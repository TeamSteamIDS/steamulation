												When I was a child I would play this game. Now I bought it a second time because I want to be a child again...  This is a game where you make an Empire that lasts through the Ages...  Also when a friend of mine was telling me about this game when I was in third grade, he thought that it was called Agent Vampires.  A game that has nothing to do with agents or vampires.  Anyway, good game if you have friends who also want to be kids again.			"

												Just nominated this for the test of time award.Honestly who hasn't heard of age of empires? A lot of grew up with it and other titles like warcraft and command and conquer but look at it. Age of empires II is still played to this very day by a lot of people, and for a good reason!Since this game came out ages ago it has had tons of bugs fixed, a lot of balancing work went into it and new civs were added that fit into the game nicely and enrich the overall experience while still staying true to the core.It does't need super fancy visuals, it doesn't need you to have korean progamer levels of apm to enjoy it.It comes from a time when games were just about having fun, and it still is!Do yourself a favor and give it a try.

												I thought I was over my AOE addiction back when MSN zone shut down.  I managed to go outside and make some friends. I even got a girlfriend and a job. Life was good until a colleguage told me to check out the black friday steam sale.  I noticed AOE HD listed with 70% off and immediately started having flash backs of the game from back in 2000.I have to say the game hasn't changed from what I remember and once I got the hang of the keys I was playing like a pro again.  In the first few months there were crashing issues in the lobbies but these have been fixed recently. I now love playing it just as much as I used to and spend most nights in deathmatch games.The population limit increase it the only feature i've noticed to really improves the game from the original...apart from that its the same, so probably overpriced for a 15 year old game. Reasonable if you pick it up in a steam sale.Unfortunately my girlfriend got sick of the sound of camels moaning while she tries to watch towie so our relationship took a bad turn...my boss has also noticed my work productivity has decreased because I spend too much time sitting in deathmatch lobbies when i'm supposed to be working...he said if things don't improve I will be fired.I think I could enjoy this game more if I was single and unemployed but at the moment it's causing too many problems :( "

												Oh boy, where do I begin? I've been playing this game since it was released as a demo for maximum pc back in 1998. My father showed me it at a computer store that he used to work at in the small community that we used to live in. I was only 4 years old at that time, and I remember the only civilizations you could be were the Brits and Celts. I first laid eyes on the scout calvary, would ignore the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everything else, because he looked cool in my eyes at 4 years of age. Since then, Ive been playing this game on and off, I'm 21 now, and I still find myself latched on to it. I now have a daughter of my own, although she won't know what it was like to see the game evolve over the course of 16 years, she will still know how it came to be, assuming she would even find it as cool as I have growing up. I think for me at least it was the growing anticipation of seeing something new with every civ, while still keeping the basics of the game simple and the same in it's own ways. I used to play this during lunch break in middle school from 2006-2009 with all of my friends, for the most part, I came out on top, even had our own little community of players, formed our own club, and we made a board game out of it. It was pretty cool that not all of us were premature nerds that played this, at least half of our little community were jocks that just loved it as much as we did, and there was no discrimination involved in any of it.  We amassed to a total of 20 or more people in this community, and for a small amount of us, our community is still strong with new members and old. This game is called Age of Empires II, and it will stand the test of time for the ages. I'm happy and delighted that people are still playing this game 16 years later, and we're still finding newcomers for this game at as faster rate than before. I've come to realize that just since early 2014 I have ended up spending hundreds of hours playing this game, teaching people both young and old what to do in this game. I'm so thrilled to see that this game is coming out with new expansions still to this day, even after 16 years. I think that if I were to find the gold edition realeased back in 2004 without the package being opened or torn, I would keep it as a collector's item, this game has so much potential and I'm happy to see that it's not being thrown away in to the trash. I honestly believe that when I die of old age, assuming that I don't die any other way, I will more than likely have a copy in my coffin for when my body gets discovered generations later, people will know what kind of influence this game had on my life as much as anyone else's life. I honestly didn't even play the Conqueror's expansion pack until 2007, even though I knew about it unpon release date, my mother refused me video games, so I never got to play it on time like most of my friends did, but I knew that I would at some point in time. Due to my parents seperation back in 2001 shortly after my mother's mother died, I ended up living with my mother, as she got the majority of custody except on holidays when I would be with my father. Whenever I was with him, he would let me play games, even though it was against my mother's wishes. I really loved playing as the Celts, Britons, Franks, Goths, and Vikings, at the time, they were my favorite. Now and again however, you will find me riding along Genghis Khan's horde as the Mongols, however, you can also find me still enjoying the company of the Goths and Britions. I love all of the civilizations very much, I know that they all have their strengths and weaknesses, some are greater than others. My best advice to you is to rush your enemies into the dirt while still keeping up with your economy via micro manage. I would rate this game a solid 10/10 and would also highly recommend it to anyone who still finds the old RTS game to be complexed and fun. I can't wait for the new expansion to come out November 5th 2015 African Kingdoms will have without a doubt in my mind as many new features as it pre successors. I hope you all have a try at this game, it's for sure my favorite game of all time.			"

												This game has long been a childhood favorite. It was the first game I ever bought and owned for the PC. I played a lot of this game, mainly singleplayer back in 2006, but scratched the CD a couple years later. When I found it had been remastered on Steam I was quick to purchase myself a copy and have been playing both singleplayer and multiplayer since. For those of you who used to own a copy like myself, I highly advise purchasing this digital edition, as it offers both the same nostalgic gameplay and a great strategic outlet. The Forgotten DLC also gives you more to explore and adds even greater variety to an already extensive game. I highly recommend this title, as it has quickly (re)become a personal favorite.For those of you who haven't played Age of Empires before, it was one of the older RTS games dating back to the late 90s / early 21st century. I'm surprised more people don't play it. You are given a wide selection of civilizations with specific perks each, and try to race each other towards an objective, be it a Wonder Race, Deathmatch, or King of the Hill. All of which are great fun! What really stands out with this game is that there are hundreds, if not thousands of ways to win. Granted, the mechanics may seem simple and outdated, but when trying to runn an entire empire with 200+ units against up to seven other players, every click counts as you try to out-maneuver, out-think, and out-micro your opponent. The graphics may take a while to get used to, but what you really should look forward to enjoying is the satisfaction of wrecking the strong defenses of an enemy with allies or alone, and conquering lands one by one. A great title, I also highly advise purchasing this for the newer community.			"

												One of the RTS classics alongside C&C & Starcraft, Age of Empires 2 is brought remastered on steam. Now supporting all HD resolutions, reworked terrain, water & building textures/sprites, it definetly looks better than it did a decade ago. Gameplay is left mostly untouched, with the only notable change being a pop cap increase to 500. Multiplayer is handled through steam, meaning (generally) more stable MP, but with the caveat that LAN got removed from this version.The constant support and existing features makes this a version to get even if you still have your old copy laying around.

Will a remake from Age Of Empires II: Age of Kings fit into the expecation from the gamers? Lets find it out!Hint: At the end of this review you will find a TL;DR section.----------------------------------------------------------------●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ REVIEW]▬▬▬▬●October 1999; one of the most durable games all the time was born made from the hand of Ensemble Studios; its name: Age of Empires II. Even Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun, which turned up at the same time, wasn't in a position neither to beat down the rapidly growing fanbase nor to outclass Age of Empires II itself.Yet so many years later no games from this genre was able to reach the quality of Age of Empires II and we all ask ourselfs; is there something which can make such an old game better and give it modern conveniences to the newer operating systems? I'll give you the answer; a second coat. HD and the option to play with higher screenresolution. With this Age of Empires II: Age of Kings looks better as never before, however the gameplay and everything else you may know from the old version has remained. Sadly this includes also unaltered animations from the unites, which causes the feeling that the whole game seems to be a bit laggy, especially when you have a lot of unites on the field. Don't stop to read now! This and the price (18,99EUR/$ 19.99) could may be a reason to close this window within the second you saw the last sentence, but don't you dare! It's worth the time.Remember when there was a population limit of 200? Microsoft had the wonderful idea to increase it and allow us to create not less than 500 unites. A real ease for most of the gamers, even if there was a mod which did the same to the old one.Apropos ease: The multiplayer from the old version is yet after this many years still active but a pain in the neck to get it work properly, if I may say so. To avoid this, you are now able to play through the steam p2p multiplayer which microsoft implemented. As if this wasn't enough they also added a ranking system which permit you to duel yourself with other gamers and be the best! Also steam called a workshop for this game into existence, so feel free to scroll through all the fanmade maps, graphics and so on!Incidentally this version contains the add-on ""The Conquerors"" and if you still want more you also be cordially invited to buy ""The Forgotten"" Once a fanmade product, now remastered and available at the same menu from AOE II after purchase.As to the rest you can expect playfully exactly what it was back then: Almost a perfect real time strategy game.●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ RÉSUMÉ]▬▬▬▬●Not every remake is good enough to fit into the quality of these old games... but in my opinion microsoft studios made nearly everything perfect. Till now I have no regrets about the purchase of this game plus its DLCs and I guess it will still mesmerize me when I am old and bony and begin to fall apart!●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ UPDATES]▬▬▬▬●Unbelievable but true: Microsoft Studios decided to give this gem a new addon. Age Of Empires The African Kingdoms will add a few more civilizations and new maps to the game! Go check it out in the store!●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ TL;DR]▬▬▬▬●[✔]  Updated graphics[✔]  Running Multiplayer incl. ranking system, no third party programs needed[✔]  Workshop Support[✔]  New updates and content[✖] Unaltered animations, which don't feel smooth with a lot of unites on the map----------------------------------------------------------------If you liked this review and want to see more from me, give this review a thumbs up! I also appreciate every feedback!

												Age of Empires II, known in the professional world as Human Resource Management Simulator 99’, is the premier HR Management Simulator. After 16 years, it still stands in a league of its own. Simple to use, this software is utilized by the likes of Fortune 500 companies and top tier business schools for training and retaining skills. Furthermore, it doubles as an entertaining and interactive platform for learning about the Middle Ages.HRM Simulator 99’ takes place in a historical period running from the fall of the Western Roman Empire to the dawn of the Colonial Age. You will be placed in the role of a medieval leader seeking to build your kingdom and defeat your opponents. In order to win, however, you will need to micromanage your human resources with the utmost efficiency and effectiveness. Central to your efforts is the villager. Villagers are the ideal worker. They can work for indefinite periods of time while earning nothing and aptly work several different jobs throughout your kingdom. They can handle everything from construction to fishing to sapping enemy buildings. Your villagers are also loyal to you beyond question; they will even gather berries while wolves are mauling them to death.Once you have established a perfectly efficient economy using the principles of operations management, you will have to shift your attention to raising an army and defeating your enemies. As a human resources manager at Proctor & Gamble put it, “HRM Simulator 99’s army management is good preparation for some of the most daunting tasks that a new manager may face in the real world”. While managing your army in battle, you will also still need to pay attention to your economy, keeping your villagers on task and away from becoming useless, idle drones. Campaigns (Spoilers?):Play as Mel Gibson and beat up the army of a dude named Edward Longshanks who, despite his last name, cannot shank anything for long.Play as a teenage chick, summon Shelby Cobras for horny Frenchmen so that they can shoot up snotty Britons.Play as a legendary ISIS commander and defeat NATO forces in Israel.Play as Genghis Khan, travel the world and break down the Great Wall of China with an extraordinarily fast & furious monkey.Play as der Fuhrer, subdue domestic opposition, invade Poland and convince Italy to side with you. Then drown in a river and get buried in a pickle barrel.Play as Attila the Hun, beat up everyone and steal their everything.Play as Good Guy Greg, save your king’s life even after he screws you over and imprisons your family.Play as Cuauhtémoc, repulse the Spanish invasion of Tenochtitlan with the help of God-given Hun Tarkans and Korean Turtle Ships. Witness the evolution of Cuauhtémoc from a loyal, concerned jaguar warrior into a tenacious resistance leader and then finally into the last Emperor of the Aztecs. Then play Age of Empires III and see him finally become a psychotic blood fetishist fighting wars in oddball locales all across Asia and the Americas.If you successfully complete these campaigns with flying colors and prevail over your colleagues in online skirmishes, you will be ripe to become the CEO of one of the largest corporations in the world!500/500 Preferred by all large-cap corporations listed on the S&P 500. In other words, buy this game if you want to invest in the American economy!			"

""WOOLOOLOOO""One of the strongest names in gaming industry, this series has been over here for almost TWO FREAKING DECADES. In 5 months it'll be 20 years and people still want part 4 which most probably never come. Since the last part it's been over 10 years. Do you guys even remember that book which was released by Microsoft Studios which showed up AoE 4 and 5? I guess we all believe there was suppose to be 4/5. Wasn't it actually Bill Gates who said he'll look into that (answer for question what's up with AoE 4?)1999 was the year of original Age of Empires 2: The Age of Kings and year later expansion The Conquerors. Don't tell me it didn't affected your childhood, growing or just lifetime in general as a gamer? That game was (is) incredible. 13 years later instead of Age of Empires IV we've recieved HD remaster. It's easier to remaster something that was already done than create something new right? Times of remasters. Now, this remaster wasn't bad at all. There are several pros. Most importantly, fan base. Secondly actual game at Steam Store (no idea if there was SD edition, if so write in comment please). Another pros contains working and great multiplayer, actual HD and the fact that you can just relive it all once again. I don't even know if there's something to say about this game. It has its campaign, that contains another campaign that  contains another campaign and same with The Conquerors + respective DLC content. So if you don't feel to play Skirmish yet or Scenarios or just free build then do campaign. But Skirmish at least for me is main element why I've played this game. And of course you start with nothing, nowhere, uneducated paesant and end up kinging your own Empire that will crush your enemies like nothing.There is just f*ckton of nations (+ DLC nations) so you have really big selection and yes every have its own bonuses. Architecture looks really great, buildings, units and everything just like good old times. Wonders are spectacular. Architecture of new DLCs is also really beautiful. (No, I'm not hard on DLC content whatsoever). Game also have various game modes such as King of the Hill, Wonder Defense, Wonder Destroying, Relic Captures, DM and lot more.It's really hard to tell how long Age of Empires II lasts for you. It just all depends what you prefer and how long it can keep you entertained. Some can get bored in few hours, somebody is still going to enjoy it even after 500 hours. I'm on over 150 at the moment, and I must say I'm really exhausted. So do your math.Price point is kinda friendly especially during sale so don't think about it twice if you like RTS games. Multiplayer can get very interesting sometimes, sometimes laggy as hell sometimes smooth as I don't know, skin of some smooth human being. However it also depends on what you like. Me personally I don't like big farming and just rushing everything, so I enjoy more playing MP with all friends in lobby so there's no serious rush. But if you like opposite then hop into that MP or SP with hard CPU and it will be your heaven. There used to be a lot of bugs and glitches back in 2013 even with both SP and MP but everything is calm now and you can enjoy it to the max.Last thing before end I want to adress are achievements. For me personally definition of Achievement is not to keep me in game longer than I should already be. If you want to keep me in game way way way way waaaay longer when I was already suppose to be done, that's not Achievement for me. Achievement should expose every element of the game possible. Achievement should cover every existing aspect of the game or action you can done without holding you inside game for too long. So if anybody thought it would be wise to put achievements like these in Age of Empires II HD was clearly nuts. Yes it covers everything, but it fairly exceeded anything sane. Bonus Point: Nostalgia of 1999Rating: 8.5/10 "

												Played this to death as a kid and it is exactly how I remember it.AoE2 is the quintessential medieval base builder that has you conquering your opponents through four ""Ages"", with progressively stronger and better units. Best part was they released an expansion after more than a decade because this game has such a cult following.The game has you gather resources, build structures, amass units and go trapsing over maps of all kinds. These range from tiny islands to pretty decent sized representations of European climates that have you seek out and destroy your enemies or win by several other not-so-total conquest game types. The new expansion allows those maps to be massive and adds even more civilizations to play with, making the total 23. These civilizations span from all corners of Europe, Asia and the Middle East. All units have voice clips in their native languages to help with the feel of every faction being truly different in addition to visually unique buildings and units depending on the cultural locale of your civilization.With its migration to Steam AoE now has great multiplayer support, achievements, and Steam Workshop capabilities that will allow the sharing of user-created content to be spread much easier than having to download things like scenario  maps from a third-party webpage over dial-up as I did back in the day.If you played this game in the past, it is well worth picking up again if nothing more than for nostalgia goggle syndrome because you know just how fun this was. If you somehow missed the boat in the past and are a fan of games like this there is literally no reason you should not own this game. It has been improved and will more than likely be considered one of the fine wines of gaming; Better with age and enjoyed even more with friends.			"

												Age of Empires II HD is a classic strategy game and a must-have for both old and new fans of the RTS genre. Although, the original game was realised in 1999 it managed to stand the test of time due to its unique art style. The gameplay is simple to learn but hard to master. As you begin in the Dark Ages and try to advance your civilisation to the Imperial Age. A good building order is important for maintaining an optimal economy to support your war machine. It does not feature unique abilities that units can utilise and therefore it does not require the extensive micro-management as seen in games such as Starcraft II and Warcraft III. Actually, the introduction movie of the game says it all as two kings play a game of chess, the pieces representing units in the game. This is how Age of Empires feels, a real time chess game where every move matters and momentum is key. As an added bonus the soundtrack of the game is amazing, although I do miss the original menu music. However, thanks to the support of the Steam Workshop, there is a mod to fix that (and many other things). Overall, the HD version is what it says: an update of the already impeccable original game with better textures and HD resolution support.			"

												If you know what Age of Empires 2 is: get it. The HD version is a delight and they also added multiplayer support and decently-priced DLC. The remake is among the best i’ve played.If you don’t know what AoE2 is, you are in for a sweet treat, a blast from the past, a game of… much fame? Alright I’ll stop.AoE2 is a RTS in which you play one of many olden civilizations, starting in the Dark Ages, and progress all the way to the Imperial Age, all while expanding, building an army, creating defences, researching military/industrial/agricultural improvements, leading your forces to battle, creating trade routes, protecting wonders, finding relics, gathering all seven Dragon Balls et cetera et cetera.The “to do” list might intimidate new players, but AoE2 plays as smooth as butter, with easy controls and button layouts. After a few sessions and looking up a guide, you too will have a strong starting economy and empire in 15 minutes during skirmishes (campaign can be a different beast altogether).The economy is based on 5 resources: food, wood, stone, gold and population (from houses). There are multiple ways to get each resource, albeit stone and wood trading is a bit difficult with the AI since this isn’t really a game about diplomacy. Gold however can be taken from “trading” easily among two of your marketplace buildings: the further they are, the more you get.Be prepared to spew out villagers left and right and grab any rock and log you can get, since you will need them to build an army. Besides the regular soldiers, each civ has it’s own perks and a castle with a unique soldier. Some have restrictions to certain troops or upgrades, making sure each one feels and plays slightly different.All of these can be inspected neatly in the Tech Tree, available both in and out of game. You will also find an encyclopaedia about medieval battles, units, buildings, kingdoms; all sorts of neat things that old farts like myself wish were still around in modern games. It’s also worth mentioning that AoE2 HD, without any DLC, has 9 historical campaigns that are both entertaining, educational and, at times, hard as nails.If you like “easy to learn difficult to master” RTS games, absolutely get it.

												Age of Empires II HD is a real-time strategy from Microsoft Studios. It is a perfected version of Age of Empire II: The Age of King and Age of Empire II: The Conquerors expansion pack reimagined in HD and now entirely as one single game. Everybody know what Age of Empire is unless you're really new to PC gaming, the game is a legend, was the best classic real-time strategy of that time.All gameplay and features in this game is left untouched and are very exactly the same as the old Age of Empire II except for the new 500 population limit for skirmish play, let's you train even more units and having a larger battles and larger tactics than before.The graphics has been improved slightly where you can see the new water and fire textures and effects are better than before. The new widescreen support for the game are also included. The rest still retain the same graphics as before.Well, the exact same gameplay and features could be the good or bad thing, because most people don't like buying things similar with what they already have, own or taste, but if you're looking for the old Age of Empires II in a new and better way then it is for you. All the story campaign, civilization is all there and the new Steam workshop integration is the best thing so you now can download many user created content ranging from maps, scenarios, AI scripts and many more to customize your game or create your own stuff and share it with everyone in the Steam community. I say this is a good remake, I  recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

												Age of Empires 2 is in my opinion the best game ever made. It's a timeless classic that is still just as enjoyable today as the day it came out. In my opinion it is the best RTS game of all time and for that to still be true 10 years later, it is certianly worth full price.However, this is the HD version so it is slightly different. Graphics are practically the same - which is ok for such a timeless game. However it doesn't quite live up to it's HD title. However, I came back for the game - not for anything new.This HD version HDifys the gameplay rather than the graphics. It adds a new map size and increases the highest pop cap to 500 - allowing for much better games if your PC can handle it. The new map size hurts the PC more than the pop cap though and I've played 500 pop games on a laptop on the old standard map size. I don't recommend doing that with more than one player though. Nonetheless, huge armies are very fun to play with and add that little thing that we probably would've modded in. However - if this is what sold you then make sure you have a decent PC for it because it gets unbearably laggy on certian systems.Another update is the new AI which they patched in at some point. As a man who prefers to do single player, this new AI added a proper challenge to the old game when I played all the time during my childhood. I used to be able to take on  6 other AIs on the hardest difficulty all on the same team. Now I struggle against them on equal footing. However, you do have the option of playing against the original AI if you want. Even a mix if you really want. The only problem I've found with it is that it will focus on water whenever there's a significant amount of water on the map. This can be good at times but when they attempt a galley rush on highland and you walk right around them it's limitations can be quite apparent.One big flaw is it's multiplayer. They've removed the LAN function for some reason. Despite this I still play this at LAN parties but we play through the online mode. A little bit annoying. Another thing is the lag. There's a noticable lag between when you click somthing and when it notices. This did cause problems but they are working on patching these problems out. The lag still exists but I'm no longer having the problem of me putting many houses in a line and it registering the house I accidently placed rather than the ones I wanted. However, I have played an entire game which was full of unbearable lag. However, it has multiplayer (the original's doesn't work anymore) and it actually lets you try the new civillisations from the expansion packs in it.Overall, this is still the Age of Empires 2 that I loved all my life. It didn't need updating but they gave it a go and basically refreshed the experience a bit by letting me play on larger maps and with larger populations. Still the same game and therefor worth full price in my opinion. I'd personally say that the fact that the game is still being updated and you've got expansion packs if you want more, it's somthing you should get. Even if you've never played it you should try this game as it is the best game of all time in my opinion.			"

												Before you read this please note that I have been playing this game since I can remember and have only had it on Steam for a short while and don't have much to play now days. This game is awesome! It is the perfect type of strategy game! There are dozens of different types of nationalities to choose from which all have their strengths and weaknesses. I have spent hours of countless fun playing this game. You can play the campaigns and when you have finished them you can play with a friend over LAN or online with random strangers! It randomly generates the maps so you don't have to worry about playing the same old map over and over. All in all I think this game is well worth the money! I give this game a 9/10!! Just cause I don't think any game can be a 10/10 but if a game can be 10/10 then this is the game!			"

												I remember playing this as a kid, before I got into games like Counter-Strike. Steam wasn't popular so this is what I would play.The original game used to run on some low resolution, and was so obvious. The age of the title had something to do with it ;)But as it was, it didn't really matter to me. I would love being able to sit down and do what I wanted to do. I didn't have to kill everyone off, I could get the ""artifacts"" or build a wonder to win. Even the Regiside (kill the enemy king(s)) gamemode is a good gamemode.Multiplayer isn't as good but it's nice to be able to play with friends again. With all RTS titles, it's whoever can rush the enemy the fastest. That's what bugs me about the multiplayer. If you can get over that, there's no major outstanding issues. ELO ranking has been added, but don't base your skill off of it.Even though it may look like it supports old machines, there was a requirement for some new shader/texture thanks to the water. Not sure if it really is the water, but you need a dedicated card of some sort. Old Intel GMA graphics don't support it. So any reasonable card such as a GT 8600 or GT 9800 would make a great choice here.7/10			"

Age of Empires II HDPros:+ Finally MULTIPLAYER!+ Old memories from the past comes back!+ TBH the best game for LANs+ Nice campaigns+ Easy to understand + Unique technologies for each race+ Thanks to the DLCs, forgotten races are inclueded to the game+ Customizing your own maps!+ Many game mods! (King of the Hill, Wonder Race etc.)+ COOL: Races speak actually their language+ ELOsystem in Multiplayer+ Nice and kind Community+ Each race have their Unique Elite Units. (Example: Japanese with their Samurai; or Britons with their Longbowman)Cons:- Have to buy DLCs for the forgotten races- You'll need much practice to rock!Conclusion:Maybe the first game that I've been played in my childhood. Buying it again in HD version is definitely not a regret. Thanks to the DLCs we are also allowed playing African races in Age of Empires II HD. Although the DLCs are bit too expensive, it's still worthy buying them, because of the nice campaigns you can play with the new races (Learning a bit more history isn't bad eh? :p). I'm not the most skillfull player in that game, but playing in Multiplayer is awesome! It is a great feeling if u destroy your online opponent with your favorite race (my all favorites are Teutons because i'm from germany). I recommend this game for every strategic lover! Also this game is one of the best for LAN nights.			"

												The Little Mod That Could.A Franchise Refurbished, Yet a Missed Opportunity.The age of empires series is one of fame. After 13 years it can still be purchased (along with its expansion, The Conquerors) at Wal-Mart and Office Depot. This ""new"" title is an attempt at sprucing up one of the most beloved games of the franchise. It is amazingly rare to see an old property being brought back to life and updated, especially by a parent company that is only looking forward to the next big buck, and are willing to drop any title not making 500% profit (AOE Online was scrapped after a year in the wild, and much needed updates to many games still hang in limbo at EA). Only the bigwigs know what made them bring this one back, but we are glad to see some dust wiped off of our past every once in a while. Developer ""Hidden Path"" was contracted to shine up the series fav and bring it into the new age of gaming, they fixed important things and they didn't fiddle around where it wasn't needed, but they missed a couple of points that would have made it into a new age RTS diamond.First of all, I must thank hidden path for finally raising the unit cap, but why only 500? While it is a good 2.5x higher than before, our machines are 250x more powerful than the Pentium II 200mhz it was originally designed for. I can only guess that much of the core engine remains as it was, and 500 was the highest they could go without breaking it. Even though the cap has been raised, you can still only select 20 units at a time. Was it something that was overlooked? not likely. Here is another notch in the theory of a stretched engine. They just couldn't do more without overhauling the back end.While we are on the graphics, The reason it has HD in the title is the ability to hit 1920x1080, (and beyond for multi monitor rigs) whereas the original topped out at 1024x768. I agree with the general consensus in that the overhauled building and unit models are amazing, but once again the elderly engine comes through showing us no shadows, no zoom, and no visual effect updates. These are an almost standard feature of today's even bargain bin games that they missed completely. Does it detract from gameplay? Not really. Could they have spent a little more time bringing the graphics engine into this decade without effecting gameplay? yes.The multiplayer. What can I say here? Game Zone worked (kinda) back in the day, but thankfully we have learned from those early days and have integrated the game wholly into Steam's online network with only a few launch bugs and some early lag issues (to be continued). What this means is a front row ticket to a beautifully seamless multiplayer before-game matching experience, but completely removes the LAN option that, like me, so many young geeks had permanently set up in their basements just for this. Inclusion with the Workshop will make mod and map finding a breeze, and I believe the good outweighs the bad here, but somehow there is still a bad taste somewhere in my mind from losing our offline multiplayer. (single play is still allowed offline).The music score has been redone, but I can still pound the number keys for WOLOLOOO and ""I Need Wood"". No complaints there.All-in-all it was well worth the money, and it is the authentic Age Of Kings/Conquerors experience, but the lack of improvements to the gameplay, and the surface improvement to the graphics makes this game feel more like a decent mod than a blockbuster.(For further fiddling- the mod ""Forgotten Empires"" does everything this HD remake does, plus adds hours of single player campaigns, and a good dozen fixes)			"

Age of Empires 2: HD Edition is not for everyone!If you are considering to buy this game which is sort of a remastered and updated version of the original game from 1999 then you need to know that this game is not for everyone especially how it works online. I didn't expect this game to run completely smooth especially in multiplayer but the fact that most games do go on until the end is what makes this great. One thing you must remember when playing multiplayer either with friends or other people is to make sure everybody has an okay Internet connection. Just one player with bad connection can ruin a game and possibly making it go out of sync. When playing a match if you host it or joining one, game speed will make a huge difference on how much time you will spend playing a game so you need to know how to budget your time if your planning to play a game.Here's a a single example on how this game was pushed to its limits on multiplayer and the game didn't crash or disconnect (desync) even to me. Jump to 04:18 part on this video to see the main action unfold. The gameplay here is dated on the current version dated December 18th, 2016.

			Jump to 4:18 part on this video to see the main action unfold! This match played on December 18th, 2016 showed a pure example on this game being pushed to its limit.		

Finally, I wanted to show anybody who is considering to buy this game should see this video. Basically it was me on a 2 vs. 4 HARDEST AI in this game. The battle went on for about 4 hours and 3 minutes, the games timer said about 6 hours because the game speed was set differently. In short, the AI was tough but me and another player emerged victorious. This battle also was dated on the game version dated December 18th to December 19th, 2016. Make sure to jump ahead to 3:59:00 to watch the beginning of this long match.

			Skip to 3:59:00 part on this video if you want to watch the battle as you saw on the video title. The main focus I like to put on this video is that it features a 2 vs.		

I'm not an expert on strategy games so I won't go into great lengths about this game but what I can tell you is that it is fairly easy to grasp and a bit difficult to master just like Rocket League. Only way to get better is to play over and over and refining your techniques in order to build your mighty army. This game has support of the Steam workshop so you can modify this game to make it look however you like and that's a good thing for people that are used to seeing good visuals on modern games.I can't say much on the sound since the original soundtrack, banter and death sounds are still present here however you can get variety by getting new material on the Steam Workshop if you wish to.Overall, if you are sort of interested in strategy game or you love this type of gameplay then feel free to get this game. I recommend to wait until it's on sale though.7.5/10 "

												First of all, thanks to my friend Augo, who gifted me this game.-------------------------------------------------------------------This game is, truly, a masterpiece. If you liked Starcraft, you will love this game. What's the objective of this game? Winning. How? Well, make an empire. Defeat other players. Be the best one.GRAPHICS:Well, what can you expect from a 99s game? Nothing but trash (compared to new AAA games), right? Well, this remake has made the graphics lovely. They changed a little bit and now, you can play the game at 1080p.GAMEPLAY:This is the very best thing of the game. The gameplay is exciting, fast, and makes you want to keep on playing. I just have 5 hours, but Augo gifted me this game 1 day ago (31/10/16).STORY:This game has a few campaigns to complete. Since I started playing on normal singleplayer, the tutorial itself it's a campaign about how the Scottish rebeled against  Edward Longshanks.SOUND:This game has a very beautiful soundtrack, but it's quiet repetitive after hearing it everytime.OTHERS:This is a very good example of remake. The bad thing is that the new AI is very strong. They can make a great empire in a matter of minutes.Very replayable game. It has trading cards, Steam Workshop, map editor and even multiplayer.This is, definitely, a classic. Why are you reading this? GO BUY IT! :D---------------------------------------------------------------If you REALLY readed all of my review, thanks so much. This is my first serious review, as I mostly do joke reviews with memes and jokes.Thank you for reading!! Hope this was helpful.			"

												Age of Empires II: Age of Kings was originally released in 1999, and it is one of the most influential titles in one of real-time strategy’s most celebrated franchises. It holds a special place within gaming history as a solid, meat-and-potatoes RTS generously drizzled with rich historical gravy.Age of Empires II: HD’s main changes are updates to the graphics engine, allowing the game to be compatible with modern machines. The game has been overhauled to allow players to take advantage of HD displays and multiple monitors. But one of the strongest elements of the re-release is the score, which has been lovingly remixed. The music now evokes a more sophisticated mood than it did previously, and it’s something that adds greatly to the feel of the game.This edition of Age of Empires II includes The Conquerors expansion, so fans wanting to replay the campaigns will find hours of familiar scenarios. These haven’t aged particularly well; the scripting system compares poorly with other titles, particularly Blizzard’s Warcraft III and StarCraft II. There are many instances of breaking the fourth wall, where victory and activation conditions are very obviously scripted rather than fitting seamlessly into gameplay.The new textures added to water, fire, and earth add a nice new look to the terrain. It’s subtle, but the overall impression is refined and almost painterly. The terrain itself has been one of the biggest changes, with a mesh system now used to give a more even natural landscape. Also gone are the 256 colour UI elements, and the icons have been updated to a more rustic feel to go with the softer 32-bit colour scheme.The only significant change made at all to gameplay is the raising of the maximum population cap to 500. This is a lost opportunity to fix the kinds of problems that even diehard fans consider simple annoyances. The ability to select more than 20 units would have been a worthy addition, and is simply a control flaw rather than a balance or creative issue. Running at 1920x1080 allows for a huge number of units on one screen, which still need to be divided into small divisions to command in battle.The most positive change – and one that will justify the price tag for most players – is multiplayer. Although alternative matchmaking services have done much to keep interest in the online game alive over the years since the demise of Microsoft’s clunky Gaming Zone, Steam integration puts players back onto a universal ladder system. The platform’s social features and existing framework also mean players can come to the game with their own networks firmly in place.So for better or worse, Steam has come along and is now selling a game it’s quite possible many gamers already own in some form or other. The changes are subtle, but well-intentioned and admirably executed. Multiplayer is excellent. Those who loved Age of Empires II should happily indulge in some nostalgia with this HD facelift. Anyone new to the game will be frustrated by the lack of modern control systems and responsive hot keys.Recommended "

												One of, if not 'THE' best, Real time Strategy game of all time! I do have very fond feelings for Age of Empires: Gold, as well as Rise of Nations, but AoE II takes the biscuit and slam dunks it from a bungee jump! (yes that is actually a world record)All the fun of building, Battle and tactics, with 'mostly' correct history and a tonne of community created content and scenarios to boot :)I love the diversity of the units, buildings and nations, especially with the inclusion of the new DLC. Who doesn't want to lead an army of 150 samurai?! or throwing 75 petards into an enemys base from behind, erradicating everything in their path?Would always recommend to anyone, even non RTS fans. 10/10			"

												Instead of writing a review, let me tell you a story. I recently had an online 3v3 match where I had to fight the Japanese, British, and the Spanish. Early on, my friend got attacked by the Spanish which left his empire severely crippled. He sent some villagers to settle next to my empire so we could attack together. Around the beginning of the second hour, we kept getting attacked by the Japanese, so we assembled large armies to push through. Soon enough, my navy and our armies destroyed the Japanese. We both settled in the area because the Japanese left a lot of resources around. Resources were scarce around midgame, so we set up small strike forces to chip away at the British empire. Soon enough, we lead an ambush on the British, attacking their buildings and razing their farmlands. We killed their army and destroyed their most important buildings, eventually causing them to surrender. Our last enemy were the Spanish. Led by Queen Isabella, she had armies of monks and conquistadors. We kept getting our asses destroyed by her forces, almost leading us to surrender. She had controlled most of the land, which would prove to be a challenge to us. It took us about 2 hours to destroy her navy and kill her conquistadors and monks. Soon enough, she surrendered, as we just toppled the largest empire on the continent and brought it to its knees. We won the match when the clock struck 5 hours.God I love this game.			"

												So, what can I say?It's Age of Empires II, the best game of the series.It's still as addicting and fun as it has always been.New support for higher resolutions, though it doesn't really look better to me, but it does improve the overall view.Some new civilizations also made it to the game (DLC).Overall the gameplay is pretty much the same as the original, didn't notice any major improvements, but this game didn't need any to begin with.Price might seem high, but on a sale, this definitely makes for a decent purchase.

												Opening first impressionWARNING PRETTY LONG REVIEW: well this is my first ever real review and i have alot to say about this game first i want to say I deffiently have had some experince from this game as you can see i have played over 1000+ hours and am still playing this game today. Now age of empires is not a bad game but it is deffiently not for everyone. Now lets dive into this review here.Single player campaignSay you dont have internet or maybe you just dont want to play online well there is a variety of levels in the single player campaign for you to enjoy from the french all the way to the aztecs the campaign is packed with hours of fun filled levels each having there own story its also a good place to start if you are new to the game its slow paced and gives you a taste of what the game is like and how it will handleartificial intelligencealthough they did update this to make it feel more like your verusing an online player it ovbiously still lacks what online players have wich is diffrent strategys and diffrent skill levels the AI in this game isnt the best and is flawed but i guess you have to make do with what you have. atleast i can say its better practice then the old AI that wouldint even get the last blacksmith upgrades in the imperial age making them a joke and very easyy to deal with. so i say if your going to do any sort of deathmatch or random map or scenario for the matter you should stick to playing with real people.Scenario EditorThis is my personal favorite of the game are you tired of online dont feel like playing aginst the crappy AI then why not make your own adventure or your own story in the scenario editor. i have had hours of countless fun making simple levels that i enjoy by myself to complex levels that are still in development this is deffiently one of the best features on Age Of Empires 2 just buying the game for this is worth it very user friendly, easy to usr and organized. the triggers take some practice to get use to but you will soon learn fast. the best part is that you can share your levels with the public and many other players can play them.multiplayerThis is where the main core of the problem is for the game multiplayer is very unstable very laggy and the community isnt to nice but its not the worst you still will find alot of decent player but ocassionaly run into the ones that always try to out do everyone or put other down. if you have much patience then you may be able to handle the lag but some game lag can just be unbarable. Dont even get me started on the dysync if there on accedent or on purpose they really know how to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, The worst type is the player that does it intentionally because he or she is a sore loser or doesint want to lose ELO(the points that show your ranking in the game.CivalizationsThe game age of empires has a vast amount of civilizations to chose from in the game this maxumizes gameplay allowing you to tamper and play around with diffrent strategys for diffrent empires. maybe you like the ranged gunpowder of the turks or the close quarters combat of the aztecs. or maybe you like to ride the fearsome paladins of the franks into battle who knows there are many diffrent strats and builds you can try.Age Of Empires 2 OverallAge of empires is a very fun game if you can get past the  bad multiplayer lag although occasionally you come across some good lobbies that wont lag near as bad. even without multiplayer or if your preffer to play offline this game offers so much content that it takes a very long time to get bored if you chose to spend your money on the game even with its flawess i would say you would be makking a wise choice for 20 dollars i dont think you can go wrong.

												Age of Empires II HD, well HD? Not really. That doesn't change the fact that it's still a pretty good stragety game. I personally love the unique units you can train in castles, for instance when you play as the Spanish you can train a unit called the Conquistador in your castle, a unit wich only you (while playing as Spain) can create. The maps are quite big, so enough space for large battlefields. While the naval battles aren't bad either, I personally love the land battles between two different infantry units. The original 18 civilizations are still in the game, but a DLC has been added: The Forgotten (empires)This DLC ads 5 new civilizations, including the Italians and the Inca's.All civilizations have got their very own unique unit, and building style.An awesome new campaign has been added aswell. Here are a few short descriptions about the different campaign scenario's:1. Alaric I:The trauma of the Hun invasion in the 4th century has shaped Alaric, the fearsome warrior king of the Goths. But can the beloved king secure a new homeland for his people in the territory of the collapsing Roman Empire?2. Sforza:Always hungry for glory and wealth, Sforza wanders around 15th century Italy, offering his services to the highest bidder. Will he pick the right battles or make the wrong enemy? Take the fate of the young mercenary captain in your hands.3. Bari:400 years after the collapse of the Roman Empire, Italy is still up for grabs. Relive the tale of the port city Bari from the point of view of a Byzantine family, rising from the common soldiery to the nobility. Beware, for not only Bari is at stake, but also control of Southern Italy.4. Dracula:History forged an incredible legend around the man who ruled Wallachia in the mid-15th century. Holding his ground against the vast armies of the expanding Ottoman Empire, his cruel tactics made him the most feared man in all of Eastern Europe. Will his thirst for blood and the loyalty of his soldiers hold the Turks back for good?Sounds good doesn't it? Well it is. The €18,99 you pay for a game wich should be HD but the only thing HD in the game is the water, might be a bit much. But it's defenitly worth it.			"

												I remember back in 2000, 2001 ish. I was about 6,7 years old and I remember sitting on my father's lap. I remember those summers, long and humid and hot. My father would be playing Age of Empires the Conquerors. It was the first game I really got into, I remember back in early 2000s all the internet cafes in China would be filled with people playing AOE, warcraft, starcraft, and red alert. AOE was the game everyone plays. I remember one time I played against my father when he had to stay at work late and I just got to feudal age and he put a freaking castle in front of my TC. I was crying and I was so sad. Those were the days. And Now I cant tell you how excited I am to get back into it. Classics never die.			"

												Only a few weekend chores, a Packard Bell, buttery crumpets and AoEII. I never had it so good as a kid. A true trip down memory lane makes makes it worth it's full price alone and is a steal at sale price. As an '80's kid this series had become the premier RTS for me- Total Annihilation aside- and despite it's now aged look, abundance of micro managment and somewhat limited unit roster it'll keep you hooked game after game especially for returning fans. Those who are new to the older titles well it'll be an education. But one you'll ultimately enjoy.			"

												Spoiler Free Review:Come on, how can there be spoilers for game that is almost two decades old….Nostalgia is a powerful force, and this game brings it back full throttle.  Age of Empires 2 has a cult following for sure, it was a masterpiece at its time – everyone played it, I’m not going to delve into that so much as a comparison to the HD version, and if it is worth playing now.Let’s start with the HD – there is nothing HD about this.  Graphics may be polished, but it is nothing compared to AOE3 or StarCraft, or any other comparable RTS – the game still shows its age.  The AI has been improved from what I remember of the original, and several times in the single player campaigns I had to restart because I wasn’t fast enough and the AI has me in a corner.  The gameplay challenges have been welcomed and aren’t frustrating.The issues that plagued the original are still present, troop movement being one.  You have to carefully monitor your army and not send them across the map in one move.  AI movement still causes troops to get separated from the pack, or take a pretty stupid route.  The rock paper scissors mechanics are still in effect (send pikemen to horses -  swordsmen to pikemen – etc).Some other changes that the HD version brings include map size, population limit increase, and where this game is really shining – new civilizations.  The new expansions include civilizations and single player campaigns that equal the original.  They did a fantastic job of keeping the feel of the original, but adding in the different content that sets it apart.  In the mind of this reviewer, the DLCs are totally worth it.  The population increase has also been welcomed.  I tend to turtle during single player games and being able to open the gates of Mordor and flood the map is very satisfying.AOE2 at the time was the number 1 game out and became a classic.  Fan outcry brought it back full force, and I have to say it is just as enjoyable as I remember.  How much of that is nostalgia and how much is actual good game mechanics is up for debate, but I find myself pouring hours and hours back into a game, that is still around after almost 20 years.Rating: 8 out of 10.  Highly Recommended.Playing on i7-6700, 16Gb RAM, GTX1070			"

												It's classic and it must be known. Literally. Of course, dinosaurs were playing this game when they were young, but it's still brilliant. It's a grandfather of all modern RTS. Yes, it has awful graphics according to nowadays, but it still looks pretty and nice. Campaigns are elegant both in terms of diversity, both in terms of historical accuracy. The only disadvantage of the game is a lack of scale: the great Barbossa's army, which has to go in crusade by feet, because there's no fleet in Europe, that can hold it, costs only 75 points of population.

												One of my favorite memories is playing this game back in the day with my Brother and some of my cousins.This game helped me develop my ability to strategize and think quickly as a kid.I gotta say I hoped the game would have been fixed up a little more when I saw it on Steam and got ahold of a copy in a gift trade but I know they have AOEIII and things and I do love how it just takes me back to being a kid who played when it came out. I actually have my old box copy with manual and the expansion disc too.This is a great game to LAN with friends or just play solo while bored and needing to kill time.It may not be enjoyed as much by millennials or people who want all the new graphics and such but any 80's or 90's kids that grew up on it or parents and others who played will definitely have a blast from the past.

												This was one of my childhood games and it has aged really well. The gameplay is really addictive and it is so satisfing to watch your civilization grow and dominate everyone else. Playing with other people is a lot of fun and the game compares your skill level to everyone else's so you always know whether or not it will be a far match. That's not to say the game is perfect. As satisfying as the game is when your winning, it's really depressing when your losing; all that hard working building your civilization gone to waste. The learning curve is also really steep, especially if you're unfamiliar with this genre, and getting to the level of skill that most people have online is a bit of a chore. If you can go toe to toe with a 'hardest' level COM your probably ready to play with most of the average tier players. I'd also recommend a youtube channel called 'spirit of the law' if you want any advise on how to play the different civilizations. But it's a lot of fun to learn. I'd recommend it, even if you're not into strategy games. Come on in and play. More people need to.10/10			"

												Having been one of my first PC games, no less than 15 years ago, Age of Empires II helped me refine my gaming tastes, giving me a penchant for strategy games (and for history, it's always been my favourite non-scientific subject at school).It was a time when there were no cutting-edge hardware, nor eye-candy graphics, games were just meant to be fun.Even now, after 17 years from its initial release, Age of Empires II is still one of the most beloved RTS games of all times, and keeps getting useful DLCs which make it even better.Too bad I can't add to Steam the hours I spent on the original, they would easily surpass one thousand, maybe even two...

												Update 4: Props to the devs that are at least somewhat active in fixing this game.Update 3: So age of empires World Domination was just announced. I almost feel like this is because of people attacking anything negative despite reviews showing objective problems. Most of the reviews on the front page of steam that are marked ""helpful"" are hardly ""helpful"" to people who played the original given the actual problems that haven't been listed and are completely useless to people who never played the game. When you have people who will attack anything negative someone says (I have yet to see a good argument against me saying this game isn't worth 20 dollars) then crap like this (AoE:WD) happens. MS now thinks that we are blind, thrashing, monsters that will buy anything with the Age logo on it who will blot out anyone who goes against it with just flaming (not constructive critcism, flaming). Now you may be the biggest age fanboy ever and you may try AoE:WD but you probably won't put money into it. Microsoft is clearly making (what looks like) a clash of clans ripoff to milk fans that will fail (at least in milking fans) and end up being a big waste of time to any fan of age of empires 2. I am not saying that ""fanboys did this"" I am just not rulling out the possibility.Update 2: Over a year, multiplayer is dead. Fanboys too busy humping this game to care. I can't believe some of the idoitic responses I have gotten from this. If you like and bought the game, why are you arguing with me? Why do you care? This game has flaws that make some aspects of the game OBJECTIVELY WORSE than the original. IE no lan, framerate issues, etc. I have reported on these flaws yet I am bashed for it. I have played hundreds of hours combined and yet you guys think you are at a better position to judge me when you can't even admit the objective faults of this game. MS now knows that they can charge whatever they want for each ""HD"" edition they release and at whatever state they put it in and they know people will eat it up. Even if it's broken, the criticism will be drowned out by fanboys ""downvoting"" (which is not how the system works, it goes by if the review was helpful, morons) every critical piece that comes out. You can still get the single player game with the mod for 10 dollars off amazon, with lan and fewer bugs. That is still a better value then what is here.UPDATE: IT HAS ALMOST BEEN A FULL YEAR AND THERE ARE STILL D-SYNC ISSUES AND NO SERVERS (so people are still DCing and it's still laggy as ♥♥♥♥) FIX YOUR DAMN 20 DOLLAR PIECE OF GARBAGE.-Actual ReviewI'm sorry, what is with all these reviews with their positive ratings? You guys are okay with paying 20USD for a widescreen edition and paid dlc for a game that is more than a decade old AND that has had numerious bugs even 7 months later still have not been fixed? Like the online lag is still awful. ""But it's better than it was on launch"" yes but it's still awful and at this rate I would advise just finding a copy of the original game and playing it with mods (like the Forgotten Empires, more on that soon) that run it on a modern system for the single player.As for the DLC, I have not played it, but I have heard how it had lots of bug on launch and the patch to add it in fudged up the base game as well. Buyer beware the campaign doesn't even have voice acting although on their livestream they said they [maybe?] will look for voluneteers. It's nice that they are getting paid for it but instead of releasing it for 10 (which is really unreasonable might I add) why not make it free and give some of the money you (MS) made - from the upsurdly priced 20USD - and give it to the devs of forgotten empires. Also, there are no benefits that come from the FE update, therefore, IF YOU BUY THE GAME BUT DON'T BUY FE, YOU NEED TO PLAY WITH OTHERS WHO DON'T HAVE FE OR WHO CHOSE TO NOT USE FE. THIS MEANS THAT THE COMMUNITY IS SPLIT UP EVEN MORE, GREAT, THAT MEANS ONLINE IS EVEN MORE BUTCHERED.Graphics and Performanceit's not an HD edition, it's a widescreen edition with 2 graphics options (which weren't even on launch btw) as well as no screen resolution. ""But it's an old game, why do you need graphics options?"" well that's because the game can run like crap online or offline on certain lower end machines. I run a gigabyte 7950 GPU with an intel 3770k I7 3.5 processor and the game runs like crap online, I HAVE PLAYED WITH 8 PEOPLE AND I GOT AN AVERAGE OF 15-25 FPS, THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT CAN RUN CRYSIS 3 AT ALMOST MAX AT 1080P 60FPS, THERE IS NO EXCUSE TO CHARGE ME 20 FOR A GAME THAT RUNS WORSE THAN A TRIPLE A GAME. Side note, when do you think people are gonna start saying ""But can it run AoE II HD online? The poor optimization is shockingly bad but the game is basically unchanged. Remember those graphs you would look at after a game ended that would show certain stats? Yeah those are unchanged, they look really bad now as they haven't been updated with cleaner text or anything. I would have accepted that in early the 2000s, not 2013 on an ""HD"" edition.GameplayYeah it's good. It's age of empires 2 what do you expect and from what I can tell, that's all people seem to care about and i'm assuming that is the only reason people are giving this game good reviews. But guys, THIS IS NOT WORTH 20USD AND TO BE MARKETED AT AN HD EDITION WITH THIS CRAPPY PERFORMANCE AND BAD ONLINE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. IT HAS BEEN 7 MONTHS AND THERE ARE STILL MANY BUGS AND ONLINE IS STILL BROKEN.I will be fair right now with the gameplay, the campaigns take time to beat and they are challenging. The gameplay had a satisfacation in the way it was made that - to me, for the longest time - beat other games. Units wouldn't get stuck from time to time via collision on an object when you moved them, (Star Wars: Empire at War) units move when you tell them to without fail (company of heoes one had moments where they would just sit there) and they would respond quickly (age of empires 3, although many units behaved like that, many would move slow as balls). The core gameplay is enjoyable at least to a fan of the original but there are many outdated mechanics that I really don't have the time to go into, just think of starcraft 1 to starcraft 2 MECHANICALLY Ie unit binding, macros, replay systems, all that and how much of a leap back it feels going from starcraft 2 back to 1 after awhile of playing 2. The difference is very noticable.Conclusion:On sale at like 5 bucks, if you don't want to bother digging up the original game and putting mods (which isn't very difficult) than yeah, maybe buy it. But at 20 USD with an expansion at 10 more? No, just no. For that price you can get Starcraft 2 for a few bucks more on Amazon. Age of Empires 2 was my favorite RTS of all time until I played Starcraft 2 (warcraft 3/frozone throne came in third) but now after playing Age 2 again, I like warcraft 3/FT better. WHICH YOU CAN BUY COMPLETE FOR 20 DOLLARS, IT IS A MUCH BETTER VALUE THAN THIS RIGHT NOW AND THE MULTIPLAYER (although it has its problems after recent patches) DOESN'T HAVE LAG ON EVERY GAME YOU TRY TO PLAY.Yes, Age of Empires 2 is a good game but the HD edition is a disgrace. Don't praise this game just because it plays like the original. Don't charge 20USD for a re-release with bugs. Fix your game and make it look better and then I will reccommend it for almost anyone but at this point ONLY BUY IF IT'S ON SALE FOR 5USD OR LESS AND YOU ARE A FAN. Newcomers will get almost no value out of this instead of getting the original with mods.If this was just an intended re-release for 5 bucks or 10 with workshop and multiplayer I would be singing a different tune.

												This HD remake has been riddled by various bugs ever since the release in April 2013, but at least multiplayer worked for the most part and I spent over 500 hrs. in it trough out the years and it was a hell of a ride. Well, that has changed since the release of the latest African Kingdoms expansion on November 5th, 2015 - since then multiplayer has been rendered unplayable. What is worse, the SkyBox Labs/Forgotten Empires crew ceased any communication regarding the problem shortly after. As early reviewer, I was assured by Cysion (Belgian member of a dev team) that repairing the broken multiplayer is high on to do list back on November 13, 2015, but nothing has happened since, except for the release of half-baked & buggy expansion for Age of Mythology with the subtitle ""Tale of the Dragon"" back in January 2016.On reload, game does not seem to remember players/AI oponents involved, which can be clearly seen in the lobby, after reload, you cannot play a multiplayer game for more than a few secs before it just desynches. African Kingdoms was my very first and for sure the last preorder on Steam, sure, multiplayer-destroying update came to all AoE II owners, including those who did not bought the expansion, but this expansion symbolizes the beginning of the problem and the lack of commitment from the developers towards their own project which stands on multiplayer. They do not deserve any finnancial support unless they fix their mess. Until then AVOID!			"

												You know if you buy a ""remastered"" (really) old game you'd expect that it's polished, all compability issues(apart from maybe the mac version) have been resolved, the preformance has been improved and maybe some content like maps or improved handling/pathfinding. None of this is the case for Aoe 2 HD, It has numberous compability issues with all systems, months after re-release, the preformance is actually down a bit, there is virtually no new stuff, mechanisms are still from the ninetees, Pathfinding is aswell and the increaced unit cap(not that great btw) only makes it worse, because ""retro is cool"" they didn't even change the unitselection limit! now how ... not smart is that? 2,5 the unit limit but don't increace the number of selectable units? While there are fairly many events, the support mainly boils down to ""have you tried turning it off and on again"". Considering the Mo... Expansion, There are many great new aspects. But it's pretty obvious it's only a glorified mod. the comparison with AoC hurts it quite a bit. Not because of the civs or units but because of the Campaigns. The beautifully mapped and scripted maps but because of the shallow (and lacking)storytelling and the agitatingly narrow passageways through whom you have to maneuver 100 troops of different types combined with multi stage missions that are easily goofed. These missions are not particulary difficult, they are just annoying. I love lush and passable forests that don't just consist of blocks of trees and paths in between, but with this pathfinding and full armies it's just a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to micro or getting your army through in the first place :/ . the lack of voiceovers is totally understandable for a mod but it's another hint that MS is minimizing it's work here and not really ok for an expansion, same goes for sketchy scribbleings on parchment before each mission. The great thing about the AoE2 campaigns was not the missions themselves, but the stroytelling. You sitting in the tavern with Henry the lion talking about Barbarossa, a Frankish PoW in Saladins Camp, badgering El cids Widdow on the streets, Cautemocs chronicles, Father armand and his Goth-Skull, those were FANTASTIC! - All this is lacking in ""the forgotten"".Just take your old CD, install the mod (for free) and deactivate the explorer, and you have a game that is much stabler and cost you ""nothing"" - this version only has one asset: Steam, yes steam is the asset here, that shows how low microsoft has sunken. With Steam you can easily get mods and maps, install it on machines without an optical drive and ... well you get acchievements, if you're into that stuff. I just got it because I'm currently working with just a small laptop(no optical drive). I still think that 25 liters of cheap beer would have been preferable.			"

Words alone can not possibly explain how much I adore this game.Ever since I played this when I was just a little kid I was hooked, but I was in dismay after I couldn't find it anywhere, but once it came up on Steam, I jumped with Joy.Age of Empires 2 is a classic strategy game that not only teaches you multitasking skills, but also teaches you tactical reasoning. Age of Empires 2 is more than just a gaming experience, it's one of teaching you subtle history tidbits while also enjoying yourself, and I really like that about this game. Age of Empires can keep you occupied for hours on end (hence why I am reaching 500 hours).Long story short: If you like strategy games, this is definitely for you. If you like action packed games with an equally compelling set of campaigns and scenarios from players around the globe, don't even think twice. I love this game and I am sure that if you think that you'll like it, you will.			"

												Age of Empires II...This is a game particularly close to my heart, its probably the second game i remember ever playing... at the age of 5 (first being a combat flight simulator that my older sister gave to me). It came to me in demo form from my older brother, the demo disk had this, homeworld 1, some online game which i never played cos my computer was never connected to the internet, and a hoverboard racing game. All demos. Oh boy, the amount of times i played the William Wallace campaign, i even used to just stare at the cool looking Paladins in the scenario editor screen. Time passed, tried Homeworld and that one hoverboard games demos. Eventually somehow got Age of Empires 1, cant remember how, but i do remember playing the hell out of it.Years passed, was homeschooled and had to keep moving, so i didnt really have much in the way of friends, but at the age of 7 or 8 my older brother got Age of Empires 2 and the Expansion pack, letting me install it and use it.I played that, and pretty much only that for... well atleast till i was 11, i had memorized all the nations, the stats of most of the units, and had fought hundreds of single player skirmish games (rarely had internet, and when i did i wasnt allowed to waste the small amount of data we had on online games), fought every faction, played every faction, tried every stratagy i could dream of.Then i got a PS2 for my birthday and half a dozen games for it. Still played AOE on and off, but not nearly as much as i used to.Couple years passed, found my old disk, and started playing again on and off.The next year i got a new laptop for christmas, one that didnt overheat every half an hour when playing 3d games.Even then i still played.4-5 years passed and here i am, thousands of hours under my belt but i still play, and find it as challenging and fun as ever, hell, even recently got into Multiplayer.Now, personal nostalgia aside, this next section is if you should get THIS version of AOE 2, there being other HD refits of this particular game. Voobly for instance has one which i hear is reasonably good (havent tried it myself).The thing about this particular version is that it updates, but the devs arent exactly... competent enough that each update doesnt break something or other. Hell, for years this has been a buggy, laggy mess from what i have heard, having only got this last year. Recently it has reached some form of functionality, your PC wont catch on fire if you try to use the higher pop limits or the new map size, and multiplayer now works mostly as intended.The DLC's... well, they have their own review sections.Overall, not a whole lot has changed to the base game, new map size, HD resolutions (dont try in 4k, it doesnt work too well) better AI and some rebalances.And for the new player i think i will write a seperate guide and link it, as explaining everything about this game would turn this into a massive text wall...In conclusion, i think the devs of this HD edition could have done a better job overall, i personally hope someone will pick this game or the Genie Engine (what this game is built on) and build a new game with some more features, deformable terrain for instance would allow for more sources of gold and stone lategame and allow for artificial moats.So yeah, i do recommend this game, weather or not you get this particular iteration is up to you.A true 10/10 game, 6/10 devs.			"

Blast from the PastAge of Empires II: HD EditionAge of Empires II is often considered to be the pioneer of modern strategy games. But does this old gem still holds out in the sea of other similar titles? Let’s find out:Gameplay:Age of Empires II is a medieval themed strategy game which focuses on building your own empire and then demolishing that of the enemies. The Base game contains two set of campaigns, The Conquerors and The Age of Kings. Both of these campaigns then contain subsequent campaigns based on historical leaders and events which span six missions each and tell the stories of people like Genghis Khan and Attila the Hun and their conquests. What is great is the fact that Microsoft has released three expansion packs which include new missions and civilizations. While the new expansions don’t have the same quality as the base game, they still provide new content for an all time classic. Age of Empires II starts you off in the Dark ages where you are little more than a band of villagers with a town centre to start off. From here on you are tasked with collecting resources and explore the map while subsequently growing your army. From a mere tribe you build up a mighty civilization that will stand till the Imperial ages. You need to collect food, wood, stone and gold to upgrade and build your soldiers, guard towers, castles and other buildings. While the gameplay is less complex and simpler to get into than more modern titles, it is surprisingly deep once you get to know it. Normal Soldiers will be slaughtered while trying to get through walls so you need to bring in the siege to take those pesky walls down. Your archers will get mauled by cavalry so you need to have a row of pikemen in the front to defend them and also see the enemy’s army composition to build your own. It is not a game where an early rush strategies work but you will have to keep up with your enemy’s progress.Except a few visual improvements, the HD edition includes multiplayer and steam workshop support. The multiplayer is not perfect though and there is a certain noticeable lag between command and act which might easily ruin a game. Multiplayer games also have a tendency to desync quite often and crash the game. But there is an impressive amount of people who are online for such on old title and while the expansions split in the population when they first came out, the game has been balanced perfectly for the non expansion owners to play easily with the ones that do own the expansions. The non owners are limited to a rotating pool of civs to choose from which changes every day or so. This way non owners don’t feel like they are being left out and the expansion owners can use the civilizations of their liking.  What is the godsend for the HD edition is the workshop support. There are already an impressive number of awesome mods and most of them come with multiplayer support. They range from Lord of the Rings to Game of thrones Overhauls and there is a mod called CBA which I have already wasted hundreds of hours in multiplayer. There are a good lot of bugs present in the game and there are days where the multiplayer lobbies are completely bugged but the overall it still remains one of the best strategy games ever.VisualsVisually, the HD edition does not differ much from the old versions. The water and fire textures are nicer and the game has a more compact look but that is about it. That does not mean the game looks bad. Time has taken a toll on it but it still is really good to look at. SoundOne word: Epic. Right from the menu, you will sense that you’re in for a treat here. The game has an awesome soundtrack which fits right in with the medieval themes. The voice acting while limited is done very well and conveys the emotions it tries to. I can even go as far as to say that this might be the best soundtrack I’ve ever listened to in a strategy game.OverallAge of Empires II is still one of the finest strategy games ever made and it has stood the test of time. It is easy to get into for new people while rewarding the veterans. I have played the game since the time it came out and HD edition only adds to it. The multiplayer support is good and the mods will keep you occupied for a long long time to come. It will be a injustice to provide this game with a rating as it has come far beyond that. Age of Empires II: HD Edition is easily worth your time and money and if you somehow still haven’t played, please do. You won’t regret it. This review was brought to you by SIlas Reviews.

												Best RTS game ever made. I've probably played over 2000hrs of this game over my life and I'm still not bored of it. It has endless map variations and the map editor/creator is the best I’ve ever used in a game. Ever sense Zone went down it was sad that pvp was gone, but now online play is back which is amazing. If you like RTS at all, get this game. Also, all the dlc are worth it for this game. I’m hoping they keep making more civilizations.			"

												This game is the King of RTS. I have not played it much since getting it on steam but that is because I have hundreds of hours logged on the game outside of steam. If you love history and RTS this is the game for you. Far superior to Age of Empires 1 or 3.While the game may look a little dated, Don't let that fool you, the mechanics are still top of the line.

The multiplayer works splendidly, and it promises to keep on delivering even more countless hours of RTS fun. Just buy it, I guarantee you won't regret it.			"

Such great mods :p) Also played online with my school friends a bunch although we had a sh$tty net connection it was still fun.All these years later and this game has aged fairly well; that and the fact that I love playing it.10/10 this game was one of my favs			"

												This game did not have a negative review since December of 2013, until today. That is due to the recent expansion and patch update, but trust me, people. Don't give up on it. It is a 16 year old game that has been given new life, and a breath of fresh air due to the committed Forgotten Empires crew. My husband and I, as well as a group of friends, have had very many hours of fun on this game, and the hours on my account will continue to grow. I haven't gotten tired of this game, and it is the only game that I've ever played so many hours on in such a short time without losing interest. The laughs, the tears, the anger, the happiness.... It's all worth it. You have 27 civilizations to choose from, and you can win in so many different ways, with strategies that aren't formed to a small ""box"" like other games. There's really no right or wrong way to play, and that's what I love about it. Growing your village into an empire from your starting town center, few villagers, and a scout, only to lose it all in battle..... Such a grim ending, but it never ever gets tiring. --For those who think it is buggy and laggy, yes, it is, after the patch,  but they are working nonstop to fix it, and I assure you it was NOT that way before. Don't give up, it is worth it!			"

												I like to give this game a nickname which I like to called ""Mini Civilization""I'm gonna be honest most of the time when I'm ingame it doesn't actually mean I'm playing, sometimes I play but most of the time I doing a bot only game or in other words a bot tournement, partically ResonanceBot 5-1c. Why you may ask cause I have a fascination for the AI :D.So for every bot tournement I always have the same settings no matter what - 8 bots- Black Forest- Hardest difficulty - All Visible - Standard Resources - Random Civs In my current bot tournement the civilizations they're playing as - ResonanceBot 5-1c Blue, Aztecs- ResonanceBot 5-1c Red, Mongols- ResonanceBot 5-1c Green, Goths- ResonanceBot 5-1c Yellow, Britons- ResonanceBot 5-1c Light Blue, Saracens- ResonanceBot 5-1c Purple, Vikings ( Eliminated )- ResonanceBot 5-1c Gray, Slavs - ResonanceBot 5-1c Oranges, KoreansSo far playtime of the tournement 4h & 12 minutesIt very addicted game indeed, honestly I believe it the best RTS game ever created follow by Mythology of course. In Aoe 2 the farms are quite annoying, how you had to constanty replenish the farms. The Perisans and Teutopns are my favourites to play as nothing more fun then building mass war elephants ( Strongest Cavalry  or Teutonic Knights ( Strongest Infantry ) and roaming over your enemies. Don't care for online matches unless I playing with a friend or steam friend but other then that I pass.Overall if you love RTS games I highly recommend you give this game a try, if you love Age of Empires 2 I also highly recommend you try out Age of Mythology same thing but with mythological units and god powers.

												I was in an interesting game today. Everyone was either a Turk or Byzantine, but we did have one Korean and a Teuton. The Korean died quickly.We laughed because one of the Byzantines was named Heinrich Himmler, the advisor for Hitler during WW2. My friend in the game was acting a lot like Hitler, killing every Turk, so you can imagine having Hitler's advisor was funny. I was one of the Turks, but my friend did not kill me. Soon my empire grew and I started to kill off a Teuton who refused to give in to my demands. He was very weak and fled. I found him hiding in Heinrich's huge city, and it had turned out Heinrich agreed to protect him. Heinrich went to go eat and I decided I'll drop by and...hah...see how the Teuton was doing. I bring 40 Heavy Camels, 50 Jannisaries, and 15 Petards. The 15 petards were used to blow up (as I screamed in chat ""ALLAH HU ACKBAR!"") the little defense the Teuton had, effectively letting in my troops. The Teuton panicked and, again, tried to run away. I killed 23 of his villagers, but two got away. They got on a transport I presume, because next thing I knew, they were on a different land mass. I had trouble finding him, but eventually I did and got over there with 20 Cannon Galleons.By now, Heinrich had come back and noticed I was trying to kill the Teuton. He laughed but didn't choose a side. Meanwhile, I began to build a wonder, which for a Turk like me is a Mosque. I said ""LET ISLAM REIGN!"" as I finished the Mosque and put 15 Jannisaries on guard. My friend laughed before saying ""I hope you realize...I kill Muslims like you.""I laughed as well, thinking he was joking. I got some pizza and decided to go eat some. I come back about 7 minutes later, being destroyed by my friend and his ally. Now it was my turn to panic.""WHAT ARE YOU DOING *insert my friend's name here*?!""""I'm stopping the spread of Islam! Succumb to Christianity!""""OKAY OKAY I SURRENDER, CONSIDER ME CHRISTIAN!""""You are no Christian until you tear your Mosque down!""""But I...ugh, okay.""I selected the Mosque and clicked DELETE. It fell to rubble.""Happy?""""Yes.""Now we go back to the Teuton. He was hiding up north before, but in the short 7 minutes I was gone, he went back to Hein's city and Hein had built a wall around his town center. He called it the ""Teutonic Concentration Camp"". It was pretty funny. After a while we got bored and were going to select ""Allied Victory"". I still had a bone to pick with the Teuton, so I sent the remainder of my men after his camp, having to enemy Hein on the way there. FOR WHATEVER REASON, THEY KNEW I WOULD DO THIS. SERIOUSLY.EVERYONE IN THE GAME ENEMIED ME AND FOUGHT ME TO THE DEATH. THE TEUTON ACTUALLY WON WITH 1 TOWN CENTER, A VILLAGER, AND A FARM.In the end I whispered to myself ""This must be how Israel feels"".10/10 would be a failure of an Islamic empire again			"

												Is amazing how this game never gets old. This elder game was worth the effort of a full remasterisation into HD, the community is still active, competitive and it's creating a lot of content as maps, tournaments, tutorials and deep gaming analysis.It's incredible complex and well balanced on its internal mechanics and even now is revealing hidden secrets that keep amazing us. Its aura, half vintage half fresh, its aesthetics and the peculiar mixture of economic development and military devastation created a masterpiece like few others strategic games. It's virtually unique in its kind.			"

												Status: DeniedThe original game is very good, it's excellent, but the HD remake is horribleIt got tons of issues with optimization, giving you low fps and the netcode was badly written, thus resulting in an unplayable multiplayerThe reason it even appeared on steam was cause of the ""money hungry"" MicrosoftYou see, there was already a mod, called Forgotten Empires, that allowed the HD resolution, and it was FREEIn fact, the recent DLC (""Forgotten"") for AoE2, was ripped of straight out of Forgotten EmpiresThe thing that bugs me, is that Microsoft wasn't even involved in the making of the Forgotten Empires, they didn't invest money into it, yet here they are, selling it for 9.99$Age of Empires 2 HD doesn't even have a retail version, it's digital onlyI wonder, whether they invested anything at allobviously the just ripped off The Forgotten Empires, as they are the holders of the IP, and used it for ""easy money""			"

												Remember the WOLOLO?This was an awesome game back in the day. I remember spending hours upon hours after school coming home just to play this, and I'm glad there are still people working on it to this day. When I picked this up in 2013 on it's release date, I was convinced that there wouldn't have been any further updates other than the retextures and porting to Steam, etc. Glad it turned out that I was wrong, what with the continual release of DLCs for the game. That said, while it is definitely showing it's age - but with the DLCs, updates and the community still playing this game, it's kept it from going stale.Developers are still consistently working on patch and bug fixes, and... hey, with the Steam Workshop you can do pretty much whatever you want in this game. Reworked mechanisms from the original are welcome to keep it up with recent RTS releases as well.  Now... I need to find friends to play this with ;-;			"

												Genre - Historical RTSGreat respect for the developers for bringing this game to the new world with added content and civilizations.Despite my age, my first experience of AOE was the online version, which I really enjoyed and think was overlooked more than it should have been.After loading this up I trialled the campaign and found it enjoyable if a bit slow. Most of the units are quite generic across the various Civs until you get to certain age within the game.The game plays like most standard RTSs, where building the right things and managing your defences and resources is key.I tried a skirmish on standard against the AI and got my butt handed to me. I put it on easiest and it was a walk in the park. So unfortunately the AI is a bit ropey. Also you can't have different AI levels for more players, they all have to be the same. This is a bit restrictive if you are trying to setup an even game with friends.Still it is worth the money and you should get loads of playability out of it. I personally think the original game was over rated, and the online version under rated, but I am one voice in the crowd there...			"

What is it?A fully rounded real-time strategy game that's simple to grasp with full, playable tutorial mission to get you started (as William Wallace of Scotland) and really hit that magic formula where town-growing and tactical defense are equally enjoyable.  Age Of Empires II: Age Of Kings (its full title) is set in mediaeval times covering a time period of some 1000 years and is a mixture of resource gathering, town building, research and development of technologies and Wonders, and stategic defence and town attack with multitudous unit types from knights to elephants!  There is a full story-rich campaign where you will play as various legendary leaders from the Middle Ages around the world such as Saladin and Joan Of Arc (with unique units to each character).  The campaign is immensely enjoyable and surprisingly informative, where you re-enact famous battles or battle through foreign towns (plundering them and making them your own) without being able to change the course of history.There is also the option to play a sandbox game where you can choose to play one of several nations (again with unique units to each) and this never seems to get old.  Start with a new and small town with very basic resources, and try to build it to a much larger town and conquer other NPC towns on the map before they conquer you!  The game also offers full multiplayer support.How much has changed?Age Of Empires II HD is still the same game it always was.  The single biggest changes are the much-improved resolution over the (now very old) original and full compatibility with today's Windows versions (no more needing to kill explorer.exe to play)!  The HD version also allows the player to carry more units than the original.  Finally, the equally excellent expansion The Conquerers is included at no extra charge.  The game doesn't look pixely or low-resolution, and it's held up surprisingly well for a game first released in 1999.  The HD remake ensures the game looks as good now (on high resolution wide-screen monitors) as it did back in the days of low res 4:3 monitors.  What the HD version is NOT is a complete remake, but a remake was never needed; the changes just restore the game back to its former glory.I own the original - is it worth upgrading?Absolutely.  This title is often on sale so you don't have to pay full price if you're patient.  It's a delight not to need discs any longer, and to be able to run the game without killing explorer.exe processes in order to play.  It's also nice to have full wide-screen support and those all-important extra units.It won't feel like a different game (it isn't), but it's been lovingly restored to the game it always was - for today's PCs.In summary...An excellent and very addictive game from the age of traditional strategy that will sink many hours of your time without the steep learning curve often associated with today's strategy titles.  If you like games where you can build a town, defend it and conquer other towns, then this game is perfect.			"

Product received for free
												If Steam added all the hours I played on the disc copy of this game to my current digital download, I'd likely range in the 2-3k hours. A dear friend gifted me this game for my birthday, so thanks to him!This game. . . .where to start. . . .I grew up playing this game as a kid, and a young teen. This is perhaps one of the most immersive strategy games I've ever played. Overall, I can't find much to fault in it. Everything seems to still be in its respective place. Age of Empires II is an amazing strategy game, retelling hisoric events, such as memorable battles, the rise of multiple leaders and civilizations (through campaign mode, which is also highly recommended for those of you who like to play alone), and events in history that just captured peoples attention. I think they should institute this at schools for history class instead. It's very accurate to the events/battles/timelines that it covers. If campaigning just isn't your cup of tea, fear not! There are multiple online servers hosting games almost all the time! You can also play your own private games with friends, in standard games, if PVP isn't really something you want to do, or are extremely good at (like me. I'd probably get destroyed in PVP XD). Lots of civilizations to choose to play as in these modes, so finding the one that suits your playstyle doesn't take long at all. Feeling creative? Make your own maps and scenarios, with scenario editor! Pick and choose features to add to your maps, and have a blast creating your own battles and maps to play! I don't generally play strategy games (it's on my to-do list), but I have played this one extensively. All I can say, is GET THIS GAME!!!!! You will not be disappointed :)			"

												Review Aimed to New Players: Yes, it is an old game. Yes, even with the HD enchance the graphics aren't that great. Does it plays as it looks? Nope. While it is indeed an old game, AoEII was known for being so modern in its mechanics that it revolutionized the whole RTS scene to the point that newer games tried to be like AoEII and not the inverse. Considering this, you can see features such like pathfinding, balanced civilizations, mass stack of units, group controls, up to date hotkeys and a myriad of other things common in the RTS of our days. So yes, it is an old game, but it does not play like an old game.What makes AoEII so good compared to RTS of its time or present time?- The game is forgiving in small errors because confrontations are focused in tactical endurance and slow advance rather a clash of sweeping offensives. This is one of the few games where when you can truly say ""I may have lost this battle, but not the war!"". So things are more aimed toward who makes more errors (and the importance of those errors) rather about who makes the first error and dies. This add a lot of depth, playability and strategy to the game, both for newbies and veterans.- You have a myriad of civilizations who specialize in different things and each one posses an unique unit (or some, two). Yet, the bonuses and differences between civilizations aren't sharp, so aside a few particular cases you won't find yourself in the situtation that a civ. pick (or random) can determine the whole match or even influence too badly on it. The civilizations are properly balanced, so you can pick favorite ones and be sure you will rock on it as long you use their advantages wisely (and patches their weaknesses).- The game is extremely friendly to new people since it includes one of the most memorable tutorial campaigns (featuring William Wallace!) ever made, making sure in a fun and quick way that players can manage the game. While it can take a time to learn about all the units and specific details, since the game only possess four ages and the units upgrades are straightforward, a player can plan an (effective) tactic without much knowledge. The matches can be played on Slow Mode so the reaction and reflect factors of the RTS doesn't hit them hard. There are maps like Black Forest that are easy to wall, thus winning you time to compensate differences in skill levels.- The Single-Player posses a heck a lot of content with a myriad of different campaigns and random maps. The campaigns (excepts those from the expansion The Forgotten) features an amazing voice acting that will enchance your experience greatly. Wanna learn about medieval history (specially for school/college LOL)? This game and its campaigns will teach you and motivate you like nothing else you can find in your way!With that said, the game possess a flaw for new players in multiplayer and it is the resource gathering. Actually your capacity to quickly collect resources possess a snowball effect that can put you ahead several minutes (even half an hour!) of your opponent in development, giving an easy win to those who can make a lot of resources in the Early and Middle game. This is easy to improve with some practice, tips or tutorials, and resource gathering is actual fun here with the ever useful villagers (that also rocks as offensive and defensive machines since they can repair key units and position holding building during battle, just like making new main bases or frontline bases to battle). Yet, this can be frustrasting at first when someone wins you only because they handle the resource gathering better.Nonetheless, this game rulz and I totally recommend it, not only for old and veteran fans, but for new people as well!

Age of Empires II HD Edition Pros   New AI Better graphics Online multiplayer Workshop support Still recaptures the magic of age of empires II   Cons   The new AI still has flaws not game breaking still challenging but not perfect No graphics settings this is the main thing I dislike about the game I wish I could tune the graphics a bit The DLC, I understand the idea and mentality behind the DLC but I wish it was all in the main game it would make it feel more like a complete package While the graphics are still a vast improvement over the original I can't help but think of an age of empires 2 with 3's graphics  Conclusion Age of empires II HD Edition is a vast improvement over the original and while this is not without it's own imperfections it is defiantly worth the $20 price tag even better if you can snag it on sale.

Age of Empires II was the very first real-time strategy game I played, back in 1999. In my opinion, it remains the best at what it does.There are many civilizations to choose from, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, but all incredibly balanced. The gameplay is very simple and allows for a variety of approaches. There are also many modes for multiplayer and the maps are generated randomly, resulting in unparalleled replay value.The single-player campaigns are well designed and challenging. Plus, you can learn some History by completing them – I know I did.The scenario editor is a fantastic tool. It has pretty much kept Age of Empires II alive for all these years, thanks to its brilliant and passionate community.There are some issues, of course. For example, the A.I. leaves a little to be desired and unit pathfinding is not so great, which is made worse by occasional framerate drops during multiplayer matches.Still, none of these issues are enough to keep you from fully enjoying the game. You can't call yourself a true PC gamer without giving Age of Empires II a try.Even though it's been over a decade since its original release, it feels like the game hasn't aged a day. It's a timeless gem.			"

												EDIT MARCH 2016:Despite contrary claims by the devs the game's multiplayer is still completely broken to the point of being almost unplayable. To make matters worse, the latest DLC broke the game even more just in time for the developer to seemingly abandon the game in an absolutely devastating state.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, IT IS COMPLETELY BROKEN. If you want to enjoy Age of Empires II get the original game and use a free service like Voobly to play multiplayer.Original review:Maybe the best RTS game of all time with the ""HD"" version adding support for widescreen and a few other minor features. The singleplayer campaigns are perfectly playable and just as fun as they were 14 years ago. Steam Workshop makes installing mods very easy.HOWEVER, the multiplayer has since release been absolutely riddled with bugs and glitches. FPS lag even on high end PCs, far more lag than the original version, many connectivity bugs and lobby glitches, sometimes forcing a lobby to be recreated several times before it actually works.It is not completely unplayable but the multiplayer experience will get very frustrating very quickly.For now I cannot recommend buying this game, if you already have the original version, stick with it, if not, wait until the bugs get fixed or just get the original.edit: removed the out of sync part, as this has apparently been fixed in the latest update, all other bugs/annoyances are still in though.

 Short evaluation by Lythronax Age of Empires II HD is the higher resolution of the old and good AoE II. This game adds better graphics, better water, mutliplayer lobbies and rankings, more intelligent AI and the DLCs are really nice! The game is still developed and the Steam Workshop compatibility is the best thing ever. Community-made mods like texture packs, tutorial maps, new mods, etc. just revive the game with a factor of 3!  Conclusion: I really, really recommend to buy this game! It's my favourite games so far in the strategy-genre and it's in my Top 5 of best games ever as well!			"

												I've played this game for over 8 years now, and Age of Empires II has what most games these days don't have: Replayability.The inexhaustable list of combinations and scenarios with equally diverse results keep this game interesting 17 years after it's inception. The mechanics and options this game provides manages to be fully featured without becoming overwhelming (I'm looking at you Democracy 3). I reccomend this to anyone who enjoys stradegy games, economy games, military games, city building games, etc. This fufills all of those categories at once. In the future, I intend to write a full review, but this is it for now.			"

You might like if: You loved the original and want an untainted remix on your modern machine... only with sharper graphics, stronger AI and more maps! Or, if you're new to the scene, want an RTS which balances the build-up of an empire with decent-paced games (and you can stomach how old it is)A fine example of a remaster done well! If you have the burning taste of nostalgia for Age of Empires - this is easily the best version to go for.It's a clean upgrade of the original game and its expansion, Age of Conquerors - bringing in very welcome improvements: Sharper graphics, smoother movement, stronger AI... all whilst leaving the fundamental nuts and bolts very much alone and un-fudged with. There's no attempt to 'reimagine' here, it's exactly what you loved, only better. (Well... except the new fire, but there's a mod for that). There are also balance changes; but these have, thankfully, been honed over thousands of hours of top, competitive play... so are not the result of horrifyingly whimsical ""hey, I think Teutonic knights are too slow.... You know what they need? Bazookas"".For a veteran who wants to see life breathed into one of their favourite titles - this one should tick the box nicely!Now... if you're new to the series, this is where it gets a little tricky. The game will undoubtedly feel dated to the likes Total War, Dawn of War or Battle for Middle Earth. So a few things to bring your attention to when pondering this game: The graphics remain sprite-based like the original. So there's no 3D camera or zooming here. No squads, so it's all about individual units. This may make battles feel a bit smaller or fiddly if you're used to bigger titles (but don't worry - hotkeys and controls groups are a thing) The factions all draw from the same, fundamental tech tree (with the exception of their unique unit). Their difference is in which techs they have available and their faction bonuses. Economy (and your builder units) plays a huge role here. It's as much about balancing your economy, protecting your villagers and securing resources as it is about combat and smashing things with trebuchets.Its strength though is, to me, its balance. You have decent-scale base-building, resources to harvest, scouting, harassing and all-out combat. The progression is paced brilliantly so that the defender starts with the biggest advantage but, over the 4 ages (akin to 'tiers'), the balance swings more in favour of the aggressor - providing a nice build-up in games that can last anywhere from 40 minutes to a few hours (in general). I find the larger focus on economy makes for a refreshing strategic change, especially in late game where it opens up more opportunities for thwarting your opponents with your medieval shenanigans. The trade-off is that you do not necessarily get epic clashes of armies, but more ongoing skirmishes.For me, it's fundamentally the enjoyable balance of economy and military. You get the fun base-building and build-up of an empire, married with a decent pace of play... Kinda like a pocket-Total War, if you will (albeit with considerably fewer units). Empires in a 2 hour slot. If the pace piques your interest - it might be worth a spin!			"

												This game...  This ♥♥♥♥ing game... From when I played the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this when I could barely do 13x12 to now, a grown man in college. This game was pure joy every click I made, every command I did, every task I assigned and every Teutonic Knight I slayed (♥♥♥♥ those ♥♥♥♥♥es).A masterpiece of game development. An example of how to design maps, how to create a community that lasts forever. Until the day I die, this game will stand, that♥♥♥♥♥♥is beyond hard. What Ensemble made is beyond genius. A showcase and a pedestal in the kingdom of variety, challenge and replayability. PROS + Dozens of civilizations to play as. Each with unique units, their own research trees and their own language when clicking units. This is an obscene amount of detail beyond anything any other franchise conceived. Not Command and Conquer, not XCOM, not Warhammer, nothing!This contributes to the massive variety and replayability the game possesses.+  Well-aged retro graphics that don't instantly turn you off. While many classics like Wolfesntein 3D and such died from bad aging, AoE2 still stands imo as the best RTS ever made. Even the graphics have a great charm to them, perfect simplicity and adequate accuracy to it's historical roots.+ Great Editing Mode. You can literally create thousands of maps avaliable for online play. I spent so much time making maps when I was younger O.o+ Mod Support. Now on Steam Workshop and as if the player base is huge... mod support now even increases the support on this game.+ Support. After over 15 years, AoE 2 got 2 new DLC expansions. 15 YEARS!Call of Dut... what?+ Lots and lots of campaigns to complete. All vastly different from eachother, giving the game massive playtime for a completionist.+ Greatly improved Online support.+ Very good and non-obtuse UI, unlike C&C and many other RTS' that try to do too much and fail hard UI wise, making everything feel cluttered and drab.+ Phenomenal tutorial, an example to any game of any genre how to incorporate story and gameplay in a tutorial that explain pretty much everything about the game without throwing everything at you at once, like 80% of video games...+  There is dialogue in the campaigns, it's not modernized nor was it replaced. Still sounds as nostalgic and good as it was. Not cheesy or immersion breaking :) CONS- Improvements needed from the original are lacking, like when picking an army: if it's too big, you can't pick them all at once. This♥♥♥♥♥♥should've been fixed years ago ^^"" - Occasional and annoying bugs and optimization issues. I ran multiplayer games @ 30 FPS sometimes, others were massively laggy and on the Ludicrous map size, there seems to be a general issue that renders the game slow (my game froze/played at 1 FPS, I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not. Haven't touched it ever since).- Some Achievements are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It's just... busy work. I mean... 1000 wins with each civilization? REALLY?! What the hell? Yes, the game's addicting, time consuming, and requires massive dedication to remotely learn it's mechanics decently well, but 1000 wins? What the ♥♥♥♥ were they thinking?!- Compared to some more modern RTS, AoE2 is too zoomed in  on the action imo, at first after many years of a break (until the HD remake came out), it just felt weird and a zoom out option would be GREATLY appreciated.-  Where's Age of Empires 1 HD Remake?! I want that♥♥♥♥♥♥ NOW!Alright, this was a smaller review overall, but it just had to be made eventually. I was supposed to since... Summer of 2015 but was too lazy to do it. This game was, is and will be always a masterpiece that heats the blood that flows through my heart valves. it bring numerous child memories of playing with friends and even my mom. It's a masterpiece of strategy design, planning, agility and critical thinking that many ""Biggest Unit-Spammer Wins"" RTS these days sorely lack!Despite all the flaws, I just can't bring myself to not giving this game a perfect score.No game is perfect. Everyone knows it. But there is this perfect nomenclature that translates into something you keep going back to year after year, day after day, night after night. You have fun all those times. You lose some and win some, but you leave with a grin on your face. Because you are happy, you had fun. You love the game and the game loves you. A flow of synergy between the controls, UI and your brain that made you blow up that castle and gate, bash in with your cavalry and slit that king's throat into a pool of gushing blood!Conotative over denotative. Perfection in life is something that never dies within you. A movie that you talk about year after year with your friends. A game like this. A book you never shut the ♥♥♥♥ up about. People that never leave you. Nothing breaks that bond.Anyway, -> 10/10This game is perfect.			"

												I very tentatively recommend this.""How can you say that?"" you might ask, knowing full well that Age of Empires 2 is an excellent game that is widely praised and regarded as a classic. Well, I'll explain.Age of Empires 2, as a game, is a classic RTS game where you manage a Medieval Civilization, going from a tiny settlement to a sprawling empire. If you don't get invaded first that is. There is a massive focus on combat in this game, most games are decided on the battlefield, with players fielding massive armies against each other to knock out buildings, defences and eventually innocent civilians. But of course, these armies don't come out of nothing, you need to build up some money, gather food, collect wood for buildings and stone for castles. If you aren't familiar with Age of Empires 2, I suggest you look for reviews of that game.Age of Empires 2 HD is a little different, and not always in a good way.The upgrades from the original are primarily on the graphical side of things, the updating to a modern lobby-based multiplayer, better mod support and two expansions not originally made for the game. Make no mistake, these aren't all what they're cracked up to be and there's a few problems in this release.As far as graphics are concerned, the game looks as nice as ever, with only the water reflections, the larger resolutions (which aren't easily adjustable) and a few changed in-game graphics, most of which are welcome additions. To call it HD is perhaps a stretch, but it is graphically superior to its original counterpart.The modern lobby-based multiplayer is a welcome feature, theoretically allowing for easy and simple online play, without the need for third party clients like Voobly and Gameranger. In practice, the lobby system is very suspect to bugs, with crashes upon game launches occuring frequently and dropouts that halt the game halfway through happening somewhat less frequently. For all the unreliability in Voobly and Gameranger that this system could do away with, it is in many ways inferior, with these problems ocurring less often in either client.Another couple of things that Voobly and Gameranger players would be able to avoid is the problems that actually happen in-game. Path-finding was never stellar in the original game, but many claim that it has been significantly degraded in this version. Not to mention that the actual game seems to typically run slower, with more log and with more connection problems than it does in Voobly and Gameranger under similar conditions.The mod support is nice, but the amount of content for AoE2 that isn't on the Steam Workshop is gigantic, which leaves mostly classic and popular scenarios as well as an assortment of other bits and bobs to choose from. Your typical AoE2 player won't be missing out on much, but for those who want really specific things, they might have a hard time to get a hold of them.And lastly, there's the two expansions. Opinion is divided about these; some say that the new African Kingdoms are extremely powerful, to the point of possibly being imbalanced. And The Forgotten Empires is perceived as being a slew of rather lacking civilizations that don't boast much power, but seem to have very little place in the game. Personally, I think that the African Kingdoms expansion adds a lot to the game and is very fun to play with, even if the new civilizations, particularly the Portugeuse can seem a little tough to play against. As for the Forgotten Empires, it's fun in much the same way, but the civilizations added seem too timid to really add all that much beyond a few interesting unique units and techs to open up a few more strategies than there used to be.The bugs that make online play well under optimal for such a multiplayer focused game, not to mention one so old and a few of the gameplay problems make me really hesitate to recommend AoE2 HD, because these issues are extremely frustrating and can feel like a dealbreaker. But when the game works, it's as fun as the old AoE2 and sometimes even more so with the higher resolutions, the extra content and the new community. I can't blame you if these bugs get the better of you and you end up going back to Voobly though.			"

												Age of Empires 2: HD edition is an update on the original game. The first difference is that you have all of the previous DLC/expansions already.  So no need to go rummaging around old game stores for the extra campaign mode maps.The game really does look really nice when playing it on 1080p and the support for multiple monitors is a welcome addition. Multi-player AOE has never been easier. No need to set up servers, IP addresses and the sort. Just click ""join"" and you are in. Is it worth it though? If its your first time playing Age of Empires, then yes, it will save you a lot of hassle,  however if you have played before, you can get the majority of these features via mods to install with your older version of Age of Empire.

												This is the definition of an iconic game. At its time, it ruled the world. The HD remaster allows it to run on newer computers and does an adequate job. The multiplayer connectivity is an issue in this version, but the single-player modes provide the same engaging and rewarding RTS experience as the original. For those interested, I have a video reflecting on what made AoE II a standout game of its time. Hope you enjoy!

												Amazing game. Filling the gap that AoE Online failed to in my heart, Age of Empires II HD recaptured the Age of Empires experience that I've enjoyed better than most, if not all gaming experiences on this planet. The community is great, as I have yet to see the classic multiplayer rager who caps locks and types vulgarities into the chat, and most everyone says ""gg"" after a match, making Age of Empires II HD one of the most docile and least annoying multiplayer communities I've seen on Steam!With The Forgotten Expansion, the single player AND multiplayer experience is, in my opinion, doubled in fun. With scores of new and unseen units in the scenario editor, brand new civillizations, and some of the most interesting random maps I've seen, this expansion is well worth the money.Overall, I highly recommend Age of Empires II HD to veterans of the game, as it will be an amazing and unforgettable nostalgia trip. If you've never played Age of Empires before, it's never too late to start! Also, this game is a great alternative solution to the problems that the CD-ROM of The Conquerors has on modern computers.

												I've been playing Age of Empires since I was 9 or 10 years old. That was about 14 years ago, and no other game has taught me more than Age of Empires has.It taught me good english, history, management and fast decision making.And Age of Empires II does it in the best way.I still have very fond memories playing this masterpiece during my teens.I'm not sure if it interests today's people due to shinier games out there today, but I can tell you that this is one of the best RTS games ever made, besides C&C : RA2, Warcraft 3 & StarCraft IIBe sure to try AOE III as well, it's another masterpiece.Age of Empires II : 9.5/10 "

There's a lot of content not only in the game but in the steam workshop. You can download bonus maps and stuff. I really recommend this game its okay to play even without a friend because the missions are really well made.

												This is not HD. This is a laggy, buggy, ugly remake of old game.The only ""HD"" things in this game is water texture and native capability of hd resolution. Original works better in all other respects and hd resolution cabability is easily added f.ex. by Voobly matchmaking or UserPatch.Game lags in single and multiplayer, partial fix is setting vsync on (why?) Network lag, timeouts, out-of-sync issues make this unplayable even with gigabit lan network. Adding CPU player guarantees lag from game start. This is now version 2.4(?) and only fixes are essentially UI changes.Forgotten apparently did not add all the features from original FREE addon and introduced more bugs.Update: So now this is version 3.8. I decided to check out if game has improved. Lag issue seems to be gone in SP. But about 10 minutes into the game, entire army moonwalked into a forest instead of going by the straight road to ally's town. Ragequit and Back to AoE2...			"

												Age of Empires II is one of the most timless installments of gaming.  It goes without saying that it has essentially become a legend.  With the HD release, the game is highly polished and streamlined, making it playable to those who are more accustomed to modern gaming.  Continued support of the game through server maintenance and subsequent expansions show that this game will not be allowed to die anytime soon.			"

												Those of you that haven’t played AoE II in a while will probably have some pretty fond memories of the aging strategy title. You’ll likely think of it as one of the greats; spectacularly innovative, well-balanced and displaying a level of detail that would make Renaissance painters blush. Then … you’ll start the game.As great as it might be, the number of changes that have been made here are the absolute bare minimum. There are no HD textures, all of the original sound effects and voice clips have been kept, and none of the mechanics have changed. Everything is exactly as we all left it -- for better or worse.Little in AoE II has aged as well as one might hope. Those used to more sophisticated strategy games might find this golden oldie a bit frustrating. There’s no auto-explore, no unit command queues, no building queues, selecting a group of units will often select stray workers, control groups are pretty limited both in terms of number of units you can select and number of control groups allowed, and worker AI leaves quite a bit to be desired.Even so, there’s a kind of purity to the whole thing. Micromanagement and care are a lot more important than they have been in years and the lack of affordances and hand-holding gives a rougher but sometimes more precise experience. I found myself setting rally points much more effectively, and I would often dedicate five of my control groups to villagers or workers specifically to help cycle through economic management. For example, in my main lumber-gathering camps, I’d keep one worker in a control group so I could easily reposition the camp, and jump to that group of workers for quick action.Additionally, I became much more careful with base construction patterns and the arrangement of my buildings and supply lines. Keeping everything organized with so little help from the computer is hard enough, and I figured working around my own foolish base design would make the whole thing intolerable.This bare-bones approach encourages a much more aggressive, and obsessive style of play. There’s no room for complacency; you can't afford to stop moving or quit paying attention. Quite unlike StarCraft, which is often the same for the first three minutes or so of every match -- build worker after worker, secure more food, then crank out some military. At the very least, AoE will have you manually scouting and switching between various starting food sources while also securing housing, wood supplies, and getting everything set-up for the tech advancement. It’s different enough each time that it’s never the same game twice.Each of the civilizations is also fairly balanced with a few small exceptions here and there. Generally speaking though, the game is a very appropriate gauge of an enormous number of tactical as well as bigger-strategy skills. The game moves fast enough with other competent players that you’ll need to be pretty aggressive to keep up, without being so inaccessible that newer or less well-practiced players will be doomed before they ever start.Similarly, the campaign will take you through some of the more interesting, albeit distressing, moments in the middle ages. It’s all more or less historically accurate, though handled with a fair amount of tact, such that it never veers into unnecessarily offensive territory. If you can teach your children how to play effectively, it’s honestly not a bad tool to teach them a few things about major historical conflicts. I remember learning about the Aztecs and the city of Tenochtitlan from this thing. Enough that I can still spell that city-name properly with one try. Whoever said games weren’t effective teachers?In all seriousness though, this game is fantastically well-made, even if it a little rough around the edges. Some of the bigger issues with trying to run the thing on modern computers (such as the color bug, and the mouse scroll bug) have been fixed. Plus AoE II now supports a huge range of monitor resolutions, which is nice, even if we’re still stuck with these old textures, but there is Steam Workshop support so things could change down the line by fans.All told, while a little frustrating if you’re not into tons of micro-management, Age of Empires II HD with the Workshop and updated multiplayer features is an excellent title. The brilliance of the game’s design is still there, you just might need to look past its age to see it.			"

												Microsoft решили поиграть  на чувствах игроков ""со стажем"", выпустив переиздание одной из самых успешных, лучших и инновационных стратегий в реальном времени — Age of Empires 2.Сразу стоит сказать о улучшениях - мы все так же собираем ресурсы и машем саблей , но вот с технической стороны улучшения есть (хоть они и минимальны) :Улучшили прорисовку зданийПовысили качество текстур Вода и огонь получили новые шейдерные эффектыПодкорректирован интерфейсПоддержка широкоформатных мониторов Достижения ! Но вы их видели ? Конечно можно было спустя столько лет сделать лучшие изменения , для меня идеал в переиздании это  Halo Anniversary - вот там то перепаяли очень многое , но и тем что сделали можно удоволетвориться .Существует проблема - невозможностью увеличить изображение. Конечно, в 1999 году, когда вышла оригинальная игра, это было нормально. Но высокие разрешения сделали всё очень мелким, хотя и расширили угол обзора . Очень  хорошо ,что игра связана со Steam Workshop . Steam полон модов и расширений . Это все та же добрая Age of Empires II  , если играли вспомните былое , а сели нет , то обязательно попробуйте !

												AoE 2 is among the best rts games ever made. It's a classic. It's a legend. Building your own empire is really addictive and this game can easily be played for hours without getting bored. I'm so happy they made a hd version of it for Steam. It has some performance issues with the two largest map sizes but I can forgive that, since the game is so awesome. I highly recommend getting all the dlc's as they bring a lot of new civilizations and campaigns to the game. This game is also suitable for casual players like me, since the ai isn't too difficult to beat on the easier difficulty levels. I rate this game 9/10. Totally worth your money.			"

												This game brings back a lot of memories for me.In this game, you start of in the Dark Age, where you have little resources and villagers. You must build your town, and into a city to defeat the other player(s). I recommend this game for players who can multitask (No offense), as this game is crazy with multitasking. You need to organise your army, economy and allies. If you aren't sure to buy it, watch some games of Age Of Empires to get an idea of the game. In conclusion, this game is well made, and i would recommend it to anyone who love strategy and medieval multiplayer type games.P.S It would be awesome if they enabled Age Of Empires to be accessable to mac platforms.

												So 35 hours into the game, I guess it is time for a review.The game is addictive as a whole, playing against the AI is challenging itself, more challenging than playing against other players, single player is therefore very competitive and fun to play. Taking the AI on higher difficulty head on is a suicide mission and will result in your army dying out. It requires strategy and quick thinking. Eg: The Persians were attacking my front base and taking them head on was not an option, I stationed my archers at the walls and directed infantry and cavalry to a forest where I used an Onager to clear a path, of course I walled it up later. I sent my troops through that path and flanked the enemy only then was I able to repel the attackers.As you can see, the game at times will make you try out unconventional strategies and methods and these are the moments that you will enjoy.The single player campaigns are fun to play aswell and are very informative and historically accurate to a certain extent. (The Scotts lost the Battle of Falkirk) Campaigns are worth playing.Multiplayer is fun but the community is quite toxic and not very welcoming to new comers. So it is advised that you learn your stuff before going into multiplayer cause you will be pressed down hard.Though I do experience a funny thing in multiplayer. While I may be lagging in AOE 2, at the same time when I quit AOE 2 and launch AOE 3 multiplayer, I don't experience any; I suspect it is ESO at play.The modding community and official updates of the game are alive and regular so that is not an issue.Even at full price the game is worth it and you get a whole bunch of content to play around with.I recommend this game highly and a must add for your library.8/10 "

												I was about 6 years old when this game came out (not the HD version of course). I remember that i used to watch my uncle play this at the office when there weren't any clients around and ask myself why he found this game so amusing. At that time i was playing a demo version of ""Lego Racers"" when cereal boxes used to give you CD-ROMs. I asked him to get me the full version of that game, at that time and i couldn't understand what a ""download"" was, he simply was that computer wizard who could get me anything i wanted. There wasn't ""unlimited internet"" at that time, we used to turn off the phone when we wanted to get online so i never got the chance of playing ""Lego Racers"" and i got a zip file with ""Age of Empires II"" instead. For many months i watched that folder on my computer and then i decided to play it. I remember playing with ""El Cid"", i didn't understood English at that time so i never got the first level completed. I tried to run from ""King Alonso"" and i never understood why i couldn't complete my mission. Years have passed, i played single player games with bots and learned the basic mechanics of the game. I've got ""Age of Empires III"" and my uncle was still playing ""Age of Empires II"" and i couldn't understand why once more. Why should he prefer it when there was a game wich was ""the next"" and with so better graphics?I am 22 years old now, i learned a little of English and i have my internet access to do whatever i want. ""Lego Racers"" used to be my favourite and i never played it anymore, i played lots of ""Age of Empires III"" and got the collection on Steam to remember me what great games are. On ""Age of Empires II"", i went back to the ""El Cid"" campaign, fled from ""King Alonso"", got some villagers, built my empire and tried to destroy him without the game asking me to. I have failed miserably but this time i did just because i wanted.""Age of Empires II"" is a really well made game, i am not experienced in the ""HD version"" but i found many bugs that should be corrected. I am currently playing the game hoping that i could beat every campaign but sometimes it's just impossible.Besides that, i don't know why i can play this game for 6 hours straight, i can't understand why this game is better than ""Age of Empires III"" but in all of this years i can tell you this: my uncle was right all the time for playing it and if you are reading this you are making the right choice.Note: I am trying to help others and get help by making a steam guide so feel free to check it out.

												A very fun game, but it's not bug-free.If you and your friend decide to take a break mid-game and save/leave, you can forget about coming back. You can't restore multiplayer games.Online vs other players is pretty hard, or I just suck. Idk yet.			"

												Having clocked up more than 700 hours re-playing AoE II  and the new 'The Forgotten' Campaigns I have to say this has been the best epxerience of a rejuvinated game.The Forgotten Campaigns are very well crafted with multiple possible wins.  The use of triggers is extensive and some are either/or so if you choose path A path B is not available.I've really enjoyed playing this game again and the new campaigns are so much better than previous.  I already know I will revisit these campaigns.			"

												I was about 6 years old when this game came out (not the HD version of course). I remember that i used to watch my uncle play this at the office when there weren't any clients around and ask myself why he found this game so amusing. At that time i was playing a demo version of ""Lego Racers"" when cereal boxes used to give you CD-ROMs. I asked him to get me the full version of that game, at that time and i couldn't understand what a ""download"" was, he simply was that computer wizard who could get me anything i wanted. There wasn't ""unlimited internet"" at that time, we used to turn off the phone when we wanted to get online so i never got the chance of playing ""Lego Racers"" and i got a zip file with ""Age of Empires II"" instead. For many months i watched that folder on my computer and then i decided to play it. I remember playing with ""El Cid"", i didn't understood English at that time so i never got the first level completed. I tried to run from ""King Alonso"" and i never understood why i couldn't complete my mission. Years have passed, i played single player games with bots and learned the basic mechanics of the game. I've got ""Age of Empires III"" and my uncle was still playing ""Age of Empires II"" and i couldn't understand why once more. Why should he prefer it when there was a game wich was ""the next"" and with so better graphics?I am 22 years old now, i learned a little of English and i have my internet access to do whatever i want. ""Lego Racers"" used to be my favourite and i never played it anymore, i played lots of ""Age of Empires III"" and got the collection on Steam to remember me what great games are. On ""Age of Empires II"", i went back to the ""El Cid"" campaign, fled from ""King Alonso"", got some villagers, built my empire and tried to destroy him without the game asking me to. I have failed miserably but this time i did just because i wanted.""Age of Empires II"" is a really well made game, i am not experienced in the ""HD version"" but i found many bugs that should be corrected. I am currently playing the game hoping that i could beat every campaign but sometimes it's just impossible.Besides that, i don't know why i can play this game for 6 hours straight, i can't understand why this game is better than ""Age of Empires III"" but in all of this years i can tell you this: my uncle was right all the time for playing it and if you are reading this you are making the right choice.Note: I am trying to help others and get help by making a steam guide so feel free to check it out.

												You can't really call yourself an RTS fan without playing this masterpiece of the genre first. It may seem a bit basic - train a load of soldiers and build a load of siege engines in order to systematically remove every other player from the map - but the complexity comes from adapting to various different styles of map, as well as learning how each different civilisation works. For example, the Britons have some of the best archery units in the game, but their mounted units are lacking in response. On the other hand, the Teutons have a unique unit that can take a lot of hits but is extremely slow, so they essentially need ranged escorts. And then there's dealing with being krushed (a.k.a. rushed with knights) and being able to reach the Castle Age in under 20 minutes. Oh, and don't even get me started on the absolutely wonderful soundtrack - something that I didn't hear until I got this version, no thanks to having to use a No-CD patch.However, while this is an incredible game, I feel like Microsoft haven't done enough to call this a true HD edition. Yes, technically it is in HD and this improves the game significantly, but otherwise it has little in the way of improvements, and it's therefore quite expensive for what it is. If you're never going to play multiplayer then try to find it cheaper on Amazon or something, and download the Forgotten Empires mod separately. Otherwise, get it when it's on sale, because fifteen quid is rather a lot of money to be spending on a game that's over 15 years old.In conclusion, absolutely get this game (when it's cheap) because it is one of the greatest strategy games ever created, alongside Civilization IV and Command & Conquer: Red Alert. And to those idiot critics who say the game doesn't play very well, you deserve several slaps.			"

												It's classic RTS and is always playable, but this version brings nothing new but a screenmode and unbalanced gameplay.If your going to buy this ok but do not buy The Forgotten expansion. The creators clearly have no idea of game balance or a good scenario.It's just buggy trash now.The single player mode was so good but now you have ruined the AI for stupid multiplayer.Has anyone beaten Sforza - A New Duke In Milan on hard? Of course you haven't beaten this mission in the latest update. The AI sends everything it has at you, thats red and green sending it's full army at you with you having only 19 troops with no base. By the time you get setup they are on you. Of course there is no murder holes so basically a castle is useless. You can't build troops fast enough because the AI just hates your villages so much more than you troops. You cannot get a wall up in time and even if you do it gets beat down very fast.This mission was hard enough before you tweaked the AI.			"

												Let me say this - i love this game.... it made part of my childhood, and i played it during most of it.... but the thing is, it was already a good game back in the day, so this review is not based on that, but on what it improved from the previous one, and the answer is: NOTHING.Graphics are basically the same, and server lag is so unbelievably bad i can't play with 3 friends againts bots withouth massive lag..... i can play Forged Alliance Forever, a comunity server, with no lag and +400 units, and i can't play a game from 1998 withouth constant freezes -> ARE YOU KIDING ME?And then, its the ""where is the inovation?"" -> where is the unit selection? new unit organization? strategic zoom? being able to put a barracks or archery range on infinte unit production? build or selection queues? And don't give me the ""the game is already perfect, so it should stay like this"". NO, it was perfect in 1998, now it needed some improvments, not to the core game, but with making it more fun and with less busy workThey are charging 20 dollars for a copy paste game from 1998 but with s**t servers. And for that it gets thumbs down			"

												Key Highlights:Re-mastered for high resolution displays 1080p+ Enhanced visual engine with improved terrain textures, water, fire and ambient lighting effects****************************************************************************************************Age of Empires II HD Edition is nothing but a money grab, targeting people like me and you who enjoyed this game as kids, saying the game has ""improved"" and charging $20 for it.Because for many different reasons I'm disappointed with AoE II HD and I dont recommend if you're looking into a really improved AoE II especially if youre into historical/cultural accuracy, except for some graphical upgrades!I remember playing AoE & AoE II as a kid, and still have the original Discs with original covers, theyre great games and fun, but I wouldnt say the same thing for AoE II HD Edition, because I dont really see improvements to justify the $20 bucks.First of all, there are many different nations to play but many of them STILL share the same 3D models! Same buildings, structures, units even though they are different nations and had different architecture and style.Developers didn't bother to create new 3D-models and improve the game (As they wrote in key features), instead they slightly upgraded the engine and the graphics.I've asked them about these issues, they responded and told it's not going to be easy to create new 3D-models as it requires skill, time and a lot of cash. But in my opinion if Modders are able to create their own models and import them into the game it should be a piece of cake for developers to do that, and if they cant do that Im sorry but they should look for a new job.I was hoping for improvements over the original ones but sadly those flaws are still there, and its very annoying for this age, Byzantine Empire monastery is actually a mosque (This is unforgivable), then Ottomans have the ability to recruit Chivaliers (SERIOUSLY?)These are just 2 examples, there are dozens of and many other flaws such as Multiplayer problems.I also note that its not something really ""HD"" other than Widescreen support and slightly upgraded graphics.Original Age of Empires & Age of Empires II sure are great games, I enjoy them myself but I dont recommend the HD edition unless you really want to bring some nostalgia and dont have the original discs and dont mind to throw $20 on it.I will edit this review and write more about this game later on, thats all for now.

												A HD revival of the classic Real-Time Strategy game Age of Empires II: Age of Kings and it's expansion The Conquerors. Originally released 14 years ago during the golden age of Microsoft Game Studios with classics such as Halo, Rise of Nations, Dungeon Siege, Fable etc. Age of Empires II might be the most acclaimed RTS game of all time, with exceptions of maybe Starcraft and Warcraft due to the importance they had in the competetive scene compared to Age of Empires. Age of Empires never were a real successful tournament title but there has always been small communities surviving throughout the years.The original game is still available in some Retail stores as ""classic"" branded title, often as a third-party release. I bought a DVD copy a few years ago just for the sake of nostalgia, it featured both the 1997 original Age of Empires and the sequel for 9,99€. Yet I instant-purchased AOE2HD when it arrived on Steam. I would've bought it even if it costed me 29,99€ for the sake of getting it on Steam with workshop support, achievements and higher resolutions.The HD version does not include Any high-definition textures or effects, as one might expect. The game is rather a High resolution edition, supporting up to multi-monitor resolutions, not that it's recommended on a Strategy game, but still neat. Some people argue that the price is too high and the title is false marketing since the game does not feature any HD changes to the textures. Combine that with the amount of issues some people had upon relaese - and you get quite a few disappointed customers.This game introduced me to Video Games, Age of Empires (1997) was the first game I ever played, at least that's what I remember. The sequel did play an even bigger role throughout my childhood and even up to this date. A supreme LAN title to play with your friends or on your High-schools computer's. No doubt this is the game I have played the most ever. Which does say quite a lot, I regularly return to play some Single or Multiplayer.Age of Empires II HD recently recieved it's first expansion - The Forgotten. Which adds 5 new Civilizations, 4 new campaigns, a bunch of more units and upgrades, new custom maps and settings. This is probably what fans wanted with the original HD release, since the expansion costs 9,99€ alone. I am still extremely excited for new official content after such a long time!If you do not have a personal connection to this game then I suggest checking out some videos and maybe look out for a sale. If I were to install the game from my DVD and gotten the fan created high-res support as well as server hosting service (Voobly, GameRanger), then if I would've tried to play online - I would have gotten my♥♥♥♥♥kicked. This revival resulted in a lot of beginners started playing this game again, which is a very good thing. I get to kick some♥♥♥♥♥without being a total ""AOE2 Master"". We've seen a lot of classics being revived lately, and I hope publishers and devlopers realise what kind of money a person is ready to spend just to feel like a kid again.Like Real Time Strategy and don't mind a few dated looks? This game suits you like a glove. Maybe you just want it for the nostalgia? "

												Worse developers ever to have seen and experienced their work. What's even worse is why it had to be this game that they had to screw up..From the very beginning, it started to smell of poor management. Milking the system having no clue what to do, working for Microsoft...This game was released in 1999 originally, lets remember that. Now it's released 2013 April and already introduced new bugs. Fair enough, s*** happens and we just have to wait for a fix, but nope, that doesn't come to months later, even when it's game breaking like an ""Out of Sync"" error in pretty much 1 in 2 games and sometimes constantly in a row.There was no beta testing, no alpha, not even a sale, the price was £20.00 for a game that was released and rereleased with no care at all on how much people actually take this game seriously and how much people focused on the little things.Even now, they release patches that breaks the game, which could have been easily noticed if they had a proper beta testing method. The forums is no help to the community other than random crap you would expect from a game expected to be FINISHED.It can't get any worse, we assume, but that I can't confirm, as I thought that last year.. Slowly things are being resolved as time goes by, but no credits are warrented in my opinion, given anybody can do anything in 100 years.I recommend this game, because it's my favourite game of all time, but under control of crappy people. If I had enough money to buy them out, I would and make Age of Empires truely the epic it should be.			"

												Doesn't matter if you made the water look pretty or added workshop support. It's still a game from 1999, it's nearing its 20th birhtday, give it a rest, put it out of its misery.A common thing ""back then"" was to release a game that reached an old age as freeware/open source, so the eager community can expand its number of fanatical worshippers, work on further modding and all the good stuff, today?Today you shamelessly take a game thats rattling its bones on the deathbed, and release it in SUPER MODERN HD VERSION™. Its bones are screeching, its whining, ""free me from the pain!"" is what the game is shouting at them, ""end it all!"", but the devs put on their best business smile and put the game out onto steam with a 20$ price tag.20$ price tag! For a game thats 17 years old (as of 2016)! And the ""expansions"" which are 10$ each amount to 20$ extra, if you want the full experience you have to gash out 40 grand.The game didn't cost that much when it came out, and with steam you don't have the excuse of printing disks, shelf space, or included collectibles. It's a disgusting business practice, and you idiots eat it up! Game after game, everything windows releases in a badly running HD version, you get and pay them mad cash, admit it, they've had you!Same with the homm 3 remake, and any other HD remake, ""oldschool fans"" will pay exorbitant fees to rent (steam is a renting service, read the EULA next time) a game from their childhood, and leave raving positive reviews about how fun the game is, and make it reach a 90% positive rating on steam, despite being decrepit and barely working.Industry crash when?

The game is slow and very repetitive - in the economic matter of speaking : collecting food, wood, gold, recruit repeat - but it does its job, entertains you for hours. As the most potential feature I consider multiplayer, playing with real life opponents makes everything more interesting and harder than with AI.7/10			"

												Age of Empires was a great game, but this might be one of the worst updates I've ever seen.  The menus look like they were upscaled from the original by a guy who was told he only had 5 minutes.  The interface is tiny with no ability to customize.  The units hard to find, hard to control, and, stunningly, the interface still runs slow at that!  Trying to drag a box around some units is CHOPPY!  In a 15 year old game!If you *love* AoE 2 and just want to play it on Steam, then this is a fine purchase.  But if you want *anything* else, this is pretty damn weak.			"

												Age of Empires series was supposed to be the best series around - as I've read through many and many reviews. Many people recommended this game and when I saw it on sale I gave it a shot.Basically, this game is like European Wars : Cossacks. Old style RTS.The only downside to this Age of Empires 3 versus the second is the way you can choose formations in the second. It felt overall the second had more to control whereas the third sort of simplified things and tried to make the game easier and smoother. AoE 2 is your typical RPG, offering peasants (or settlers), militias, markets, church's, walls and gates to protect your city. I really can't see all the hype about this game to be truthful as everyone says. Yes the campaign stories are good, but I find that this game doesn't really set itself apart from other RTS's.If I had a choice between playing European Wars : Cossacks or this - I would most likely choose EW : Cossacks. Not to say that this game is bad, but the options that are given in EW far outweigh those of AoE for me.I would give it an 8 if it had something to differentiate itself from other RTS of it's class, butRATING : 7.3/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability B- Overall  B- "

												Firstly it is a great thing seeing one of my favourite RTS games appearing on steam, as it has given rebirth to AOE2 after many years. Though I first played this game when I was 12 yrs old i.e some 4-5 years back(not a long time). Though I don't have many play hours on my steam account but I can say with a 100% guarantee that I've played this game for more than 500+ hours with the old disc version. Secondly, as the title says ""Age of Empires II:The HD Edition"", I will only say that its no worth buying if you're buying it for some improved graphics as it has only some minor(0.01%) graphics change(or say texture change) only on reflections of water and the colour of cliffs. Other than that its just the old AOE2. But the good thing is that it has multiplayer which is no dead and you can easily find a decent amount of people playing online.In short here are the pros & cons of this version of game-PROS-1.Multiplayer reborned2.Buy this if want to remember some good old memories of this game(having it on steam)3.For new players I would say you should try playing this best classic RTS game if you want to.4.Some minor changes like-   -Select more than 40 units in a row(not sure how much, maybe 50 or 60)   -Supports a maximum of 500 population limit in standard game mode.CONS-1.Don't buy if you're concerned only with the HD graphics.2.Its no remastered edition, its just an old AOE2 with steam workshop and steam trading cards available. But yes it has multiplayer to play.I really don't mind its graphics as I am fine with its old retro style graphics. But they should have improved its graphics as it says ""HD Edition"" which it is not :CFinally, I'm happy that it is on steam, and also the developers are releasing new contents for this game.			"

												Although this game came out many years ago, i have to say that this is one of the best, if not the best RTS games out there!The in depth upgrade routes and the way you advance throught the ages completes a very gripping game that does not get old for a long time!The different countries and troops that can be created is mostly unique to each faction which gives this game a gem that is no longer hidden.There are some bugs in this game, but these bugs do not affect the gameplay much at all.I know my steam profile only has a few hours on its list, but i had this game on disc back in the day and that is where 99.999% of my hours come from.I give this game a 8.5/10			"

												I care not of the changes (or, lack thereof according to the majority) from the original Age of Empires II, for I enjoy playing one of my favourite games (from when I was younger) in high-definition. Its existence on Steam makes playing with friends far easier. The only real downside to the game (not the HD edition excusively but rather Age of Empires II itself), I feel, is that the leap in AI difficulty from standard to moderate is ridiculous and rather overwhelming for players whose skill levels aren't exactly top-notch; standard is too easy whilst moderate is often rather difficult. With that being said, once you refine your skills, you will get the hang of the moderate AI. If you are a fan of Real-Time-Strategy games, I would recommend that you purchase this.			"

												When Microsoft re-released Age Of Empires II as the HD Edition, I can't tell you how excited I was. With widescreen support, updated graphics and interfaces, multiplayer and workshop support, this classic game that I binge-played as a kid just got even better. I've deposited countless hours into this game growing up and played local-multiplayer with my sister every day. In later years we used GameRanger to play multiplayer verses other players, even though it wasn't super ideal. In my opinion, Age Of Empires is one of the greatest RTS games to date... even though I play very few RTS games, the ones I have played pale in comparison. AOE II has a deep upgrading and leveling system per game and a very large varity of tribes to choose from, each offering their own special units. You can play on a variety of maps and gamemodes, including ones you can create in the map editor. This is where the Steam workship really comes into play, easily being able to download custom maps in minutes. The map editor itself is something I could talk about for a long time because it is so advanced. I'll keep it short though and say that under it's surface are the options to create detailed and custom campaign scenarios or maps with custom triggers and plenty of props. If you have the time to invest into the map editor, there are no limites to what you can create.Age Of Empires II holds up really well for being 15 years old, and if you love any kind of RTS game, Age Of Empires II HD without a doubt should be in your collection. The new expansion packs they added is also a must have, adding new features, maps, and units while keeping it true to the origonal game.			"

												I have nearly 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews.One Hour Reviews - Game 2Age of Empires II HDPurchase Date: 6/13/2015Unlike most of my Steam games that I haven't played, this one I just picked up in the most recent summer sale.  I played the original Age of Empires II way back in the day, but I didn't remember a lot of specifics.  Generally I am not a fan of real time strategy games, but I remembered actually liking this one, so I decided to pick up this new version on sale.An hour doesn't get you very far in an RTS game.   You can have multiplayer matches go longer than that.  But I spent my hour going through the tutorial, which does a good job getting you up to speed on things.  If you've played an RTS game before, then the concepts introduced in the tutorial will be very familar.    It's all about harvesting resources to enable you to build buildings which let you train different units so you can attack and defend.Because this is an older game (albeit an updated version of one), it's missing a few things that you'd expect from more modern games.  For one, you can't change the resolution of the game.  You can run full screen or windowed mode.   You also can't zoom in or out of your map.  I kept wanting to use my mousewheel to scroll, but this game predated the use of scrollwheels in games.   The one thing that really stuck out as annoying was the placement of the icons at the top of the screen, which are for various menu options.  The problem is the icons are rather small, and also when you move your mouse to the top of the screen, it will scroll the map up.  It' nearly impossible to click a menu option without also making the map scroll.The tutorial was pretty fun, and does a good job of easing you into the game without overwhelming you at first.From what I can tell, the HD version of this game actually changes very little.  The graphics and textures look the same.  I think this was more about making the game playable on newer machines with widescreen resolutions.  Also it adds Steam Workshop support which is a nice bonus (although my one hour in the game didn't include anything to do with the workshop).I can see where some might be turned off by the lack of updates here.  But I would argue there is something to be said for keeping the game as it is, warts and all.   This isn't intended to be Age Of Empires IV, so I don't think it should be judged as such.Overall Recommendation: Keep   "

												Just the same great game I remember, but looks a little bit better. If you liked AoE II years ago, there's no doubt, then, that you'll like this as well. My only quip, though. is that the multiplayer is extremely laggy with more than a few people to the point that it's unplayable at times. Otherwise, the single player is extraordinary and alone is worth the price.			"

												As an owner of the original disks, I love this version. Runs seamlessly on Windows 7, virtually no load/buffer times during the campaign (random maps compile quickly), and looks so clear and perfect (old one works, but it requires tweaks in 7 to run). It is the original game with the Conquerors expansion; Forgotten is a whole new bit of content.You'll lose yourself on random map plays, playing against as many as 7 other players (whether AI or live) to forge alliances, rivalries, and battle to the last man standing or to be the most successful.It's simple strategy games like this that you can truly enjoy and is up there on my list with Civ V, Crusader Kings II, Europa Universalis IV, and Warcraft III as just another game I can sit down and play for hours.

												Age of Empires II was certainly my favorite game back in the days. Incredibly well made, engaging and educational! And now it got a much needed HD update. Indeed, an update worthy of the game itself. The title screen had an almost hypnotic nostalgia effect on me; I just sat there for a minute or two listening to the music and admiring the details that have aged so well. The seamless transition to HD quality was without a doubt perfectly executed. The game hasn't lost any of its original charm and after a few moments it feels right at home. What's more, I particularly enjoyed the new music that seemed to fit in so well with the gameplay, adding this much needed dramatic effect. Although I played only the first mission of Barbarossa, I found it immensely entertaining. The amount of user-generated content for this game is bewildering, in a good way. Hundreds of achievements, Steam powered lobbies and future official content to come, what more could one ask for? I couldn't think of any game more worthy of such revivification.			"

MORE THAN WORTH IT.If you've ever played this game before, years ago, then you already know how amazing this game is already.And guess what? They've made tweaks to make it even better. Yup.I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RTS games, and if you've never played an RTS game, how does creating an empire and conquering your enemies sound?Endless hours of gameplay are available for even single player alone, and even more hours with LAN or even playing online.The gameplay is pretty simple to learn how to use and play but the tactics go very deep and it can take quite a while to become a master at this game.This is 5 bucks you won't ever regret.10/10.

												HD Edition has enormous potential. The base game is still enjoyable and visually attractive (excepting the units that were never beautiful), and you can smoothly download content from the Steam Workshop. However, the HD edition fails to improve on the original's gameplay in any way, and numerous bugs mar what should be an excellent multiplayer experience. Hopefully, Hidden Path will eventually fix the problems so that epic eight-player matches with hundreds of units on each side can entertain strategy fans until our civilization, like ancient Rome, falls and fades into the annals of history.Multiplayer is a buggy, broken mess :(			"

												這Age Of Empire遊戲是我第一個我玩的電腦遊戲。還記得是我還在念小學四年級時，我父親買給我第一加電腦。哪時候的電腦超及昂貴。應為功課須用電腦，我爸逼不得已不買給我。還好哪時的OS是WINDOWS98。那OS cd剛好有己個遊戲。讓我影像最深刻的是AGE OF EMPIRE RISE OF ROME TRAIL EDITION.我每當放學都會到我的書房玩個不停。後來當我上中學第一年age of empire 2 age of king 就出了。當時後的我都聽到這消息，口都打的太大，我用我的零用金來買 age of empire 2.當我試玩時畫面果然改進很多。個各國家的人都說自己語言。哪是的我都似乎天天沉迷在age of empire 2世界。可說我玩個不停。我玩阿玩玩了好己年，連我的ps2手柄都放在一邊等發梅了。然而，age of empire 2有出star wars 的mod.我就直接安裝。THIS game feels old but the nostalgia is still there.i remind me of my past self 19years ago since i play the first age of empire on my first pc.and yes if you said what my fav RTS.i will only pick AOE1,2,3 than starcraft.even though the game logic and the history in game are inacurate.i still find joy in playing this game.although i miss the aoe 1 priest that chant WOLOLO!!!!!!!THAT HAS BEEN STUCK IN MY HEAD FOREVER. 這遊戲是很值得買如果你玩過AOE系列。			"

YouTube™ Video: Age Of Empires 2 HD Edition - Review 

			Views: 185		

			My views on the new version of Age of Empires II for steam. This is my first review video. I hope you like it. If you do, please leave a like and if it isn't too much of a bother some feedback.		

Both are the same. Text below.What is age of empires?Age of empires is a classic real time stragery game. In Age of empires you are the wel.. hmmi think you are the king of a little kingdom. You always start of with three or four villagers and one scoutYour main goal is to defeat the enemy king which also has a village somewhere out there on the mapYou'll need to issue orders to your villagers and get them to work, villagers gather resourcessuch as stone, wood, gold and foodYou don't need to literally feed your people, but if you wish to recruit more villagers you will need tospend a one time payment to start the creation of a villager which will then be recruited.As you gather supplies you will become able to build various buildings such as the barracks, archery rangeand stable. All the buildings require a certain amount of supplies in order for you to build themfor your kingdom.which are all used to recruit a certain type of unit. The blacksmith is in turn used to upgradevarious aspects of your units such as armor, line of sight and firing range.As you play you develop your own village or perhaps should i say kingdom. You will become powerful andeventually lose or win the game by defeating the enemy king or getting defeated by the enemy king.Once you have acquired a good base of supplies you may head over to your town center and advance to the next age.Once you advanced to the next age, new buildings will be unlocked.It might seem easy but it definitely is not. The ai is what i call the typical AI. The first moment it stands idly by,while it attacks with everything and everyone a moment later. Even though the AOE II HD development teamworked on the AI i still find the AI rather vanilla with it's behaviour not greatly enhanced.I did notice that the AI actually sends siege weapons in and archers for targets that infantry can't reachbut the AI has a habit of sending it's unit's one by one to their death.You can age-up a couple of times. You start at the foot age and then age up to the feadul age. After the feudal age comes the castle age and the last age would be the imperial age.Everytime you wish to age-up you will need to possess a certain amount of goodsto pay your age-up with. Once you reach the castle age you will unlock siege weapons which couldbe essential for takingdown castle's and other fortified buildings.and we've got a perfect example right here right now. As you can see the AI has various units just standingthere doing nothing.They are literally waiting to get attacked or for an enemy to get close enough to them.It usually takes a while for the AI to actually start attacking you, but when it does it does attack you good.As you could have guessed, i do am playing on the easyest difficulty right now.civilizations and upgradesAs you play you unlock new upgrades everytime your civilization advanced age.Once you build the proper building, let's say a library.. many new upgrades will be unlocked and made available for researchYou could for example then research stronger armor, sharper arrow, longer range, faster units andnew attach methods etc.At the end of the game you will still be able to view the good old timeline. Showing the stats of all players who participatedin the game. You can view military stats, economy stats, technology stats the society stats and of course the general timeline.There are various civilizations a player can pick to play as.Each civilization got it's own bonus. Be it cheaper units, faster unit recruitment, unique buildings and so on..what is new?The game has been released again under the name of age of empires 2 HD.However, there hasn't honestly been anything new despite the steam workshop and the steam multiplayer function.The textures do look indeed much sharper than they used to do.But then again they still exist out of visible pixels.The expansion pack they brought really didn't bring much to the game and is to be more of a mod.Luckily there are active members in the steam community wish dedicate their time working on mods and new content.There do is some new fancy music which i actually liked instantly. It literally settles the mood properly and brought me backinto the good old age of empires II atmosphere.There also are a couple of achievement a player could earn for defeating players and acquiring certain achievement.But other than that? No, there isn't much new.Steam workshop integrationOne of the amazing things the developers added is the steam workshop integration.This allows steam users to access new content such as textures but also new or additional units!And if you are creative, you may contribute to the community yourself.I find this a very good new addition myself, this way the AOE developers no longer need to release new content for the game.Now, the community could do it for them!multiplayerit is amazing that you can now play age of empires ii online and on steam without having to port forward your router.But it still got it's flaws. Even though you're using a network and are no longer usingtelephone line to play multiplayer the game still suffers from constant performance dropsand internet delays which only occur at multiplayer games.Final verdictThe game is good, it is still good. It's lovely how the online option and steam workshop was added. That surely brings thegame back to life.However, the game itself hasn't changed. So if you're planning to purchase the game again for the single-player whilst having it on an old disk somewherethen do not purchase it, the game is the same. It's the online and workshop you should purchase the game for.			"

												Age of Empires II was and still is one of the greatest RTS titles of all time, known for it's fast-paced, macro-oriented but still very micro-intensive gameplay. The HD version has left the core game untouched, only boosting the graphics, improving networking, adding matchmaking and enabling steam workshop support. In one way this is great because it stays true to the original game for nostalgic value and so professional/competitive players won't shun the game for being ""casualized"" or ruined for minor changes. On the other hand this is a huge amount of lost potential. To be perfectly honest, Age of Empires II was a very flawed title - I mean don't get me wrong, I love the game and it was amazing when it first came out... but it hasn't aged as well as it could have. No pun intended.I still think the game is incredible and well worth the purchase, but I would have liked to see them do more than just port the game over. A more advanced map editor, better mod support, more interface options, more potential. All things that don't really affect the 'competitive' scene but give the rest of the audience (probably 99%+ of players) something to play around with. The original AoE 2 gets my full 10 out of 10 score, but this 'HD' version is just a sloppy port.$20 is a little steep to re-purchase a game that came out in '99, but hey, if you love the series then I guess it's worth it. Original Game: A+, timeless classicHD Remake: C-, could have been better			"

												I highly recommend this game to my friends. This is a classic, technically perfect strategy game as far as I'm concerned. I've been playing this game since it came out as released by Microsoft in the 90's. What's fun about it?-Historical perspective on races in a RTS game-Historical battles-Great look to the graphics-Works very well on low-end systems-Economy is fun to manage-Micro and macro contorl are easy and fun to manage-Good variety of different strengths to the various races-Story mode is fun-Just playing agains the computer AI is fun-Very easily customizable			"

												AOE2 HD is just like the beloved original, with the only diffrence lying in 'steam workshop' support, better functionality on modern operating systems and much smoother menu transistions and multiplayer support.Pros: Just like the Original        Steam the return of old school Aoe2 online gameplay        Workshop allows users to share mods and maps in an easier way then before.Cons: Most of the shortcommings of the original game are still present, e.g bad villager pathfinding.         Graphically, the game is identical with the exception of '3D water', new flame and cliff sprites, therefore not a true HD remake (However their are many texture packs on the workshop which rectifies this)         For what is esentially a 'get this game running better on modern operating systems', the game is fairly expensive at 27euro with its expansion pack (Which was also a free mod). Alternatives to this exist as freeware in the form of ports such as Voobly.        No Manual way of changing resolution        Steam overlay often bugs during the stats screen and after a game in the main menu.Despite all of this, it is still the Aoe we all know and love, with some modern conveniences. So, yes I would definatly recommend this game to anyone remotely intrested in true RTS gaming, in a world were old school RTS games are ridicilously difficult to find.RATING: 68/100 (Good)Most of that mark is because it is AOE2 with multiplayer that actually works. However the lazy nature of this 'HD Remake' must be taken into consideration to anyone wishing to purchase it. Value for money is not very high, at 27 euro one can purchase other Remakes such as RIse of the triad or Serious sam HD, but at the same time Aoe2 fans like myself are not likely to turn down this offer.EDIT 2016:Much of what I said earlier still stands however the state of the game is much more polished and the addition of the expansions as well as the balancing accompanying them have made it a far more enjoyable experience, at least to me. Stability has increased dramitically with it being able to run at an uncapped FPS without issues.If I were to give it an ambigious rating, it would increase to around 75 as really the easy of access and the community they have created here is well worth the price of admission.

												First of all:  this game isn't all that different from the original version.The units and textures are mostly the same the original game (although to be fair, where they have been changed - cliffs, farms, resource icons - people have complained bitterly - so much in fact, that the new farms were reverted back to the original farms).Time to update my review somewhat:In the mean time, two expansions have been released and brought fresh civilizations, maps and techs to the game.  Both are definitely worth getting.  The game is still recieving developer attention, although progress has been addmittedly very slow and patchy.  Neverthless, things are slowly moving in the right direction; bugs are gradually being fixed and in general the experience is improving.  It's certainly playable at the moment although plenty of people whine in the Forums about all kinds of diverse issues.So, in conclusion:If you liked the original Age of Empires II, you are in for the same experience here, except that the game is now once again being supported by Microsoft.  It is not a modern game with fancy graphics, it is an old classic that been reinvigorated with new life.The standard price for the game seems rather steep to me, so I would definitely recommend waiting for a sale to get it.

												I have been playing Age of Empires 2: The Age of Kings and Age of Empires 2: The Conquerors off and on since 2004. When this HD version was released I had to get this masterpiece of a game. This game is my all-time favorite RTS game a long with Empire Earth and Stronghold Crusader!! Buy this game- can spend tons of hours in this game! I also recommend The Forgotten DLC- it adds new civs to this game and also has 4 new campaigns which are pretty fun so far. Highly recommendNot to mention have put over 300+ hours into this game when I first started playing this back in 2004. This game is without a doubt my all-time favorite game!!!Also, let me say that I bought both the Age of Empires 2: The Age of Kings and The Conquerors on disk and it was so good that I bought it again on Steam! In my opinion, this is the best RTS game ever made. Amazing game!!!!!			"

												AOE2 is one of the kings of Real Time Strategy. A game with knights on horseback, the building of an empire, and the premise of total conquest by any means necessary. A game that dispenses with the idea of morality, and breeds competition through complete annihilation.AOE2's reputation speaks for itself. Prior to this re-release it was still immensly popular online in Europe. While I do wish Microsoft re-released AOE1 first, as I played that game more frequently. AOE 2 is still an incredible RTS, especially with the vast amount of user created content for it. This re-release also runs in higher resolutions and comes with the Conquerer's expansion pack.Really when you can find it for a good price I cannot recommend this game more. RTS games are few and far between, and this game truly does give titans like Starcraft a run for it's money.			"

												Age of Empires II HD is a 2013 High Definition remake of the classic real-time strategy game, Age of Empires II released in 1999. The original game remains intact and is still alot of fun to play; However, with this new HD Edition, you can also play with user-generated content through the Steam workshop and on Steam servers. The HD Edition of AoE2 also comes with, The Conquerors expansion, and features multiplayer the same as the original version.Overall, I think they did a pretty good job of resurrecting a classic. I have fond memories of playing AoE2 for hours both through the varying single player modes as well as through multiplayer. It is nice to polished up a little and making the rounds for newer gamers who didn't have the pleasure of playing the original.			"

												Age of Empires II HD is a remake of the original Age of Empires II (because number 3 was god awful) in this intense base building game you enjoy a peaceful expansion against easy AI and the but utterly crushed by a moderate difficulty AI. Then, after hours and hours of slogging through games maybe you'll take on a super hard AI, maybe. As well as that you can enjoy one of this game's million campaigns, because doing three of four wasn't enough. But then again, doesn't everyone want to play as Vlad the Impaler and fight Romanian Tribesmen.But, it is the multiplayer that really kicks the♥♥♥♥♥♥bucket. If perhaps you're just looking for a nice, easy game full of teamwork and such then you'll be horribly disappointed. Watch as your Levy Pikemen are utterly slaughtered by hoards of Paladins, scream in terror as your walls are torn down by Vikings, or just scream with a hint of insanity as your men are turned against by men in dresses with sticks.If you happen to be the guy with the Paladins, the Vikings or the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Priests, well done!

												Beautiful, beautiful <3Enough can not be said about Age of Empires, but everyone who had their share of experience with this franchise will know. Never played the game, you say? Well then, don't wait for anything, buy it!Been playing AoE2 since like 2000 and it's still brilliant. The HD edition brought much refreshment for the game, with better graphics, native HD resolution and multi display support. What's the kickass for a casual player though, is the Multiplayer and Steam Workshop. Multiplayer is now ran through Steam, which eliminates all the trouble we've had since ES shut down.If you're deciding on buying, i can't do better than encourage you and wish you good luck in the next hundreds of hours of wonderful and for some of you nostalgic gameplay.

												I bought this game because I enjoted the Original game as a kid, it's nice having this on steam for old time sakes. The game isn't that much different from the orginal, though personally i feel it is a little laggy at times, but maybe that is due to the increased unit size.I just bought 'The Forgotten Expansion'. I must say The DLC to this game 'The Forgotten Expansion' feels more like a mod that I have payed for rather then a real expanshion, when startiing a mission there is no voice audo like the original games, just simply text. I would recomend skipping the add-on, and just downloading something simmilar from the steam workshop.			"

												This.This is a game you need.How do I even begin to recommend this? Do I tell you it's the best single-player RTS of all time? That, when combining campaign and skirmish, it's got some of the best single-player value for the money ever? That it's just... it's a reminder of the great games you used to play as a kid? That this will be one of the five best games you ever have in your Steam collection? That the mod scene for the game's exploding? That the new expansion pack, The Forgotten, and tweaks to the core have made it a better game than ever before?This is Age of Empires II. It was the greatest RTS of all time, at least as far as single-player games go. And now, with the HD rerelease, it's even better.Only minor gripe, campaign feels a bit unbalanced. Really, really brutal. But, then, I'm not very good at the multitasking required to be the best at RTSes. I've cheated in a couple of missions, to avoid being completely overrun. But that's just me. I suck. It's a great game, with great value for the money.If you buy this, you'll find that your money and time were well spent, and honestly, what more could you want out of a game?What are you waiting for? Start the game already!			"

												Update 20 Nov.This game is simply not a final product despite being years after initial release.Today single player hung near end of game, at least whole computer didnt crash this time.Even little things like user/player  name  doesnt show on start screen. Choose a new player but when creating game paramters in standard game the selected user name doesnt show. A small thing but maybe indicative of lack of polish this game lacks. Why  do I still play? I didnt buy this for myself, bought to player with others but sadly cannot.All I really want is what I thought I paid for ... a functional game.Dont see how this game got so many positive reviews.****************************************************************************************************Update 18 NovSingle player, game crashed in midplay..... screen black this time not BSOD, but must remove power wait and reboot, 3rd reboot and I got back up. Windows says error, but no restore.When will it crash again?  Computer didnt start crashing until installed this app, and only crashes during or immediately after an in game crash and reboot.******************************************************************************************************************Update 17 Nov 2015After Hotfix tried multiplayer a bit better but still laggy..... but then in midplay (no other apps running) BSOD  Windows (Blue Screen of Death) couldnt restart computer tried several times, unplug monitor and computer, now Windows want to restore to restore point.Modified my review here a minute later BSOD again restart and another BSOD this is ridiculous!Had to retype this review! Use at own risk!No LAN version either, must use via internet booooooo! ********************************************************************************************************************Loved the old version, but for my capable machine, even running with nothing loaded from the workshop it crashes.Appears to be hardware/system dependant, a survey would be interesting, but on my Win32, Phenom 2 X4 965 and Nvidia 9600GT, the multiplayer is unplayable, 1-2 second delays after issuing commands.I loved the old version, looks like I have to continue using the old version even tho I have 2 copies of the new HD and its extended content; the Forgotten....... irritating.Difficult to assess these reviews it terms of how well the product will perform for you..... Overall: the game concept is great the execution good to unplayable depending on your system.			"

												HD? I'm kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off, I bought recently a MBP Retina Display, so I though it was a good idea to get Windows 8 and then AOE2HD cause the trailer announced the multiple displays support and since the name got a big HD on it I though (I was wrong) that my new display would take the best from it, but it doesn't, I couldn't even play cause everything on the games looks so small and even trying to low the resolution from windows  (Cause there is no option inside the game to change reolution (WTF! I know)) can't help me cause the only thing that change from resolution are the annoying mouse pointer, so now I got a big hand covering my tinny workers, I really want my money back.			"

												A timeless classic, butchered by incompetence. You would imagine a re-release would warrant at least a stable release, but the game is anything but. Even two-player multiplayer games slow the game down to tectonic plate speed, with no patch or even a community fix in sight. It's highly likely that the game has been abandoned by Hidden Path, either out of indifference or ineptitude to fix the jarring problems with this 'HD Edition', which brings only stretched out user interface to the table, but offer less frames per second than the original '98 version of the game.Saddens me to see the old classics dug out from their graves like this, and hocked off unfinished products bearing familiar titles to unwary consumers in hope for a quick buck.

												The campaigns no longer work properly; the COMPUTER DOES NOT BUILD UNITS. The computer only uses the existing units, then sits there and does nothing for the rest of the game. I know for a fact that this was not the case in the original Age of Empires II,  I put in my old CD and checked. In addition the new campaigns in the ""Forgotten expansion"" have NO VOICED NARRATION. The well-acted voiceovers at the beginning and ends of campaigns are what made the old game so great. The new campaigns are text narration only.			"

												The FPS regularly sinks, on modern systems. For a 2000 game. I'll let that sink in.The pathfinding appears to be more or just as broken as the originial title. The game is highly unstable.The new effects they added are badly tacked on and look worse than what they replace. The cliffs look out of place, the flammes look like a slow detached blingee gif added on top the building, the farms and ressource icons look like crap.Do not buy the expansions as they are not expansions, they are MODS. MODS that you PAY for. They were made by young high school/college modders (this is no joke) and scream amateurish for every content introduced. The material stands out from the original assets like a stain on a white napkin. The slav building set has a lower resolution than the rest of the game, looks unfinished and the colors are way off the game's general scheme. Most of the new units added were ripped from old mods or AoE2's original beta units. The forgotten campaigns are a succession of very narrow corridors (A nightmare with the armies you control), on immense maps clogged with buildings and decorations. The modder who made them seems to be suffering from the same affliction as George Lucas which prevents the both of them from realizing when overdesigning is ''too much''. There is no voice acting obviously, thank god for that considering the walls of texts thrown at our faces were apparently written by someone struggling with the English language (of course they're also amateurish and cheesy beyond the simple vocabulary and spelling mistakes). The triggers can be downright tedious, like having to click back and forth between two characters just to trigger each lines of a pointlessly long dialogue, and are apparently so elobaborate they can cease working altogether.Even small details like the new pictures for the civilizations in the history section, or especially the unit voices, stand out for their low quality. You are left to wonder if the material used for most of these voice recordings amounted to more than an in built laptop mic and the work outsourced to a random Peruvian, Hungarian, Russian, and Italian fan respectively. Considering this 'expansion' was made by amateurs in the first place, would that be surprising? (Read on how they were produced in the original 1999 game, it's amasing that they went their way to hire Mongolian throat singers for the Huns/Mongols voices).The new expansion, AFRICAN KINGDOMS, suffers the same, just to a lesser extent. The content still stands out for its low quality. The new building set for Africans looks a bit better than the slav one, and they had the sense to give the Italian building set to the Portugese. The campaigns are still inferior to the original ones but not as bad as the Forgotten. Not as over designed, they have some very bad voice acting but at least there's less lines to read from (you can spot mic distortions which obviously indicate some sort of cheap USB mic in someone's bedroom was used, again). You often walk accross gigantic maps, tediously eliminating one small group of enemy after another. Age of Empires 2 is not Warcraft and was never meant to play like an adventure tactical game, especially not on amateurish maps.And this is about all you can say about the HD edition. There is virtually no other content to review. On the plus side the new civilizations are somewhat balanced and play alright in multiplayer, some balance changes were introduced and are welcome for the competitive scene. Except there's virtually no HD competitive scene to speak of and the multiplayer is mostly dead. If you like Age of Empires 2 I recommend you acquire the old versions and go play on Gameranger or Voobly who have a thriving multiplayer scene. PS : If you're wondering about the Italian building set, they ripped it off from a very old mod, Rome at War. I don't even know if the original creators are aware that they are making a profit on their backs.			"

												Idle villager button doesn't work after the release of African Kingdoms. It is the best joke on AoC ever!Edit: I am aware the problem was fixed long ago. But the main problem of this game is having lots of issues like that and developers don't take them serious in long term.#It doesn't run on some old PCs which can run old version of the game#I like this game very much and have always been a supporter of Cysion about this project. But I also have to admit that had lots of problems when trying to play instead of old AoEII. I insisted a friend to buy this game on Steam when it was just released. But the game didn't work on his PC. I know, this happens very rare but it didn't run on a computer which can run old version very well. So, you can't play this game with an old graphich card.#FPS#FPS is lower than expected. I expected to play this game with Intel integrated graphics, but it's not fluent on high resolutions. Also, scroll system doesn't feel smooth like the old version, especially if FPS stays below 60s.#Game balance#Adding new civilizations and units very good improvement, but as long as they don't break the game balance. But I think nobody doesn't play The Forgotten seriously or (some of them) still not aware of it. It is really impossible to stand Italians with a cavalry civilization (like Persians). Or Incas' unique unit is really worthless. When these changes considered seriously you can see the unbalanced points easily.#Campaign videos (Narrated Stories)#I had really enjoyed while playing Age of Kings and Conquerors campaigns, expected same quality from Forgotten. Actually, scenerio designs very good, but why there is no narrated stories with a medieval soundtrack? This could be really done easily because texts are already implemented in the game. It seems they realised this lack and added to African Kingdoms, but I think Forgotten Empires also deserved that. To be honest, I was expecting that for a long time and it seems no chance for AoFE no longer.Conlusion: I like this time and still supporting the project and spending money for it. But I also have to admit that when I compare the changes and lacks of it, the lacks seem more than improvements.			"

												Definitely one of the best RTS games I know, and I couldn't be more pleased with the quality of this game. Both single-player and multi-player are quite enjoyable, and the scenarios are fun as well, and the DLC is also quite enjoyable. In addition to the fun game-play, I do also appreciate how this game has taught me a bit of history and language, which I always appreciate from games.The mod-library of the game is also nice, as the game has some fairly good mods/maps/scenarios that the players have created. The graphics packs and soundtrack mods are a nice touch, though the original qualities to the game are nice as well!So far, it's been one of my favorite games to play with friends, and it has been very re-playable as well. I couldn't recommend this game more!			"

												THE DEFINITIVE RTS GAME.One of the rare gems that truly encompasses everything there is to love in a game genre. See Skyrim for Sandbox RPGs, Mario Bros 3 for platformers, etc. I won't go into detail explaining the gameplay, but with 20+ civilizations to play with and against, you will never run out of combinations. GRAPHICS/MUSICThe music is catchy and will get stuck in your head quickly. Graphically, it's not necessarily ""HD"". Just looks sharper and more refined thatn the base game. Overall, pretty good, and you can easily tell what things are, make distinctions between teams, and identify PRECIOUS STONE HOLY CRAP WHY IS THERE NO STONE WHEN I NEED ITSTORYThe story mode is played out in single-player ""scenarios"" that document real events in world history. It's a very cool concept, but isn't as great as the multiplayer. MULTIPLAYERThis is where the game truly shines. Nothing beats getting a few buds together and playing Last Man Standing for ages.Honestly, it can't be put into words, you have to experience it for yourself.OVERALLGRAPHICS/MUSIC: 8STORY: 8MULTIPLYER: 10In conclusion, it's easily the best RTS I've ever played. I'm now realizing this was a REALLY half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥review that I might redo later. "

												I probably have thousands of hours spent on the original version of this game. Its defintely one of my favorite rts games. The game modes are all great, and if u dont like standard matches, u have multiplayer. If you dont like multiplayer, you can head into the map editor and create your own world, then battle it out however you like. The campaigns are also amazing. Seriously not a thing  wrong with this game.			"

												I'm really glad someone brought this classic back to life. I had so many hours of fun with it back in the day. Should you have played the original and would still like to get a taste of it once again, you'll be happy to know that they almost entirely left the game as it was back in the day, only this time with mod support, support for modern machines, and Steamworks integration for multiplayer! Even to this day this classic holds its own and I think you will find a lot of enjoyment out of it even now.			"

 Preface Age of Empires 2 has been a game that I have been playing since I was about 9. Don't let the low hours fool you, for I've had this game before it came to steam. This is a game that me and my brother bonded over when we were young. The emotional connection this game brings to me today when I play it with my friends is unforgetable. This review may be a little biased based on nostalgia. Audience If you are fan of RTS games or maybe even the slightest of one, please check out this game, it will be worth every cent. If you enjoy games where you have to manage your resources, this is the game for you.  Gameplay You have to build houses. Once you've built houses, build more. They are the very foundation of your town. More houses, more people. Anyway, The game starts with you in a random place on the map with very little viewing distance. You start with 3 villagers and are left to set them to do whatever you please. Tell one to go cut some trees so you can build more houses. One to collect berries to make more villagers. And one for gold so you can afford upgrades on your town center. These are the basics of this game. Collect resources, make more villagers, collect more resources. Now that you have an army of villagers, make a real army. Build a barracks and create troops. Collect Resources, build troops. And So on. Then send a few out and find the enemy base and attack. Thats pretty much it and it's alot more fun that you would think. With up to 8 player free for alls, it gets pretty heated pretty quickly. Verdict I love this game. This game is very good. I highly reccommend it. It's 3$ on sale right now, and it has trading cards aswell. I'd probably rate it a 9.5/10 Just for not having a super long campaign. However, the multiplayer will last forever.			"

												It really is amazing how this game got a second lease on life. Twitch integration, a graphical makeover, Workshop mod support, improved (albeit still kind of laggy) multiplayer, not to mention new expansion packs more than seventeen years after its initial release.It's a deserving game, too. Age of Empires II is a classic historical RTS with rock-solid, foundational gameplay. This re-release also boasts improved AI though, so it's even more of a challenge, albeit I wouldn't say it approaches Korean Starcraft-level speed. It won't run on computers that the original edition would function fine on due to the increased graphical load, unfortunately, but if you were planning on playing this game seriously you probably already have a good computer.If you feel like you can measure up, or if you just have nostalgia about leafing through the included encyclopedia of medieval life while desperately hacking your way through the campaigns, I'd absolutely recommend this.

Was the original game that got me into the idea of gaming on a computer. And well this title propably has a special place in my heart just because of that. They took the old game and cleaned up the graphics, gave AI an overhaul (while also leaving the old ai as an option for the genuine aoe 2 feel), and made multiplayer a thing again (beyond just LAN that is all that works in the old one anymore.).10/10 Love Age Of Empires, nothing wrong with this rewrite it's an upgrade all around.

												It's Age of Empires.  In HD.  If you enjoy RTS games even a little, you want this game.  If you haven't already played this game, you should play this game.  If you enjoy the concept of castles, you should buy this game.The game is a standard medieval RTS game, in that it was the defining factor back in 1999 as to what they would become.  It is extremely balanced after years of playing it and refining it.  The HD version enhances the game by offering wide screen options, newer hardware/OS support, steam integration, and new age balance changes.  Age of Empires II HD has received nothing but betterment on top of its amazing predecessor, the classic many grew up with and even more played.Age of Empires II HD and the new expansion, 14 years after the release of the game, are both must haves for any gaming collection.  10/10			"

												Not worth the purchase unless you are nostagic about the game. It is an amazing game and runs well on new and old machines alike (caveat: I've only played single-player and have heard about multiplayer lag issues) but it really shows its age and the HD enhancements really aren't that impressive. One big complaint of mine is that the screen is zoomed at a fixed level (I have tiny interface widgets). This was fine 10 years ago when screen sizes were pretty similar but it just doesn't work well with bigger monitors. Apparently when they called it HD edition they really meant 'works on HD monitors and newer processors without crashing' not 'graphics and interface adjusted and imrpoved for modern gamers'.			"

Welcome everyone, back to Age of Empires II.That one game from everyone's childhood that is the cause of mass nostalgia is now on steam and HD.Original Release Date: September 30, 1999Steam Release Date: April 9, 2013As nearly everyone else in the reviews, I also played this in my childhood. This was probably my second or third game (after AOE I of course) and I can easily recall wololo'ing enemies to my command, only using the cavalry because they looked neato and stupidly raiding enemy AI prematurely without much of a chance. Age of Empires was a brilliant part of my gaming childhood and might just be what pushed my 5-6 year old self to continue to do what I love up to today, gaming.Age of Empires II is a RTS (Real-Time Strategy). The focus of the game is to gather resources such as wood, food, gold and stone to create your most ideal kingdom that fits whatever scenario you are in/come across. You use your loyal villagers to create buildings based around certain ages you can evolve through. These ages consist of the Dark Age, Feudal Age, Castle Age and Imperial Age. As you move forward throught the ages, you advance in technology and become able to construct better buildings and units all with the intention of surpassing your opponent in economy and militia.The game offers an easy and understandable tutorial to people who are new to the scene of RTS games while still maintaining a learning curve of difficulty perfect for more advanced players.Lower difficulties aren't simply a walk in the park where the AI immediately gives up. It still provides a challenge suitable for the newer people to the game.The Yays!More people are playing multiplayer. Since the HD version, many players use multiplayer now so it is very easy to find a game suitable to your level of playing. I'd reccommend tweaking the settings beforehand to suit your wants.Say 'Goodbye' to countless hours of your time. Age of Empires is a very addictive game and you will definately find yourself late for dinner, meetings, anything that'll happen in 2-3 hours time.Flexible Scenarios. Find yourself lost in many fun and random scenarios ranging from handicaps to bountiful resources and more!Interesting Campaign. Play single-player games featuring famous people in history such as Joan of Arc, Ghengis Khan and Attila the Hun.Mod/Workshop Support. This is really interesting to see because now players can add custom maps, soundpacks, texturepacks and scenarios to workshop.The sounds and music are a great listen. It feels good to win a game and depressing to lose one (not just because you're bad :P). The music and sounds are a great addition to the atmosphere of the game.The Nays...Updated Graphics...? The difference between the HD version and older version isn't too far apart. They both look quite similar and have only minor changes. Although much higher resolution is supported than the old one.No LAN Games. It seems that the LAN feature for multiplay has been removed, would've been nicer and more playable if they kept it.Connection Issues. Desync and mass lag occurs quite often and is very game-breaking, even when you are close to people you're trying to play with.Seeing this game on steam after those years made a feeling of nothing other than pure nostalgia wash over me and absolutely compel me to buy it.Would I reccommend this to anyone?Without a doubt, yes. Whether you are an older returning player to the series or would just like to try a new game, Age of Empires II is definately a good game in my books.Rating: 10/10Reccommended Price: $5-10 "

												This game was one of my childhood favourites, and inspired my interest in history, especially history surrounding the nomadic empires of Atilla and Genghis. The gameplay is fairly standard when it comes to RTS gameplay, you start with your Town Hall and a few workers and micromanage said workers untill you've got a town large enough to build a sufficient army to take on your foes.Personally I never got very invested in the multiplayer, which is why I'm glad to say the singleplayer is very extensive with campaigns surrounding certain wars that were fought in times long past, for instance the rise of the mongol empire, and the events that unfolded when spaniards first set foot on aztec lands. I wouldn't say the game is 100% historically accurate, but the campaigns are definitely based around real events.Beyond that, all and all I think it's a fun game, the HD edition doesn't add to much beyond making everything look a bit smaller, but nothing too upsetting, atleast it lets me play Age of Empires 2 again, a game I'd gladly pay for to relive.Word of warning though, I have come across a lot of issues with the expansion ""The Forgotten"", and as it was based around a mod for the original game, a lot of the AI feels clunkier. (The AI will spawn tons of units in their fortress and the campaigns can feel more like a grind than usual), and the pathing is sometimes difficult to manage. There's also the issue of invisible walls in favour of pacing, which all comes down to your personal preference.All in all I love the original game, and due to that I can bare The Forgotten's campaigns, but if you're trying this for the first time I'd recommend starting off with the game without the dlc.

												An excellent rewrite of an excellent game! I have the original version (1999) as well and that was probably my favorite PC game of all time. Was the original game that got me into the idea of gaming on a computer. And well this title propably has a special place in my heart just because of that. They took the old game and cleaned up the graphics, gave AI an overhaul (while also leaving the old ai as an option for the genuine aoe 2 feel), and made multiplayer a thing again (beyond just LAN that is all that works in the old one anymore.).10/10 Love Age Of Empires, nothing wrong with this rewrite it's an upgrade all around.

												It's Age of Empires.  In HD.  If you enjoy RTS games even a little, you want this game.  If you haven't already played this game, you should play this game.  If you enjoy the concept of castles, you should buy this game.The game is a standard medieval RTS game, in that it was the defining factor back in 1999 as to what they would become.  It is extremely balanced after years of playing it and refining it.  The HD version enhances the game by offering wide screen options, newer hardware/OS support, steam integration, and new age balance changes.  Age of Empires II HD has received nothing but betterment on top of its amazing predecessor, the classic many grew up with and even more played.Age of Empires II HD and the new expansion, 14 years after the release of the game, are both must haves for any gaming collection.  10/10			"

												Not worth the purchase unless you are nostagic about the game. It is an amazing game and runs well on new and old machines alike (caveat: I've only played single-player and have heard about multiplayer lag issues) but it really shows its age and the HD enhancements really aren't that impressive. One big complaint of mine is that the screen is zoomed at a fixed level (I have tiny interface widgets). This was fine 10 years ago when screen sizes were pretty similar but it just doesn't work well with bigger monitors. Apparently when they called it HD edition they really meant 'works on HD monitors and newer processors without crashing' not 'graphics and interface adjusted and imrpoved for modern gamers'.			"

												All the strategic greatness of Age of Empires 2 and its expansion, The Conquerors in one package... AoE2 HD Edition is great for people who never played the original release and want something that will work on modern systems without any problems. It's also great for people like me who absolutely loved AoE2 to begin with and was hoping for the ability to play it on modern operating systems without running into graphics or sound glitches or having to go through the workarounds for multiplayer after the MSN Gaming Zone was shut down.That said, for an HD Edition, there's decidedly little that's actually ""HD"" about it apart from being able to run in modern resolutions (just bear in mind that fullscreen runs at your desktop's resolution and there's no way to change the resolution ingame). I feel like this is mitigated by the fact that it's still a compilation of Age of Empires 2 + The Conquerors expansion, with their gameplay pretty much unaltered from the original releases and patches apart from integrating Steam achievements and using Steam for the multiplayer setup. AoE2 wouldn't really benefit all that much from significant visual upgrades anyway. After all... it's the fantastic gameplay that's kept people like me playing it pretty regularly for going on 15 years. And that's precisely what you get with this package.			"

												As a fan of AOE, AOE 2 and The Conquerors I was very disappointed with this installment. The game shows promise, has new units, techs and civilizations and anyone can appreciate the painstaking beautiful detail with which some scenarios are designed. But somewhere in that drive to create, the creators got carried away. Very carried away.Some scenarios are almost unplayable with how difficult they are. The creators seem to have gone trigger happy with creating HUGE enemy armies and are obviously obsessed with the ""big battle"". This amateurish approach is something you'd expect from a beginner creator who wants to fill the screen with as many units as possible - not a serious creator. You'll get huge hordes of units massacring each other, armies wasted against walls and almost impregnable cities with extremely tough AI (even at the easiest difficulty levels), impregnable cities with upwards of 10 castles, endless ""Fire Towers"" and seemingly endless resources and ability to regenerate endless units. Challenging is fun, but this is just... yeah. Not worth it. The original games were charming and made you feel immersed. Sadly, the expansion's difficulty is its biggest downside. It's hard to get immersed when you feel like you are fighting an almost artificially impossible scenario every single time you play. Would not recommend.			"

												AOE 2 is such a great game. when it was release on pc many years ago around 2000, it ran smoothly the campaign was great and IMO it's one of the best stratergy games ever made. Coming on to the HD remake, running an i7-4790k 16gb ram and a gtx970, in single player against AI the game just struggles to reach 10fps 15mins in. i've oftern had games where it crahses for no aparent reason. The suprising thing is, the game doen't even use a quarter of the processing power/ram staying at around 20% and max 1gb. this has been a great game ruined by the developers lack of interest to fix it. Why would the developers release new PAID DLC instead of fixing the game first? This HD remake would be amazing if only the bugs were fixed. I can understand why there are so many positive reviews, the gameplay is great when it doesn't bug out. Ah well yet another game ruined by the developers. Microsoft please bring back ensemble.			"

												I loved playing AoE2 back in the day huge fan of AoE in general and I was really excited thanks to the positive reviews. However, right now I can't reccomend it to anyone as it's literally unplayable with current patch.As of weekend sale purchase the game suffers from massive critical bugs leading to mp desync, discos, huge framerate lag, as well as poor latency since they never upgraded the netcode for a 15yo game. How could they not have even tested this once, issues are immediately apparent in first 5s of scenario or skirmish play (even single player!). Hopefully it's fixed soon due to the massive outcry.

I cannot play Dracula campaign mission 4 because the AI stops doing anything when I load the game. I read that some issues reported years ago were never fixed.Terrible pathfinding, and overall terrible Forgotten Campaigns, badly scripted, with broken triggers.This is a disservice to the original game I enjoyed very much, to be honest.  :-(You are better off playing the original game.

												This game is more for people who have played Age of Empires 2 back in the day. The ""HD edition"" is exaggerated and might be misleading. It runs on a higher resolution, the water is a bit nicer, the cliff texture is different, but overall it's not that much of a difference. The menu was very dissapointing imo as it looked very low resolution and blurry. I even thought that my resolution was set wrong! I don't think it's worth the prize they are asking for it, I mean come on an old updated game for 18,99 or 27,99 (+DLC) is way too much. If you still have the original game then don't bother buying this unless the steam online play attracts you that much. I didn't have the game anymore and it was on -75% off so that's the reason I bought it. I don't really know if I would recommend it yes or no as I'm more in the middle. It's a fun old game, but nothing spectacular has been added.			"

												EDIT: Fixed in the latest patch! Hurrah for lan again!Original review: I really liked the original.I really liked this when it was re-released.But the latest patch/expansion has totally fried the network play.So now after buying the game twice, and the Forgotten expansion twice, I can no longer run a multi game with my GF, even though we're sitting in the same room.Guess we're back to boardgames at the kitchen table.

												The recent update has broken the game.  No longer do buttons respond instantly, they lag in response, due to the revised game program.  The game has been rewritten and just doesn't seem right.  It is apparent that one of the prime goals of the update is to reduce demand on their servers, even though the original game was written for dialup internet.  The game lobby is laggy, games take minutes to start, if they do start at all.  With the lagginess of the interface, it is difficult to double click a unit and select all visible units, since the delay in click response makes double clicking on a moving unit impossible.I loved this game, probably the best computer game ever made, but with this update it is time to stop playing it.  Perhaps I'll go back to the original game.  Goodbye, Steam, goodbye Valve.			"

												This is everything you expect from Age of Empires II, and nothing more.The game is different on a few points: easy multiplayer matching, higher graphics and higher population cap.To my opinion the pricing of € 18,99 is too steep. When should you buy the game:- you loved age of empires 2- you are willing to pay the price- it's at discountTo my opinion if you really want to play Age of empires 2, get the CD out of the dusty closet!

												I really recommend u not to buy this game. If u want to play the old campaigns and matches  vs the computer you ll have the same experience with the original version. If u buy this game to play online with friends u will be really disappointed because the multiplayer is unplayable due to extreme laggs. It really is a disgrace that even 9 Month after release this issue, which was mentioned  buy the community since the start of the game, still isnt solved and that themultiplayer still is unplayable.So as a conclusion i can say that even the biggest Fans of the original AoE 2 should not waste their money by buying this piece of crap. If u want to play this game get yourself the original version and use programms like voobly to play with ur firends.edit: game is on sale atm for 4,75euro i think thats what the game is worth just for the singleplayer so i recommend buying it for that price.

												While I did enjoy the original Age of Empires with my family extensively and this one does handle Single Player like I remember but with more current resolutions, it fails in one very important area.    Being able to play multiplayer is a critical part of this game for me.   With high end machines on a LAN with extremely low ping times it constantly desyncs and has lag issues.    If you look at the discussions they have relegated discussions on fixing this to a single pinned topic.   Basically it seems to be there so the forums are not flooded with people having issues.   They can let people post in that thread and seemingly do nothing to address it.I am all for expansions and new content, but not if the base game is not fixed.   I do realize many people are having no issues, but there seems to be a high number of people who are.If you only plan on playing this single player then I can recommend it.   If you plan on playing multiplayer I cannot receommend it since there is a strong possibility it will not work for you and you won't be able to get any assistance or commitment from the developers to fix it.

												Don't be decieved by the 100+ hours I've spent on this game, that was in better times. The recent updates/bug fixes had the unintended consequence of creating more bugs. The game is now practically unplayable, as if it were possible to make the multiplayer even worse ! 90% of the games you play will lag terribly, and someone will drop out within the first five minutes, to your dismay it will usually be someone on your team, rendering the match distressingly unfair. The community consists of rank obsessed, loyal, die hard fans that have no regard whatsoever when it comes to fair play and have accepted this♥♥♥♥♥♥and awful broken multiplayer. You can still find unranked, arena type games, such as castle blood, where the objective is to out kill your opponent which levels up your never ending spawn of troops, but these are frustrating due to multiplayer issues. The biggest trouble is multiplayer, it is totally broken. Some players are courteous enough to rush their enemy when an opponents team mate drops, to end the suffering as quickly as possible, occasionally someone will drop out to even teams, but most laughably carry on as though it's still fair game, despite being 4v3, or 4v2, or worse. You might be lucky and have two lag outs, one on each team making it a fair 3v3 or 2v2. You will roll the dice every time you play, in the worst possible way. I don't blame people for being unsportsman like, it's so hard to actually get a game going, getting through the loading screen, by the end you're just desperate to play something, anything at all, even if you have no chance of winning, or equally, the opposing team has no chance of winning because lag claimed a victim on their side, it's frustating, as the game will almost NEVER play out as intended from the start, you just want that sense of blood and carnage, it's so difficult to reach that point due to the bugs. People rarely leave out of courtesy to even the teams once a player has dropped or lagged out so the game is instantly over in some cases. If lag claims a victim on the opposing side expect a desperate rush from your opponent in order to rebalance the game, or expect a team mate of yours to capitalise on your opponents misfortune by moving in on the dead players position and building in close proximity to gold, iron etc, often cutting off the trade links for market carts, meaning the opposing team has no chance at all of making a comeback. If the dice roll in your favour,  you may as well go afk, have a shower or make yourself some food instead, that's if you don't lag out yourself, because the game will not be challenging at all, you've basically won, it's 4v3, or 4v2, you are sitting pretty, why not send your villagers to attack the enemy base? May as well try and amuse yourself somehow because it's otherwise no fun at all. This buggy and broken multiplayer has lead to some interesting developments in gaming strategy/style. Some players have adapted to predicted lagouts, by rushing and trying to eliminate a player at the very start, thereby increasing their odds of winning. How sad and pathetic that a game's multiplayer in 2015 is so broken players have to include alternative strategies to accomodate the event within their scope of play. AoE2 was always plagued by terrible multiplayer.There are so few games in the multiplayer lobby, even at peak times, the chance of you finding one in close proximity is remote which is important because any games you play worldwide will increase the probability of lag and almost certain drop outs. Any communication 'lag' issues with other players is delighfully displayed on the game screen at the start. You will be dissapointed when you join a lobby only to find you lag with another player, the traffic light system green, meaning slim chance of lagg/drop out (but by no means guaranteed), yellow, meaning odds of lag/drop out is over 50%, red meaning don't even bother, it's unlikely you'll get through the loading screen. I mean really these are windows 95/98 issues that never got resolved, it's an absolute disgrace. You will spend more time in loading screens/lobbies trying to play than actually playing. Having said all that, if you don't mind being unable to play multiplayer, the single player has a lot to offer. Sadly even those that love RTS will, I doubt, wish to spend hours on their own doing the single player campaign or death matches against AI  in this era of gaming. Multiplayer is the only real thing this ancient game has going for it, and that is totally ♥♥♥♥ed. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, trust me on this, save yourself the frustration, because it never gets any better.			"

												Basically, this is the same AoE2 game that you are familiar with last decade, but with several new twists.It is a quintessential RTS that you must experience if you haven't already. Adding to the multitude of units, technology and strategies are Workshop mods that further enhance the gameplay and depth of the game for both your offline and online needs.The new African Kingdoms expansion offers a great opportunity for players to start their AoE experience and see for themselves how this game has survived and evolved to its present incarnation.Note: Disregard the Steam-registered play time; I spend my AoE times off-site with AoC.

												Age of Empires II was one of my favorite games not just in the RTS genre, but of all time. I'm a huge history buff so being able to play through some of the most important events of the medieval era was great (even if some things aren't historically accurate, such as repelling a Mongol horde with a sports car outfitted with machine guns.)The best way to approach this is to break it up into parts based on expansions. Let's start with the base game and The Conquerors.The game itself was rather faithfully ported. Calling it an HD remake is a slight bit of a stretch since the only real changes were some improved textures and widescreen support but I don't remember it looking this clean when I first played it all those years ago. As time went on patches improved performance and mechanics, such as increasing the number of units you can move at one time and increasing the framerate, both of which were very welcome changes to the game. Everything is intact from the initial release, and I still love playing as the Mesoamerican civs that were added in The Conquerors. Add in Steam Workshop support and you can find all sorts of textures, sound packs, and replacements for buildings and units to further customize your experience.And then we move onto The Forgotten and this is where the game slips. The Forgotten was a fan made expansion that added five new Civs to play as and a few new campaigns to complete, but you can easily tell this was not official. For example, the Indians use the soundpack for the Indians from Age of Empires III. The same is true with the Slavs using the soundpack for the Russians from III. I also deplore some of the writing in the Campaigns; In one mission I had to infiltrate a camp with two really powerful Man At Arms and as I approached the camp, one of my men mentioned how crawling through sewage would give them the Black Plague to which his partner quipped back he would show him his Black Plague if he didn't stop complaining. On top of that most of the Campaigns are short with some as short as only three scenarios, and some of the missions are grindfests or fetchquests.The Forgotten did add some new architecture and units that are cool, on top of adding the ability to research another Unique Tech for all Civs, but overall you can tell it was done by amateurs.This brings me to the latest expansion, The African Kingdoms. Aside from becoming a rather amusing image macro utilizing the cover art, AK added four new Civilizations each with a five scenario campaign focusing upon medieval Africa to varying degrees from the Berber Invasion of Spain to Portuguese exploration. Once again new units and techs were brought to the table but while some techs seem useless depending on your strategy, each Civilization seems failry evenly matched against the others but they're all very similar to begin with.If you want a simple review of this game, get it if you are looking for a relaxing RTS that has some historical value that spans the rise and fall of many medieval empires. While it may feel archaic compared to more recent RTS games, Age of Empires II HD has stood the test of time that seems to have claimed many of the Civilizations featured in this game and it's expansions.tl;dr Woo loo loo get this gameEdit: Did you get it yet?

												This Game includes everything an RTS has to offer, and more.Over the past decade and a half people have created mini games, movies, tournaments, artwork, maps, gamemodes, rpgs, comedies, and other things.Don't just expect what you will get out of the main game, it isn't just filled with 1v1s and team games like every other rts.This Game breeds creativity, and is very easy to share that.Plus the competitive scene is very much there and alive, and you can get into it if you want.

												So much nostalgia in this game for me, I recommend that anyone who likes RTS' should get this game, unlike newer games that use 3D models this game uses flat, still images making it look quite marvelous in terms of detail, the sound effects are nice and the scenario making is also fun.The biggest problem with this game is it's stability, online games can be riddled with lag early on in games making a good start hard to do, but past that little hiccup I see a great game for both base-building & war!

												I'm going to being with the negative aspects of this game:It's old and the graphics aren't amazing. However, it still looks great and will not hinder your game play.Now, we'll delve into the positive aspecs:After all these years, this game's playability has not aged at all.There is so much versatility in how this game can be played. Looking for competitive strategy? This is your game. Looking for silly shenanigans? This is also your game.With steam, this game has become so much easier to play online and with friends.If there is a sale, don't hesistate and grab a four pack. Grab one for yourself and 3 for buddies that you know will enjoy it.p.s Sneaking in with your monk and stealing relics under people's noses is delicious. WOLOLOLOLOLOLO			"

												Definitely a classic RTS. The Age of Empires series is what got me into strategy games and what got me into history actually. Age of Empires II offered a better variety to the strategy of how you can build your empire and take on multiple opponents. Although I did like the third entry to the series this one will alwas have a special place in my heart. Having played it for hundreds of hours (although you won't see that listed on Steam) I always find my self coming back to this game all these years later. Building up a fortresss (especially on the island maps) and setting out to conquer whatever opponents you face is very satisfying. If only Age of Empires III had the map sizes that this game had I would say it would be a close competitor but nothing beats the classics.			"

												Before you read this please note that I have been playing this game since I can remember and have only had it on Steam for a short while. This game is awesome! It is the perfect type of strategy game! There are dozens of different types of nationalities to choose from which all have their strengths and weaknesses. I have spent hours of countless fun playing this game. You can play the campaigns and when you have finished them you can play with a friend over LAN or online with random strangers! It randomly generates the maps so you don't have to worry about playing the same old map over and over. All in all I think this game is well worth the money! I give this game a 9/10!! Just cause I don't think any game can be a 10/10 but if a game can be 10/10 then this is the game!			"

												Let me tell you a story. I call it The Adventures of Agent Cobra: Episode 69: Checkmate.Our heroes, Agent Cobra and his furious monkey-boy sidekick Furious have just returned to their Byzantine castle hideout in the mountains. No sooner had they returned than a new document was faxed to their secret missions-only fax machine. Furious picked it up.""Zimmering zwounds, Agent Cobra, it's a message from the leader of the Byzantines!"" He said, flapping the page in the air.""Well, Furious my boy, what does it say?"" He was calm, nonchalant, which was odd, given the traumatic conclusion of their last adventure. Of course, being a car with an automatic assault rifle in the hood, his emotions were difficult to gauge.""I'm not sure. The message reads: 'how do you turn this on roggan wololo wololo wololo roggan start the game already start the game already don't point that thing at me furious the monkey boy wood please wood please woodwoodwoodwoodwoodwoodwoodwood please <laughs>. Stop. Sincerely, The Byzantine Leader'. What does it mean, Agent Cobra?""""Furious my boy, that's a cipher,"" he said, as he somehow lit a cigarette. Puffing a noxious cloud from his exhaust, he continued, ""If I'm not mistaken, it can be decrypted to mean 'Dear Cobra Car and Furious the Monkey Boy: I am aware of the dangers of requesting your assistance so often, especially given the... emotional nature of your last mission,'"" he shrugged, ""'but I fear circumstances have left me with no choice. The reasons for your new mission are confidential, I fear, but your objective is simple: the enemy king must die. Do this and you shall be rewarded.'""""You decrypted that in your head?""""Many newer cars have onboard computers...""""Well, yeah, but not for cryptog...""""We ride, Furious my boy, to slay the enemy king.""""But which enemy did he mean, Agent Cobra? There are so many. The Aztecs, the Koreans, the Malians, the Franks; how will we know which one to assassinate?""Cobra put his tire on the confused sidekick's shoulder. ""The only way we know how, Furious my boy. The only way we know how.""And that, my son, is why there are so many ruined castles in Europe, and a few in Asia, Africa and Central America.			"

The graphics are HD but pretty much the same with the original AOE II. The strategic aspect and multiplayer is pretty much the same as well. I am very glad because my original CD no longer works on Windows 10. If you liked this game as much as I did, definitely pick this version up.			"

												Absolutely awesome game. I have been playing it for more than 15 years and I still enjoy it as much as I did first time. The gameplay is unbeatable. Strategy, tactics its all there. Some people say its too old and too simple - I say: TRY IT and you will know whats up (that is of course if you enjoy strategy games)			"

												From the  60.9 hours I have on record of this game, I have throroughly enjoyed it. From the gameplay itself to the campaigns and the DLC, everything I have seen in AoE II has been superbly made and has provided quality entertainment. Even the map creator in this game is superior, as it is easy to program, but the results of your programming are very complex.I highly reccomend this game to anyone who is into medieval history and/or warfare.

												Before you read this please note that I have been playing this game since I can remember and have only had it on Steam for a short while. This game is awesome! It is the perfect type of strategy game! There are dozens of different types of nationalities to choose from which all have their strengths and weaknesses. I have spent hours of countless fun playing this game. You can play the campaigns and when you have finished them you can play with a friend over LAN or online with random strangers! It randomly generates the maps so you don't have to worry about playing the same old map over and over. All in all I think this game is well worth the money! I give this game a 9/10!! Just cause I don't think any game can be a 10/10 but if a game can be 10/10 then this is the game!			"

My only complaint is that the quick match service does not work very well, but this is a moot point if you have friends that play. All in all, a fantastic game.

												Basically, this is the same AoE2 game that you are familiar with last decade, but with several new twists.It is a quintessential RTS that you must experience if you haven't already. Adding to the multitude of units, technology and strategies are Workshop mods that further enhance the gameplay and depth of the game for both your offline and online needs.The new African Kingdoms expansion offers a great opportunity for players to start their AoE experience and see for themselves how this game has survived and evolved to its present incarnation.Note: Disregard the Steam-registered play time; I spend my AoE times off-site with AoC.

												First, I must say this is easily one of the most perfect games I have ever been lucky enough to play. I used to play it all the time before the disc broke when I was younger, and my recent return to its beauty is a warm welcome. The HD graphics ""update"" doesn't really stand out to me, as it looks nearly the exact same. However, the exact same is good enough for me. The music fits the game like a hand in a glove, and if you're one who cares as much as I do about in-game soundtracks, this is THE most memorable music I have ever heard while playing a game. It stands out with its really unique approach to the how a game should sound, and listening to the entire 30 minute long epic (and that's only the base game soundtrack) while outmaneuvering enemy players is a dream come true.The game itself still holds up extremely well in terms of variability even to this day. Its many different civilizations all offer something slightly different, both in terms of playing style and building style. The expansions for the game add on an almost ungodly amount of additional civilizations, which only furthers its flexibility. The game modes are relatively straightforward, and all very fun in their own way. My all-time favorite will forever be conquest, in which you must conquer all enemy players completely and decisively in order to win. The resource system in the game is perfectly executed, in my opinion. I believe it found just the perfect balance between simplicity and depth, as it is very simple to learn, but very difficult to master, hence the appeal from a shallow learning curve. The different branches of research are much more difficult to master, as they are plentiful and all useful in certain situations. You need to decide what is most vital at the moment, and work towards it (ex. advancing villager resource gathering speed or troop strength) while also juggling however many other tasks you can in order to keep a fluid overall movement and pace as the game progresses.The workshop implementation for this game is simply a joy to browse through, as this game was just begging for it from the start. The map creator tool in game makes it possible for custom maps to be posted and downloaded by anyone, and the more open-ended game files allow for easier modding. Right now whenever i play the game, I am treated to the game of thrones soundtrack at the title screen as a result of a simple download from the workshop. Various available texture packs caringly created by the workshop members are really nice to try out, as they can add entirely different feels to the game as you play it. Beyond this, I can't think of much more to add about it, other than the fact that it greatly furthers this game's life expectancy in my games library.Overall, I can tell you that this game, no, this MASTERPIECE, is well worth the buy, and the constant discounts it offers should only entice you further to snatch this baby up.Need I even add it? - 10/10			"

												Age of Empires II HD is a real-time strategy from Microsoft Studios. It is a remake of Age of Empire II: The Age of King and Age of Empire II: The Conquerors expansion pack reimagined in HD and now entirely as one single game. Everybody know what Age of Empire is unless you're really new to PC gaming, the game is a legend, was the best classic real-time strategy of that time.All gameplay and features in this game is left untouched and are very exactly the same as the old Age of Empire II except for the new 500 population limit for skirmish play, let's you train even more units and having a larger battles and larger tactics than before.The graphics has been improved slightly where you can see the new water and fire textures and effects are better than before. The new widescreen support for the game are also included. The rest still retain the same graphics as before.Well, the exact same gameplay and features could be the good or bad thing, because most people don't like buying things similar with what they already have, own or taste, but if you're looking for the old Age of Empires II in a new and better way then it is for you. All the story campaign, civilization is all there and the new Steam workshop integration is the best thing so you now can download many user created content ranging from maps, scenarios, AI scripts and many more to customize your game or create your own stuff and share it with everyone in the Steam community. I say this is a good remake, I recommend this. And by the way, I've been playing this game for over 6 years :)Rating 10/10			"

												This is by far maybe the most iconic and interesting games of the 2000nds. The original game was so good, I don't even remember when I first started playing it from a DVD. I must have spent hundreds, if not thousands of hours since my first ever AoE II game. I still have my old DVD with the game.So why do you need the HD Edition? I've tried and the original still works fine on my 1080p screen, so what's the point of buying a game if you already have it? If we don't count the much better graphics, the answer is the content. With the HD edition from Steam, it adds so much more interesting possibilities.First is the Steam Workshop. You can now download for free hundreds of maps, enhanced graphics or elements or even new troops and buildings.Second, the DLCs. You can't add ""The African Kingdoms"" and ""The Forgotten"" DLCs to the original game without tinkering with the game. I prefer to pay a few dollars/euros to get it from here than trying to find it on some sketchy Reddit post.And last, but not least, the multiplayer games. Whenever I tried to go in a multiplayer server on the DVD game, I was directed to a Microsoft website that told me that they stopped supporting multiplayer battles. it is essential to try multiplayer and learn from some veterans, who know all the best tactics and some might even try to help you learn to play better.As a conclusion, this is probably one of my most favorite games and I think that you would like it as much as me.

Since the early age of knightsWe've often had romantic notions of how wonderful these men were.Riding in on white horses, rescuing damsels in distress. But who were they?Well, most knights were sons of aristocrats.Noble upper-class familiesAnyone ever heard of chivalry?""Chivalry: The rules and customs of medieval knighthood""Yes, it was a code of conduct for the knights.HonestyObedience to GodLoyalty to king and countryHumilityand charity.Knights were protectors of the weak, they were warriors.Not just for battle sake, but to protect.Wouldn't you want to become a knight today?""Not really""Why not?""What's the point of being a great knight if that's all you do?""A knight stood on the battlefield and in society as an example of what a man should be.Protectors of the weak and defenseless, and warriors against monsters who threatened this land.if a knight broke this code of conduct, it was considered treason. ""No wonder they're not around anymore""Actually, they are.But they're knights in titles rather than armor.But even though the armor is gone, a knight's ideals should always remain in fashion.History is always in the making, and what will your history be?My review:I can learn history from this game, as you can read at the conversation above.history is not just about dates and facts.the real message, the real lesson in history is what we can learn in hindsight.that way we can take it and personalize it, and figure out how they feel about it today.100/100			"

												This Game includes everything an RTS has to offer, and more.Over the past decade and a half people have created mini games, movies, tournaments, artwork, maps, gamemodes, rpgs, comedies, and other things.Don't just expect what you will get out of the main game, it isn't just filled with 1v1s and team games like every other rts.This Game breeds creativity, and is very easy to share that.Plus the competitive scene is very much there and alive, and you can get into it if you want.

												Age of Empires II was one of my favorite games not just in the RTS genre, but of all time. I'm a huge history buff so being able to play through some of the most important events of the medieval era was great (even if some things aren't historically accurate, such as repelling a Mongol horde with a sports car outfitted with machine guns.)The best way to approach this is to break it up into parts based on expansions. Let's start with the base game and The Conquerors.The game itself was rather faithfully ported. Calling it an HD remake is a slight bit of a stretch since the only real changes were some improved textures and widescreen support but I don't remember it looking this clean when I first played it all those years ago. As time went on patches improved performance and mechanics, such as increasing the number of units you can move at one time and increasing the framerate, both of which were very welcome changes to the game. Everything is intact from the initial release, and I still love playing as the Mesoamerican civs that were added in The Conquerors. Add in Steam Workshop support and you can find all sorts of textures, sound packs, and replacements for buildings and units to further customize your experience.And then we move onto The Forgotten and this is where the game slips. The Forgotten was a fan made expansion that added five new Civs to play as and a few new campaigns to complete, but you can easily tell this was not official. For example, the Indians use the soundpack for the Indians from Age of Empires III. The same is true with the Slavs using the soundpack for the Russians from III. I also deplore some of the writing in the Campaigns; In one mission I had to infiltrate a camp with two really powerful Man At Arms and as I approached the camp, one of my men mentioned how crawling through sewage would give them the Black Plague to which his partner quipped back he would show him his Black Plague if he didn't stop complaining. On top of that most of the Campaigns are short with some as short as only three scenarios, and some of the missions are grindfests or fetchquests.The Forgotten did add some new architecture and units that are cool, on top of adding the ability to research another Unique Tech for all Civs, but overall you can tell it was done by amateurs.This brings me to the latest expansion, The African Kingdoms. Aside from becoming a rather amusing image macro utilizing the cover art, AK added four new Civilizations each with a five scenario campaign focusing upon medieval Africa to varying degrees from the Berber Invasion of Spain to Portuguese exploration. Once again new units and techs were brought to the table but while some techs seem useless depending on your strategy, each Civilization seems failry evenly matched against the others but they're all very similar to begin with.If you want a simple review of this game, get it if you are looking for a relaxing RTS that has some historical value that spans the rise and fall of many medieval empires. While it may feel archaic compared to more recent RTS games, Age of Empires II HD has stood the test of time that seems to have claimed many of the Civilizations featured in this game and it's expansions.tl;dr Woo loo loo get this gameEdit: Did you get it yet?

												Alfred the Alpaca voice acting is awesome10/10but all joking aside I strongly recommend this game, this game makes rebuying the same game really worth it (not like that last of us piece of ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥that is the exact same game when they make a remastered version)this game gives you: new graphics, new improved AI, Workshop content, great servers, new factions and lots of new possibility's.I went into the game and started a standard game with 7 different AI all in individual teams using the ""-"" in the team options.but of course with my brain I could only see as far as I can stretch my arm, thus forgetting to put the LOCK TEAMS on... yep! they al teamed me and kinda ♥♥♥♥ed me over.but i was astounded by this! never had the AI form AOE 2 used strategy before. usually they would have spammed every available unit they got. now they did exactly the same but this time the varied in a way that made the groups they sent more diverse. each different from the other.this time they actually countered what I was throwing at them.Example:I sent a group of Kamayuks (new spear unit from the inca's), and spear throwers.and what do they send? Champions and ballista's.so i sent a lot of Paladins (full tech tree option) to counter his Champions and to quickly eliminate the ballista's. And he sends Halberdiers!I loved this constant thinking of what to counter but your enemy always being one step ahead of you!then i made my own map!I loved making fortress maps for me to defend againts the AI in AOE 2. but the strategy that the enemy uses is really hard to comprehend in this kind of situation.I always turn off the Trebuchets because I flipping hate those things. and then the enemy comes to the gate of my grand city! with siege rams, lots and lots of siege rams. so i send my Kamayuks outside to deal with them. and you'll probably guess what was in the rams.... Arbalests and Champions... he countered my Kamayuks just because I went scouting with one earlyer in the match.This game has it all. HD graphics, great campaign, great AI, lots of options and a sense of nostalgia..thank you Microsoft Studios (and all the other companies that I don't see just because I want to skip the video's in the begin and play my game)you made one of my favorite games come to life again.11/10 it's awesome!

												Age of Empires II... what's not to like? This was my absolute favourite game in my early teens, even though - when I look back at those times - I sucked at the game and mostly played the excellent campaigns. Joan of Arc, Genghis Khan, Frederick Barbarossa, Saladin... I could still play through these campaigns while blindfolded.Now that the game has been re-released in HD, I'm playing it in multiplayer, and it's great fun. It took me a while to learn the proper strategies, because if you want to survive in multiplayer, you have to be efficient - proper build orders, never stop building villagers, etc. The game requires a lot of skill to play and learning how to beat your opponent is very rewarding. There are just so many ways to approach this game, it offers a lot of variety.About the game itself: it's a typical RTS where you build your base, harvest resources, and train an army to destroy your enemy's base. And it is very, very well-made, to this day one of the best titles in the genre, in my opinion. Most games start out in the Dark Age, where you have few buildings available and can only train weak militia units, and you ""age up"" to the Feudal Age, Castle Age, and finally Imperial Age, with each age unlocking new buildings, units, and technologies. Every playable civilization has its own unique bonuses, unique technologies and unique units. The British have the longbowman, for example, and the Teutons have the Teutonic Knight, a heavy infantry unit. While the tech tree is similar for each civ, they still play differently thanks to their unique units, techs and bonuses, although not as differently as in Starcraft or Age of Mythology.If you're not into multiplayer and prefer singleplayer, don't worry: the campaigns are quite excellent, and AoE2 HD comes with the Conquerors expansion, so you have a large amount of campaigns to play through. William Wallace (a tutorial campaign), Joan of Arc, Saladin, Genghis Khan, Frederick Barbarossa, and in the expansion: Attila, El Cid, Montezuma, and a collection of historical battles. Mission goals in the campaigns are varied and it never feels repetitive, and some missions are very, very challenging, like the final mission of the Saladin campaign.One minor note of complaint: the multiplayer sometimes has issues, but they've become a little better with the latest patch. Still, in large matches of 3v3 or 4v4 you will often experience lag, and sometimes you will even get out-of-sync errors, so beware. 1v1 matches work flawlessly though and I never had a problem in a 1v1 game. If you like team games, do keep this in mind though.Overall, a thorougly recommended game. I enjoyed the heck out of this when I first played it in 1999 as a young teen, and I'm enjoying the heck out of it now in competitive multiplayer matches.			"

												Let me tell you something you already know. The HD Edition ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very buggy and laggy place and I don't care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as HD. But it ain't about how hard ya hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!			"

												Before you read this please note that I have been playing this game since I can remember and have only had it on Steam for a short while. This game is awesome! It is the perfect type of strategy game! There are dozens of different types of nationalities to choose from which all have their strengths and weaknesses. I have spent hours of countless fun playing this game. You can play the campaigns and when you have finished them you can play with a friend over LAN or online with random strangers! It randomly generates the maps so you don't have to worry about playing the same old map over and over. All in all I think this game is well worth the money! I give this game a 9/10!! Just cause I don't think any game can be a 10/10 but if a game can be 10/10 then this is the game!			"

												This game was my childhood. I honestly thing it lives up to all it's fame. You don't see many games where the II is better than the III. The graphics are HD but pretty much the same with the original AOE II. The strategic aspect and multiplayer is pretty much the same as well. I am very glad because my original CD no longer works on Windows 10. If you liked this game as much as I did, definitely pick this version up.			"

												AGE OF EMPIRES II HD REVIEW............Buddy of mine was always playing this and i thought il grab this when on sale, which i did!!!its a great game but too difficult, i would have preferred easy mode so you can build and resource at your own leisure and when you are ready just simply click & send your troops to commence battle. Unfortunatly the enemy Ai think sod this off im raiding on in :( and game over quickly appears.My work around was simply to cheat lol yes playing with cheats if you havent got patience like i have as the game is simply too difficult, combine it with the lord of the rings soundtrack from the workshop its actually pretty good.its a pretty huge game and will last you a long time depending if you cheat or notid give it a 7.9/10 its a classic RTS updated in higher resolution, but be warned its quite a hardcore game and not easy.But at sale price its on now, why not give it a go?

												I used to play this game when I was 10 years old (or even younger, I can't really remember). Well, 15 years later this game is still as enterteining as it used to be back then. One of the few problems with old strategic games is that they look so damn old if you play them now. Luckly you don't really have this problem with AoE II HD (it happens with other very good games just like Warcraft III or Empire Earth). I would say the HD graphic it's kind of ""retro-oldish""  but also ""newish"" at the same time: a perfect compromise.  It's a shame they didn't add some new features, but even lacking new relevant updates this game is still amazing and can definitely compete with more recent titles. If you're wondering ""is it really worth it to spend 20dollars for such an old game?"" my answer is: you'd better wait for sales in order to get it for about 5 dollars, but man... the game is worth all the 20 damn bucks.

Hell, I only bought it because I wasn't able to fix the graphical problems in my original copy of age of empire and was slightly intrested in the forgotten expansion.For people who care about ratings/numbers This game gets 8.5/10And is definetly worth the 20$ price if you are intrested			"

												There is quite a lot of gamers at the moment which are giving biased or very unhelpful reviews for people who want to pick up the game but are unsure. So im here to give an honest and moderatley helpful review for you.The game is the same old game you love, there isnt anything new or fancy or shiny which is going to change your game expirience for the better or worse, its exactly the same as it was 12 years ago and by god this is one hell of a game. I had played two hours with a friend and it was one of those games which you love from the start, yet i wont go into the gameplay because its exactly the same as before.The only new additions is some polishing of the graphics, everything seems a lot higher resolution as before but nothing which is eye candy. Infact the textures have been increased only very slightly, I felt that they could of done more work on polishing the textures and improving the very linnear and laggy animations, even if you loved the original animations it wouldnt of hurt to have smooth 60fps animations.This is not the only problem the game suffers from, constant network problems and low framerates seems to be quite common, yet you should remember the game isnt released yet and im sure the developers will get patching.The resolution is now much higher than before its running at 1080P, which is where the ""High Definition"" comes from yet this is only the resolution and the actual base texures are defiantly not at 1080P. The game now allows for multiple monitors so you can strech your game over 2, 3 or 4 monitors.The main problem here is you cannot fine tweak any resolution options. The text isnt in pure HD it seems and some elements of the game still feel like they are 12 years old.The game is now using the Steam API system so you can join friends and play, from what I have tested this works perfectly yet a lot of people are complaining with problems with network lag.Maybe the most anticipated feature is the game is fully supported with Steam Workshop meaning modders will start modding and creating new content for the game and you can subscribe at a click of a button.In general its the same old game you love, but I feel that this is not a remake to me it feels as if the game is the exact same apart from a quick resolution change and the new Steam Features. If you loved Age of Empries II and want to relive the memories then this game is for you but don't expect a completly new game or anything to look too much better or smoother.Gameplay - 9/10 (Same old, same love).Graphics - 6/10 (Feel they could of worked more on this and had a bit more options to change resolutions and animations)Performance - 3/10 (The game still has a lot of lag issues, FPS and Network, but I hope this will be fixed up)Overall - 7/10 (If you are a fan of Age of Empires you will love this, Just don't expect to much from a simple remake of the game)			"

												Such a great game! It may be old, but it is a lot of fun. This game allows you to build up your ""empire"" while fighting others.In most matches you start off with a few villagers, a town center and maybe a few houses. Town Centers allow you to create villagers which mine, build, chop wood, farm/hunt/gather, fight (rarely), fish (sometimes) and repair. You can research new techs in certain buildings to improve your army, villagers, buildings, how fast things are created, etc. You can play on many different maps, choose how you can win or lose the game, choose from many different countries/cultures etc. Your army usually comes from barracks, stables, castles, archery range and the siege workshop. Your navy will come from the docks. One of my favourite matches to play on it is the islands where everyone has their own island to start, regardless if they are allied with someone or not. It is like you have your own country and you must defend your island and then take down the enemy. Overall I think this is a game many people should give a chance!			"

A gold coin in a pile of silver coins in the strategy genre. The first time i played this game i went the mongols. I realised about 5 minutes in that there seemd to be an increase in the number of AI enemy soldiers in my base. To my horror i realised the enemy had built a barracks in my base and it was spurting out fresh soliders by the minute. Best game ever 11/10 (Edit: Stil Best Game ever with an active community)			"

												It's really one of the classic map-based strategic games of the computer age thus far. One day it will be eclipsed, but for the moment, this game still has the power to hold the strategic gamer's attention.Kudos to the independent entrepreneurs who have rejuvenated this game for higher-definition screens. Along with this comes expansions, campaigns, and features that effectively extrapolate upon what came earlier under Microsoft's creative tutelage.Have the foresight and wisdom to recognize a classic, and make this game one of your 'must-play' computer gaming joys.

												Age of Empires HD Edition will always be my best gaming experience. I have played this game now for over ten years. My first encounter with AOE was in 2005, when I just started on school. They had the game installed on the school PCs, and it was the original age of empires.Ten years later I discover Age of Empires HD Edition and are totally hooked. The game is MASSIVE. Although the game itself isn't so large, it can be played in hundreds of ways.You can play with your friends, other people in the world, or with yourself and "" the computer"". When I get tired of my friends, I try against some unknown around the world. And when multiplayer is boring I start with singleplayer. So when even singleplayer gets boring, I start with multiplayer again, so there is a ""vicious circle"": PSo it does not look like I've played so many hours, but the hours I've played it on steam, is only a fraction. I played the original like crazy, but I will say that the HD version of the play is even better. They've added a little more and otherwise freshened up the game a lot and made it possible to play multiplayer over the Internet. And i know that the HD edition didn't improve so much, but I think it's great!Like i like to say: This game came first out in 1999, and have through, soon 2 decades been played. And when a game is still popular when it's 15-20 years old... AOE have to be a ""good"" game!Absolutely 10/10 :)			"

												Age of Empires II HD Edition is an amazing reboot into, in my opinion, one of the best RTS games ever made. I'm playing in 2k and it just looks amazing, and unlike a lot of reboots it runs without any bugs, hitches or crashes. The multiplayer matchmaking and ELO based ranking system make it tons of fun to play; catering to the competitive market which has allowed a renewed and very much welcome return to the Age of Empires competitive scene.For the more casual players, what is more fun than a 4v4 regicide free for all amongst good friends? Well, maybe a few things but it is certainly up there!You can catch me playing this game frequently on my stream on hitbox.tv/yent - hit me up if you want to play! :)			"

Despite this I would still recomend this game to you as it still makes playing multiplayer far easier than trying to hook it up to sites. Although there are issues, not the ones with multiplayer lag, but the fact that this is not a HD edition but its still like the original game which is nice as trying to make the orignal disk to work with windows 7 for me just never worksI would rate this a 7/10			"

												Age of Empires HD Edition will always be my best gaming experience. I have played this game now for over ten years. My first encounter with AOE was in 2005, when I just started on school. They had the game installed on the school PCs, and it was the original age of empires.Ten years later I discover Age of Empires HD Edition and are totally hooked. The game is MASSIVE. Although the game itself isn't so large, it can be played in hundreds of ways.You can play with your friends, other people in the world, or with yourself and "" the computer"". When I get tired of my friends, I try against some unknown around the world. And when multiplayer is boring I start with singleplayer. So when even singleplayer gets boring, I start with multiplayer again, so there is a ""vicious circle"": PSo it does not look like I've played so many hours, but the hours I've played it on steam, is only a fraction. I played the original like crazy, but I will say that the HD version of the play is even better. They've added a little more and otherwise freshened up the game a lot and made it possible to play multiplayer over the Internet. And i know that the HD edition didn't improve so much, but I think it's great!Like i like to say: This game came first out in 1999, and have through, soon 2 decades been played. And when a game is still popular when it's 15-20 years old... AOE have to be a ""good"" game!Absolutely 10/10 :)			"

												I must admit, playing this game as a kid back in the day was one of the best things around. As a fan of strategy games I can promise you that this game just gets better and better with age. There have been some tweaks and balances to some civilisations and units but the game hasn't majorly changed and is still awesome. If you can find it on sale it should be a no brainer, especially sice the multiplayer has been brought back to life. Yes you can play 4v4 or 6v6 or whatver you want with your frineds, and if you dont have friends dont worry! The AI is ridiculous and will surely provide a good challenge.10/10 would monk army again			"

												I must admit, playing this game as a kid back in the day was one of the best things around. As a fan of strategy games I can promise you that this game just gets better and better with age. There have been some tweaks and balances to some civilisations and units but the game hasn't majorly changed and is still awesome. If you can find it on sale it should be a no brainer, especially sice the multiplayer has been brought back to life. Yes you can play 4v4 or 6v6 or whatver you want with your frineds, and if you dont have friends dont worry! The AI is ridiculous and will surely provide a good challenge.10/10 would monk army again			"

												Age of Empires II HD is so friggin' awesome. The details are wonderful. I have been a fan of AOE games since they came out. I have all of the games in their orginial BIG boxes. I highly recommend this game to anyone that loves playing strategy games and wants wonderlful details in the game.			"

												Overall the game is decent,  I would not call this a ""HD"" edition more like a widerscreen edition with barely noticable to no graphi enhancements. Despite this I would still recomend this game to you as it still makes playing multiplayer far easier than trying to hook it up to sites. Although there are issues, not the ones with multiplayer lag, but the fact that this is not a HD edition but its still like the original game which is nice as trying to make the orignal disk to work with windows 7 for me just never worksI would rate this a 7/10			"

												Okay so, if you've played Age of Empires before and you liked it.I completely recommend this to you, it's a quite improved and actually, for 2014, playable version.The graphics got a boost, the AI, the multiplayer system, lot of tweaks and etc.But don't expect a game that's completely in HD graphics, it stays close to its old graphics, and thats only a good thing, atleast if you're in for nostalgia.

												Some classic never die, and Age of Empires II is no exception. Vintage though it may be, it offers a lot for a RTS even by todays standards. And Kudos to steam for making some Valve run servers so us of an older generation can relive our days of nostalgia with other like minded old school gamers.Reccomemned buy for those that remember, those that wanna connect with a gaming history spanning a decade, and those that get off on playin vintage gamesSo in conclusion . . . BUY THIS GAME for you and your children			"

But with practice and time this game is very fun.Well. it is still fun when you are new. I may not have many hours on the game, But I have played it a lot before it was on steam.This review may not be written well. But I hope I helped decide if you want the game or not.Thank you for reading my review.Good bye ^^			"

												I would not recommend this game unless it goes on 75% off or higher. It had a lot of issues at launch, and still doesn't work too well.I get lower FPS in this game than I get in ultra settings in Starcraft 2, the mouse seems to be laggy when you box over units. The unit AI is weak, villagers constantly getting stuck here and there when they're trying to pathfind their way to their workstation.Online isn't exactly perfect, as it relies on peer to peer for the actual matches, and even with a ping of 30 in between you there's still input lag. A lot of input lag. It feels unresponsive, even pressing the Build ->X building hotkeys too fast means you won't  slect said building at all. The game's terrain and water looks way better than the original game, but the units still use the same sprites, even on 1920 x 1080. Buy it cheap or just buy Starcraft.			"

Epic battles, great gamplay, and the sprite graphics STILL look good! Microsoft did a fantastic job with this game, and it is pleasing to see that it is now updated and ready to be played on steam! This game is sure to entertain!			"

												This game is perhaps my favourite strategy game of all time, and that's saying a lot because I've played plenty of strategy games including the command and conquer series and many others. This game is very addictive and I definitely recommend buying it!Pros-Campaign Levels are very challenging, but are very fun.-Great Multiplayer - Ideal for those who play competitively and for those who play just for fun.-The Developers pay attention to what the community thinks and they constantly try to improve the game according to the feedback they recieve.-Wide variety of civilisations to choose from, even more if you decide to purchase the DLC's.-There are plenty of units, technologies and strategies to choose from!-The game runs very smoothlyCons-There a few bugs which really disrupt the gameplay whilst on multiplayer-Smurfing, although there is not much that can be done about this; it is still a major problem with multiplayer. If you are interested in a strategy game that will give you plenty of hours of great gameplay, then I recommend this game. I've been playing the Age of Empires games for a very long time and I was so glad to find out they made an improved version available on steam. I definitely recommend purchasing the DLC for this game because it will allow you to explore new civilisations, new maps and new strategies.			"

												Whilst this wasn't the first RTS I've played, it led the way into online gaming for me for years to come. This game kept me up late hours during my high school years, always wanting to do one more Castle Wars or heck, a standard game. Age of Empires II stands the test of time, and the HD edition brings forth a new generation of players to play with/against. The game involves, like most standard RTS games, the use of building and advancing your city, gathering resources, and the fun part, training soldiers to go to war. Each match feels fresh, different from the last, and with so many civilizations and strategies you can attempt, the possibilities are endless. Each civilizaion has its own unique set of units, and overall, it's fairly balanced. Even the cheaper units have their uses against the stronger ones if used correctly. The maps are unique and based on preference. I like larger terrain maps, less use of sea combat, but even the ships have their pros and cons and fit in with the layout of Age of Empires. A standard game involves going through four ages, from the Dark Age all the way to the Imperial Age. But you always have to stay on your toes because you never know what the opponent's strategy will be. There's many different playstyles, such as those that like to rush units to take an early lead, or those who prefer a slower paced game and building their economy to advance through the ages quicker. Whatever the case, Age of Empires II is a must-buy for RTS fans, and hell, I'd say it's worth trying with non-RTS gamers, too.			"

												Really, all that Skybox labs have done with the base game is add a coat of paint and make it compatible with modern versions of Windows... and that's all it needed.The new expansions add new units and civilisations but as everything follows the same rules and structure of the base game, nothing feels forced or particually out of place. Put simply, it gives you a little bit more of what was great about Age of Empires II in the first place. I bought this because I wanted to play AOE II without having to spend hours configuing it to run properly on new hardware and thats exactly what I got. It's pricy considering you can get the old gold eddition for next to nothing these days (and the forgotton empires mod for free on top of that) but really, I was happy to have it make an old but amazing game conveniant to play whenever I like again.

												This game is a classic. Possibly the most memorable game from my childhood. If you haven't already played you can probably guess its a base builder rts. Gather resources create buildings make units, and destroy the enemy. Simple but elegant this game was popular for a reason. The re-release Implementing steamworks into the game is pretty awesome. Just Invite your freinds straight to your game and kill some computer controlled civilizations or team up and take on some other players. Having this game with the workshop gives you access to the dedicated modding community with ease.With the community made expansion you can play some new single player campaigns, or if you're just into multiplayer there are new game modes and civilization that add some fresh content to this classic piece of 90s gaming gold.

												While this game is just a massive Microsoft Studios cash-grab capitalizing on 90's/early 2000's nostalgia and offers an ""HD"" retexturing which was already made available via the still active modding community, it nevertheless remains the same old Age of Empires II which gamers loved more than a decade ago. It's smooth, performs well, features some tweaks as well as a reinvigorated online experience. Overall, while it's offered at an excessively high price, it is an excellent game. I, however, strongly suggest you wait for a sale seeing as they are incredibly common for this game.			"

												The epitome of classic RTS!While the graphics and UI are extremely dated from today's perspective, the gameplay is still as fun as it was when it was first released back in 1999. Fun and strategic while still being laid back; this title (along with Starcraft) is one of the first successful RTS, and it's not hard to see why it spawned so many clones. If the idea of building a medieval city, controlling an army and ultimately conquering your neighbors sounds fun to you, this is the game to do it in.It reaches the ideal level of abstraction for an RTS, staying arcadey and fun while keeping the flavor of the middle ages with a minimum of minutiea. The Age series as a whole is amazing, and this is the seminal title of the series.Also, the Forgotten is well worth it, but wait for a sale.Score: Objectively: 8/10           Personally:   9/10			"

												Do you smell that? That's a smell. That kind of smelly smell..that smells....Like childhood. Yes, this game is the hour consuming, family depriving, and hermit provoking game that made part of my childhood amazing. This game is not exactly the ""Hd"" everyone was hoping to be when it was announced, but frankly Scarlett, I don’t give a damn! This is by far the best RTS game out there even after almost a decade of its time. The campaign is amazing with a fantastic tutorial, and the battle of the online civilizations is so much fun. Battle it out against the great empires and watch your opponent fall to your infantry, cavalry, or medieval artillery. You will spend hours on end away from your worrying family to play this history grade saving game. "

												If you've played Age of Empires II before (and enjoyed the experience), you're going to absolutely adore the HD Edition. New campaigns, easily accessible multiplayer, and mods from the Steam Workshop make it well worth its price. Personally, I've spent countless hours in online scenarios alone. The few, insignifigant gripes I do have with it lie with its multiplayer.			"

A strategy game of epic proportions that requires intense concentration and quick skills to balance your army management and your economic management.  This game will force you to think about everything and be looking everywhere on the map in an effort to evade your opponent and overwhelm him at the same time. 9/10  because of the bugs.			"

This game delivers solid gameplay using units, upgrades and mustang car cheats that only little ♥♥♥♥♥es use when they can't win because i spam jihadis and war elephennts. It also features an extensive history on the civilizations such as when the japense tusseled with the vikings in texas (no not the sports team you burn out ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and dont say you're not i know you are because you play steam.) another feature that kind of sucks but whatever is the map editor i enjoy making anime then battling the romans on it dont tell anyone though they'll think im gay for liking naruto. well gtg grandma just made sum chicken pot pie.

AoEII HD looks great with the higher resolutions offered and the texture packs you can mod in. The game civilizations are diverse and all the units are fun to work at. There is no better feeling than building up a diverse army of knights, pikemen, archers, cannons, and seige weapons and wiping your enemies off the face of the Earth. "

												Age of Empires is a classic middleaged RTS, the new HD Edition added a new reworked multiplayer system that worked without hamachi. The reworked singleplayer is untouched only adding new and better graphics. If you decide to play multiplayer then you may play ranked or unranked starting with an elo of 1600 in ranked. The game is rather recource oriented like starcraft, exept the major materials are wood, food, stone and gold, each holding a decisive role in the middleage game. In the beginning of each match you start with a towncenter and 3 villagers, these can build buildings and gather recources and the towncenter can produce villagers and provides other upgrades like a number of other buildings which require recources. The game supports a number of playstyles as a player you have the option to defend yourself and advance through the four times: Dark Age, Feudal Age, Castle Age and Imperial Age to defeat your enemy, turtling your way to victory or you can rush your enemy. The game features a variety of civilizations which have different attributes & which allow an even more free playstyle. I used to play the oldest version of the game, in which the ai was extremly unbalanced on a more intermidiate level. To my suprise alot of extrem fans of the franchise play the game frequently, so its hard to improve if you play against pros all the time, thats why I would recommend this game to a bunch of friends when its on sale, since the game itself is extremly enjoyable, but to reach a competitive level you require an extrem amount of patience and practise like in any game, which I myself did not have. I lack a profound devotion to master this game but maybe you have it. As a horrible player who only plays with friends, I would give this game a 8/10 it has extrem potiential for new players, but you get destroyed if you dont know how to play this complex game.			"

												My first real video game was AOE I. I remember playing it every day after school and when I got a hold of a copy of AOE II I played it until the disk wore out. So I asked my parents for another copy, which was also played until it broke. Then I heard about Steam having a HD version of the game which I bought as soon as I could and have been playing ever since. This game is possibly the best strategy game ever. EVER. Get it, get the DLC, play it. love it. HOW DO YOU TURN THIS ON?			"

												This is the best strategy game ever. This is the best Age of Empires game ever.BUT. There is a problem with this HD re-release - the base game runs better.This is utter♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to the base game, and if this was not the best strategy game ever, I would not recommend it to you.In an offline match (random map, campaign, etc.) there is a great deal of lag - so much, that you'd think you were playing with people living under the earth. Units glitch around. The frame-rate hovers at about 30 FPS and when you've got on-screen battles that involve MORE than 20 units, the frame-rate stutters below 20.Pathfinding is broken and if you've got 3 villagers collecting from the same gold quarry, when they go to unload their collected resources, they will get stuck on each other until you manually control them. Units will attempt to take the shortest route to where you send them and they almost always get stuck trying to go a patch of trees, through a wall (even though there is an opening a few squares away), and military units will get stuck on enemy units, just sitting there - while getting attacked.Also, hotkeys are recognized FASTER than the ORIGINAL 1999 GAME. You to press H (town center hotkey), shift+the hotkey to train a villager (so you train 5), and you get no villagers. You just get to the town center. This problem wasn't in the original game. When you use hotkeys to make villagers build things, (i.e. press B then whatever key to build whatever building), you get stuck on the build menu.Achievements are completely broken. You can only get them in a multiplayer game. But when you do somehow get achievements, you get an MVP award and a ""razed 50 enemy buildings"" award when you are♥♥♥♥♥rushed by the Huns and this activity causes players to go out of sync and you get bumped out of the game..... yeah.And this brings me onto the subject of multiplayer. The lag is terrible. Players go out of sync so many times, units sit around for about TEN SECONDS when you give them a command, and even if you're the host, you get horrendous lag - EVEN WHEN YOU START A MATCH WITH A 75 UNIT POP LIMIT AGAINST ONLY 1 OTHER OPPONENT.These problems were never existent in the 1999 game, and this version feels like an unstable mod that I programmed..... with my♥♥♥♥♥With all that said - I would not at all recommend you buy it. In a couple weeks, this all could change - those Microsoft ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s could get off their big, fat, greasy asses and address these problems, but we all know Microsoft - and their attitude towards fixing things, PC games, and Steam.Livid, is an understatement. I am utterly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off that THEY SOMEHOW MANAGED TO F*** UP A RECIPE FOR UNTOLD RICHES. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO SCREW UP AN HD-RE-RELEASE. ALL THEY WERE GOING TO DO WAS UPSCALE THE RESOLUTION TO 1080p AND ADD MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT...10/10 for the original game1/10 for the re-release**Update as of 11/25/13**I haven't touched it in a long time but it's fairly playable now. Multiplayer netcode has improved, but then again i've mostly been playing with people who live near me or in the same house, so I can't say much about regional or global quality. Hotkey response has been messed with as well, which was a big issue because RTS games are mostly about the speed and proficiency at which you perform. Now I recommend it. Also there is the new Forgotten expansion which looks fantastic. Don't have it yet but definitely plan on buying it.			"

Unfortunately it doesn't.1) It runs really slow on black forest, given enough units it becomes unplayable 2) It has some bugs, the idle villager button doesn't work properly and on occasion i'd hear the sound of a farm being depleted at which point the villager working on that farm stops collecting but the crop itself is still there.

Its really the same game as the original with just 2 things in its favor. 1, the online works on this version but has been discontinued on the original. 2, they have the workshop on this game so you can get some graphic overhaul mods and stuff. If you dont have the original you should go ahead and get it. If you do have the original, wait till thres a sale and the price goes down (went to $5 during fall sale), try and get some friends to get it with you and its ll be well worth your money.			"

												The trailer states that Age of Empires II defined an age. Well, in my case, it's actually quite true. Even more so than Total Annihilation (that I was offered at the same time), AoK is among my favorite RTS games. The fact that I was already an History nerd probably helped, but the game was nonetheless a very slick RTS.The gameplay was very basic - peasants gather resources and build stuff before you go to war -, but everything was very well done, and it implemented a lot of cool mechanics, like garrisoning units inside castles.Overall, let's say I have very fond memories of AoK: I loved the single player campaigns - despite the WTFHISTORY moments - and playing it in LAN with my brother and friends.That being said, do I recommend this HD edition? It's hard to say. The game is still as good as it was and, unlike Empire Earth 1 & 2 and their somewhat basic 3D, AoK graphics aged pretty well. But, as far as HD goes, it's pretty much inexistant. Thank god, you can have a decent, recent resolution. Thank god, you don't have to use some computering shenaningans to make it work on Windows 7. Apart from that... There's the steam workshop, which is nice, even though there is, so far, not a lot of content on it, map and scenario-wise. There's apparently some remade water HDish texture (didn't notice it). There are some new bugs, and some old ones haven't been fixed...All in all, I find the price tag to be set way too high for such an old game, with so little apparent update. 19€ + expansion is overpriced. Too bad Age of Empires II is still a great game, because if you liked it back in the 2000's, or want to try this classic, the HD version is as good as you'll get. And is regularly updated. So, my final piece of advice is: wait for a sale and get it (*). It's unlikely you will regret it.* Unless you're rich, in which case, go ahead and buy it now. Then send me a check.			"

												This Game is truly a history in the making. The Age of Empires Franchise is outstanding being the start of the Strategy Genre. AOE 2 really made its toll as a game as now it's been remastered, it really can't get any better. What makes this game so good is a number of things. To start of the gameplay is great. There is a key manging that you have to do to achieve a large army, a stable amount of resources and golden tunnel to victory. It does not match the Mangement of CIV 5 but there's a big difference with both of the games (but lets not go into that). The Graphics may not match most other strategy games like Company of Heores 2 and StarCraft but I think that's what makes it an AOE game in it's own sense. With the huge armies and big variations of units fighting this game really makes combat fun. When playing this game like most strategies you have to think carefully and plan your road ahead, you will come to do this alot with AOE2. Plan who to attack, plan what you are going to do with your first villagers so it requires alot of thinking but theres no harm in that. You have the choice also to pick a huge variety of factions to play. Each faction is unique in its self for example: the Byzantines to having a STRONG♥♥♥♥♥Cavlary Unit, Heavy Armoured with a fast speed. But also having certain strengths and weaknesses and the Celts having Woad Radiers a strong brute type unit being swift and having high attack. Like the factions the units in the game have strengths and weaknesses. Enough about the units and Factions lets now talk about the music. The Music is catchy, you won't get bored of the music. The music is very fitting and is great to listen to.What Makes AOE as a series is the Map Maker. There is a wide variety in making a may, from adding lots of different types of terrian to buildings and units. You can make your own campaign if you really wanted. The REAL Campaign Personally was alright, I enjoyed it but not enough to say it was AMAZING like the game itself. One of the things that really I enjoy about this game is the expression of custom battles and Skirmishes. You can have Skirmishes with Friends or Solo and the map will always be randomly generated. You can choose many different map types to choose from but also the premade maps from the Steam Workshop.The Steam Workshop really increases the games overall score. The original AOE2 is outstanding but the Steam Workshop allows you to add maps, new units, OUTSTANDING new Textues and custom music as well, but also many other things. Now Moving on to DLC ""The Forgotten"" the only ever DLC released for this game enchaces the game to a point. It adds new units, factions, campaign missions and other things. Personally I love AOE2, but the DLC is not worth the money. So I do not recommend buying this DLC.Overall this game is truly amazing, I recommend buying it but not its DLC. You will never get bored of this game as a game is always different even if you play the same faction and use the same plan. I really want a AOE4, AOE 3 is amazing but thats a another review for another day.This game scores a 87/100 from Captain Fidgett - ""A Truly Fantastic Game with its great gameplay, map maker and a game you can't get bored at""			"

												The combat in this game is so frustrating. Trying to get units to attack correctly makes me want to rip my hair out. For whatever reason, they do not feel as responsive as they should be. Even turning the game speed all the way up the units still feel incredibly slow and clumsy. I'd take Warcraft 2 over this. I love the building and resource harvesting aspects of the game though.			"

												A truly great HD remaster of one of the best rts games in existence.Everything that made this game so great is here, just better. Anyone who played it back in 1999, knows how easy it is to get sucked into this game. And this re-release is no different. It didn't take long, until I was spellbound once again. The gameplay is as intriguing as ever, and the music has aged well and perfectly fits the mood. Even the graphics still look great. The textures might not be as clean and sharp, but it's hard to miss the love and detail, that went into every pixel when played in HD. Achievements, Leaderboards, Matchmaking and Cloud support are a welcome addition together with the visual upgrade. The game even supports user created content over Steam Workshop. The only complaint I have, is the main menu. I personally would have liked to see a bit of an overhaul, but it's nothing serious. I highly recommend this game to anyone who played the original or any rts lover who has not done so.Go, buy now!!!!			"

												I've been playing this game since its original release and decided to give this version a try.All I can say is I'm glad I payed so little for it. The original played smoothly and well on a 233mhz machine with 64 meg of ram and no accelerated graphics.This version is choppy and slow on a 64bit system running at 3.8ghz with 10 gigs of ram and 2gigs of gpu memory-HD it is not.Funny that a company can take what was a very fine game 16 years ago and be unable to make it work smoothly on 21st century machines. Not impressed with this release and yes I am old enough to expect things to work as advertised ""out of the box"".			"

Because it just works.The single player is a great experience in itself, but I already played through that back when I was a child so I didn't replay quite everything.

												Were you alive in the year 1999? I was, I had just gotten my first pc (technically the family's first) and I got this game for Christmas. And for the next 4 years this was pretty much all I played. And then I went to High School and I discovered cs and tfc, and then in college came the Call of Duty games, but then it all comes full circle and now I'm here playing the greatest game of all time. Age of Empires 2: The Age of Kings and this game is amazing if you like tactical rts'. With advanced hotkey and formation support. Battle outcomes and oppurtunities are endless. With the MSN Zone gone, Steam integration brings this game back to life. So relive your childhood/teenagehood/early20s again and drop whatever cash you need to get back into this!			"

												While I'm a big fan of the classics, this specific iteration of Age of Empires II: Age of Kings is nothing but a way to milk that last drop of money out of a game. Age of Kings was a great game, but you don't just add an extra straw in your drink and sell it at four times the price as a bartender, do you? Well, if the bar was owned by Hidden Path Entertainment, then I guess they would.  I don't care that one of its members created the game to begin with, it's foul play, and I regret having supported the HD ""remake"" of this game. The resolution additions and small fixes aren't worth those extra money.			"

It's kind off similar to the game which is why i easily adapted with the game mechanics and such. It's fun to play especially with friends since you both can team up to destroy the enemies base. I have played this for not more than a week and i already love it. I would highly recommend you to get the game and start playing it, if you aren't a type of person who likes graphics like this, i would still recommend that you get it, I'm a type of person who looks at the games graphics instead of what it can actually offer, It all changed when i started playing this game.

												This version of AoE2 is too buggy to be enjoyable. Every new patch introduces a few new bugs and further diminishes the quality of the game. The developers broke the pathfinding AI sometime around the African Kingdoms release and never bothered to fix it; units now become unresponsive and barely move in 300 pop games. The games are plagued by lag and constantly go out of sync. There is zero quality control with this dev team. They are now pushing out more DLC instead of fixing core features that have been broken by an incompetent team of developers.			"

												Age of Empires II is a classic and a must-buy for anyone into the RTS-genre. Even though the HD version has some perks, it makes it easier to play an online game, has no more silly water on W7>, has fewer connection issues (mind I say fewer, not none, this will always remain a part of the game where you spend more time setting up a game than actually playing) and maps are directly downloadable via the workshop. I also recommend getting the extra DLC The Forgotten as it gives new civilizations and really adds something to the game. Creating my own maps never gets old as well as playing others. The time you will spent on this game will definitely be of good value.I still give this game 9/10.			"

												Having been addicted to this since its first days, it is really pleasing to see the return of AOEII in HD. The game holds onto its origins with all the original civiliztions and campaigns. Gameplay is the same. Unless you get ""The Forgeotten Campaigns"", you might find this a little monotonous. The DLC/add on adds 4 signle player missions, which spice it up a little. There are also 5 new civilizations added in The Forgotten, new gameplay options (I like the idea of increasing my population size to say 500 for a bit of fun), new units, new techs, etc. It definitely spices things a bit.In addition to the above, I have been able to introduce the game to my children and they are loving it. A must if you had any joy playing the original game.			"

												A true classic of RTS. And I'm not even a RTS lover. The thing that I love about Age II is the balance. It's advanced enough to be strategically challenging, and simple enough to understand fundamentally what needs to be done with only a playthrough or two. Basically, building a village with a bunch of houses, then spam several villagers. Villagers collect food, wood, gold, and stone (typically in that order). Then spam buildings. Advance technology. Rinse and repeat. Build an Army/Navy and any defences you can muster. Attack as applicable.All before the enemy beats you to it, racing against time.Grab some buddies and crank up the difficulty. You will know stress. And you'll have fun doing it.			"

Posted: April 26, 2014
												Time makes fools of us all. When Age of Empires II was originally released in 1999 it was simply an astounding game. Between the multitude of civilizations, random maps, deep campaign, and multiple gameplay modes a person could play for hundreds of hours EASY and never touch the additional content. When such stuff was touched not only could people play in tense multiplayer matches but there was a detailed scenario editor that allowed us to make whatever we saw fit. It seemed truly revolutionary, truly amazing to have such control and seemingly unlimited possibilities. Then the expansion came out and even more was added. For a time it seemed as if Age of Empires would change the face of gaming.That was in 1999. It's now 2013 and the game has finally been re-released for a new generation to play. Does it still hold water? Or is it a relic of the past best left to be admired and forgotten?The answer is 'both'.First off the good. The gameplay, which has always been Age of Empire's strong point, is still amazingly strong. Age of Empires, since the day it was first made, has always slowed down the gameplay in favor of more drawn out and epic engagements which the series still manages to preform wonderfully. This is not, nor ever has been, a game about having towering champions that fight through slews of foes with carefully timed spells and abilities. This has been a game about armies clashing while heavy sieges rage on and allies preform expert flanking maneuvers with well-developed armies to allow you the chance to win. And Age of Empires plays to this wonderfully. Almost everything is run smoothly and battles can reach truly epic scales. When playing with my friend a battle happened where a massive army of invading Franks smashed up against my Persian walls and I needed to preform a desperate scramble for resources to develop and field a few war elephants to fend them off while my British friend sent a small squad of longbowmen to aid in my defense while he flanked around back and laid into their now-undefended town. The entire battle hinged on if the Franks could break my wall before my friend reached their town. It was fierce and over a hundred units must have died in that one battle alone, but the wall survived with 95 HP left.Such epic-scale battles happen with frequency in this game. With the defensive focus it is very possible for games to become very long, drawn-out, and epic. Simply allowing the player to build walls alone grants a unique perspective not easily found in other RTS's while the slower development times and option for in-depth research makes it so that every battle will truly be distinct as it will be hard to find opponents who play the exact same way. To top it off, the random map function increases the replayability immensely. Having a completely new and different map every game allows for every game to unfold in a different manner. Age of Empires fits very well into the 'easy to learn, difficult to master' category while never being too brutal or too easy.Additionally much off the campaign is wonderfully detailed still and very challenging. Though it lacks the technical depth found in more modern RTS's the sheer size and detail allow for many hours to be sunk just chewing through the default campaign. That's not to mention that many of the campaigns are very fun and enjoyable and can easily end up being played multiple times.Lastly the inclusion of the Steam Workshop is wonderful. Allowing people to create and modify some of the game content and create and share their own scenarios makes it so that the game will, almost certainly, endure for many years to come.And now for the bad.The game has clearly aged. It came out in 1999 and it plays like it did so. Many simple conveniences that would have been easy to implement, some of which were in later titles, are simply non-existent. Things like an auto-explore button which would have helped out with the early game simply do NOT exist. The limit on the number of selectable units is also particularly annoying when there is no need for such a limitation. Even minor technical bugs, like trebuchets unpacking as if they had 17 range when they only have 16 (this means you need to manually pilot each into range instead of simply telling them to attack a building) persist despite that they should have been corrected long ago.Additionally, despite being a 'HD' version, many of the graphics are simply not 'HD' quality. It's very easy to see individual frames on buildings with motion, like mills, which ruins the whole point of making it 'HD'. Though this is alleviated somewhat by steam workshop mods, the obliviousness to detail makes people who haven't spent time figuring out the 'best' graphics patches truly jarring. To say nothing of how cumbersome many of the sprites function, often lacking true sprites for a given direction and simply going with the animation closest which results in things like people managing to walk diagonally while facing right.Too add to this, the scenario editor that gathered much praise originally simply lacks the detail it once had, and could have easily obtained. Simple things like allowing players to edit all of a unit stats instead of a select few and allowing players to make their own, unique, civilizations were not included, despite these potentially offering much replayability. And to put the icing on the cake, the achievements tend to act buggily, sometimes not registering until the next time the person plays the game or later instead of appearing on the spot.The Verdict: On the whole Age of Empires II HD plays more like a port of the original game with some minor graphics upgrades, tacked-on Steam Workshop, and few other, similar, upgrades. On the positive, it retains much of the original charm that caused the original to be a classic. On the negative, it retains so much of the original charm it fails to take advantage of the more than ten years of improvements that have come out since then, both in other RTS's and in their own series of games. If you were a fan of the original and no longer have your disks or are unable to use them due to many years of use, you will almost certainly enjoy this game. If you are not, if you enjoy it or not will likely come down to the deciding factor of 'are you willing to play a game that, basically was made 14 years ago and plays like it'. If you are willing, Age of Empires HD offers loads of depth and replayability that can keep you entertained easily for well over 100 hours without even truly scratching the surface. Otherwise, it's a relic from a bygone era best looked at, admired, and then moved on from.My value: For a fan: $15.00-20.00For a newbie: $10.00			"

Although AOE 2 HD looks largely the same (to me at least), it's worth the price on here mainly for the Steam integration. Now there's no reason to download a third party client or run a cable through the length of your house if you want to play with another person. Finding mods and maps is now a lot easier as well. Plus there's a new expansion. It didn't bother me at all to buy this game again even though my discs are still in working order.			"

												Game I played when I was like 7 and recently decided to buy this on steam, and I can say I was not dissapointed, the game is exactly how I remember it although, in the HD version the colors are a bit better but if I had the choice I would just buy the normal AOE 2- but! As this is the only AOE 2 on steam how could I argue. The game controls I can really say as I learnt to use them ages ago and can use them off memory, but I guess are easy to use since if a 7 year old me could use it, it couldn't have been too hard. The grapics are meh for something but for something that came out that far ago I can give it points. I would say that the AI in this game are op as f*** I had it on normal and I strrugled to keep my town from being destroyed although playing online with real people is even harder as most people are really good but playing tis with a friend and teaming up is probably the most fun I have had in ages. This is the type of game you don't really have to put too much effort into for me is a game you can just relax on and its even better playing with friends. Yes I would recommend it but I don't think its worth the price. I would wait for it to drop to about £7-£8			"

												For those who don't know, Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings was released in 1999. After that the Conquerors expansion was released, which almost everyone who has the original Age of Empires II also got. The game is one of the most popular RTS games in existence. It's most fun when played in multiplayer, my friends at college and I love playing multiplayers games all crowded together in one dorm room. Trouble is, we can't play over the summer because the online support for it was dropped years ago (it is an old game). A lot of us were disappointed by this fact, and Microsoft must've found out, because they modified the game to work with Steam's multiplayer system and re-released.What's new and improved in the Steam version of the game:-Slightly updated graphics; almost everything looks exactly the same or identical to the old version, except for the water, which looks a lot better in the new version; the old game looked good (2D graphics), so no change is good here (but the new water is nice)-New resolutions are supported, along with dual monitors (the old game only supported 1280x1024, 1024x768, and 800x600)-There is a new AI, thanks to a recent game update (recent as of 6/29/14)-The max population cap was move from 200 to 500, you can still limit it to all the old settings if you want-All multiplayer works through Steam nowWhat is not so good in the Steam version-The game requires a much better computer to play than the old one; this is actually very obnoxious, the graphics really are not much improved (except the water, of course), but it takes a lot more graphics muscle (yes, not just CPU) to play it smoothly-Multiplayer is rather laggy, almost every game I've played has had a very unpleasant amount of lag; for this reason, if you are not a big fan of the game, you should not get it unless you want to play the campaigns and single player battles (which are still fun); I still play multiplayer almost exclusively, but I really like this game, so that's why-LAN multiplayer isn't an option now; I would hope that it still uses only the LAN when all players are on the local network, but I don't know; however, while I say this is a bad thing, it hasn't actually caused a problem for meApart from what I mentioned above, the game is pretty much exactly like the old game. You can play it with no change in gameplay if you like, by setting the pop cap to 200 or less, and you can even choose to play agains the old AI. The game plays like the 1.0c update of the original Age of Empires II: The Conquerors. Oh, and if you haven't figured it out already, Age of Empires II HD includes all the features of The Conquerors expansion.			"

												Age of Empires 2 is one of those classic games that both old and new players alike can be gripped by the magical world, in a metaphorical sense, which comprises of ancient civilisations and countless converting monks. Having played this game excessively in my childhood, it was a distinct pleasure to be able to purchase it for a mere £2.99 (though if i had known it was on steam i would have payed full price no doubt!) which is an absolute bargain of a price. There are many RTS games out there, some simple, some complex, but none have the same majesty of Age of Empires 2; Age of mythology was a good game, as was AOE 3, but none are just so simple, yet so complex as AOE2 that they can warrant the same price tag in today’s standards.Regarding actual gameplay, it can be said that the graphics look a tad dated, but personally i think it plays to the games strengths, the idle animations are rather quaint, and the sounds as well as the ambiance is all very satisfying; this truly is one game where an hour feels like five minutes, and ""one more game"" becomes the ""one more turn"" curse which has afflicted civilisation in the past!Definitely worth a buy if you; like history; have a penchant for RTS; just want a good game!Wolololo!!

The sound... well, 'sounds' a bit crispier so being able to hear the wololo in all it's glory can't be anything but a plus. However it lacks options in the settings like changing the resolution to your will. But at least it has a better online functionality thanks to steam. Overall, it's just tweakings here and there so I would say unless you want to play online with your friends or you find it on sale (like I did), it's not worth it. However, if you don't have the game already and want to finally jump in, the game is awesome and played for a decade for a reason. It's a very good version, just not exactly worth a new purchase if you have the old one. "

												GREATER POINTSBeing one of the first computer games I've ever been priviledged to play (its predecessor probably being the first), Age of Empires II, even after more than ten years, continues to amaze me. Whether you're raising vast armies to bring your civilization to victory (no doubt with the support of a population enhancement mod), or if you pride yourself on creating the most impenetrable city/fortress known to Medieval man, this game fully supports your input with multiple ways to play, varying maps and map-types, and a near-full arsenal of weapons at your kingly disposal. The 'Forgotten' expansion/DLC brings in even more variety with new civilizations (and hence, new unique units), larger map options, and additional campaigns to follow historically-based figures from their rise to (more often than not) fall. The HD edition itself, although, holds its own quite nicely when the expansion is unavailable.POORER POINTSBeing a ten-year-old game means it certainly shows its age (especially to someone new to the franchise) with 2-D frame-based figures on a mock 3-D map (which several mods on the workshop can significantly improve), outdated AI (which there are mods to replace and improve the AI, even on the workshop), and a slight lack of cultural accuracy (such as the fact that all military units and villagers look the same across all civilizations, form the Britons to the Japanese. No mods I know of currently fix this). No, it's not as militarily-geared as, say, the Total War series or as economically- or culturally-geared as the Civilization series. The HD Edition does little more than increase the default resolution, provide more company labels before the out-of-game menu shows, replace the old water tiles with ""moving"" tiles that simulate waves and the reflection of sunlight that shines in the wrong direction with accordance to all of the building shadows (a mod in the workshop helps fix this), and make the software more compatible with up-to-date PCs.SUMMARYOverall, this is a great starting game for someone not only interested in the Age of Empires franchise (whereas the first game has several lacking mechanics such as land-based trade, detailed troop formations, overpowered units such as the 'Centurions' with 'Priest' support often spammed by the AI, et cetera), but also for someone wanting to introduce themselves to the strategy genre. Even for someone experienced in both categories is Age of Empires II: HD Edition worth taking at the least a look at. Truthfully, I can say that of the three real-time strategies of Ensemble Studios' Age of Empires series (and sadly it doesn't look as if we'll get any more) this one easily takes the lead. Whether that's my nostalgia or the truth speaking, I'll let you find out yourself.Thank you for your time.			"

The multiplayer function online lags at atrociously unplayable these days, and it's still worth every penny.			"

												This game was good but not great. Although, that was probably because I had bought They Breathe before this. They Breathe is the best game since canned bread and for all you guys who like horror games out there, it is for you. I cannot list a single negative attribute to this amazing action adventure drama trilogy game. As you battle your way through moose slug creatures underwater, while rescuing your turtle brethren, your mind will forever be in that lake. The intense realism also adds to the dramtic effect of the flawless stroyline, which I have yet to make sense of. But, yeah, anyhow Age of Empires is okay, I guess.			"

												It's the same game you remember from back in the day, optimized with Steam. There are some great hi-res texture and terrain mods in the workshop, as well as lots of cool taunts and some excellent tutorial videos for if you're looking to get into the multiplayer - which is hella competitive. There's a reason people still play this game when it came out in the freakin' 90s. It's a load of fun, the multiplayer is simple and can be very cempetitive if you're into that. If you just want a retro throwback for your games library, get it on sale. If you're looking for a competitive, classic RTS experience - it's worth every penny.			"

												I still remeber the first time I ever played this game it was around October 31st, 2000. Well in this case it was the first time I saw this game in action. Age of Empires II meant alot to me growing up. I played it a ton as a kid. I played thourgh all the campaigns. I played tons of custom skirmishes against the computer. Thourghout the years I loved this game to death and it is one of my top all time PC games. Since I had this game I went on to get Age of Mythology in 2002, The Wrath of the TItans expansion, and Age of Empires III in October 2005. I was very glad when this went on sale for the holidays! I no longer have to rummage around for the two CDs with this game on it. I love this game and the resolution upgrade is much appreciated. While it is slighly frustating they did not change the game mechanics at all. It is easy to get used to. One just has to put themselves in the mindset of 2000. I hope more people play this game it is a classic!			"

												Still the finest RTS available; long single-player campaigns, deep strategy, and challenging levels keep this game fresh. First played at a  LAN party long ago, and in 2014 enjoying the single player all over again. There are other great RTS games out there, including this game's sequel, Starcraft, Warcraft, C&C, Moon Project, and others... but none come close to the total package of AoE2. On top of this, the Steam version allows you browse tons of mods, including many graphical enhancements, and easily add them to your game without using third party sites or figuring out where to put something. If you enjoy tactical real time strategy; you simply aren't  a gamer if you pass this up.			"

												I've put 2 days of playtime into this game already in little over a month, so I'll put my thoughts out there. Age of Empires 2 is a magnificent RTS game, my personal favourite. I would reccomend it in a heartbeat however this is of course the steam version, hence I will concerntrate on what the steam version offers, seeing as you could just buy a disc copy off amazon for £5.First, the multiplayer support. Whilst in its current state it isn't all it could be, it is perfectly fine for matches with friends. No LAN however so this isn't suitible for LAN parties. Before the steam version I'd have never been able to play with most of my firends; now I played numerous matches & had tonnes of fun.Second, workshop support. This has allowed for some really neat custom maps, scenarios & texture packs. The original game was moddable but this has revived the modding scene for this game, at least for now.As for the HD part, theres no point in buying it for that. It looks the same for the most part, with some nicer water. To its credit though, it does now support modern screen resolutions which is a big plus. Some people don't like the new textures for farms, cliffs etc, but thanks to steam workshop they can be modded to be like the original or into something new.There are achievements, records of your playtime & other standard steam accessories. They're nothing special but they don't hinder the game in anyway, and if you like achievements, or knowing how much time you've played the game they are neat functions.My conclusion: If you're wanting it for LAN gaming, don't bother but otherwise it is very much worth getting.

												Age of Empires contains a perfect balancing of micro-management that's easy to learn and a fun challenge to master. It's a four resource game using Wood, Food, Stone, and Gold to build units and research technologies. Villager AI make resources easy to gather with automatic collection after building a resource collection site (ex. build a mine near gold/stone and they gather the nearby gold/stone without command) . Military is based on a ""Rock, Paper, Scissor"" system and is explained very well by unit descriptions in game (ex. Pikeman > Cavalry > Swordsman > Pikeman). There are many civilizations each with specialty units and technologies, unique civilization traits, and various access limitations to the primary tech tree. So different civilizations will have varied success to each player based on one's own play style (ex. Huns, which start with max population cap, are great for early game rushing but have difficulty late game against more advanced units since they have very limited tech).			"

												Great game buy it. Classic game remastered making it exceptional. The nostalgic value I got from replaying this was amazing and the replay value of the game makes it a great bang for your buck. I definitely recommend checking the workshop for mods to change some of the textures back to the originals to give it the real feel of the original.			"

												This game is great. Unlike most popular RTS games from Blizzard, which emphasizes more on micromanagement or the hero than macro and only requires harvesting two different types of resources, in the Age of Empires series, one has to deal with four types of resources and there are different ways of acquiring them. In Blizzard RTS games one sees combat with their opponent much sooner whereas in Age of Empires I & II, the average timing for the first tier occurs roughly at about 12-13 minutes, 15-16 minutes for the second tier, and roughly around 28-30 minutes for the third. This really depends on whether or not the player rushes or booms.This series stands out simply because each map type is unique so players are expected to be more alert and adapt to their situation, where Blizzard's games have the exact same map.In AoE2, there are 13 civilizations, each with it's own unique characteristics, hence build order. To be good at RM or DM, you will need to know, not only the build order for that civlization, but how to counter the strengths and exploit weaknesses against your opponents civilization.There are limitations to the HD version on steam in that the game lobby is still based on the original concept and the player statistics aren't well recorded. However, one can simply download the compatibility patch to play on Voobly.com which offers a more competitive environment and more!			"

												This is by far my favorite RTS game for many reasons. A defeat is not treated as a failure, but more as a lesson. It will make you build your economy dexterously and assemble your army ealier in the match next time. The graphics are applealing to the eye, even in the 1999 version. A perfect balence of colors and lighting make the game what it is. Each civilization is unique by having their own units and upgrades. They are all balenced, so you can not defeat another player by rushing your civilization's only special units. Also, thanks to the HD version, multiplayer is back without having to use a 3rd party client (ex. Vlooby). A perfect and entertaining game to play at an LAN party, or hell, anywhere.Too bad AoE 3 was ♥♥♥♥ing trash.			"

												Age of Empires II is one of the best Strategy games ever made. I played the original for years, less in recent years because the game does not run well on recent PC's. Now we have a HD version. It is pretty much the same game, with graphics that are somewhat improved. Not that much however, but it is enough.Two big positive points are the mod support thanks to steam workshop, and the now offical add-on The Forgotten. I do consider the price too high, I only recommend a buy during a sale. I bought it myself during a sale, having resisted buying it when it came out.Overall i rate this remake with a 6,5 out of 10.

												Great game if you played it in your childhood and are looking for nostalgia or even if you've never played before but be careful if you buy it. There are still several issues that are slowly, very slowly getting fixed via patches that are considerably spaced out.Edit 5/12/14:I've had this game since the day it came out, and in the past year and a month, the developers have made significant improvements to this game. One such being an actual attack move command, and various other things such as bug fixes. They released an expansion to the game, as well as many free campaigns. One of the best things about this game is the Steam Workshop which adds many useful mods or user-made campaigns and scenarios. I would still recommend this game, but I would wait for it to go on sale. There have been many sales in which AoEHD2 is $5, and with the expansion is $7.50 or somewhere around that price. Definitely worth waiting until this Summer for the sales, rather than spending $30-35 dollars in my opinion.			"

												One of my past childhood favorites, worth the money spent, especially when it's put upon sale.Historical accuracy? For the most part, yes. Even the way they died is often accurate. It's mainly reenacting the famous battles during the middle ages, with you acting as the commander. There are some instances that aren't as accurate. The new expansion adds five more nations to the fold, effectively making it so there is twenty-three nations in total. Whereas the best part is that despite having the same generic units, and having only one or two unique units to each and their own.The outcome of the battle can truly be decided with what technology and talents each and every civilization holds, and how much you use it to your advantage.. Where each civilization has four or five, maybe even six bonuses, one of those bonuses going to the team it's on, and itself. They have one unique technology exclusive to it's own nation, and one or two unique units depending on the civilization itself. Not only that these special units are powerful in their own field, but they're exclusive to your nation and anyone else being of the same nation. Therefore making it so the only way to get those units when not being of that nation is to convert them.Each civilization has it's own playstyle, defensive or offensive, no matter what, you need to use those traits to an entire advantage. On top of that, said civilizations have their own technology trees, which has some historical inaccuracy, sadly. Though these trees balance the game a little as well. Though when in control of a civilization, you need to know not only it's strengths, but it's flaws, and how to combat them.The HD version changes actually, very little of the same, safe for graphics that were revised, the gameplay and controls were not touched one bit, therefore allowing any Age of Empires veteran to join in the fun.The new expansion is worth it, by adding more civilizations, technologies, and units to play around with. So with that, this game is good for those who love a historically accurate real-time-strategy type game. Where each and every civilization has those aforementioned strengths and difficulties.So, what are you waiting for? Hit that green button.			"

												I picked this up because there was a pricing error for the complete edition on amazon during a sale a couple years ago and finally got around to playing it, so by no means am I a die hard fan of the series. From a campaign standpoint, the learning curve is more of an angle. It's quite difficult to hold your own in the campaign on the easiest difficulty even if you are new to it. I would have put more time into it if I had been more interested in the content, but it just made me butthurt. However, this level of difficulty was later corrected in III and Mythologies. Aside from that, the game is remarkable in terms of content, relplayability through online multiplayer, and a nearly perfect relationship between developers and community. If anything, this over a decade old game has amassed an amazing following who provide a great deal of Workshop content (which I would familiarize myself with before pressing Play, as some mods fix graphical issues). The fact that they just released DLC a month ago proves my point. If RTS' are your main squeeze, buy this on sale or not. You will log hundereds of hours into this.			"

												I replayed the original expansions and had a blast. I finished them and still wanted more, so I purchased The Forgotten. (I purchased it on another account that has games shared with this account.) The first Italian campaign was a blast (although a little bit buggy) and was a good challenge on hard mode. However, on the second campaign, the enemy AIs are broken. They don't attack at all on any of the levels. It's pretty disappointing to set up a base for thirty minutes and realize that no attacks are ever going to come. I started some other campaigns and the attacks work just fine, but what's up with the Dracula campaigns?			"

												Easily one of the best RTS games of all time -- right up there with Starcraft. Still tremendously popular and if you get the Forgotten Expansion, you'll love the bit of extra variety it breathes into this old classic.If you're reading this, you probably alread own the CD version of the game and unless you want to play multiplayer games online, you don't really need the HD version. However, the ease with which you can find games and join lobbies via Steam is well worth the $20 price tag for a game that's older than half my siblings.			"

Age of Kings was my fav expansion and I love playing with the Turks - who doesn't like a little gun power in the Castle Age :-)  Its a great game to play single player with the missions and/or a comp stomp or with your friends.

												AoE II: HD is a re-release and minor graphical update of a circa 2000 RTS, with 18 civilisations to choose from, focuses on the ""dark ages"" to the start of the renaissance era. Each civilisation has 1 or 2 unique units and technologies as well as a varied tech tree (all derived from a standardised tree, though). For single player campaigns, it features: William Wallace, Joan of Arc, Barbarossa, Saladin, Genghis Khan, El Cid, Montezuma and Attila the Hun. It also has up to 8 player multiplayer with various game modes such as regicide, death match, king of the hill and defend the wonder. This also includes AI skirmish capability for solo play. In addition, there are also many user created scenarios available to play that can be downloaded from the workshop.Although at first, this may be thought of as a money-grabbing exercise, this breathes  new life into a formerly slowly dying community, allows easier multiplayer without a 3rd party service and has fresh workshop content as well as bringing this old game to a new generation of players.Although graphically dated, it still has great RTS mechanics and if you want to play a classic RTS with good multiplayer play, this is a game you'll want. Also for those who feel nostalgic and want to play AoE II with support for ""HD"" resolutions.			"

Fast paced action combined with different army compositions create a never ending fungasm of warfare over a variety of generated maps.Despite the lag on multiplayer, it is still bearable in LAN partys if you can make them. The Workshop is definetly an added bonus and they at least fix the issues in the campaigns when reported.The only thing I would really not recommend this game for is if you only play for the competitive multiplayer, the ranking system is very strict and dropping out is a major problem combined with certain compatibility issues with downloaded addons.

												Age of Empires 2 was already my favorite RTS of all time.  Excellent balance between civs, outstanding civ selection, outstanding map and game mode variety, good balance between economy management and combat as well and macro vs micro control.  Controls are tight and system specs are relatively low.  Basically, by virtually any measure of an RTS this game, this game nails it.  Of course the graphics are still relatively dated but the color palette and sprites used are still just fine and rather pleasant to look at.  Even before this reboot, there was a lot to this game, but now there is tons of new, worthwhile content that complements what was already there.  Multiplayer is now easy and worthwhile with matchmaking and an elo system that should put you in the same ballpark as your opponent.  Definitely pick up this edition, the Steam Workshop makes mods a snap.  My only gripes, and they are minor,  multiplayer sometimes lags and there still isn't a ""make your own civ"" options for singleplayer/non-ranked multiplayer games despite all the development that has gone into it to date.  These things take nothing from what is already here however.  This is a classic in the best sense of the term.  Score 9.6			"

												Definitely one of the best real-time-strategy games ever made. This also includes of the age of empires games as well as the great Age of Mythology. Ever since this game came out and I got my hands on it I couldn't stop playing for the longest time, sometimes I would keep on playing for more than 3 hours! I'm so glad that this game was remade HD for the newer computers since the old one doesn't work well with the new technology. I definitely recommend this game if you want to have fun, kill time, and use your brain!			"

												AoE II: HD is a re-release and minor graphical update of a circa 2000 RTS, with 18 civilisations to choose from, focuses on the ""dark ages"" to the start of the renaissance era. Each civilisation has 1 or 2 unique units and technologies as well as a varied tech tree (all derived from a standardised tree, though). For single player campaigns, it features: William Wallace, Joan of Arc, Barbarossa, Saladin, Genghis Khan, El Cid, Montezuma and Attila the Hun. It also has up to 8 player multiplayer with various game modes such as regicide, death match, king of the hill and defend the wonder. This also includes AI skirmish capability for solo play. In addition, there are also many user created scenarios available to play that can be downloaded from the workshop.Although at first, this may be thought of as a money-grabbing exercise, this breathes  new life into a formerly slowly dying community, allows easier multiplayer without a 3rd party service and has fresh workshop content as well as bringing this old game to a new generation of players.Although graphically dated, it still has great RTS mechanics and if you want to play a classic RTS with good multiplayer play, this is a game you'll want. Also for those who feel nostalgic and want to play AoE II with support for ""HD"" resolutions.			"

												tl;dr 8/10; this is as good as the original, but DLC is really what makes it, though it's a bit overpriced, so get it on sale.A classic RTS resurrected, this is a good buy. I say good in order to avoid ""excellent"", because to be honest with the standard the game is as the title says: an HD version of AoE2. Because of that, it's got the same features as the original game just in HD. The HD is good, but is best seen on things like water and fire. Units are all the same, no changes here. Pluses though are the inclusion of the Workshop and hosting the servers on Steam, as I know it's hard to find matches for the original version. The inclusion of achievments as well is a plus for those into that thing, as well as trading cards. The Forgotten is really where this version shines though. The inclusion of new campaigns and civilizations are great, as well as the new techs in the Castle Age. They went a bit wild with the renaming of units and making some new ones (like a seemingly pointless AoE1 Broad Swordsman and ""Nordic"" and ""Eastern"" Swordsmen), but I digress. Campaigns have no narmy VAs sadly but are fun nonetheless with okay storyelling. The Encylcopedia was expanded for The Forgotten civs. Sadly this meant that the standard HD edition's encyclopedia is messed up. You can interchange between both the Forgotten and HD edition instantly though.However a problem occurs with how faction changes and patches don't carry over between the two, though this only really affects Campaigns (if you have Forgotten you can just play the same civs in MP with the changes). So low pop limits, old tech trees, and stuff still occur in the original campaigns.Another problem I have is the price tag of $29.99. It's a bit too much for a re-release in my opinion, since you can pick up the original version (including Conquerors) for at most $10 somewhere else. The Forgotten DLC is $14.99 as well so my suggestion is just get both on sale if you're going to get it at all. The game's great as the original though and the Forgotten is fun. I still recommend this game to anyone who wants to play this great game once more. I know I play it regularly, and I have more reason to with this on Steam.			"

People still quit as soon as they get attacked. ~AOk changing r eview  THe devs DID fix some of the bugs I havent gotten an out of sync in awhile So its getting a good review now :D THere are still problems with the player base but oh well thats all steam games THere's also AOE2lobbycom if you want a better lobby browser			"

												Firstly, the metascore for this game (For those who care) is misleading. The game as you remember it is quite well intact, and good as ever it was. However, the transition to Steam and ""HD"" is very underwhelming. It offers very little that makes it worth its price tag should you already own it (And cetain ""Expansions"" from elsewhere) and what is does offer is often disappointing. The HD, while nice, is almost unoticeable from the original. The online play, which I would venture many desire from this, is unimpresive and fickle to work with. Steam Workshop so far does not seem to add much to the game either, aside to make minute changes, the return a lot of the smaller HD changes to their previous form. Strangely, AoE suffers from problems that you would think extinct in this age. There are issues with it no properly accessing multople CPU cores, causing clientside lag, and issues with connectivity causing Desyncs and connection lag. In summary, the game itself is about as fine as it ever has been, and its expansion is enjoyable, but unless you suffer compatibility issues you can't be bothered to or otherwise lack the capacity to figure out (Like myself) you would be better off with the original. If you are simply looking for a way to bring AoE to the Steam community and play with friends then yes it does that and I recommend it for you.			"

												First of all, a little context bias: I grew up with this game. I suck at this game. I'm not an RTS guy.That said - fantastic game. I've played all of the AoE games. This one rises above them all. The graphics are dated, but a lot of effort went into them, and it looks genuinely great despite. Gameplay is not only fun, but satisfying and challenging if played online or against a harder AI. Campaign games can become ruthlessly difficult at least for a simpleton like I, but they're not really the main attraction of the game. The best strategic fun is found in the random map modes, both on and offline. I can't say for sure whether the gameplay is accessible enough for someone completely new to the series, but many years ago, I managed to get completely hooked on this game. Matches can be tense and tactical from start to finish, but they can also be very therepeutic on easier difficulties if that's your thing.In conclusion. Instant classic. Best in series. Good game to get into strategy games. Good game to stay in strategy.Mandatory WOLOLO. "

Multiplayer is still laggy sometimes, but apart from that, they took every aspect of the game that wasn't working (such as colors on Windows 7, unless you killed explorer.exe), polished it and sold it.

												One of the best RTS games to ever exist, this is one of Microsoft Games' crowning jewels that still holds up to any present strategy game.  It is simple on it's surface, but the mechanics and strategy involved are actually quite complex and difficult to master.  That said, the controls can be a bit sticky at first, in that placement of buildings is something that you have to be careful about and troop movement can be a little finicky if you are not paying attention.  The tutorials in this teach you all you need to know to jump right into one of the many unique campaigns.  If the campaigns aren't your style than there is the free game mode where you can set up your game to play with up to 8 computer or human players (LAN or online, hotseat not supported) on a randomly seeded map or select a specific type, size, and syle of map or even a specific seed in one of the games many different modes.  Playing LAN or online is a great way to kill a couple of hours with friends.  Feeling creative?  This game also features a custom map option and custom campaign option that is as in depth or shallow as you like.  On the maps you can start with a blank slate of any of the standard sizes or you can start with a seeded map that you mod to fit you needs.  The campaign builder lets you create objectives and a story to share with the rest of the world or just to play through by yourself or with some friends.This is a classic RTS that is a great introduction to the genre, one any stratagy game lover sould own, and anyone who likes medieval simulation games can't go wrong with.  It has stood the test of time and now with the addition of two new expansions and steam workshop there are almost limitless possibilities. All in all I would give this game a 10/10.			"

												This game is nostalgia for a good price.  The music is a little different, but the feeling is still there.  With the Steam achievements to go with it, Age of Empires II is a lot more entertaining than it used to be.  I highly recommend it for those who played it when it first came out thirteen years ago.

												As a personal ruse master this game appealed to me a lot, mainly because I played with my friends secretly alligned with one of them then he alligned with the other 2 and said that I was going to attack and they allowed him to join their defence. As I started attacking them my friend un-allied with them and we wiped their base clean. Ruse executed.			"

												I don't know why people are not recommending this. This HD release is a blast.I haven't been able to play my Conqueror's disk in about 6 years due to incompatibility and crash issues. This release solves all of that. I'm more than happy to shell our $20 for a re-release of a game that actually runs on modern computers.			"

												Amazing nostalgia feeeling when playing this game. If you love RTS games then you have to play this game. Not only was it was one of the foundations of RTS games as they are today it can still hold its own against more modern games and I would say that it is actually better than AoE III.			"

												Ok for one, i get it, we are old! but these games still rule, especially if you are poor!  I mean if you lack the RAM and other necessary requirements to play the newer games, than just get a game like AOE 2, these classics are still playable with friends and can easily cost a few hours of your life to get some worthless achievements, (sorry they are worth gems) XD regardless my point stands, great game. I recommend this to any new RTS players, pretty basic but also pretty intense if you do not know what you are doing. Thinking your playing Civs 5 will get your♥♥♥♥♥♥handed to you quick, comps are unforgiving as they build and destroy, plainly put. There are also hours to be had building custom maps and scenarios, meaning, yes i have spent countless hours on such an endeavor, the fact still remains. The only thing i am rather dissapointed with is the workshop.. i figured by this time, there would be signifigant progress in mods, and in an accessable manner. This could be said for most of the great ones, i mean come now, has noone thought of making a star wars mod? or maybe a Warhammer mod? but enough said on mods, let's move on to my valid point here. This is a good game, lots of history and easy to get to know. By this point you have probably played some pretty decent games, have fun with that, we are still playing great games ! :D			"

												Though not as fun as the original, this game brings back memories of one of the greatest strategy games ever to be created. Fast paced action combined with different army compositions create a never ending fungasm of warfare over a variety of generated maps.Despite the lag on multiplayer, it is still bearable in LAN partys if you can make them. The Workshop is definetly an added bonus and they at least fix the issues in the campaigns when reported.The only thing I would really not recommend this game for is if you only play for the competitive multiplayer, the ranking system is very strict and dropping out is a major problem combined with certain compatibility issues with downloaded addons.

												Age of Empires is undoubtedly best game in history of mankind, thats why I am so dissapointed that I suck at it and get beaten up by AI. Well, considering the fact that chess world champion got beaten up in chess by AI as early as 1997 I shouldn't be so upset, guess I'll try again....*30minutes later* Somehow AI converted my catapults to Islam! Can't even imagine what would happen if Islamic State would convert our nuclear warheads to Islam.Guess warfare is not for me, I'll just enjoy exploring map with my sheep.			"

												Ya know why you should buy this game? So you can PlayOE! (Play Age Of Empires)But seriously here is a list of criteria you need to have fun with this game:1. You need to like strategizing in real time.2. You need to be okay with micro-managing.3. You need to be have time to play this game, you CAN save and exit games, but it is much better if you can play a round in one go.And if you want to play the multiplayer: 4. You need to have at least 3 friends who meet these criteria and have the game, it works best with at least 4 people, it is ok with only 3 but the more the merrier.5. You need to be able to negogtiate, it is a lot more fun to make trades and alliances then just always kill.6. You need to have the steam version, otherwise to play multiplayer you need to be on lan.Okay, now a list of pros and cons for single player:+ The campaign is amazingly well done and is very fun.- The new AI is derpier than the original, it makes it hard to play against AI on a quick match, but they work on the campaign.This list really isnt complete, but single player isnt really the best part of the game.

												Worthy of any RTS awards! Great classic strategic combat with a HD improvement, nicely balanced building and resource management. It may be an older game now, but its just as good as any of the modern 5 star RTS.  Excellent multiplayer and tierd campaigns to play.Just as good if not better then age of empires 3, and still has an active community.This is one of those games that will stay with you like a jeweld golden tooth, and you tell the developers put their blood swet and tears into this game to make it what it has become.

												Well This game deserves to be a 9/10. Why? Lets go over with the basics: Age of Empires II was at a score of 92% while the Conquerors expansion is about 88% in total reviews. This game includes the actual Ages of Kings as well as the Conquerors. The gameplay in fact is the same as having those two games (nothing new except for the 500 population cap, widescreen support, Steam Workshop, Steam servers and leaderboard). The water, fire, cliffs, trees and effects have changed in order to make the game more HD. Single player is still the same but for the multiplayer, it was fixed before (last time, the players were out of sync). Well, this game deserves a gold.			"

Since the HD versions release joining and creating matches have been much easier. With Steam's In-game friend invites playing matches with your friends is as easy as two clicks. I would have to rate this 9/10. I rate it so highly since I really like the small fixes they made to make it better, but they where able to keep the old vibe still alive.			"

												DISCLAIMER: I'm not a multiplayer person, so can't comment much on that aspectIt's the same good old AOE II we loved and played nonstop few years backs. That's the biggest PRO and biggest CON at the same time though...HD version pretty much just means that you can run it on current widescreen resolutions. The whole game is zoomed out quite a bit compared to the original. I expected them to update textures and make the game a bit prettier. None of that happened though, the only updated visuals seem to be water surfaces, which looks wavy and animated now. Units still look pixely, same for buildings.I didn't notice any updates to controls, UI, etc. It's still the same, but hey don't change what works I guess.Apart from the Forgotten ""expansion"" there is no new added content. But tbh Forgotten seems more like an official mod than a legit expansion. Added campaigns have no voiceovers, they added some new nations, too. But no technologies or any major stuff like AoC did to original AoE2.Would I recommend it? If you loved old AoE2 then yes, it is quite fun. Don't expect any new experience or mind blowing innovations. I'm a bit skeptical about paying 20 euros for such an old game with just a resolution update though. With that said it seems to go on sale quite often, so consider getting it then.			"

Upgraded graphics, sounds and music along with Steam Workshop integration allow the player to create and distribute mods freely whilst at the same time preserving the original along with the multiplayer experience.

												Classic. If you don't have it, you're missing out. Period. I used to sit around and draw unit formation ideas on paper. That's how obsessed I was with this game. Still love every bit of it. But 20 euros? What? This game is so old it should be a lot cheaper. It's worth the price, mind you, but I totally got it on sale. The new DLC's are pretty sweet, too, but not as detailed as the original stuff.			"

												Age of Empires II will never die.The best RTS of all time. Used to play it every-day for years. The HD edition is definitely worth it to grab when it goes on sale. The lobby system is great, and games are always available, or easy to create with friends. Can play in actual high-resolution, and a few other tweaks that brings a classic game up to date.My harshest rating would be a 9.9/10 for the fact I get owned everytime on water maps. :PWoo-loo-loo.14			"

												Age of Empires II in it's day was epic, thanks to the steam community and workshop it is once again a fantastic game to play online with great content. The stratagy in this game cannot be under stated, I have played alot and I mean alot of stratagy games, and yes alot have better graphics, they all have something to contribute that is fun, but none of them have come close to this game. Just try and look beyond the dated graphics, look at the level of planning that can be employed the tactics, the ambushes everything is possible with this game. I have played this game for well over 10 years and always I have revisited it time and again to play with friends. If you have never played it before and are looking to buy, it will be money extremely well spent, you wont regret it. BUY IT NOW "

												I still remeber the first time I ever played this game it was around October 31st, 2000. Well in this case it was the first time I saw this game in action. Age of Empires II meant alot to me growing up. I played it a ton as a kid. I played thourgh all the campaigns. I played tons of custom skirmishes against the computer. Thourghout the years I loved this game to death and it is one of my top all time PC games. Since I had this game I went on to get Age of Mythology in 2002, The Wrath of the TItans expansion, and Age of Empires III in October 2005. I was very glad when this went on sale for the holidays! I no longer have to rummage around for the two CDs with this game on it. I love this game and the resolution upgrade is much appreciated. While it is slighly frustating they did not change the game mechanics at all. It is easy to get used to. One just has to put themselves in the mindset of 2000. I hope more people play this game it is a classic!			"

												Still the finest RTS available; long single-player campaigns, deep strategy, and challenging levels keep this game fresh. First played at a  LAN party long ago, and in 2014 enjoying the single player all over again. There are other great RTS games out there, including this game's sequel, Starcraft, Warcraft, C&C, Moon Project, and others... but none come close to the total package of AoE2. On top of this, the Steam version allows you browse tons of mods, including many graphical enhancements, and easily add them to your game without using third party sites or figuring out where to put something. If you enjoy tactical real time strategy; you simply aren't  a gamer if you pass this up.			"

												Fantastic remake of the original game.The content and gameplay is all the same, so if you are looking for something fresh and new look elsewhere. The only differences are that the water looks shiny, you can play at HD resolutions, and there is online multiplayer matchmaking using steam servers. Ah, and the population capacity has been raised to 500! If you were a fan of the original game, deffinitly worth the buy here on steam. If you're new to the series I still highly suggest it!			"

												movie games are almost never goodand this game is based on the upcoming movie ""star wars VII: age of the empire""but the main problems with this game is that it all takes place on one planet, and there's no space combat. i think it takes place on tatooine. i just dont understand why all players play as rebel scumstar wars VII is not a very good movie game, but then again I haven't seen the movie, maybe it's exactly like thisin conclusionas a movie game: 1/10as a game: 10/10			"

												How do I turn this on?Brings back memories from way back when, playing endless skirmishes and laying the smackdown with Teutonic Knights and Hand Cannoneers.  I got this for the nostalgia, kept playing because it's a damn good game.  Sure, there's small things that bother me here and there about a game this old, but considering all of the upsides, it's hard to deny that this game is a classic.Along with Steam Workshop, the possibilites are endless when playing these games.  I'm playing with 1000 population max on ""LudiKRIS"" map sizes with a full house of AI.  All gold mines, stone quarries, and farms have 50,000 resources and I can keep throwing units at the enemies across the map.  Sure, it's not how it's meant to be played, but damn is it fun.  Sure, the Attack-Move that we are all so used to is pretty bad, but it's one of the small sacrifices in playing a game such as this.If you enjoyed it back then, you'll enjoy it now.			"

With the ability to customize the game through Steam Workshop, the incredibly simple way to connect to another game and not to mention the slight increase of graphics to high definition, this game is worth every penny. If you are a fan of the Age of Empires series, or even a real-time strategy enthusiast, this game is a must have.  So stop reading this and go purchase a copy so that you might reign supreme over your friends and enemies. Wololo!			"

												Age of Empires II is a classic and a must-buy for anyone into the RTS-genre. Even though the HD version has some perks, it makes it easier to play an online game, has no more silly water on W7>, has fewer connection issues (mind I say fewer, not none, this will always remain a part of the game where you spend more time setting up a game than actually playing) and maps are directly downloadable via the workshop. I also recommend getting the extra DLC The Forgotten as it gives new civilizations and really adds something to the game. Creating my own maps never gets old as well as playing others. The time you will spent on this game will definitely be of good value.I still give this game 9/10.			"

Posted: April 26, 2014
												Time makes fools of us all. When Age of Empires II was originally released in 1999 it was simply an astounding game. Between the multitude of civilizations, random maps, deep campaign, and multiple gameplay modes a person could play for hundreds of hours EASY and never touch the additional content. When such stuff was touched not only could people play in tense multiplayer matches but there was a detailed scenario editor that allowed us to make whatever we saw fit. It seemed truly revolutionary, truly amazing to have such control and seemingly unlimited possibilities. Then the expansion came out and even more was added. For a time it seemed as if Age of Empires would change the face of gaming.That was in 1999. It's now 2013 and the game has finally been re-released for a new generation to play. Does it still hold water? Or is it a relic of the past best left to be admired and forgotten?The answer is 'both'.First off the good. The gameplay, which has always been Age of Empire's strong point, is still amazingly strong. Age of Empires, since the day it was first made, has always slowed down the gameplay in favor of more drawn out and epic engagements which the series still manages to preform wonderfully. This is not, nor ever has been, a game about having towering champions that fight through slews of foes with carefully timed spells and abilities. This has been a game about armies clashing while heavy sieges rage on and allies preform expert flanking maneuvers with well-developed armies to allow you the chance to win. And Age of Empires plays to this wonderfully. Almost everything is run smoothly and battles can reach truly epic scales. When playing with my friend a battle happened where a massive army of invading Franks smashed up against my Persian walls and I needed to preform a desperate scramble for resources to develop and field a few war elephants to fend them off while my British friend sent a small squad of longbowmen to aid in my defense while he flanked around back and laid into their now-undefended town. The entire battle hinged on if the Franks could break my wall before my friend reached their town. It was fierce and over a hundred units must have died in that one battle alone, but the wall survived with 95 HP left.Such epic-scale battles happen with frequency in this game. With the defensive focus it is very possible for games to become very long, drawn-out, and epic. Simply allowing the player to build walls alone grants a unique perspective not easily found in other RTS's while the slower development times and option for in-depth research makes it so that every battle will truly be distinct as it will be hard to find opponents who play the exact same way. To top it off, the random map function increases the replayability immensely. Having a completely new and different map every game allows for every game to unfold in a different manner. Age of Empires fits very well into the 'easy to learn, difficult to master' category while never being too brutal or too easy.Additionally much off the campaign is wonderfully detailed still and very challenging. Though it lacks the technical depth found in more modern RTS's the sheer size and detail allow for many hours to be sunk just chewing through the default campaign. That's not to mention that many of the campaigns are very fun and enjoyable and can easily end up being played multiple times.Lastly the inclusion of the Steam Workshop is wonderful. Allowing people to create and modify some of the game content and create and share their own scenarios makes it so that the game will, almost certainly, endure for many years to come.And now for the bad.The game has clearly aged. It came out in 1999 and it plays like it did so. Many simple conveniences that would have been easy to implement, some of which were in later titles, are simply non-existent. Things like an auto-explore button which would have helped out with the early game simply do NOT exist. The limit on the number of selectable units is also particularly annoying when there is no need for such a limitation. Even minor technical bugs, like trebuchets unpacking as if they had 17 range when they only have 16 (this means you need to manually pilot each into range instead of simply telling them to attack a building) persist despite that they should have been corrected long ago.Additionally, despite being a 'HD' version, many of the graphics are simply not 'HD' quality. It's very easy to see individual frames on buildings with motion, like mills, which ruins the whole point of making it 'HD'. Though this is alleviated somewhat by steam workshop mods, the obliviousness to detail makes people who haven't spent time figuring out the 'best' graphics patches truly jarring. To say nothing of how cumbersome many of the sprites function, often lacking true sprites for a given direction and simply going with the animation closest which results in things like people managing to walk diagonally while facing right.Too add to this, the scenario editor that gathered much praise originally simply lacks the detail it once had, and could have easily obtained. Simple things like allowing players to edit all of a unit stats instead of a select few and allowing players to make their own, unique, civilizations were not included, despite these potentially offering much replayability. And to put the icing on the cake, the achievements tend to act buggily, sometimes not registering until the next time the person plays the game or later instead of appearing on the spot.The Verdict: On the whole Age of Empires II HD plays more like a port of the original game with some minor graphics upgrades, tacked-on Steam Workshop, and few other, similar, upgrades. On the positive, it retains much of the original charm that caused the original to be a classic. On the negative, it retains so much of the original charm it fails to take advantage of the more than ten years of improvements that have come out since then, both in other RTS's and in their own series of games. If you were a fan of the original and no longer have your disks or are unable to use them due to many years of use, you will almost certainly enjoy this game. If you are not, if you enjoy it or not will likely come down to the deciding factor of 'are you willing to play a game that, basically was made 14 years ago and plays like it'. If you are willing, Age of Empires HD offers loads of depth and replayability that can keep you entertained easily for well over 100 hours without even truly scratching the surface. Otherwise, it's a relic from a bygone era best looked at, admired, and then moved on from.My value: For a fan: $15.00-20.00For a newbie: $10.00			"

												Well, a couple of days ago I bought Age of Empires II on Steam, because I have so many fond memories of playing it as a kid. The thing that got me worried though was that I wasn't sure whether I would still enjoy it now... I couldn't have been more wrong! Man I used to play this game on my crappy old laptop, it was so much fun! I remember making whole maps with oceans and forests, then starting from the dark ages with a few villagers to make it to the imperial age whilst fighting off armies of intruders from the inky blackness of the unexplored regions. It really is a fun game to play and here are some of the reasons why:1) There are so many customisation possibilities, you can make almost any scenario imaginable (well, as long as they are historical ones). There is a fully customisable map editor, where you can build anything from natural landscapes to villages and cities. In this editor you can also change the game type (conquest, king of the hill etc.) and the enemies you face (including their civilisation, eg. the vikings). There are up to seven AI controlled players to either battle with, or even form alliances and trade.2) The mixture of building an thriving economy, amassing a formidable army and furthering your civilisation with loads of technologies to research (which differ between civilisations), makes gameplay rewarding and addictive. There is nothing better than watching your civilisation grow and prosper from a tiny group of villagers with a town centre into an amazing city, producing forces to bring your enemies to their knees!3) There is a great campaign mode that is both fun and challenging. The campaigns are split up into different historical events (for example, the tutorial features the Scottish battles against Edward Longshanks' English forces) and feature figures such as Joan of Arc and Atilla the Hun. It's surprising how much detail has gone into these campaigns when it so easy to make your own games; there are fully voiced introductions to each of the missions, and numerous objectives and optional missions to complete each time.4) With the introduction of the title onto Steam, there has been a complete revamp of the online features. There is a whole community of players with which to battle and ally yourself with (admittedly I haven't tried the online features yet, but they do look promising). Steam has also introduced achievements and trading cards to the game, which can only make things better right? However one of the best things about moving onto steam though is the fact that there are so many mods available! (right now I have a mod that includes Arnold Schwarzeneggar taunts to my sound list) My one gripe with the game is something that I believe has been many peoples' concerns since the game was first released back in 1999; the AI can be pretty awkward sometimes. This usually comes through when your army runs off without you noticing to pursue a single enemy scout, only to be slaughtered when they reach the enemy stronghold. Or you build an amazing empire to realise that the enemy hasn't built a single thing... they have just chopped down every tree on the map (why this happened I have no idea). The one thing I will say about this is that the AI on the new steam version is updated (and so are the graphics, huzzah!) and doesn't seem as silly as before, and there are updates still coming. All in all though, I think that this game is completely worth your time and money, and will keep you entertained for hours, so grab a copy or download it from steam, you won't regret it!The Fox Eyed Man's Rating: 8.5/10			"

												I have put countless hours into this game since it was originally released and it's nice to see AoE2 being revived with new DLC and a fairly active community after all these years. This game is well worth the money especially if you grew up playing, the convenience of the HD edition means you don't have to worry about finding patches and if the game will crash or not, (if installed from the original disks the game would crash with newer graphics cards and widescreen resolutions because, put simply, when the game was created, it wasn't created for widescreen resolutions).

The broken AI from the original is finnaly fixed, the hardest difficulty now is fairly impossible to get beaten. The AI is really smart (IT has its bugs-bads tho). Anyways, it is the best strategy game I have played, I prefer it from Rise of Nations and I recommend to give the 20 Eu to buy it right now.			"

												AoE2 is a vintage RTS. Its quite good. You could explain it in a nutshell as being civilization - the RTS. Each civ has unique units and bonuses and there is a good selection of units and upgrades to build a strategy around. This version is updated with better resolution, steam workshop support and multiplayer support. The workshop has a huge selection of maps and scenarios. There are also 2 expansion packs that have been released after the positive reception the steam version has had and while I haven't played them they seem to be getting a lot of love.Good - game is goodBad - graphics are a little dated by today's standardsrecommended to anyone who enjoys RTSs, this is a classic 4/5  (5/5 if you ask me from 15 years ago)			"
