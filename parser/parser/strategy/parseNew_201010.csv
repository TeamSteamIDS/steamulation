												The very first game I played was geneforge 1 and once I did I knew I wanted to keep playing video games. The series as a whole Is wonderfully amazing, almost endless possiabilties, its own lore, challenging bosses, limitless followers if you spend points in shapping. Eahc game seperatly however is quite a diffrent story. Like any gamer I have ones I like and ones I wouldn't be to upset If I never got to play again. Lets start with the first 1; Very involving, you can get attached to your first creature if your not careful, the story is awesome, I recomend reading anything you find for back story, and always avoid anything you don't think you can take. The second on; It's not the best geneforge game but its not the worst in my opinion, didn't play much of it but what I did play I didn't care too much for. The third, By far my second favorite one, I could go on and on about everything I loved in it. The 4th could care less if I was unable to play, Its good and leads you up to the 5th but its  tedious and irrating at the best. The 5th is the best in my opinion. Great graphics, new montsers, new creature to shap, wide ammount of areas to explore, many differnt paths to chose, my only probelm with it are the plants that stun you and the white beasts in the middle of the map. Back to the series as a whole, my only 3 issues with it are 1.) Turn based combat annoys me now adays hard for a game to impress me with turn based combat. 2.) Oppenets having laser sight and can see you even behind them quite annoying had to redo missions a lot. 3.) While albeit an old game I would love voice acting. It would just add so much more to the games. In all the geneforge saga is one of if not the best game series' I have ever played in my life.			"

												previous Geneforge 4 reviewGeneforge 5Graphics: Better graphics and lighting effects than the previous four Geneforge.Control: Nice and not-so-clear dramatic tutorial, fixed key binding.Replayability: Somewhat High.The cliche of this game is... you are amnesic! hurray! But most of the important characters know who you are... and none of them will tell you out of the kindness of their hearts. All of them will exploit you and profit of the actions of the 'mysterious stranger'. You can be an obedient Shaper tool and happily slaughter Rebel scum and Unbound, the Mad Lizard's mad glowing lizards. I killed about 20 Unbound, if I missed some I will appreciate information on their whereabouts to clean Terrestria for good.Of course you can be Rebel scum as well but... Why?The narrative is good, the freedom is back. I enjoyed playing Geneforge 5 almost as much as Geneforge 1. The Geneforge Saga is a perfect cycle: You know who you are but not where you are to you don't know/remember who you are but you know where you are.Things I learned:-Serviles smell bad.-Uss is Drakon speech for 'Fort'.-Drakons become duller every next game.-Wingbolts are OP-I got the 'pleasure' of killing Greta and Ghaldring... again.The end			"

												Great storyline, old school combat/graphics style. Difficulty in torment is legit and with 5 main factions and a myriad of choices, lots of replay value.Gameplay is not simply just about slaughtering everything in your path - stealth and non-combat skills will be needed to clear the game. Monsters don't respawn which means that your experience is limited (in particular, your minions get xp when you get xp); but this is only an important factor (getting minions early means they can level up more by the end game and are thus stronger than 'fresher' ones) in the harder difficulties. Two minor complaints:1.) I can't move the screen easily (arrow keys only) since you're usually clicking with your mouse to move the party and its awkward to have the left hand on the arrow keys to move the screen around2.) A 'solo' style is virtually impossible on the harder difficulties (even with all your points in solo stuff like spells and stats rather than creations)Awesome game, and great bang for the buck!			"

												One of the best RPGs I've ever played. It's every bit as good as the late 1990s infinity engine classics from which it draws its inspiration (in fact, it even rivals my beloved ""Fallout 2"" on many levels).The gameplay, plot, and writing are all top notch, but its biggest success is how it handles choice and consequences. There are 5 separate factions, each with their own political and moral opinions, quests, storylines, and endings. Every choice you make in the game affects how these factions view you, which makes political maneuvering a dimension of gameplay every bit as important as outright combat. Playing the various factions off of each other, allying with them, or betraying them, is endlessly entertaining and there are very few games which balance open world freedom of choice with complexity of plot as well as this one.An awesome end to one of the best RPG series ever.  If you only play one game in the Geneforge series it should be this one.  "

												this is a great rpg. I love spiderweb's games.  It is a turn based rpg, multiple endings and quests are pretty much up to you which ones you take or refuse. You also get a choice of which group to help or even leave one -once you join. It might seem simple but its actually very chalanging. You cant just hack and slash you way throught the battles. You need to use stratigy. Also alot of choices of what class to play and skills to invest in and stats also. The world is huge. The story line is well thought out but not confusing. The game plays well. No glitches, lag, crashes or freezes. The graphics are spiderweb's classic style and I love them.			"

												All 5 parts are very enjoyable and you can get the saga for the price of each game so you may as well get all 5 and play them in order to get a feel to the story, the only drawback to this is 4 and espcially 5 go back to the issue of balance of power you can have up to that point, since stuff generally doesn't respawn, you can only get so powerful by a certain point and be stuck. It's still a worthwhile series and collectively should take about 80-100 hours to beat the entire thing, double that if you want to explore the splitting plotlines.From best to worst (mainly in terms of difficulty) 3, 2, 1, 4, 5.

												This game and in general the entire series is highly intruiging because it has a great and quite fluid story. It has certian setbacks though, the general quality of graphics is noticably not great but the game makes up for this in the quality of the story. The general feeling of making gigantic monsters tofight other monsters and then you make even more monsters, just feels good in away. I would recomend this game hily for anyone who enjoys a good storyline rpg game.			"

												Most imaginative and unconventional RPG series (with a compelling story-line) that Spiderweb Software ever made. Could never get into Avadon, sadly, because it's not Geneforge, and I want Geneforge.Would recommend playing from the first game if you're new to the series (there are a couple of recurring character names and a few references to past events, though it doesn't matter *too* much since you play as a new person in each sequel); note that the graphics of the older games are a bit dated but if you're playing any Spiderweb game, then you're only in love with the storytelling - and you probably don't care too much for eye candy anyway.The Geneforge remake (if developer Jeff has it planned, which hopefully he does) couldn't come sooner, have been waiting for it for some time now. Also, we are developing a scenario editor (fan-made, unsupported by Spiderweb) for Geneforge 5 and will update here and in the Spiderweb forums when done. We don't expect it to be quite as fullly fledged as Blades of Avernum (in which you can create your own scenarios from scratch complete with quests/dialogue) at least in the first release, but it should be close.

												Before you read this, NO I didnt play it for 20 minutes, I was offline because of shatfeck M’gee internet.I am hesitant to say no, it really is ok, but I had a difficult time getting the grasp of it. Complicated concepts are generally very difficult to convey with simple graphics. It just feels like a slightly updated version of the previous 4. This would be spectacular if it was released in 2002 or before perhaps. I would like to point out that 4 years before this, Half-life 2 was released, which by today's standards has acceptable graphics. I understand that graphics aren't everything, but some people will find this not making sense if they have an IQ of 100-. I don't personally, but I am just trying to point this out. Also the UI was very glitch-filled for me. Movement seemed clunky, and objects were difficult to tell apart. Also generic plot pls. This game in its nature is like Counter-strike Condition zero. It was difficult to tell friend from foe, and where you were supposed to go and what you were supposed to do there. More on, I couldn't tell how to do what I was supposed to do. Idk man this game sort of feels like a fetish, most people wouldn't like it, but the few people who actually really look into it appreciate it more. Btw I mentioned I didn't have 20 minutes, it was something along the lines of 7 or 8 hours. Maybe you have to completely play the previous 4? Maybe you have to put in 100 hours? I don’t know but, it seemed too boring and illogical, so I stopped playing and went back to Duck game and CSGO (until r8 pls.) Feel free to object in comments. It just occurred to me that I wrote a small essay reviewing a game when I have an actual essay due tomorrow. At this point I wrote more in this review than I have on my essay I've been working on for days now.  Lol, and this took me like 3 min. This review is approaching 400 words, it has specifically three-hundred, eighty-five words in it including all of the words in this sentence, which yes, it took way for me long to figure out how to do.

												Like a Single Player Dungeons and Dragons.In Geneforge 5, the progression is slow, and balanced, but in the end, you can achieve power equal to some faction leaders. In general, the story is great, and emersive. If you're not that skilled, I recommend playing on casual so you can experience the story without having to reload often. Also, experience with the previous games is not required at all, but after playing every game in order, it's cool seeing important characters grow and change.To conclude this review, I recommend this game to anyone who likes turn based Dungeons and Dragons style RPGs, and anyone who enjoys a good story.

												I have never written a review on here, but considering this is one of the best games and one of the most underated games ive ever played, ive decided to try my hand at it. Starting off, i know it may say i only have a couple hours on record with the game, but id like to stamp that out now. I played this game years back off an old game engine before steam was a thing, buying it again now is more comfort and support for me, like buying an old book that you read years ago. I have well over 200 hours in the game, and about a thousand in the series. So let me dive in, and let you know what this game is about.   Geneforge is more than a game, its a book, an experiance, a choice, and a beautiful combat system all in one. It cries out to the imaginiative, the 3 am readers, the DnD players, the indie game searchers. What it lacks in graphics, it makes up 10 fold in story. The game puts you in the middle of an entire world and has you influence the outcome of it. In the first game, you find yourself in this estranged world, where the game gives you a brief history of it, then immediately tears that away. It isolates you, shows you that you must survive, and asks you what to do to survive. But that is only the first part. once you gather your bearings, you have to forge a path. At first the paths seem clear, good or evil, but the more you progress the more you realize there is no good. there is no evil. This game makes you question everything, with the only clear progression being that of power. You single handedly experiance the start of a world rebellion, and reitre as a god or a soldier by the end. The same picks up in each consquensial title later on, each putting you, a young shaper, smack dab in the middle of the biggest points in history of this new world. The hours, weeks, months of text painstakingly put into this game alone makes it a solid game, but the combat is fantastic too. You play a tactics style turn based micromanaging comabt system, sort of like fallout: tactics or final fantasy: tactics. But instead of pre determined abilities, like everything else you determine your path. Conjure up an army to fight for you, use magic and objects to trick your opponets and take them out one by one, or don a helmet and sword and slash your way through hoards, the choice is yous. My by far favorite part of it however, has to be the fact that nothing is safe in this game from you. It emphasizes that your choices can change the entire reality. No npc cannot be killed, although it may be hard. The world will form to what you want it to, if you are brave enough to undergo the task. Dont take this as you cannot lose, for the wrong desicion will put you in a spot where you cannot escape. But understand that you are free to make that deicion, you are free to make any desicion. This is the closest i have ever come to DnD Freeplay. Pro's: Excellent story line, worth of a novel of the highest value.          Freerealm as hell, you are free to make any desicion you want, nothing stops you, you shape the future and history alike.            LOTS and LOTS of content, as said earlieri  have over 1000 hours in the series as a whole. thats a lot for a single player non grind game.          Decent combat tactics system, many ways to play out combat.          Can easily engulf you in for weeks.          Lots and Lots of TextCon's: The graphics are subpar at best, must be able to use your imagination            Game doesnt hold your hand at all, in fact quiet the opposite. This may be a con or pro.           Again, a LOT of text. again, could be a con or pro depending on your preferance.Overall i would rate this game a 9/10, Despite the horrid graphics. i honestly believe that if ther were better graphics, there wouldnt be enough reasources to make everything else so amazing. Heres to you, Spiderweb Software.			"
