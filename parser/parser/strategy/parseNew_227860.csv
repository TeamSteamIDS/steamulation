Early Access Review
								Fraud and LiesOK I know that the mods are keeping a tight leash on the forums here and they are shutting down everything that is pointing out the truth so I am going lash out and hope that a few people see this before it gets locked or myself banned like many others have before. There are a lot of Early Access games on steam. Most of them have a capable and dedicated development team behind them. We all know this, we are all playing their games. We know what to expect from Alphas, Betas, Early Access etc etc. And this isn't it. This game has changed very very little for more than a year now. And they are still taking peoples money for it.The people that originally backed this game are for the most part gone - they check in every few months hoping that something has changed but it hasn't. At this stage the only people that are happy with this game are those that have recently bought it in the last couple of months and don't know that a patch isn't 'just around the corner', and those that are friends with the devs who jump on every negative review and defend it with the usual ""Alpha"", ""Early Access"", or ""refactoring"" excuses.We aren't stupid. We have played plenty of Early Access games before. They all need to be refactored a couple of times during their development as the scope of the interest in the game increases. All the early access games we are playing are doing the same. Castle Story is NOT unique in this.The devs just use refactoring as an excuse for having not produced anything notable for more than a year. This is rubbish. They have accumulated near enough to a million dollars to work on this project and all they do is stall.I know there are a lot of others out there that are just as fed up with this rubbish, and I hope it serves as a lesson to everyone to be very careful as to what they back with Early Access games. There a plenty of good ones out the with dedicated developers, but there are also a few rotten eggs.I'd like to hear from everyone that has been through the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥e and all those that were banned for speaking out about this, but I know they probably have given up on this game plus anyway it won't be long before this thread is locked down and removed anyway. I feel sorry for everyone that wasted their money - I had hoped for something special too.			"

Early Access Review
								Update 20NOV16:Just keeping this review fresh, it now has more content and updates than this game.  Still no meaningful changes to the game, still barely playable, still missing features, still full of bugs.  Feels like it has actually regressed, the early alpha from 4+ years ago felt more finished than this game does now.  Really think about that.  What were you doing in your life 4 years ago?  How much has changed for you since then, professionally, personally?  Have you finished any life goals, at all?  The devs for this game haven't!Winter sale season is coming up soon, don't be fooled by their 'updates' it's all a gimick to look busy and net sales.Update 10FEB16:Just wanted to update again to keep this review current with development.  Yup, nothing has changed since last time.  Update done.Ok, there are many patch notes, none of them actual content, all of them coincide with the winter sales event.  Dev's are still trying to grab cash while clumsily and incompetantly releasing trivial updates in time for a sale.  Game has actually regressed, which I didn't think was possible.  UI continues to get worse with every iteration, less intuitive, more complex, less functional, and bugs with AI grow ever more intrusive.  Avoid this ""game*"" at all costs.* A game is technically any sort of interactive entertainment where choices by a player lead to and change a possible outcome.  None of that happens here, there is no outcome other than you wasting time and money in anticipation of a crash or game breaking bug.Update 30AUG15:Well, summer is over.  Another round of shotgun blast Sauropod updates has passed.  Nothing of actual significance has been added to the game yet again.  Just making this update to point out that every sale season (WInter/Summer) Sauropod blasts out a ton of updates right before the sale, so potential new customers will walk in, say ""Wow, those guys really turned it around and get making progress!"".  When the reality is, they're using the update ticker as a daily news feed for stuff they've thought about, and haven't actually done.  They will also roll a minor trivial change in something out as 3 or 4 updates.  Don't be fooled, there has not been an update. It's a shameful and deceptive practice and really shows the developers for the dishonest incompetents they are.  If there was any doubt in your mind about whether to label them as ""Just bad developers"" or ""Actual thieves"", this is all you need to know to decide.Update 21DEC14:I figured I would update the review considering how much activity the dev's have had lately.  But it seems it was all just lip service.  Over the last few weeks they've been shotgunning loads of update announcements, but the reality of the situation is those were all just announcements for one single update.  That update itself was absolutely trivial, and seems to have added nothing of substance to the game.  The devs constantly give the excuse of ""reworking"" and ""redeveloping"" engine components of the game, but these changes never seem to result in any sort of actual impact to the game.  For all their bluster, a disapointingly little amount has changed, and all assumptions about them have been confirmed.  This is just shameless PR propaganda.The sad fact is, if you're the lunk head that invented a square wheel, taking a year off to invent an octagonal wheel leaves you as still a lunk head.  I don't think I'll be revisiting this game until it's final release, whenever that may be.Final thoughts for now:  Stay away.  With luck they'll go bankrupt and sell all IP to a competant developer.*Original*Overall, I do enjoy this game, and probably had more anticipation for this than any other early access I've followed.  So why do I not recommend this?  Bullets:Cons:- No updates!  Years have passed and the game is still in a less functional state than their fictional tech demo.- Current state is playable, but quickly reveals how broken it is.  Terrible AI, limited functoinality of game mechanics, limited... game.- Devs hate the community.  Well probably not hate, but this is the crux of it.  There appears to be absolutely no effort being made to update the game in an actual and meaningful way.  When pressed for answers from the community as to when we can expect something new, the same canned response of 'we don't give deadlines' is the answer.  That's fine after a few months, but not after a few years.  The first major red light for me when nearly a years worth of dev updates were about how they spent a month and a half working on a new sound effect for an object that isn't even in the game, or here's a new soundtrack I've been listening to, or ""Hey, we're going on vacation!"".  While glaring issues remain untouched and unaddressed.  PR people are hired to quell criticism and silence community dissent.-Devs are in over their heads.  A lot of people will call them theives, or scammers, I don't see it as that.  They are still around.  They are still 'working'.  But it really seems like they've all retreated to their little comfort zones, and feverishly work on silly little things like a sound effect to the exclusion of actual game problems.  Why would they do this?  Well, it seems pretty clear that they have realized they cannot handle those bigger problems, and just seem to be hoping they'll fix themselves tomorrow.  Their production efforts are terribly misguided, and no one seems able to get the train back on the tracks.  This is the main reason I think the community has given up on them.  There are gracious ways out of this connundrum for them, but they seem completely unwilling to compromise, admit their shortcomings, and work with the community.  For that they have failed utterly at making a game.  A community college degree does not a game dev make.Pros:- Build a big castle block by block, watch a nearly good physics engine crush it.- If you give them enough money to keep the lights on, you get a t-shirt or something, someday.

Early Access Review
								I was an original backer of this game since it has been on Kickstarter, and If you think 28 hours is long, you haven't seen how many hours I put into it before it was on steam. This game is nothing that was shown of the trailer, and hasn't even begun to show it either.I loved playing this when it was first in the prototype and to be honest it has only improved since, but that isn't saying much at all. I have lost COUNTLESS hours of this game to my bricktrons not working properly and it just keeps happening, the won't move, won't work, etc. Multiplayer is just out of the question because it's broken to all hell, so don't even bother going through the trouble. Not the mention the game was in prototype for OVER A YEAR. that's bad, Don't even bother with the game. The islands are boring and repetitive, it should be randomly generated, not the same old crappy map. It's simply boring, broken, and just flat out annoying.EDIT:Congratz, Sauropod Studio, It's been 2 years since you released the game to the public and It's still in Early Access. Really, I accomodate you and your hard work for this terribly optimized, bugged game. It seems improvement has obviously been made. (Obvious Sarcasm)			"

								When it was Pre-Alpha, there were bugs, when it became alpha, they didnt fix them, when it became beta, they added content like they kept doing and doing, without fixing the bugs. What are the bugs? A pack of workers will eventually stop working and saturate at the point it can only walk around and stare... Basically sumtimes you can't play, or it just stops working all of a sudden or you end up with eiter 1 or two workers that didnt glitch, whom are still working while the other 3 or 4 are idle forever. That makes it hard as hell, impossible long to build things and pretty boring.If only the producers wouldve fix the bugs instead of adding content...			"

Early Access Review
								I foolishly paid money for this game when it first came out on steam, in the two years since then they have done nothing of note to the actual game. They've been to PAX east, they've ordered in Castle Story T-shirts and Castle Story plushies, they've hired bearded men to make videos of people looking busy, they've deleted my posts on their youtube videos and they've deleted my posts on the community hub and banned me from posting there again, they've got new gaming rigs, they've painted the walls of their office with a cool Castle Story mural, they've been out in the woods making noises, they've played Magicite, once again what they HAVEN'T done is anything of note to the game itself. The game in its current state is ""OK"" for a buggy unfinished alpha, not much content to speak of, certainly not worth £14.99. These developers sold everyone a pack of lies and hired people to censor out anyone that calls them out on their unethical, thieving and unprofessional behaviour. I can think of many games that have far more content and regular updates and better developers (in terms of listening to and communicating with the community) that cost far less. An example of their lying can be found in the trailer, you are led to believe that there are two types of enemies, it shows a larger corruptron throwing rocks at the castle. This is an outright lie, there is no such thing in the game. The only other game I can think of recently with this kind of unethical misrepresentation of the product is War Z with its crawling zombies in the trailer.The future for Castle Story is bleak, most people who were going to buy it have already bought it long ago when it first came to steam, since then the developers have completely failed to deliver. Any criticism of their unprofessional behaviour by the community is ignored or censored. They have all the money they're going to get so there is simply no more reason to work on the game any further. Instead they are hiring more and more staff to sell it to people on the internet and make promises that will never be kept to create the illusion that they are still working on the game.I expect that in time they will change the name of the game as War Z did to squeeze out those last few sales before it is consigned to the dustbin of history as yet another kickstarter project that made the devs very rich but utterly failed to deliver on its promises.Do not give these unethical, thieving and unprofessional developers any of your money, to do so would encourage others to follow their lead.

								DO NOT BUY! Sauropod studios are run by a very small group of inexperienced, unapologetic jerks. If you bought in to this game through kickstarter or early access, they will treat you like crap on the forums.The only thing Castle Story had going for it was the amazing work the Community Manager: Box, was doing. Box would try to give information to you straight, without breaking any of the company rules, which was very difficult to do. Box would always try to break information down to the community and calm people down who were angry about any of the situations. In the end, the company would give Box misleading information and then blame him for giving out any information to the community.One of the primary developers for Castle Story is a dev named Thierry. Thierry has a tendency to berate the community for asking questions. On multiple occasions I've read post by him calling out individuals and virtually yelling at them, or the community in general and blaming them for being impatient. The game has been in development for years now, and there has literally been no visual improvement in over a year.Originally there were weekly updates on what was going on, with an occasional skipping of a week or two. Now there are monthly updates on what is going on. I take that back. There are monthly video blogs about things nobody cares about. These ""monthly"" video blogs have only made it up to the 3rd blog before they seem to have stopped posting them. It has been six weeks since the last video blog, which is probably a good thing, because they're useless information anyway.TL;DR, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME. The devs will treat you like crap, and blame the community for asking too many questions, the game has been stagnant for over a year. The forums have started seeing posts deleted, and users are getting banned for giving out useful information, and asking real questions respectfully.			"

								I know what you're thinking. Surely, right now the game is on sale and you're looking at the reviews to see if the game is worth $12.99-$14.99 because what kind of customer would you be if you didn't?You see some good reviews--""Recommended! Yes! What a great game! Has some work to do, but worth it!"" and so you continue to look, just in case. Then you'll see bad reviews--""Do not recommend! No! Horrible game! Has a ton of work to do, and not worth it!"" You see a couple of these, but you decide you want to make your own decision on the matter.You'll look back at the screen shots, review some videos, and see that the game is hella cute, has a good looking play style, and an interesting concept.You'll ignore the bad reviews and buy the game anyways.You install.The game is beautiful, so it doesn't disappoint on that front.The game is fairly easy to play, so ~30 minutes in, you'll have the controls down for the most part and basic strategies for castle building.After ~1h, you'll get bored of your first castle and start anew, with a different strategy in mind.You'll be fairly successful with your second castle, and you'll have a lot of the mechanics behind the game worked out, making this new castle easier.Now this is where I don't know what you'll do. I, personally, got bored of the second castle. I realized the only thing I can do is expand on my castle with what little land I had (digging/terraforming isn't as easy as it should be, so I wouldn't consider that a feature.) On top of that, building is pretty slow, so that takes a while (gets pretty boring to me pretty fast.) On top of THAT, the AI is still pretty wonky, so the Bricktrons aren't as efficient as they could be.This game has a ton of potential, don't get me wrong. When crafting, new game modes, and just more stuff is added, I'll revisit it. But for now, I wouldn't say this game isn't even worth $10 as it is. Save your money, spend it on a more complete game.

								Edit: 01/11/2015A year after my last update on the game, with the release of 0.5, I tried this once again. Some new blocks added; beams, supports, stone pillar, curved blocks.UI - radial menu- is counter intuitive; too slow and complicated. Designed to be used with a gamepad, not keyboard+mouse.AI is still braindead; pathfinding is as broken as it can be. You still can't build a structure even as small as this without constantly micro maniging.

Notice that he is standing right on top the blueprint he should be building. So he can reach it with the block but too dumb to do it.Started new map, didn't build anything, didn't create any tasks, didn't give any orders, just selected all 5 bricktons and moved them in front of the pre-built castle; 3 of them made it, 2 got stuck on the way. Heh, so much for improved pathfinding.

Big Island doesn't even load for me; stuck at ""Loading %0"".Multiplayer is still as broken as it can be.Some Halloween stuff again; lanterns and stuff.And to think they will release this in a few months. I really can't believe Sauropod.Still no real update, no real content, still the same old broken game.Stay away!------------------Edit: 29/10/2014So after 2 years, a new patch downloaded just now; it contains 2 new hats, one for archer and one for knight. And the floating soul thingies are now ghosts. No other visible additions so far. Will see if there will be patch notes or not.Edit: No patch notes; just some Halloween themed visual changes. Unbelievable.After 2 years we had a refactoring, a few bug fixes and a pause button. Map editor is gone.Multiplayer is as broken as it can be.Still no new content.----------Original review:I am a Kickstarter backer so I have been following the development of the game for about 1,5 years. This ride started great, these guys had an awasome concept, gameplay movies to show and so I backed their project. They were supposed to deliver the beta in October 2012; now we are in Early Access and still in early prototype. But the real problem is the lack of information about the development process; dev. dairies are void of any solid info; they are just about bugfixes and trivial stuff; t-shirts, save/load game functions, technical mumbo jumbo.. We don't know where this game is going; no real direction or roadmap presented by devs. There is talk of a roadmap though; for many, many months if I remember correctly. I suspect they have not known what to do with their game since the beginning. I just can't explain the lack of any solid info about the game/roadmap/direction in any other way.Since the first prototype of the game, over a year ago, devs have added a really, really broken survival mode to the game, a multiplayer mode which doesn't work, a few bugfixes here and there; nothing else. Game has a lot of potential, a great concept but the execution is just plain bad; UI is horrible, there are no real updates, no content added in over a year since first release. I do not recommend the game at this point. At this rate devs working on the game; come back in a year or two and maybe, maybe you might be looking at a good game. Otherwise just stay away for now.About the game itself:It's sandbox building game. You have minions doing various tasks like mining, cutting down trees and providing you with building materials on the map you choose; well you have just one map at the moment so no choosing. You issue orders to your minions to gather materials and then you go ahead and lay down blueprints for your minions and they build them. In Survival mode; you have baddies on top of normal sandbox mode. But they have no AI so they just rush at you. Get an archer or two at a high place and you win. Baddies won't be able to climb more than 2 blocks high and it takes too much time to destroy the blocks; your archers will kill everyone while baddies are hacking away at the blocks.Problems;UI is horrible. unimaginative and clunky.Camera controls are plain bad.There are still problems with laying down blueprints for constructions. Pathfinding is broken, AI is broken; blueprints for big buildings are very problematic; your minions just can't build them due to pathfinding errors. Especially big blueprints will give you a headache; you will have to zoom in, out, rotate the camera this way and that just to be able to lay down a blueprint. Misclick? Tough luck; some blueprints blocks just don't wanna be removed so you will end up dropping that building and start another blueprint.Many times you will have to start a map over and over again to get minions to spawn at all; you will just start with no minions.There is a catapult in the game with which you can hurl barrels filled with stones or explosive stones to baddies. Very clunky to use; you will end up not using it at all. You don't want to use explosive barrels too; you will just destroy your buildings with it.No content added as of now. You just build aimlessly in the map. There aren't enough building blocks. There aren't enough info about the game mechanics; how do you build that bridge for example? You will have to find some YouTube video by a fellow player to show you that.Why can't you just put that block over there? Because you can't. And no one tells you why not.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game about 18 months ago.It was a great concept, and a really fun game to play with knowing that much more content was promised and on the way.I was dissapointed to find out shortly after obtaining the game that they were essentially suspending any new features pending a 'refactoring' in the Unity game engine.  The good news was that once this was done, they were to start pumping out feature and content updates much more quickly, since they were including an improved asset pipeline.That took much more time than their community liason had let on.  The community (other investors in the game) were getting pretty restless.  Finally that refactoring was completed.  A patch was released!  Unfortunately, it had little to no impact on the gameplay.  There were some minor stability improvements but no real new features or content.  We were okay with that because of the promise of much more coming more quickly...  We were then informed that we were being too impatient, and that no new features or content could be done until they finished working on their internal tools (factories).We were then informed that there would continue to be a suspension of any new features or content while they rewrite the AI engine and the Pathfinding.   No new content could be provided since ""Why would we give you new content if the AI cant figure out what to do with that content""...   Of course most users abandoned hope that this would ever be completed.   It had been month after month after month of broken promises.   They eventually ended their relationship with the community liason, citing that he never really spoke for the company, and his promises were unfounded.Now, FINALLY.. version 0.3 has been released!!  (coincidentally timed with a Steam promotion) With the new AI, the new Pathfinding, new lighting effects, a bigger island to work with.Unfortunately, there is still no new content, no new features.   Leading up to a sale on Steam, they put together a nice little video of the new features ..   New AI (Which is worse than the original).. New Lighting (Which is of zero impact on the gameplay).. a bigger island (which is probably among the bottom 2% of necessary changes)..They then 'cleaned' out the user forums of most negative feedback..   Unfortunately even after these years of waiting, the new 'version' was even more buggy and had less (YES LESS) features than the original.  The great new AI that was promised could only be 'tested' in a seperate environment, where the feature set was limited, and even that was far worse than the original, very buggy, AI.They started releasing (Very minor) bug fixes almost daily, appeasing many, even though they really only addressed things like difficulty in loading the game, or glitchy graphic artifacts, etc ..  These fixes and patches (0.3.1,  0.3.2,  0.3.3,  0.3.4)  started giving some of us the impression that this past couple of years of unfulfilled and broken promises was at an end and the momentum would finally change.   Unfortunately, although those changes were welcome if only to see that there was actually some level of activity going on..   They were short lived.  4 patches in 5 days.  Then nothing.. again.   This game has great potential as a concept.  But if you are considering it.. You would be very well advised to wait until you can read the reviews of the finished game.    "

								They haven't added a single substantial thing to the game since it was originally released in alpha.  Every post on the dev blog is either a behind the scenes change that adds nothing for the player, a minor gui update, or another random person they hired to help with doing those things.  This game has negatively impacted my opinion of both Early Access and Kickstarter as a whole.  Would not reccomend.0.3.x UPDATE:Castle Story has recieved a-  well hold on a damn minute, what even has it recieved?  Bigger islands, okay, that's good.  New AI is good as we-  Oh, no the new AI is only on one map/gametype and isn't even near done, not to mention a buggy mess.  All six textures have been updated, but whether or not it's for the better is a point of argument.  The music/sound engine has been redone, but I can't listen a bricktron into getting unstuck from a doorway, so that doesn't affect much.Guess I'll check back next year after they've redone everything a fourth time and hired three more people.

								This game looks amazing. The video really made me rush to purchase it. Unfortunately it is a frustrating mess to play. The characters stand around like goons, refuse to follow paths or instructions, and after about 20 minutes of attempting to play they just stop following commands for no reason. I bought it ages ago and it hasn't got any better. The video appears to be a complete fabrication as you can't even mine for long before the Bricktrons glitch and stop responding, never mind build a castle. I couldn't get to any other floating islands, and even navigating the current island wasn't easy. Don't waste your money. This game doesn't appear to be improving at all.			"

								The game is currently not worth buying but the devs are trying to fix all the problems. Keep an eye on this game but don't buy it yet. Edit:Updates are slow and bare minimum. This game is probably never going to be playable. Even trying to leave the game on overnight to gather resources feels like a waste of electricity.Edit 2:As of December 7th 2015 this game is now playable. The AI is improved enough that Castles can be completed; however not the most efficient pathing. Survival was fun but lagged past playable when I reached the 6th wave on easy. My computer can run Fallout 4 (on High) so If yours can't then dont buy this. The game is at a stage where I feel it should have started for early access. I wouldn't recomend anyone looking for a serious strategy game to buy this but, if you want to support a very new development team who seems to be trying to complete this game despite multiple set backs Buy it. I think the average person could get 2 hours of fun. While I have played far more most of those hours I wish I could get back. Hopefully in the near Future I can finally, after years, switch to my review to a thumbs Up.			"

								Months, Years...without an update. May be worth the wait, but so far it was a big disapointment. Developers don't care much about anyone's opinion, don't reply to e-mails on their website, I recommend keeping away. I was banned from the community forums for saying my opinion about their game in a polite manner. In years of steam, talking and meeting many developers over time, this is the first time I was treated this way. To me, its a game being developed by teenagers or adults on drugs. I regret so much for supporting this dead game. I don't recommend anyone to buy it. They report personal problems, financial problems, staff problems, all sort of excuses. And nothing is done. But they do go on vacation and are always working...Steam should remove this game as its more of a scam than a product.			"

								Brief:Castle Story is my second biggest regrettable pruchase (looking at you, Starforge). This is supposed to be a fun castle builder in the essence of a tower defense game. I feel for the devs, but I can't help but dislike this game.Pros:+Has basic castle building mechanics+Has basic resource mechanics+Has very basic combat mechanicsCons:-Has the dev progress speed of a tortoise.. that doesn't have any legs..-Has a wave game mode with no fast forward.. so slow..-Each 'update' brings very little to the game, they seem to be more 'patches'-Maps (think there are two now) are incredibly boring and feel empty-Enemies are boring, with AI feeling very basic-Friendly AI seem incredibly stupid and struggle with simple tasks-I personally see literally no longevity to the game. It just goes on with no senseof achievement whatsoever			"

								**** DO NOT BUY, DEVELOPMENT IS SO SLOW THAT IS GOING BACKWARDS ****I've bought this game beginning of 2014, since then i was already seeing of a lot of people saying the development was extremely slow, i waited for one entire year, and here is what  i've got:New Textures = New textures, oh my god, now the game is more beautiful but still buggy.New Shaders = Another huge gigantic interstellar ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to make game look more 'cute'.New Animations = Makes a couple of animations, games is almost the same♥♥♥♥♥♥New AI System = True, new AI System with new bugs and not polished, fantastic job!New Skybox = Sauropod receives complaints about game being buggy, makes a new skybox, LOL.HDR Lighting = Another visual ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tBigger Islands Up to one square KM = Game has issues with saving and bugs over the mechanics. makes the islands bigger! Overall:In one entire year, i saw 10% gameplay development and 90% visual, 1 year ago visuals and animations was pretty good, nobody would complain about the graphics, and instead of working on the mechanics and focusing on what is really important, throws new graphics in a new update, Sauropod, you are a joke.0/10.

								This game was originally set to become a hit. There has been many delays since it originally released on the kickstart with many broken deadlines. It has been more than a year now since it's release and updates to the game *do* indeed happen, but they are sporadic and mostly about bug fixes.The game modes currently in place don't have much to be joyful about. Survivor mode feels 'cheap', the enemies are just running towards you. As for the sandbox mode, it's much like Minecraft, ie you build stuff, but I feel like the addition of more 'building blocks' would make it a better experience.The Dev Blog posts are almost void of any content and so the community still has no idea where this game is heading even after all this time.Lack of updates, and lack of transparency of this game will ultimately kill it.

								Now i dont mean to be a downer. I completely understand that there are only a small development team, ect, ect. but i bought this game over a year ago and i havent noticed any changes since i last saw it. I honestly like the concept of this game and i dont mind the early access thing at al. However this game still has to reach the point where it is playable. I wish the developpers all the luck in the world in their quest to finish this game but if one of my friends would ask me if he or she should buy this game then i would say: not yet. which is the same advice i give the reader of this review. At the moment i cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone. It is not playable at the moment and i fear that this will not change any time soon. If the developpers actually begin to make some notable progress on this game then i will be more then happy to adjust this review. But at the moment i have to say no... I did notice that much of the progress on this game appears to be focussed on the engine. which is an understandable way of development. But at the same time there are ofcourse a lot of people who spend money on this game and dont know as much about programming and game design as proffesionals would. (completely understandable ofcourse) and those people are going to end up feeling cheated. hence my advice.summary: Dont buy it. Keep it in your whishlist until it is finished and then buy it. Because the concept of the game is great and you are going to have a great time once it is playble. Castle story is scheduled for release in 2016 (as far as i know at least) so guys please keep this game in mind when that day comes			"

								THIS REVIEW IS IN PURGATORY: I'm working on writing a new one. On October 27, 2015 Sauropod Studios released Castle Story 0.5, which seems to be FULL OF CONTENT AND FEATURES. Time will tell if they will start releasing updates on a reasonable schedule, and it remains to be seen if the game will be finished. But read the review with an open mind; things are looking better than when I wrote it.Original review:This game cost me $20 USD or so, and gave me 113 hours of enjoyment. That's over five hours of play per dollar -- certainly more than I've gotten out of some AAA titles that cost me three times that much. It was a fun little game.So why the thumbs down? Well, because despite being a somewhat *fun* game, it's not a *complete* game. And at this point it is not clear to me that the game will EVER be complete.The devs posted this disclaimer long ago: http://www.sauropodstudio.com/steam-early-access-disclaimer/ stating the features that work and those that are planned. The disclaimer is pretty accurate, it doesn't lie about what's working and what's not. The problem is that the ""what's working"" list has not grown by a single item since I bought the game -- litterally the ONLY feature of any note that has been added was a pause function -- which would have been greatly appreciated if I hadn't worn out the gameplay many months ago -- but they haven't made any visible progress towards that complete feature set they said they were planning.Some of this is understandable. It's a young studio, this is their first game and the developers are less experienced than those on a lot of other games. They made some early mistakes and had to refactor the code base, which took a long time. Normally, refactoring (while frustrating for end users because it consumes time with no new features) is useful because it reduces future bugs and makes implementing new features later much easier. But these things only matter if you RELEASE UPDATES after the refactoring.As I said, this is the studio's first game, and as you can see it's not going super well. It's entirely possible that they are out of money and about to go bankrupt for all I know. So it's impossible to say when or even if this game will get another update, or if a hypothetical update would even contain any significant improvements.So while it really boils down to the typical early access mantra of ""Only pay for it if you are happy with the CURRENT state of the game"", and while the current state of the game WAS worth the money I paid for it, I can't really recommend this game because I know that most people are less easy to please than I am, and want a finished product. This game may never be that.			"

								Buy Castle Story? No, but why not? A 2 year summaryI'm watching the development since almost two years and played over 160 hours. Only survival mode because there are no other challanges. Sandbox mode didn't really interested me after all, you know minecraft?Following Bugs and missing game options bother me since the first time i played. There has been changes and improvments but nothing got really fixed to a point im happy with. I guess a lot of other people feel the same after reading reddit and other sources, pointing out there's no progress would be wrong, but the prioritisation is amiss. I understand the process of prototyping, alphas and early access. But there shut be a noticable progress in all directions after two years of development.- building menu - Castle Story uses some kind of nice circular menu, it has a nice appeal in the first place. But really nerves after using it, because its inconvenient. You need to do the following steps to choose one of your main building materials; 1x1 stone bricks: hold down the right mousebutton, the main menu appears, move the mouse to submenu button, release the right mouse button, the main menu disapperas. Press the right mouse button again, the submenu apperas, move to the 1x1 stone, release right the mouse button, now you can place your bricks. You know what!? Let me use the left mouse button to select the submenu and the 1x1 brick, this would make the following steps redundant and the selection would be; hold right mouse button, left click submenu, left click desired option, DONE!?- blue Crystals - the Ore you need to gather for spawning new npcs is now stuck on stockpiles by default (version 0.3.3). This would be one of the very few added game mechanics in two years that made me happy, if turned off by default OMG. Now you have to manually order your broken Worker AI to carry the blue crystals to the main crystal or deaktivate the option on every stockpile you build... really?- demolishing - you can't demolish stockpiles, lamps, barrels,... If it does work and i didn't realise how, why doesn't it work the same way it does with stones and wood. By the way, if it works with stones and wood, does it take why more than 2 years to implement this feature?- zooming - nice to be able to zoom with the mousewheel, but only to a certain and low point. If users complain about that, they are told to use the old method, the caps key and mousewheel, now the can zoom infinite. What every sence restricting the ""mousewheel only zoom"" and having two ways to zoom after all may have. Only one way to zoom, problem fixed.- Workers - still get stuck in many different tasks. I know theres a new AI and it's not implemented in survival mode yet. Currently (version 0.3.3) the AI is a killjoy.- Swordsmen - useless as long as not standing in front of a gate. Because Enemys are past over before the realize there existence. Currently (version 0.3.3) the AI is a killjoy.- Archers - commit suicide by shoting there bows and killed other player npcs, this didn't happen anymore since version 0.3.0 and i played to wave 25. Thats a plus!i'm ♥♥♥♥ed, somebody else complete the list... Don't buy the game until it's released! Die Entwickler bewegen sich seit zwei Jahren im Kreis, mit einer Effizienz, die sich schön in ihrem Menü wiederspiegelt.			"

								It's a great concept, really! But the developers seem to be incapable of getting the game running properly. Been following its development for years now, and while I'm aware I purchased an Early Access game,  it's at the point now where I don't see this game ever being finished.  It has the same bugs and lack of content it did a year ago, the units don't respond well (or sometimes not at all) to commands, there's still no solid multiplayer, and the game still lags tremendously after a certain amount of waves.. This game isn't going anywhere, sadly. Unplayable.I strongly urge you not to buy this game.Second review, 19-02-2015:I stand by my statement that the game has not yet reached the point of ""money's worth."" However, it seems I was wrong about this game never going to be finished.The latest patch still leaves a lot to be desired, but they did fix the general unit control. Units still ""dumb down"" every now and then, but at least this time around you get to give them new orders once you've moved them manually. Where I couldn't even get past wave 15 in the past, I am surprised to say the game managed to get me to wave 35 without any framedrop. I paused the game to have a little drinky and edit my review, games tend to take a while. It's actually quite fun without lagspikes. I've heard friends mention they've made it up to wave 50-or-so, and then it started lagging.I still don't recommend this game as it is now, because multiplayer is still barely functional. If you want to play with a friend, get ready to search forums for a while, 'cause it doesn't come with complete instructions. But it is starting to look like we might see this game in a finished state after all.What I would like to see before I start recommending this game:- Playable framerate up to at least wave 100.- An easier way of getting rid of rubble. Either by despawning it, or having the bricktrons clean up quicker, I've noticed the game now starts lagging due to the amount of rock chips lying around.- An enjoyable multiplayer mode. Let's face it, this game can be summed up as tower defense meets lego. Don't get me wrong, it's fun! But we could use a co-op mode against the AI instead of a vague deathmatch where nobody is quite sure what to do and when to do it.- Catapults to be useful for either blowing up terrain or killing the rockmen.

								(Patch 0.6) Since the first beta, i try every new patch, and i've always been disapointed by the way everything was slow and unsteady. I think that this patch is a turning point. It was the first time that the game got hard, and it was fun like that. The Bricktrons now move with no hesitation, they build fast and the most impressive part :  the combats are now epic! The Minitrons are flying everywhere, most of the action is fluid, the pathfinding is fast and the AI look like it understand what is going on (they don't exaggerate when they say the pathfinding is 100X faster or more). Still, beware, this game is far from finish, but i have a good feeling about the upcoming releases. Bravo à toute l'équipe de Sauropod!			"

Waste of Money at this TimeI have purchased this game nearly one year ago with great hopes of this being a fun sandbox style game. I watched the preview and thought WOW! This is going to be a fun old style collect and build fashioned games. I was quickly hit by the lack of development over the year. There are texture bugs, the AI seems basic, building glitches, and many more. Reporting a bug in this game does nothing because the ""updates"" the developers release are more like patches. There has been no progression of the games development over the year I have owned the game and I am feeling a bit scammed at this point. DO NOT PURCHASE. Please save yourselves from this waste. The game has potential but the devs don't produce. If you are even considering getting this game WAIT; add it to your wish-list and see if it  ever leaves early access.  At this point this has been such a waste of money as well as a disappointment. "

								I've been excited about this game for a long while. The concept was creative and nostalgic so I decided to support the game's early development. As all the other reviewers have indicated, there has been almost no significant progress in gameplay in a year and a half. To add insult to injury, the devs at Sauropod act as if the ""early access"" disclaimer forfeits any right by the gamers supporting them, to expect progress or a timetable for completion. Indeed, the devs censor and berate the gamers which have supported them financially, who are rightfully frustrated by the glacial rate of progress. Are we supposed to maintain our excitement and support when we get superficial/cosmetic updates every few months?The devs frequently complain that the increasingly negative reviews are hindering sales, and therefore development. That's right Sauropod, blame your supporters for your own incompetence. DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS GAME, at least until a complete version is released.			"

								IF YOU ARE READING THIS, DO NOT BUY CASTLE STORY!!!You guys (the devs) got $700,000 from a kickstarter in August of 2012 and mentioned twice in its description that you quit your jobs to work full time on Castle Story. What have you all been doing the past two and a half years? Not only should you not be charging $20 for an incomplete game that is more than fully funded, but you should be actually working on improving the game that you're charging $20 for. Maybe if it was one of those $2 or $3 games, I might recommend it. Your kickstarter says that FOUR PEOPLE paid over $2,000 to see this game leave the ground. Where has it gone? It's great that you've come out with 2 updates last month, but let's see some real bug fixes and some new content. I just wish I had that great of an idea to steal a million dollars and get away with it.Here's their kickstarter page if you don't believe that they made over $700,000 on this ""project"":https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/902505202/castle-story "

								Castle Story is a castle building strategy game with delightful cartoonish graphics and a fun premise.You order around a group of little yellow warriors, gathering resources and supplies to build a castle, to protect a large crystal that serves as a spawner for your units. All of this on the fairly simple-though-attractive backdrop of some flying islands in the sky.Sadly, that's about where the charm of the game ends and the problems start to show up.Charming though it may be, the game has multiple issues ranging from save-games not loading properly, to certain game modes not functioning. There are major slow-downs in the game, and often your AI will become stuck doing nothing, for seemingly no reason.The beautiful structures you see in the screenshots are nearly impossible to build in the game's current state. (No, seriously, how in the heck did they make those?)Development is also insanely slow, if it's even progressing at all.Make no mistake, there is nothing even nearly complete about the game as it is now. I want to like the game, it shows a lot of promise, and it LOOKS fun; but with issues that haven't been fixed in literally years, and no sign of forward movement, you're much better off saving your money for a different game.IF things change in the future, I will happily update my review.

								I backed this game on Kickstarter in 2012, and now at the cusp of 2016 it's still in a state of not being a playable game. They haven't stopped working on it, which is amazing, but they also have not made any progress. I see this game on my friends' wishlists and all I can think is: please do not buy this game. If it ever leaves Early Access, I will install it and try it and change this review, but it is not finished or close to finished or even any closer to finished than it was 2 years ago (or 4).DO NOT BUY			"

								I really wanted to believe in this game because of its cool concept, but let me tell you what has been going on in other indie games during the year that i owned this:Kerbal Space Program went through enough updates to go into Beta.Prison Architect (smaller development team than Sauropod) had 10 major additions and 2 bug hunts.Day Z (and in not a big fan of it) added cars along with a plethora of survival features and bugs.Subnautica was released and has added two different vehicles and is ready to add two more zones.and those are just the ones i own.In a 12 month period Castle story has basically had one A.I. update and released their new ""big map"". Even with these updates the game is still bugged to the point of being unenjoyable I hope something happens but as it stands, this game is dead in the water and your money is better spent on another title.

								Lost all hope for this a year ago.  Just had another look and all they seem to do is update their marketing, probably to try and sucker more people, especially when it's slightly discounted during the steam sales.DO NOT GET THIS.It is not in a playable state, and won't be for a long time, if ever (most likely never).

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!And here is why:BackstoryI supported them on kickstarter when it became available and have followed their progress for a long time now.What I see now just keeps disappointing me and I already lost hope in this ""chaos"" of a project. Every time I saw steam updating this game I played it for a bit but didn't see any game changes. The only thing I see every time is the hopeless same mess again and again, game start lagging (and I have a pretty high spec system), bricktrons getting stuck, glitches that make resources unavailable, etc.Positive PotentialThat's it. I can't say anything good about this game even if I want to and still hope I will be able to.Negative Performance (after 3 years it normally must have been fixed) Content (EDIT: Updates are coming in again, but the content is still the same unfortunately) Gameplay (is their even any gameplay except for glitches and bugs that make the game unplayable - remember we are 3 years after the kickstarter) Development (are they even doing anything, or just spending or money ?!) EDIT: They are updating the game again, after 3 years of doing nothing AI (They get stuck most of the time, but they're working on it now since of December 2014)These developers made me skeptical about Early Access and now got me even to the point I don't buy anything in Early Access unless it's almost finished or the developers provide weekly updates and detailed information what Sauropod promised but never delivered. This concept was great and I believed in it, but Sauropod just flushed it down the toilet.I will update my review if they ever bring something out that drastically changes the game. (But I don't think this is going to happen after 3 years)EDIT: some grammatical fixes and notices about the game being updated again.			"

								I was an original Kickstarter backer from about 3-years ago.  I was very disappointed in the development of new content prior to steam and for the past year I hadn't paid much attention to Castle Story until I happen to notice that 0.5 was released and appears to incorporate some new content.  I figured it had probably been a year or more since I last checked in so I'd give it another go.Upon booting up the game, I noticed there were some new maps which made me think perhaps maybe they had finally gotten their act together and started producing content.I started off chopping down some trees so I had a place to stockpile resources.  I had remembered from a year ago when I last played that they came up with a horrible horrible user interface.  News flash, it's still there and it's my opinion that they somehow managed to make it even more complicated.  I simply, without a doubt, absolutely hate the interface they've come up with.After creating a few dozen zones to allow my minions to place resources, I decided to start doing some mining to collect rock/stone as well.  I sent off four of the five minion to work on the side of a hill while my remaining unit cleaned up the rest of the trees and made some barrels for later.About 10 minutes later, all my miners went stupid and were just standing there.  I moved them away from the hill, then assigned them to mining the hill again, which they happily did until 5 minutes later when they went stupid and forgot what they were supposed to be doing again.I instructed the minion away from the hill again, lets them regroup and sent them back to mining the hill again.  After 5 minutes, brain dead again.  Apparently the game still has some very serious pathing issues that have yet to be resolved.Right click, delete local content.I guess I’ll check back in a few years when 0.6 comes out.			"

								Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥where are the positive reviews coming from? This game is really bad and the developers are fixing one thing in 6 months.Early access my♥♥♥♥♥this game is more than 4 years old now. The ""alpha"" was postponed several times and what they released back then is as bad as the game is 4 years later.Would not recommend.28.03.17Hoooooooo boy. Installed the game again, and saw some improvements. The conquest mode was kinda fun I give them that. Bravo they added a capture-point mode, FIVE YEARS well spent. But they still haven't fixed the constant fps drops probably caused by their AI doing way too much work.Just fix the ♥♥♥♥ing AI for once, it's as bad as it was on release in 2012.Also I played on an i3 laptop with 2 * 2.1 GHz, now I have a desktop i5 6500 with 4 * 3.20 GHz (nice) but I don't feel much of a difference in performance. So I guess it probably got worse and it's unplayable on my laptop now.			"

								I could not be more disappointed in this game. I bought this game through the kickstarter almost 3 years ago today. I can say that what I saw then impressed me, thinking that they would eventually add amazing things, which it desparately needed. Seriously this game had sooooo much potential and unfortunately the makers are just out to make a quick buck. They haven't even changed anything, even though they keep putting up videos trying to show people that they did change things. I can say without any hesitation that their game is exactly the same as when I first bought it 3 years ago. Tons of bugs, Mindnumbingly slow gameplay, and very boring lame bad guys. their newest video shows how much has actually changed NOTHING! Not since their very first video on Kickstarter.			"

								When I got the alpha for this game, I thought I saw something that could be great. And for a while I was ok with the small gitchs, and annoying little bugs in the game. But after a full year of waiting for something of an improvement to this game, I have failed to see anything worth calling an update. I honestly feel a bit robbed by this game as the updates and improvments have been nothing short of disappointment and nothing promised in the year that i have given it. I have given up on this game ever becoming anything more than alpha and disappointment.			"

								I bought this game because the concept looked cool and the game kind of fun. While I still think this could have been a great game, the developers have shown they are incapable of properly building a game. There are so many bugs that make building anything of scale impossible.My only hope now is that some other real developers take over this game and turn it into something great, but until that time (if it ever happens), stay away.

								Although in its current state it is a pretty interesting game, it will likely not change in the next few years. In two years, there has been two mentionable updates, both of which brought either tiny features, (such as pillars) game breaking bugs (such as the assumed memory leak in the unstable build which forces you to reload the level every ten minutes) or both. I understand creating games is not easy, even through easy methods, such as game making or scripting programs, but this seriously makes me wonder if they are actually doing any development, or just making YouTube videos to say they are. I doubted Starbound, and they barely pulled through once, but this is far more problematic than slow development; this is avoidance. My suggestion is to put it on your wishlist, wait about five years, and check again. By that time you will maybe know its fate. I apologise for my straightforwardness.Edit 09 08 (Aug) 15The game in its current state is unplayably difficult. Using several different tactics I haven't been able to get past wave 4. The enemy is more powerful, spawns faster and has less chance of friendly-fire, and outnumbers you significantly. Time to go edit the map again, this is an interesting game if you can get past the lack of updates, the bugs (most of which are fixed more recently) and the now outrageous difficulty.			"

Then Castle Story's early access is NOT for you! Do NOT join us today and STOP sending us your bugs report and feedbacks. Because we won't release updates anyway!Currently as of now, I would 110% recommend this game to no one. Do not support it, or buy it. No real progress has been made ever since their kickstarter. It does have a really cool concept, but it is not going anywhere.TL;DRDo NOT buy. This early access is as good as dead. Wait for it to be alive once more if still interested. "

								Don't do it! If you want to waste $20 on something worthwhile go buy banished or heck even get stonehearth or Don't Starve. It's been almost 3 years since this game came out! They surpass the time it took dota 2 to come out of beta. There is no hope that they plan on finishing this and can be reassuringly be declared a dead game. Like by time they finish it half-life 3 will have came out already. That's really slow if valve time is faster than an indie game development... And when i say valve time is faster I mean the developers are extremely slow ,incompetent and aren't willing to communicate with the community go on and read the other reviews it's the same thing over and over but if you want to know about the game besides the opinion review up there go to the next paragraph. So what they have done in the past 3 years: the AI can barely function correctly, they let out an update once in a blue moon and usually it is the most unhelpful thing, They rarely actually fix anything besides make the problem worse, it has so much potential but with staff like this the game will probably never finish and it probably won't go the correct direction. If you want more reasons:-multiplayer doesn't work-the maps themselves suck and only 1 type of map is a survival map-the other maps are buggy-the AI stop for long periods of time or just stop completely-the staff don't really solve any problems in the game-literally it has been 2 years and nothing has really changed besides adding a pillar...-the maps you can play and build are floating islands and your resources drop down there 50% of the time -after xx waves the energy you are supposed to get randomly goes off into the bottom of the map and you never get the energy from them -the developers probably stopped working on this game to pursue something else so it seems to give off the signal of an abandoned game. I can go on and on about it so buy this game at your own risk, I am not saying it won't ever get better but if they keep on going this way then it will be safe to say the developers just want your money for half♥♥♥♥♥work and will probably drag it out as long as they can.

Ive waited an entire yea and it is exactly the same game, nothing notably new.Games take time, every game is different. Refactoring. Blah Blah. The problem isnt that the game is broken. Yeah its got bugs, I expect that. Not one significant update in a year.How is that Space Engineers can produce new mechanics to their game almost weelky on the spot, then release a bug fix of those issues within the next few days? Sauropod has let me down for a game I was really excited about. I even had bought a copy at release for my brother in-law.Dont be a sucker, you $20 would be better spent on a game with active devs.			"

								(Edit as of 11/29/2013 - some people have mentioned that I haven't played the game enough to give it a chance.  Note:  I was an early kickstarter backer and I've put a bunch of time into it even before it was avalable on Steam).I wanted this game to be amazing.  I think it still has the potential to become amazing.  I was a very eager kickstarter backer (just one person out of (27,060  Backers who funded the amount of $702,516--and I believe if they were polled the grand majority of the backers would not be very happy about it)....I haven't seen enough so far that I can recommend it.  The ""idea"" of Castle Story is fantastic, but the interface is horrible and non-intuitive.  I really want these developers to improve it and hopefully some day the original dream comes true with Castle Story.For right now I cannot recommend Castle Story.  I strongly recommend that others wait and see how future development proceeds.  One day if I see significant improvements I promise to revise my review and give it a thumbs up.  In spite of being upset about backing Castle Story I really do want these developers to realize their original dream and be successful.  The project was funded in late August of 2012 and I'm wondering why things seem to proceed at such a slow pace.			"

								I was excited for this game from the moment i heard about it, i was one of the first to jump on the initial kick starter in 2012. when I got the 1st release of the game later in 2012 it was pretty much unplayable... and I am sad to say after 3 years of development not much has changed.The controls are clunky and fickle making building anything somewhat complex a constant fight. the AI is just terrible, they cant seem to do anything on their own with out you micro managing them to make sure they dont get stuck. there is no real content in the game yet, no real point to playing(unless a constant battle with controls and poor AI is what you find fun). I had high hopes for this game and maybe one day it will be great, but at its current rate it will not be anything worth playing for another several years :(			"

								Just don't buy this. There are thousands of better things to do with $20 than buying this game. Buying this game is the same as giving $20 to the begger on the street that leeches on working people and gets drunk every night. You gain nothing from giving them $20 and society gets nothing from giving them $20. Do not do it.These guys don't work like you and I work for our boss. These guys are the kind that were making Duke Nukem Forever for 20years and still ended up with nothing.It's very unlikely they are trying to make the game but are the most incompetent people ever. Very likely they are sitting around the office all day playing their Xbox and eating pizza. I don't know how they aren't disgusted with themselves but having millions of dollars from sales in your pocket probably helps a lot.- The developers are so bad at their job that the first alpha released worked better than the first alpha they brought to Steam. And the current version on Steam works even worse than the first. The game development is going backwards. I know how crazy this sounds yet I'm saying the words with truth.- All 3years of development so far have been a struggle with making the core of the game. Basic functions are still not completed and many features like remapping keys or full options screen or a working AI pathfinding are still not in the game.They use Unity3D and all basic game features that you can imagine are nothing more than importing an asset store package and 15min configuration to build it into your own game. These guys fail at using a wizard that has 200 tutorial videos about on youtube. Literally!Anyone with the capacity to work in a game engine can rebuild to the current state of the game within a month. I know.- Their artist is working as hard as the rest of the team. All characters and props can be made in 2 weeks after viewing a few hours of Blender tutorials. Everything is modelled and textured extremely simple. You'd think after 3 years they would have more than 1 spruce tree, 1 yellow guy, 1 kind of grey rocks and 1 kind of wood beams/planks? You'd think there would be beaches and mountain ranges and dessert maps etc?- About a year ago they must have noticed buyers were catching on to their scam. So they hired some guy to full time censor the forums and delete any negative thread and ban any user that speaks any kind of bad about the game. Meanwhile all the new buyers who still genuinly think this game will ever be finished get smoothtalked how busy everyone is and how they have plans to fix and remake everything. After months when that deadline has come and gone, they invent a new deadline.TLDR: The people from Sauropod are scum.If you don't believe me, just scroll down the reviews and you can see that nothing I am saying is a lie. These guys are scammers, will shut you up any way they can and Valve is so out of touch with their customers that they don't react to thousands of complaints.			"

								I advise agaisnt buying this game (at least in its current state). It has been over 2 years since I purchased this game and there has been no new content added aside from temporary holiday bits. I suggest waiting for the full game if it ever happens. Over the course of the last 2 years, Castle Story has just recently claimed it will add a new map. Yes, 2 years for a map (and it isn't even available as of writing this). This game has potential, but the developers are not delivering. To help understand, here is a complete list of what has been accomplished with the game (minus bug fixes and balancing) for the past 2 years.

								Do NOT buy this game.This is what happends when you get on the hype train of kickstarter.When they finished kickstarter, they said it will be within 1~2 month before beta version gets released.Guess what? It's been over a year and all they are doing is posting a fancy blog posts about ""hey look, here's what we did today."" kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥I got this game as loon as the alpha version was released, (that's when this wasn't on steam yet) and for few months, only thing devs did was making t shirts and ""goods"" for higher tier donators.Control is terrible, and game is only ""presentable,"", not playable properly.You probably won't even get to play enough do things like you've seen on their trailers, because this type of game already has been done, and people already know what to expect.If you looked at this because you like Minecraft style game, I'd say try something else.Post-minecraft games try so hard to be like Minecraft and it's runing the image of the ""indie games.""Some of the devs no longer try to come up with their own, other than trying to leech off of popular indie games (such as Minecraft)Never get on the hype train for a game that only has ""cool"" visuals.edit: older ""review"" from 8 months agohttp://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/19kvzo/a_concerned_backers_rant_remember_castle_story/ "

								After backing this game based on its promise, it has turned out to be a huge disappointment thanks to the continous bugs and the complete and total lack of anything even vaguely resembling progress.Every time I find myself of a mind or in a mood to play it, I go and look for updates only to find they have at best released a handful of minor bugfixes, usually for bugs they created with their last major patch. No new content, no new levels, none of the mechanics that were originally promised, nothing. No multiplayer, no story mode, no maps or map editor...And I'm not talking about every few days or even weeks. This is totally the type of game I really WANT to play, it seemed like it had the potential. Originally, I *did* check up on it on a regular basis. But after continous disappointment, particularly when I *would* see an update on Steam and get my hopes up, only to find it was nothing of interest... I lost interest. Now several months go by before I even bother, and yet, still then, there's nada. Nichts. Zilch.And my interest in the game, despite it's potential, despite the fact that it SHOULD be the kind of game I'd love, my interest is basically the same as the game's development pace, which is to say, next to non-existent. Actually, the very fact that it has inspired me to go out of my way to write what is for me a rare negative review should say it all. I have no idea what they do over there at Sauropod Studios, but it most certainly isn't anything remotely like what I'd call ""work"", I can only assume that they've happily taken the $700k they made off the Kickstarter and are laughing at us all the way.EDIT: The developers CLAIM the game will be ""released"" at the end of the year. IF that happens and we actually get what we were promised in the Kickstarter, I will revist this review at that time. Until then, I simply cannot recommend this game based on the progress we have seen in the 3 years since it was supposed to release in the first place.			"

								It's simple fraud. They are not working on it anymore. Don't buy it.Edit November 2015:There have been some updates lately which indicate a little development. Still, these updates are nowhere near to justify 6 months between major changes. However, it is not possible to tell if Sauropod Studio is doing as little as it seems or if it is just really terrible at communicating. In either case it forfeited any trust the community placed in it.My advice: Stay away from the game until you can call it an actual game.			"

								Three something years have passed since I helped to Kickstart this game and in that time they've added barely anything. The rate of development is completely and utterly inexcusable and is the main reason I'm going to give this game my first negative review.These ""developers"" are jokes who got lucky back when the Kickstarter craze first started and made it big. They raised over half a million and yet despite that their game has often gotten WORSE with each new update as they keep breaking the AI or whatever else. They seemingly have no idea how to properly code a game and have gone silent for months at a time as they ""refactor"" core game systems that just arn't working - according to them.It really is a shame, the game's concept is charming and possessed of great potential - too bad it's been squandered by these ""developers"".

								Ridiculously broken to be made available to the public to play: controls are wonky and counter-intuitve; bricktrons just stand there even after directed towards a place or task, just running down the clock to corruptron slaughter; and the construction method is impractical, though that was the only selling point that led me to this regrettable purchase (since most of the map is floating islands, its only natural to begin designing and building bridges - not possible in any way). I'm sure I and a few other buyers took the fall for this sinkhole so you don't have, so take this lesson: NEVER buy Early-Access Games. You would think that the sales would fund the updates, but you would be wrong. I now know I was.			"

Early Access Review
								I saw Castle Story on Kickstarter back in 2012 and wished I could have kick-started it, the concept was new and interesting, the graphics looked fresh and pretty and it looked like a fun game that would go somewhere. Well, 4 years down the line it still looks exactly like it did 4 years ago on that Kickstarter page.As far as I see, there is no real 'gameplay' to it other than plan a castle, dig some quarry's or mines and then watch the little yellow dudes AI fail to get it them the build zone or even properly drop resources off.Instead, you'll spend your game time watching your workers swap resources around with one another rather than building anything. It almost seems like they tried to implement a bucket brigade AI... which would work great if they gave the poor little workers a little more logic so they didn't run the exact same path when on the same task - because they then spend more time swapping resources between themselves and 'finding paths to blueprint' instead of running over there.The problems around building make it really hard to even attempt the 'wave survival' game modes - because its takes so long to get a simple wall around it and the damage enemies do (even on easy) wipes out your meagre combat units really quickly (I survived 60 kills ~8 waves before losing but still didn’t even have a simple wall up because the yellow dudes couldn't decide or work out how to get places)The final straw for me was putting 6 workers on a large build task. They'd keep stopping at the build site, even though there were plenty of resources and lots of room for movement. They just all kept saying they were going to the same pile of resources which I can only assume meant all 6 of their poor little AI's were clashing and blocking one another... without anyone actually moving!Some bullet points of what bugged me the most (Version 0.5.1):- The UI is terrible. Every action in-game relies on a right click and hold - it's not intuitive, it’s not clear and it’s not even explained to you. I had to go find a video tutorial on basic camera movement and building because it was so annoyingly unclear. Actions should speak for themselves and not have to be searched for.- Speaking of UI, sorting what materials can be placed on a storage pad is ridiculous. If you want to make it specifically wood, it takes 5 right click, hold, and selects to set it so. You need a lot of storage, so multiply that by the number of space you want... it’s just plain silly.- For a game about building castles its surprising tedious to build anything in (let alone a castle), you need more workers to get things done faster but the more workers you have the slower the build goes because they spend time bumping into one another and sometimes they just decide to have a stop work meeting.- The game constantly lags and has miniature seizures for a few seconds every few seconds...- As outlined, the AI is just shoddy. There are a few simple things that would make it miles more efficient... the best being a complete overhaul of their path-finding algorithm and how they interact with one another (not swapping resources every damn time they bump into each other!)- The game could benefit from a 'speed up time' button... a lot.Overall: 3/10Just so much wasted potential.Avoid at all costs - don't be fooled! There are better games out there!			"

								Avoid this game, do not be tempted to even want to try it. I have stopped playing for over a year, and saw the new ""positive"" reviews and decided to give it a go again.Devs have not made any improvements at all with regards to the AI which pretty much breaks the game as you can't do anything as your workers won't do what they need to do due to bad programming.They have already made lots of money from earlier sales, so please avoid until they actually fix the issues and start making improvements and adding real features that matters. If you want to throw your money away, do so at other devs that actually intend to complete and fufill what is promised in a timely manner.Edit:I have been approached by a member of the Castle Story team, and this is a welcome change as it shows things may be heading the right direction now. Of course, as what I have told that team member, unfortunately, what ever is being said to me are just 'promises' and is no different from what things were many years ago. Real improvements and updates needs to be released in timely manners for me to recommend this game.So thank you for reaching out, it is a very welcome improvement, but the good PR needs to be followed up with actual action.

								So once again here we have a studio not delivering on a promise to get a game out that people have bought and paid for. I purchased this game shortly after being offered on SEA roughly 18 months ago. To date the ONLY things done has been refactoring the code and a large map added. The AI is atrocious, the devs constantly delete threads or posts with any negative criticism and generally have an attitude of suppression. All we want to see is progression and to this point I dont believe the studio has enough experience to deliver what they promised. I am beginning to compare this game to GODUS as being a failure. So purchase at your own risk. if its finished it may be years down the road and not in a general time frame of 3 to 5 years for a game such as this. Remember over 2 years have already been invested in the game and it may take another 4 or 5 years at the rate its going if they last that long.Here is a sample of themhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079381919/moderatormessages/65143/ "

								Bought this game a long time ago. It was pretty fun then. Not a lot to it, but that's expected of early access games. However, the game hasn't made any notable progress from a player standpoint and the AI appears to have gotten quite a bit worse to the point of making building anything a mess of micromanaging a bunch of lemmings. Coming back to the game like I have, the only new thing I noticed is that the bricks look a bit more like stone instead of plastic.Had this game made progress or at least remained relatively smooth in gameplay, I could reccomend it as a fun little sandbox game. As it stands, I urge people not to pay twenty dollars for an unfinished and partially broken game that has lost its promise.			"

Early Access Review
								My complete thoughts on this title. Basically, castle story is a very unique game that has a ton of potential. Although people beleive its very similar to games like towns, its completely different. Altough the objective of castle story is to protect your base from ememys and buils structues, its thought on survival is really weak, There're no food or water meters for your little minions, and the whole idea of 'crafting' is completely useless. Despite this, the game is actually fun to play, but can only be played for short amount of hours at a time, as its very repetative. You will always find yourself either building, chopping tree's or mining. Thats pretty much it, untill you have to fight a small amount of enemys day-by-day. Its area of land is also very small and limited, but as i said, it can be fun to play, and its still in Early Access, so what can you expect? So, is this game worth $20? Probably not, if im honest. Although fanboys may disagree, and cliaming that 'its only in early development and more will come', we should really expect more from these types of games, expecially if people are laying down $20 for a game that could have been made by a college student. Overall, if you're on the wall with this game, save the cash, and wait till more has been added. Not much to do, and not much fun overall. Infact the only thing that will keep you playing is the graphics.			"

								I tried playing this game again after two years. My first impression of the game was it was absolute trash. Here is what you need to know.Pros:1.Fun concept.2. Combat is longer than before.3. Developers are being more active than previous years.Cons:1. While the bricktons do work together, they will simply all get stuck once you get more than three doing a task. 2. Catapaults are completely broken. I was not able to change targets after selecting one area it would only fire in that one spot regardless. Better make that one area really count since you can't deconstruct anything.3. Your brickton spawning is either capped, or gets bugged and you cannot create more bricktons. 4. Development is incredibily slow. However, the studio seems to be picking up the pace as of late. This game has been in early access for at least 4 years as of now.5. The game performance is absolutely atrocious. After playing a match for an hour, my fps would jump from 1 fps to 45-60 after capping it at 60. The ratio of dropped frames was about 1fps for 8 seconds for 20 seconds of 45-60fps. This is my high tier pc here are my specs. i7-6700 @ 4.0Ghz 16gb ddr4 @ 3200Titan X (pascal)1tb hdd (wd blue)Conclusion: While I really want this game to come to fruition, it still has a lot of work to go. I wouldn't recommend purchasing the game in it's current state. The game needs optimization and bugfixing before I would recommend ANY one from buying this game. If I am getting the game to @ 1fps imagine the average joe pc. TL:DR:This game has still has broken core mechanics, game ruining bugs, horrid optimization, broken pathfinding. I absolutely would not recommend this game currently as of January 2, 2017. After note:I'll try again in another two years.			"

								I brought this game a couple of years ago and it has been a dog to run, So i put it to one side and every now and then i would see it when clearing my Steam library and have a play and still it would be horible, than suddenly i see a update a day ago and thought ""I will give it one more try "" and suddenly it worked and i was enjoying it. it is like the developer has pulled the sinking ship out of the water and put a new hull on it and floated it out again, Now its not perfict there is a couple of small performance issues like slight delay when ordering the Bricktrons around (feels like they are having a quick think before acting) and that the pathfinding is a bit hit or miss (mostly hit) . But the main thing is that i suddenly enjoyed making the castles and would feel that multiplayer with pvp will be great fun smashing each others buildings down. I wish this happend a year ago and that the game can recover from such a negative low review points, As it has a great feel now and hopefully the positives will be felt by the developers who will then bring more building choice and content for it.

								WOAH... view the kickstarter page...It's a great game... but they made all their money already. Right now they are just rolling in dough and trying to give out all their glitchy software to their kickstarters...It's fun but not as fun as it should be. Period. It's ___ but not as ___ as it should be... blank can be just about any word or phrase... positive or negative(but mostly negative)(edit; here's where I slowly lose my temper thinking about this game and it's designers and failures)they made 10 times the goal on the kickstarter... the game should be working right now. Its a dinky 100 meg game, prolly made on some free to use engine. Only has about prolly 50 models (squares) and 50 (low res) textures... It's all about gameplay and functionality here... and since people seem to love it so much that they threw out to this company 8 times the amount it costs to buy the same engine that GTAIV and prolly V uses... why bother fixing any of the bugs... all they need to do now is say its done...I think what they are actually doing is just saying its still in beta or alpha or ""prototype""... just to keep the kickstarter page up... Really kinda disgusted with this game since I found this out... heard about it in a review... didnt believe it... didnt even believe the kickstarter page, surely that comma is ment to be a period, added it all up myself...yes the really did make 700 grand on a beta glitchy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game...yes and they did go from beta to prototype... so who knows what will come next... beta2, prealpha? whatever... ♥♥♥♥ this game, you can barely if ever build what you want... I havent even gone over all the broken AI, they castle ruining blueprint glitches, the sheer inability to build the most simple bridge but the ability to build an infinite unsupported staircase... the terrible combat...Last time I checked the multiplayer didnt even work... it has only 2 freaking SIMPLE♥♥♥♥♥♥♥maps... the map editor is disabled... it lags too, I run skyrim or dishonered full settings and this game give me more lag, for stupid reasons too, usually reasons critical to the gameplay... its just poor on all fronts.I'm actually angry about it now.

Early Access Review
								After a year or so of not playing Castle Story, I recently came back to it and soon ran into a new patch which broke the game for me. I decided to wait a few weeks for them to fix it — the one that froze the game with constant lag after about an hour and a half of playing the same map, and when you reach a certain number of people. Over a month later, there is still no fix.(As of the 26th of June, I have tested the latest patches... it's still going on)When I add that situation to how long this game has taken in the past, until now, to actually have updates implemented, I have to give this one a rather big no for my recommendation. This game has so much potential, and I mean a lot, but there is definitely an issue with the very slow development team, and the lack of progress made when an update is actually released — not much has actually been implemented long term, and important parts of the game are still disabled by the developers because they don't work properly (such as digging). I follow a lot of early access games and this is the poorest development cycle I am aware of at the moment.  Negatives (As of June 2015 with 'bleeding edge' version)-The way the UI is set-up for building, placing items, etc, is atrocious. You have to drill down through so many selections to reach what you want to reach, then you have to get back out if you want to do something else.. it's a bit like torture.  (This is the worst thing about the game for me)-The Save/Load menu is bulky, and slow to use. This needs polishing. (small issue though)-Very slow progression with the development of the game-The radius with cutting down trees. You have to keep adding 'flags' every time you want to cut down a group of trees, and this is rather tedious. -Major performance issues when reaching a certain number of people on screen -The way blue crystal is put into crates by default (again, tedious to manually move it to the actual blue crystal)-The lack of maps on survival. There needs to be a variety here based on peoples play styles, such as a corner start, instead of in the middle. This would greatly improve the game for a lot of people.-The waves(enemies) come too fast. There needs to be an option to manage waves before beginning the game-The fact you have to place a clean up broom radius flag… they should just clean up automatically, or the stuff that needs cleaning up should disappear over time. (tedious to manage, and the little bits littering the ground slow the game down)Positives (As of June 2015 with 'bleeding edge' version)-Friendly fire, but this can get annoying (needs fine tuning)-Variety of enemies (needs fine tuning)-The types of structures you can build using stone or wood. This is rather fun and is really the main point of the game. -The cuteness of the game. The yellow guys and the grey guys are all very cute and make cute noises.-Having your archers take out the enemy is rather enjoyable once you have enough of them, and a system in place where you know exactly where to place them, and how to build your defences. -The quick response of the developers to forum posts is very supportive & commendable-The music is quite good, but there needs to be more variety.

								I bought this game about a year ago, played it and thought it was cool for an early access. I look at the game now, and it seems like nothing has changed at all. It's a cool idea, what it does have is pretty cool and well done, but development seems to have petered off. For the amount of gameplay it has, and from what I see, is ever likely to have, I would not reccommend the game for more than a few bucks.			"

								Castle Story has potential to be a pretty cool game, unfortunately it looks more and more like that will never happen.  Development is painfully slow, I think maybe the devs just get together once a month for a few hours.  They just keep redoing the same features over and over, never getting it right or even making any noticeable difference.As it stands at the time of this review (and probably for several months to come) the game has very little to offer.  One playthrough of survival will probably be all you need to see everything there is.  As far as creative mode, there are much better sandbox games out there that are much less frustrating in ways a game should not be frustrating (pathing, glitches, etc).Maybe come back in a couple years and see if they've made any progress toward doing this idea justice, but don't bother buying it now.  They've had more than enough time to deliver but they're not even trying.			"

								This game has great potential. You command around minions rejected from Despicable Me. You order them to collect various resources and build a grand castle of your own design, then defend against monsters during the night.However, in it's current state, Castle Story isn't very functional. It offers a hardly playable tutorial that teaches very basic things. It doesn't teach you how to summon new minions, something you obviously need to know how to do. The A.I have very poor pathfinding and often get stuck.Look for this when it is fully released. Until then, avoid.			"

								I bought this game hoping that I would be one of the lucky ones to purchase it when it was more stable... I wasn't. There are about 4 lands and the option to play as either survival or sandbox mode within each land. I tried each of them but only one worked WITHOUT crashing. Yep. 3/4 lands and 7/8 modes crashed before I could even get past the loading screen. When I was finally able to get to that one land that DID work, it was so slow molasses would laugh at it. Honestly, the only reason it says I played 3 hours, was because it wouldn't close/allow me to exit.I think the idea of the game is really nice, and if the developers worked hard at it, it could be a very popular and high-selling game. Unfortunately, for now, I regret buying it and I honestly can't say that I would recommend this for a friend. Unless I hate them.			"

								This game is nearly unplayable due to bugs that should have been dealt with three years ago. At it's core, Castle Story is an experimental survival/sandbox RTS in which you tell little yellow guys called Bricktrons what to do. They can work or fight, but typically get confused while carrying out their assigned tasks and just stop doing anything. The bugs in this WiP game are just too much, considering the fact that it's been 'in beta' for four years now. The project is obviously too much for the 10-man, part-time, on-again-off-again development team, and it's gotten to the point that they've hired on a PR guy to try in vain to dispel the rumors that this game has crumbled to nothing. Updates are infrequent, and the ones that come every four to six months add no new content, and fix none of the bugs which make the game almost unplayable. Box, if you're reading this, I'm sorry for you, and what the company you're representing is doing to you, and to the Kickstarter backers of this game. 1/5			"

This game sounds really good, but not a huge amount has changed from a user perspective since it hit early access a year or two ago.The devs do seem open and honest about the problems and decisions they've faced, and I don't doubt their integrity, but I am starting to wonder if this game is going the way of Godus, and will, eventually, end up being a pale imitation of what was promised.The latest release date we've been given is ""The start of 2016"". I think this is ambitious, and would say wait until then before buying this game.  Until then, I can't recommend it. "

								I've tried and tried to give this game a chance. I finally gave up 8 months ago. When I saw that they came out with a new update, I had high hopes of coming back to something that actually functioned as an entertaining game. Alas, it is still the same basic map with the same basic functions that they've had since the beginning; the pathing on the builders is still broken; the ""building"" is absurdly basic (imagine just stacking a bunch of blueprint rectangles then sitting and waiting for your builders to try and make them a reality, all while watching them either freeze in place, forget their tast entirely, or block each other's progress);  and the interface is unnecessarily complicated. This game came out almost two years ago and the game has not progressed. Maybe in another two years they'll add the random map generator like they've been promising, but until then, I'm done with this mess.			"

Early Access Review
								I've owned this for over like 3 years and I backed it in the Kickstarter and had super high hopes for Castle Story but I felt really ripped off when I finally got to play the 'early access'. It looked absolutely nothing like in the trailers or demos that we were given a lot of previews of. I followed development really closely and I felt like the dev team at times were really ignorant of how the players felt about their 'progress' and 'attention' on certain aspects of the game.I made a thread on the forums with over 15 things that I could not find in the early access version of the game, vs all the demo videos they had shown. In the end I got the response I was expecting. Nothing.In the beginning you were actually advised by the devs to enable the cheats console to even use the game properly.Certain sounds were bugged so badly like background 'crickets' that were looped really loudly and never stopped and couldn't be silenced without muting the whole game.Entire 'building bricks' that were in the demos were missing. These were small things that were missing for ages.There were no enemies for close to a year.The menu, even years after the early access was released, is still terrible and so unintuitive.For 2 years after the game was available to play, there wasn't any multi-player at all.It took a year just to get the choice to start off on a different map from that only single one the game shipped with.Development blogs and transparency from the devs went from being something they would write about and share with their players weekly, to where you wouldn't hear from them for months despite people paying for early-access (funding them).AI was so bugged and 'bricktons' would just randomly stop what they were doing or get stuck so easily.Performance on a good machine was absolutely terrible for over a year.All in all, for the amount of money they raised on Kickstarter and the speed at which they went to early access, the game was one of the most disappointing in its early stages, that I had ever seen. In the end this game in particular taught me to never purchase an 'early-access' game because the sheer lack of development progress the game can be on, and still be allowed to be released on Steam is just ridiculous.I really wanted to like this game, but I feel that development has shifted so many times due to the incompetent team. Also in mid 2015 almost no one plays this game. All Youtube videos are from 2-3 years ago when the game still had some 'hype' let alone some 'hope' surrounding it. Little has changed since then except that now the game has less bugs and could be considered something that doesn't need to be in 'early access'. This doesn't change the fact that the game simply isn't fun for me, and that the controls and UI and menus are still terrible. Basically the developers have totally missed their deadline in terms of it getting popular.It's not remotely worth €25 and it probably won't be for another 2 years. It's a huge shame too because the graphics and potential this game has is absolutely through the roof. Hopefully in a few more years I will be able to recommend it, that is, if development is even on going and if people even play it.P.S. I know my review isn't very 'consistent' but you can't expect that when development on this game has been about as inconsistent as it gets.			"

								You go to the car dealer and want to buy a car thats brand new, not even manufactured yet.  They promise you tires, a dashboard, even a CD player.  Now, after 2 years of waiting for them to build it, they deliver the dashboard to you in peices.  Tell you the CD player is in there somewhere but doesnt work.  And perhaps someday they will add tires... And the engine was never even installed (they locked the hood hoping you wouldnt notice).Welcome to Castle Story....Great promise, excellent idea, no follow through.  A scam plain and simple.  Just another early access title that is still allowed to be sold after no significant updates or progress.  Steam needs some EA oversight!

Early Access Review
								I was very excited for this game. I was actually convinced to buy this game a year ago because a friend had it and wanted to try the multiplayer. We tried forever to get the mutiplayer to work, but it never did, and the devs eventually locked it. Its been like that for a long time. I never wrote a review about the game because I hoped it would get better. It never did. The game is still plauged with problems and has been in early access for at least a year and a half. That seems like plenty of time to actually get something done, right? Nope. I noticed almost no difference in the game when I played today in comparason to the day I bought it (End of 2013) The only things that seemed different were that they had iron and annoying curruptions that took forever to kill. The game still feels like a buggy mess when I play. Constantly my workers glitch and stop working or listening to commands. Ive seen them complain that they cant reach blocks right in front of them. They bunch up in 2 block wide hallways and I constantly have my guys shot by archers. My warriors dont listen and attacking is annoying because its hard to click on the guy you want to kill. Sometimes guys stand there and die because they glitch out. Some glitches have to be fixed by reloading the save and gets annoying when you have to do it every 30-60 minutes. The game also suffers from screen tearing. My NVEDIA 880M and Intel I7 4710HQ@3.50GHz have trouble running this game because the game refuses to use them to their full power. The highest ive seen my GPU usage go in this game is 40% and the CPU 50%. Mostly the game uses around 10-20% of my GPU and 30-40% of my CPU and my ram hovers around 9GB (Out 0f 32) Since the game refuses to use my gpu or cpu the framrate is terrible. When I get into a game the framerate is great. But it quickly drops and then hits around 1-2 FPS with gpu usage at 1-10% and CPU at 10-20%. I know you have to click the delete key but even then the game hovers around 30-40FPS with 20-30% gpu usage and 30-40% cpu usage. I dont have a cap on frames either. In an attept to fix the screen tearing I lowered the graphics to fastest and went to NVEDIA control panel and turned on VSYNC. Frame rate was still the same even though my GPU was 1-10% and CPU was still 20-30%. On my old computer I had in 2013 (It had a NVEDIA 230M and an I7 cpu with 8GB of ram) the framrate never went below 120FPS and stayed near 200FPS when the game started and I had full GPU and CPU usage. It seems to me that this problem has come recently. The sreen tearing is ugly and basically is the final nail in the coffin for this game. Most of the graphical problems arrise when the GPU usage goes down to below 20%. Setting the game to High Priority does not even help. My GPU is not crap either. For some perspective I can run GTA 50FPS with everything at very high except water (High) and shadows (High) with MSAA on and tessalation off. My resolution is 2560X1440p too so its quite impressive and the game looks great. When playing GTA gpu usage is at 98% and CPU is at 70-90%. In short the graphical problems come when the GPU is used at its lowest and I could ignore the bugs if it was not for the horrendus screen tearing and FPS that slowley drops over time. What sucks even more is that when you join a world at wave 10 the framrate starts at 60 and then drops to 10-20 over a period of 2 minutes and its not because there is stone everywhere. I constantly remove the stone by hitting delete.			"

								 Castle Story was a fun concept tied around a modestly appealing, simplistic art style. And before anybody locks to this review for being negetive, let me explain. I don't dislike this game, but it's simply under-developed and shows very little ammounts of progress. The cons far out way the pros, but I will be more than happy to change this review once it finishes. (IF it finishes.)Pros:-Voxel system-Cool graphical style-It's like if Minecraft was simplified and made into an RTSCons:-The AI is dreadfuly stupid-Path finding is about as bad as you could get without the bots standing completely still (which they will often do)-Optimization? This game, even on the lowest graphical settings, will at random, draw to a halt. Freezing and stuttering like your computer is a toaster-Lots of bugs, unresponsive AI, can't cut down a tree without it tumbling off the side of the map into oblivion, ect-It's like if Minecraft was simplified and made into an RTS I really do wanna see this game get further along, but such a slow development process is leaving me with little hope it'll ever get out of early access. (Although multiplayer was finally added in recently.) I won't hold my breath for this game.TL:DR early access at its finest. 4/10(PS: Could be a good 5-6 as is were the AI not so bad.)(PPS: To the developer: Please work on this. It's a great concept, and shouldn't be left to die.)			"

								Honestly, is anything being done on this game? I backed it well over a year ago and I feel pretty used.Novel idea, we all thought it was going to be cool, but I presume the devs have had their heads in the sand ever since they realized it wasn't going to be a cakewalk to deliver what they promised.I still believe the original concept could be saved, but I HIGHLY recommend waiting to buy until that happens, because my dollar sure hasn't been put to work.

								Yet another game full of potential, but lazy devs had done almost abosolutely nothing to update this game. I know a game that was similar to this game (Timber and Stone) that was release the same year, and about a few months apart.The first release of Timber and Stone had more features than the latest version of Castle Story. I like to consider this as robbing. The devs robs money from you and it robs a game from being good. What a shame. Keep my money devs, Just don't do it again, and don't give us false hope, you robbed us and the least you could do is admit it.			"

Its super finicky, esoteric and most importantly, not fun. This is coming from a guy who enjoys playing Dwarf Fortress.When I commented on this, they said its 'part of the fun'Well, when its 'fun' to be 'not fun' I give it a thumbs down.Save your money, spend it on a game thats made with the intent of enjoying it as a game in mind.

								Let me begin by saying this game was awesome on paper. Seeing what they were promising with a final product excited me even more. This is not my first rodeo in terms of Early-Access. I know full well that games are not created over night, but I have had this game for more than a year. I see updates to the multiplayer, and hotfixes and the like, and just am wondering what the f*** these develop[ers are doing? It certainly isn't streamlining their product. There is just one thing you need to know about this game it:THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE.Don't come at me with the 'it's still in development' or 'your system sucks' or any of that because that is not the issue. Plenty of games are early access and they can run. My friend and I ahd better luck playing multiplayer a year ago than we did today. Took a chance on this game on early access, and I GREATLY regret my purchase. Do NOT buy this game. Do NOT. They advertise that they have received a bunch of money from kickstarter, well it doesn't show. They must have spent it all on hookers and blow instead of hiring 3 more qualified programmers to help with their game. People with degrees from community colleges can make a better product in the amount of time that this game has been in early access. Save yourself the trouble and don't buy one more gram of coke for these bozos.			"

								I've been playing it off and on since it came out and have logged quite a number of hours. I keep checking back in because I LOVE the idea and style. The reason I can't recommend it at this point is the price. For me it was easily worth it for the 100 or so hours (a bargain in fact). But the average person is definitely going to stop playing after a couple of frustrating games and that seems like a waste of money.2 years, and very little has improved. All the in-your-face bugs are still there. Some of the less annoying ones have been fixed but very few of them. It leads me to believe that the developers are simply incapable of fixing these bugs. If they were able to do it, it would have happened by now. But the potential of this game should not be wasted. Therefore, someone needs to steal this great idea and build a game that actually works. I'd donate big to a kickstarter to a dev who would run with this idea.Edit: Been a fare amount of improvement since the last time I've played about a year ago. But still... you are going to loose not because of strategy but because a glitch. Literally everytime. Also I wish they would fix the slowing to a crawl thing after playing for a couple hours. It pains me to say I still can't recomend for the average gamer. I'll check back in in another year.			"

								It pains me to write this, especially as one who managed to get some enjoyment out of this title, as well as someone who bought the game barely a month after it was put up on Steam with high hopes. Castle Story is a lackluster and at times needlessly frustrating experience that will just make you want to crave more with no hope of it ever delivering. First of all, the AI remains dirt stupid and at times unresponsive, making mutlitasking, an element crucial to games like these, more arduous than it should be. Sandbox mode will most likely not hold your attention for long, with there being a limited variety in building materials. Not only that, but getting said materials is time consuming and tedious, something you don't want said about a supposed sandbox mode. Survival mode seemed promising at first, combining the freedom to build structures of many shapes and sizes with a tower defense play-style. Now, there is fun to had here if you're willing to look past the bad AI and hardly any strategy. Otherwise, the novelty won't save it from the mediocrities riddled throughout this gamemode. Accompanied with the aforementioned AI problems, the guards will ignore oncoming enemies, letting them slip by and wreak havok on your settlement. It's a shame because this gamemode has the potential to be something fufilling, if it were just executed better and had more options at your disposal (i.e, leveling up bricktrons and contraptions, stronger materials, depth in level design). With no other gamemode to fall back on, you are almost guaranteed to lose interest long before this ever leaves early-access. You'd think that the developers would have found the time to encorporate more features and gamemodes in the last two years or so to keep us interested, much like many other open-alpha indie games out there. But alas, for whatever reason, updates have mainly consisted of bug fixes and graphical improvements. Unless by some miracle, this game gets finished and has a solid, replayable, and satisfying experience as a final product, I doubt I'll be concerning myself with this game anytime soon, and I suggest you do the same, to anyone thinking of buying this.

Early Access Review
								OK, so a while back I did a review on this game. I still said it was positive, but I basically said ""It's buggy but it'll get better"". And now I feel is the time to re-review it.Let me start off by saying this is one of the coolest and prettiest castle builders I've seen in a long while. It has a near perfect arrangement of blocks to suit all of your construction needs, yet it simultaniously keeps you materials as basic as possible. You can build with Stone, or Wood. There are a few other materials that can be used to make useful structures, but those are the two things your castle is really gonna be made of. Yet in that simplicity, you can make very cool-looking castles with ease. And what's even cooler is that in the survival gamemodes, all of the castles you built for purpose and purpose alone still turn out looking amazing. So let's talk about how you build castles. Basically, you have little yellow blobby units called ""bricktrons"", which you have to tell what to do. This can consist of mining, cutting trees, building your castle, repairing damages, etc. Getting them to do these things is very simple. Want to build something? Create a construction task, place blueprints, and assign bricktrons to the task, they do the rest. The way they go about building these things still isn't the best... but it gets the job done.Then there's combat. So there's two survival gamemodes: Invasion, and conquest. Conquest has you go and capture crystals, and invasion has you defend against infinitely increasing waves of enemies. But both will have you be fighting 3 enemies: Little corruptrons, medium corruptrons, and big corruptrons. Not the most original lineup, but bare with me here. Anyway these 3 classes will act exactly like you expect. Little ones are fast, and big ones are slow but deadly. You have 3 ways of killing them. Warrior bricktrons with swords, Archer bricktrons, or catapults. In my opinion, the combat is probably one of the weaker points of the game, especially now that they nerfed your warriors. So the waves can get unfairly difficult, and you absolutely need a catapult. But even then, it's hard to learn how to lead your shots. It's not bad per say, but just be aware this game can get pretty brutal.Real quick I'll talk about the visuals, they are just shy of a masterpeice! Fantastic texture work, a great lighting engine, dynamic shadows on the higher settings, and they did a great job of bumpmapping everything. Unfourtunately the frames can take a dip at times, and there's no real particle affects, so the distance can look a bit ugly.And I'll be honest, the game still has some bugs. It still crashes from time to time (though it's not really all that bad) Bricktrons can have some quirky pathfinding at times, and they for some reason really want to place blocks they can't reach. Which really bothers me. Also, sometimes your knights will refuse to retreat when you tell them to, and just get pummeled. Which, again, can get very troublesome. I would advise saving regularly if you plan on playing survival.But this game absolutely oozes charm and love. As you build your castle you grow attatched to both it, and your little bricktron minions. (For example there was one moment where I had gotten a builder stuck, so I killed him with my catapult. And that genuinley made me sad.) You start seeing your castle as the home of these little guys, and every once in a while, you pan your camera down, see all your bricktrons working, see the gorgeous lighting and shadows, as well as the majesty of your castle, and your immediately reminded why you play this game.So, should you buy it? It depends. You can't speed up time (and for good reason, optimizing that would be nightmare for anyone) so you'll be waiting a while as your bricktrons slowly build up your castle. For me, this further strengthens the bond between me and what I've built, because I sit there thinking about how much time I've put into it. But some people aren't as patient and will get bored. Which I'm sure is where some of the more recent negative votes come from. (And some people are saying it's to complicated... what? This is as simple as they come... you wanna see a complex sandbox game, go look at Dwarf Fortress!) So ask yourself these questions:1: Are you a sentimental person?2: Are you patient?3: Can you deal with a few rough edges?If you answered no to any of those questions, then I'd say castle story either isn't for you, or maybe you should wait a little longer for more updates.

Unfortunately the kind of updates one expects takes years, no exaggeration. Buy it and wait until you grow old before expecting an update that improves the game. But wait! Your knights will get pumpkins for helmets during halloween!! When you don't hear anything useful from the devs and then get that message that knights get pumkins for helmets during halloween it's like they laugh in your face.So much work they say... I cannot even tell the difference between current version and prototype version yet years have passed.This kind of progress rate and pretending everything is going well is unacceptable!

								So, i played a few hours. Only few maps to play at all. Most of the time the one and the only (!) survival map. The sandbox is nice to try some constructions, but there are no enemies to test your castle = worthless. Your ""bricktons"" are often just stopping while working. Even with enough space for storage and anything else checked, they are just stop working. Even if you reasing them they won't do anything. You have to save, go back to the menu, load and then it will be fine. The UI is awfull. Way to much clicking to build a castle. Hope there will be a lot of updates soon... the game need them...			"

								You never know what you are going to get when you buy into an Early Access game. Sometimes you help fund the next gem of a game, like Prison Architect, who probably wouldn't have had the capital to make such a game if it weren't for EA, but on the other hand, sometimes your money gets flushed into the eternal purgatory that is commonplace in EA and you never get your money back, The Dead Linger. Castle Story feels more like The Dead Linger side of the EA. No, the makers haven't thrown in the towel yet, but there really hasn't been much improvement in the past year, content or performance wise. I honestly hope that I am wrong, and if that is the case, if they finish this game with a stable, playable, fun state, I will change this review, but at the moment, I could not and would not recommend this game to anyone.

								Ok first of all i am one of the few OS X users.I tried to give this game a chance I really did but its horrible in its current state. It's performance is appalling and my system is far better than the specs listed below, I can run CS:GO (On my other account) maxed out at 120 fps in a full on firefight. But this game I'm lucky to get more than 10 frames while the camera is standing still on ""simple graphics"".(Graphic settings; Fastest, Fast, Simple, Good, Beautiful, Fantastic.)Then its ridden with game breaking bugs. Before you say ""It's in early access it's not supposed to be bug free."" this game's alpha came out over a YEAR ago(Proof

. And there's barely anything to even do in this game even tho its been in development for well over a year now.	Heres a rundown of what you can do in the game currently. Play Hard or Normal survival or sandbox mode and a Multiplayer Arena mode. You only have the ability to do these three single player game modes on a single map(Arena mode has 4 tiny little islands apart from each other.). Once playing one of those game modes you have to get Stone from a mine in survival(By digging in sandbox) for building Blocks, half Blocks, stairs, and stone Arches. Then you have to get wood for Barrels, Columns, Platforms, Catapults, Stockpiles, Doors, Torches, and ladders. When in survival you have to fight off endless waves of (I’ve only gotten to wave 5 so don’t truly know if they stop a certain point past that.) Bricktons with your choice of archer or knight.(Can build as many of each as you want if you have the required resources) The way to spawn more is you have to collect blue crystals in the mine and them put them in a barrel near your “Home crystal”. And there you go thats everything you can build and basically do in this game so far.NOT worth 20$ in my opinion now if you're looking for a game to just build something simple and boring looking then get this, but if you want to build some amazingly extraordinary Castle this is not the game.

Early Access Review
								I have got this game for a long time. I did build a lot of castles, both in Survival/Invasion and Sandbox modes. I did not do much in the Conquest mode, even though it is fun as well. What I like and what is CS good at: Being a civil engineer I love the construction aspect: you can really build amazing castles and see how they stand against invasion waves of enemy hordes. Or you can build a set of defensive walls and trenches with towers. You can do a combination of those. The choice is yours and you can see your strategy either fail or succeed. It is kind of like the tower defence games but in 3D with real structural physics where you have to think it trough and then build it up brick by brick. I always enjoyed constructing buildings and structures in Minecraft. And this gives you another aspect: combat level.You also have to set up archers and knights around and organize them in the most effective manner because this game is not forgiving. This game had some issues in past. I think it had developed well from those ""dark ages"" and is now very well playable giving players lots of fun, with even more to come in future.What I dislike: Friendly fire: the archers sometimes hit their own, knights are too weak (in version 0.6x). Sometimes it has to be reloaded due to stuck or unresponsive bricktrons.Final word: I do enjoy this game but is it good for you as well? Do you like building castles and defences? Do you like strategy thinking how to protect your area? Do you like games with combat and some basic resource management? If yes this game is for you too.			"

								I've been following Castle Story since the very early days, backing it well before the jump to Steam, and excitedly looking forward to every dev blog and update. As the years went on, I was less and less optimistic about outcome of the game, and until recently, this would have been a very different review.Looking at the game now (as of 0.7) I can confidently recommend Castle Story. It's been a long and often bumpy road, and I've been critical of some of the decisions made in the development process. However, there is no doubt in my mind as to the dedication and tenacity of the dev team, and now I believe they have the ability to match that dedication, and will bring Castle Story fully to its intended vision.

								Although there is a disclaimer before buying this game as ""early access"", it should be a disclaimer of ""barely started"".  The game mechanics are clunky and the AI is poorly written.  This game began as a kickstarter project in July of 2012.  At the time it was $25 to back the game and earn early access.  The company, Sauropod Studio, was seeking $80,000 to produce the game.  Kickstarters provided the developers with around $700,000.  In March of 2013 a prototype was released.  As of January of 2014 the game remains in prototype stage and the company developers have stated they are continuing to work on the game with no timetable for completion. Adding insult to injury, the game is now available as ""early access"" on Steam for $19.99, less than the original Kickstarter package.  This game is a promising concept but remains only a concept as the Sauropod Studios has stagnated in it's overall development of the game.At this time I do not recommend buying the game, but waiting until full release if the game ever reaches that point.

								It never ceases to amaze me how harsh the critics are about an unfinished project. I backed this game on Kickstarter because it looked awesome: like a strategy/city-builder with Minecraft elements. So far, the game remains unfinished and very difficult (pro-tip: get some archers and have your knights run in circles leading the big Corruptrons around town). The have delivered a framework on which the game can be built, even if the mechanics need some tweaking. The developer emails kickstarter backers about once a month with updates. Around Halloween each year, they add ""spooky"" elements to the characters. If you generally find yourself hating Early Access games, wait until it's published. Early Access means it's not quite done yet, so don't judge it based on the criteria you use on a completed game. The developers are probably too busy developing to answer your idiotic questions. Be patient, or play something else.			"

Early Access Review
								Castle story has the potential to be amazinng but, at the moment, it isn't. The bricktons were very unresponsive, at least for me, and I found it quite boring. There is no tutorial and you have to go into the menu to even find out that some of the most important features in the game even exist. For the first half of my time spent on this game I found myself restarting over and over gain because the building system is flawed, there is no way to undo specific bricks in walls if you make a mistake as far as I can discern and placing even one single brick in the wrong place while laying foundations means that you have to do the whole thing over again. At the moment there is only one map that you can play on and the world editor is disabled. If you do get this game you'll probably end up covering your entire floating island in stockpiles. The game has a lot of pottntial but is held back by some of its own mechanics. The fact that it is based on floating islands looks cool but the game would be much better if it was in a randomly generated non floating world. Do not get it YET.			"

Early Access Review
								This game looked promising and for an Early Access Game it looked fun in videos and screenshots. But the game has been abandoned, there hasn't been an update in a year or so and no sign of the devs. The game is very un-friendly to new players. It took me a half-hour to figure out how to move my guys. Most of the time when you build they don't even finish what you told them to do. The pathfinding is terrible aswell. The animation are not terrible I have to admit.The game also runs like utter♥♥♥♥♥♥on my $1200.00 gaming pc, constant lag and crashes happen almost everytime you start playing. There is really no point in building becuase you're guys can't compete a simple ♥♥♥♥ing task without any problems like pathfinding problems and sometimes they just stand still. Combat is pointless with the pathfinding so whats left? Nothing  do not waste $19.99 on this game. If they kept patching and updating the game I would not be writing this. A huge waste of money, don't let you're wallet near this peice of♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

Early Access Review
								The only way to describe this game is ""dreadful and unfinished"". If this were on a physical CD, we'd call it a coaster.I'm a KS backer and purchased this based on the concept and the movies. The game looked great, the art style was cute and the promised finished date was October 2012. It looked like a very cute sandbox building game with your minions running around mining, woodcutting and building a cute fortress to protect your guys with blueprints and such. It was, and is, a great concept. Execution has been a different issue...Here we are two years later and there's been little progress made and even less communication. While someone like Box may talk on the forums, they simply don't communicate. There is no roadmap which has been requested for the last year. Dev diaries are fluff pieces devoid of any real information. The refactoring process brought no apparent improvements because the promised content releases after it was done have not materialized. In short, the project is a disaster and borders on scammy. So what has been delivered? A prototype with awful UI, stupid AI and hasn't had an appreciable update in a year. The survival and multiplayer modes that have been supposedly added don't work. The UI is beyond horrid - even simple tasks don't work well because the UI is so cumbersome. It's like the devs decided to throw out every decent UI convention in the last decade and come up with the most obtuse system they could. You'll spend hours just trying to learn how to issue simple commands to your guys and learning to control the camera. The AI is just plain broken and even the devs admit it. And again, there haven't been any real content updates in the last year either. I can't stress this enough - what has been delivered is so devoid of content it's not a game. It's a prototype demo with horrible UI, horrible AI and by a developer who seems entirely incapable of finishing their product. As such, there is no way to recommend this game. Stay far, far away. I would normally say ""check back later"", but here we are two years after the promised release date and it's still virtually vaporware. At this point I've written this game off as a total loss, but hopefully by reading this you can save your money and buy something that may actually provide some entertainment and value because Castle Story won't.

								I so was ready for this game. However 50 hours of checking it out and almost one year later, I believe these devs may have bitten off more than they can chew realistically. Or maybe just they are a bit too inexperiacned to have a good project managment grasp on things.  The comparison might be to point out that early .99 cent minecraft had more to fill your time than this offers for $20. Lot's of potential here with little to show in the last year that we'll ever see that potential realized.""Has potential, probably won't be realized"" should be a canned check box review available for all early access games by now.

								It had potential.It was a game full of potential, It could have been great and fun.But unfortunately it's one of those Early Access Game leading to nowhere, it's borderline vaporware.I usually expect devs to update their game every now and then, but when I reinstalled this game one year after my last play-trough I saw zero changes, nada, nichts, queue d'zob... and thus despite the several patch notes it seems to have.So I don't recommend it because I think this game will NEVER leave it's early alpha stage...It's a waste really, could have been great.(I will gladly edit this review and give it a thumbs up if there's any significant progress in this game's development.)

								** April 2015 update**the studio has gone from a bunch of con artists to atleast putting an ""attempt"" at coding / improving the game. but grab a very comfy chair, some wine and a pile of really long books because the with comatose pace of change a glacia looks speedy compared to saurpod studiosits still going to be a long while before your building a castles. its still unplayable, its still nothing more than oversold technical demo, and while i love the proof of concept, i think the only thing going for it right now is the dim flickering light from the candle of hope. That some kind soul might put youtube tutorial on how to code a whole RTS game in unity then send it saurpod studios, and then go over and go over and acutally do it for them.**Out of all 178 purchases on steam there are only two were i honestly feel i have been coned, ripped off, and mislead and really regreate having ever parted with my hard earned funds. Castle Story and Legends of Pegasus. The game is reasonably unplayable, broken, un polishied, there seems to be no ongoing work on other than marketing. Such a waste of a brillant concpet, graphics, and creative spark.			"

								Castle Story has been in development for well over a year and in that time not a large amount of progress has been made. However with that being said I believe there is real promise with this game, all be it if it gets finished! There are some things which make it very unique and some which make it mainstream.Pros:- Unique Art Style- Interesting style of gameplay- Enjoyable for Short - Medium play times (1-3 Hours)- Survival is very promising Cons: - Quite buggy in terms of the AI (AI often gets stuck with overloaded orders and enemy can often find pathing difficult)- Variety of units is very limited (Melee Warrior/Archer/Builder:Unarmed)- Limited Gamemodes- Very basic Tutorial (Controls are very simple but was lack of proper tutorial, can be frustrating)- Limited building options (2x2 Block | 1X1 Block | Arch Block | Wooden Pillar | Wooden Plank)- Time period of development is worrying (Over a year and not a large amount of progress)- Pricing (£15/$20) Is very constly for an almost Alpha/Beta Overall the game is fun to play for a Short/Medium amount of time however given the number of issue's addressed above  I would hold off buying it untill there is improvement or unless it is discounted down to around £4-8/$12. However because of these issues I would have to rate it probably a 4/5 out of 10!			"

Content today has not changed significantly from the game showcased 2 years ago.To the developers:Have a look at doing short development sprints to fix/update content every 6 weeks or so and then stick to that schedule.You are currently working on a big bang approach, it will not work. There is a reason why software development is moving towards more modern iterative processes.Communicate with your community, if you actually produce something, it will not be a hard thing to do.The low productivity is unfortunately all to clear.

								I want to write a good review for this game, I really do. When i bought it i had hoped for a great system to build castles and defend against sieges. But that is not what I got.  The AI is messed up, and will do the bare minimum it can to help you build your supposed-to-be-amazing castles 30% of the time, at best. If you wanst to build something that they will actually make, you've got walls. And thats it. Its mechanics are good, with the mining system, and it certainly has potential. Dont get me wrong, make a half decent AI system and ill gladly re-write this review. But they havn't done that. They spend so much hard work on the visuals, that often they have to release new AI systems with little to no improvement. If this game improves in anything other than the visuals then maybe you should buy it. Until then, no. Massive waste of good money.			"

								When I bought this game I knew I'd face many bugs. That's ok, everybody seemed to have a lot of fun with it anyways. But for some people the game is completely broken, and I'm one of them.I just can't get my Bricktons (the little guys in the game) to do anything. I just updated to the last version and nothing changed.Bugs apart, the interface is really error prone. For example, they used the left click to delete empty tasks so sometimes I just want to select a task but I end up deleting it.So, bugs forcing you to do the same thing many times in order to work, with a frustrating interface, resulted in a really *annoying* experience.

								I've had this game since April of last year and still can't get it to work how it was intended to. Quick list of negatives:- The AI are unresponsive and take so much patience - and in a mode such as survival, you cannot afford the sometimes minutes it takes for some AI to 'think'.- Updates are almost nonexistant, I returned just today after a few months of not playing just to see the changes equivalent to that of a single update in a 'normal' game. - Multiplayer is barren. I have yet to find any servers, and I feel this is more a fault of the developers rather than the community with the huge negative feedback they have received. - Recently, the tutorial seems to be absent. Quick list of positives: + The GUI is really beautiful - all so clean cut and accessible, with features within are organized wonderfully.+ A great concept, I think, especially for PvP or co-op multiplayer gameplay. Altough I've never seen PvP, or any multiplayer mode for that matter, the idea sounds wonderful.+ A great selection of different building pieces, opening a wide range of possible constructs to defend your 'Bricktrons'.This game is something I think everyone that came here wanted to badly to love; I denied the numbers of negative reviews when I purchased the game, but honestly I don't believe it was a mistake. Although, that may just be my want to love it talking. If I ever see any actual involvement of the developers, I might recommend it. Just don't forget about this game.			"

I do not think the game is 100% complete by any means but it certainly has been worth the wait if your like me and like playing single player sandbox, I love the big world as it gives you a lot more choices of what you can do and how you can do it, if you can work out how the blocks work :).The A.I presently is sweet doing mostly everything that i would want them to do from digging along a plain and then going for the next layer of dirt or rock so they can gradually dig out the earth evenly, Today i tried to play for a couple of hours but my computer and the house decided that today was not my day (blackout) to play but i got my testing that i wanted, I have been testing the game on the largest world possible because it means i can stress test the game to what i think is a reasionable test. Things like flatting out an area, building on that flat area up a crooked moutain and all the while making sure the game hasn't got its niggles which are a few at this time.Just so i can point these out. There's a double effect going on with the A.I's behaviour it seems they will take a task and split it in half meaning if they get half way done they will re-aquire there path which to me isnt a bad thing. BUTTT it can pause the game very breifly and that is why i have stated the game isn't quite there just yet but its soo close its not funny.A feature the game needs is a Fast forward button to speed up work but i am not sure if that will ever be a thing in this game, The game is stable, Fun, Colorful, and long lasting at least for me if you like to play for long hours on end and watch your little bricktrons run about doing tasks you have set apon them.I am writing today on this review board because now is the time to do so, The dev's have been asking when i will do do one and i have always said that When the game is done or at least getting to a almost finnished product i will do one then, So the game is now worth your time for single player bases, And thats how this review is.So if you wish to get info for muliplayer this game has it along with caputre the flag and a couple of other modes in that, as well as single player being conquest where you get enemy's that attack you from different directions and you can try and survive by building a base and holding off the enemy.But i do not play that mode so please look to other for that information.Thank you Castle Story Dev's and I can't wait to see if you do anything else with this game.

								Three years later and this game is still garbage. Playable, with clunky UI, plenty of lag on medium or large maps. Not sure how long it will take them to get this thing where it needs to be but I've given up for another year or so. Save your money or if you feel the need to spend money on something play Stonehearth.			"

								Was another kickstarter backer. As others have said game isn't abandoned it just isn't being developed by competent devs. First released version was completely unplayable then they spend a year ""refactoring"" and its still unplayable. Now multiple years later there still isn't a game here. To top it all off I never even received the T-shirt I was supposed to get and multiple emails have gone unanswered.			"

								Love the idea of this game.. but it's a game you install every 6-8 months to see how much has changed, to see that the answer is ""Not too much.""My hopes are still high, and with luck someday we'll be playing something one might consider a release candidate.Can't recommend it right now, but I look forward to the day that I can. That said, there is certainly fun to be had, you just have to work a bit harder for it.  This is still early access after all.			"

								I bought this game months ago and I've hardly played it since. That isn't because it's a bad concept, its just the fact that thats all it is; a concept. The game has so much promise, and yet, since I've bought it has not been changed one bit. Now that would be fine if what they gave us was actually fun and worthy of the 20$ I spent for it, but that isn't the case unfortunately. Now I'm all for early access, but this game is NOT a good example of it. This is an example of a team trying to do something, releasing it early, and then virtually abandoning it when they see that they're over their heads. Im sad to say given the potential this game had, but do NOT buy this game!			"

								Castle Story:Positives: I really interesting and fun concept. Some outlets for creativity. Has great potential as a game.Negatives: It seems development is heavily stalled. Even for early access, updates are coming along slowly and the developers are extremely slow rolling out updates. Updates are pretty solid but more of the core gameplay mechanics need to be revealed to be fleshed out by the EA people. There is nothing to discuss between players on the game because the game hasnt received any significant changes in well over a year, except for their rebuilding of the game engine.I would honestly hold on this game and come back in 6 months. My Current recommendation is No. I dont see the same promise I saw when I bought this game well over a year ago.			"

Early Access Review
								TLDR: Looks can be deceiving.At the time of writing, the game is only early access.  As usual, you shouldn't expect too much - the game will be glitchy and buggy, and my opinion of the game takes that into account.Castle Story is basically another sandbox dwarf-fortress-ish game that appears to take a different approach by using much simpler game mechanics.  You don't have to worry about needs such as food and water, but rather just focus on building a functional castle that can defend against attacks.What I like- It looks cool!  It's got the puffy white clouds, the very simple-looking avatars (bricktrons), the lego-like castle building blocks, etc.,- The gameplay is very simple, it has a refined-looking design, something that appeals to me.What I don't like- Although being early-access, the game is barely playable.  I tried really hard to enjoy the game, but couldn't.  I fully expect to find bugs in a beta, but this title is mostly all looks, the gameplay itself is very bad.- There's not much to do in the game - when I say there's not much to do, I mean what you see in those screens is about it.  You can build some stone and wood blocks, and that's about it.This game shouldn't be early access - it should've stayed out of Steam until it was much more ready than this.  The vibe I got after playing is that the developers - while they might mean well - are an inexperienced group desperately reaching for what funding they can get.Here's a good discussion thread for more info.  I came back to it recently to find it locked - which seemed quite unnecessary.  This is another bad sign imo:http://steamcommunity.com/app/227860/discussions/0/648814844593898025/#p10 "

								As a game developer who has actually worked extensively with Voxels and Unity, The amount of updates that this bunch pump out are pathetic. The last one I saw was a pause funtion, the most simple of all things.The multiplayer doesn't even connect more than one person, is laggy and completely unplayable. I sit here and looka the creations in the pictures and wonder how in the hell they fabricated those structures when my 'Brickton"" gets confused by a log and doesn't move for a good 10 mins.To put it in short, I've been considering making something similar seeing as this has gone nowhere. They always defend themselves with the 'refactoring' statement, and while that's fine, if the code is THAT BAD then they had it at a level that is not marketable in the slightest, like selling a car without wheels. The other excuse is the fact that there are only a few of them, only a few highly trained devs working on it. So what? You sold the product and should have the stones to support it. I've been waiting a long time for any hint of a decent update and just have been dissapointed. Give me a year and I could probably produce more. On my own, as a hobbyist.To sum it up in two words. Utterly Dissapointing.UPDATE : This game takes the cake  "

								Not worth it at this point. I have owned the game for over a year, (since kickstarter). Not much has changed since the first ""prototype"". Sure combat has finally been added but the combat does not amount to much. Sadly it seems as if the game is being developed by a couple amatuers. I don't see the game being anywhere near a state that's worth $20 for a while. There are many features still yet to be implemented and the team has been known to miss deadlines constantly.			"

								It could be a great game if the devs had any updates the game hasn't updated in months. It doesn't have anything to do besides build with about 5 different Block types. It is also very buggy and glitchy. Annnnd if you build for more than 30 minutes your workers stop doing anything they refuse to build or do anything. And to top it off icing on the cake the DEVS BAN ANNYONE WHO SAYS ANYTHING BAD ABOUT THEIR GAME in the forms. I have come to the conclusion the DEVs are against freedom of speech a human right I am just waiting for them to remove all the bad reviews as part of their no freedome initiative.			"

								Really disappointing game. Bought this game over a year ago in early access - very basic functionality but seemed like a fun and likeable idea - problem is that there has been virtually no new development in the game in that time. Reading the other threads this is a very common theme. The game looks little like it does in the advertising videos, except for one pre-loaded map. The gaming part of the game - the survival mode - hasnt changed at all except for the ability to pause the game, in months.Theres plenty of other early access games which deserve investment way above this title. Avoid until the finished product (if it ever surfaces, which i doubt it will)			"

								The progress made on this game is INSANELY slow. For getting $702,516 on Kickstarter back in 2012, there should have been much more progress than this. I don't know how they ""quit our jobs and work on the game full-time"" and the game is still about where it was at back in the ""First Demonstration"" video on their Kickstarter page.Highly likely that they just paid off their student loans for ""game design studies"" and are using the rest of the money to not have to work, while still working on this as a hobby in their off-time or just enought to keep the game up for sale on Steam.

Building only works sometimes and building walls is nearly impossible. Invisible walls seem to stop your workers from getting passed but you are not allowed to get rid of them either. Game has great concept but besides that it is a complete lemon of a game. I would recomend not buying this untill they completely fix everything.			"

Early Access Review
								SUBJECT TO CHANGEI've owned the game since at least October of last year, there have been few updates with no estimate of an official release. And prior to my purchase the game had been in pre-release status for I don't know how long, but apparently a decent amount of time. For a game that has so little to offer in terms of complexity it would be expected that the developers would work on cleaning up the code that they have to avoid lag build up from poorly constructed AI pathing loops, intense overlapping light bloom effects, and poor enemy spawning management (massive instant spawn of 1+ incrementing enemies that increase for each wave, each with their own poorly constructed pathing AI in a big mess of how long does it take your processor to figure out which one moves first). The development team seems to focus on cleaning up minor bugs and slowing down the process by adding new members to the team before they've even come close to working out game breaking kinks. As a warning by wave 100 or sooner this game will be nearly unplayable (due to FPS) for people without an average or above average computer, even on fastest graphics settings. Avoiding torches and lighting may help with some FPS drop.Granted the game is fun. Anyone that has no issues with repetitive gameplay and likes the concept of a kind of cross between RTS and Tower Defense games will probably enjoy this. Building a castle or structure that is tactical as you decide how you want to go about surviving increasing waves is pretty rewarding for people who would enjoy that, and the game offers a sandbox mode for players who don't want the interruptions that come with survival.Overall, the gameplay is good, but it almost feels like the development team doesn't intend to actually finish the game. Like people who run off with scholarship money, this is starting to feel like a scam to half make a game with lots of kinks, slowly update little stuff, and then run off after sales start falling. Not that it is, but this has to be the laziest studio I've ever waited for. It doesn't even have a game icon.Edit: RE: Developer comment and update.I have already, and that doesn't change the length of time that has and still is going into the project. Not to mention that the game is still poorly constructed. I just finished actually playing the update, it was cut short by me not being able to pause. By that I mean I had to save my game to go to the bathroom. Tried to load it and there's a fresh new bug that kills saves. Archers still friendly fire and destroy storage areas, the AI pathing is choppy and inefficient, and it seems like corners were cut by making workers able to move through storage instead of fixing the AI itself. Now I don't know if that was the intention because frankly I enjoy the playability of the change, it does boost player efficiency because the workers don't dogpile anymore. However, for many months and obviously before I bought the game all of the entities seem to suffer from intense short term memory loss and they just stand there day dreaming in a programming loop. This is persisting even after this new update and every update before it.My comment was harsh because this legitimately is the longest I've ever waited for a developing team to work out game breaking kinks, and I am going to remain harsh because so far the most noticeable changes have been graphical goodies for the seasons, a sound update, and minor bug fixes. There is nothing to re-evaluate, I'm a programmer too. If this were my project I'd address the major issues before working on redoing the sounds and giving people some holiday textures.To not be unfair in this I will say that the changes made the game a much better experience. Being able to store more orange crystal and not have the dogpiling issue is nice. It does free up time. The change to gatherers defaulting to the storage space with the most material already in it is noticeable.Now I have asked on the forums for some information about when certain issues are going to be fixed or if they are being taken into consideration. I didn't make this or my previous comment without giving a fair chance. I have been previously active on the main forum. I noticed a moderator that has a spider for a profile picture that gives people a hard time that aren't breaking any forum rules, and repetitive game complaints and suggestions that get little to no official response.For more information read comments:			"

								It is such a ""good"" game, I have spent many hours just in the sandbox mode, the game is awesome, but it is also very buggy and limited, the AI is not very good, Also it has serial problems of path finding, so building something complex can be very frustrating, sometimes I just want to kill those damn Bricktrons. there are just two game modes so you could get bored really fast. Also, the game is SLOW, building something can take hours. I think this game has a lot of potential but now I would not recommended it.UPDATE:After almost a year since I bought the game and it is still the same, it has the same bugs and doesn't have new content. the game have been in development for more than 2 years and almost nothing has changed, please DO NOT BUY this game, it is just an scam.

								I really want to love this game because it looks really cool. But its so bad, the soliders sometimes become untargetable, they don't attack, among a lot of other things. Everytime a new wave start it either lags so hard or you get lag spikes, and some of the corruptrons don't even show up. Their should be a way to reprioties the bricktrons to build in a certain order, and maybe add ladders again its pretty stupid how you have to build stairs for everyone and everything. On a final note you should make tree or at least the grass to grow back it looks really ugly after you take all the trees down			"

								I believe I got this game roughly a month after it was released. It has plenty of potential. You had cute little bricktrons, the ability to build big fortresses and a sandbox mode so you can build freely. Fast forward to today, and now you have...some fixed bugs. It has been over a year and no new content has been added. All they have done is fixed some bugs. On another note, what has bothered me was that in survival, you have mines that produce infinite stone and crystals, but in sandbox, you have to dug up the ground to get those materials. Shouldn't it be the other way around? It is fun for a while and might be good for young kids. Wait for it to go on sale if you still want it.			"

								TLDR: Castle Story is a great Real Time Strategy Castle Defense game. I have been playing Castle Story off an on since it was released on Kickstarter. The game has come a long way since alpha. I would definitly recommend this game!Pros:+ Solid building mechanics+ Multiple Game Modes [Sandbox , Conquest, Invasion]+ Multiple enemy types+ Create your own Custom Maps+ Catapults and Explosions!Cons:- No Steam Multiplayer integration yet (use Hamachi or be on the same network)- No Steam Workshop support to share custom maps (can use CastleStory Forums)- Outdated tutorial, in need of an Advanced tutorial to explain more complex mechanics. Feature Wish List:---General---+ Steam Multiplayer and Server search+ Ability to create groups of Archers and groups of Warriors---Conquest---+ When mousing over a crystal, highlight which crystal it is in the Upper left UI.---Map Editor---+ Undo / Redo option+ Ability to asign Player Spawns to certain Team colors (for multiplayer Conquest mode)+ Option to enable automatic symmetry over the x/z axis			"

								I'll keep it short and sweet;  this game makes the DayZ standalone look flawless. I bought it a few days after it was released since I have always enjoyed games involving building and management. It was poorly optimized then too, but I looked past it at first as it was early access. Knowing what I know now I would've requested a refund for my $22 and ran.Pros:Really cool concept.Unique graphical style.Had tons of potential.Cons:The developers gave up on it, if they ever intended to finish it to begin withEvery patch has somehow managed to make the game run worse.AI is glitchy at best, inoperative at worst.Even if you're a diehard fan of the genre, I couldn't reccomend this game to you during even an 80% off sale. As it stands, it is sadly a scam.			"

								I was excited to buy this game ever since I saw the kickstarter.  Too bad my judgement was clouded by that excitement.  The worst part is this sandbox game has serious potential, but with the bugs and frustration from commands not working properly this game is an absolute flop.  Not to mention how virtually no updates have been seen since it came to early access on steam and the only activity from the devs is who is running their sounds or new indie games from ""Friends.""My first few hours of gameplay sucked.  Mining was horrible. The yellow dudes would get stuck in the mines and sometimes all of my Bricktrons would stop moving and become unresponsive to new commands.Don't buy this game, chances are this will sit on your library shelf as a mistake (I'm saying that from experience)			"

								Edit 2 years on.This game has barely changed since backing three years ago.The original concept and developer narrative was along the lines of story/quest implementation.This was changed to open sandbox and 3 years of development later there is barely any change, the same bugs exist; and the game is still broken (despite early access, of course).I would not even recommend this game as early access.  There are games I have backed that were more expensive, released after this and have been fully developed and released.The most updated feedback/development I remember seeing from Sauropod regarding this game was a Blog about how they moved office's...and were too bogged down/busy at that time to update changes they had promised.If I could get a refund on this waste of money, I would.  It is not the game that was originally pitched, which made me buy in.  It is a joke.---------------------------------------------------------2014 review below---------------------------------------------------------Waste of Money.The concept was great.  The timescale and development of broken mechanics is awful.The same bugs still exist almost a year on from the original release.  Posts from admin/devs addressing the issues give statements that the mechanics are being overhauled and refactored.This was the original message on release.  Several months later, when I checked back for any new improvements, and again it's still the message almost a year on.Save your money, nothing to see or do here.			"

								I backed this game when it first started it's kickstarter. It seemed great. I even went so far as to become a part of the forum and write a couple wiki articles and get to know a lot of people there.Was it worth it? No.I was a firm believer in the game, and I still think it has the potential to become something but it hasn't. I kept checking and checking on the game to see if it got better and if the bugs (mostly the ♥♥♥♥ing camera) were fixed. No. Nothing was fixed. No tutorial, not a thing. I wasted my money and my time for something that wasn't accomplished. I had problems with the codes I recieved and it took a very long time to fix that problem that, and honestly, I don't even know if it got fixed because the person I bought the second code for doesn't even want the game anymore.I understand as a friend of game developers that these things take time. But 1 year and pre-alpha bugs are still not fixed but they're adding in new content? Focus on what is hurting your game. Focus on your community that you promised a great game to; instead of focusing on people that kept popping in and suggesting new content. A rename to flying island simulator 2014 might suit it well until saur fixes it to the CASTLE STORY kickstarter game it was hyped to be. I should've donated that money to Root's ♥♥♥♥ing Reading Rainbow instead of having all this trouble. "

								I know the thought process that goes behind buying a game like this. It LOOKS great, and it's only early access, so you're sure it's probably going to be great at some point. You've read negative reviews, and ignored them anyway. I did the exact same thing. I wish I had not.This game is an awesome concept. It has the potentially be beautiful, fun, and worth the money that I just wasted. But right now, it's hardly even qualified to be a Beta game. It's a mess, and I'm highly discouraged by the rate at which it is being updated. This game is essentially unplayable as-is, as it becomes very boring very quickly.As a game developer myself, I know how hard it is to create a working game, and how annoying it is when the audience does not understand all the work that must be put in to the final product. In this case, though, I feel like progress is practically inching along at the slowest pace possible, and a bug-ridden, unplayable, broken game was released to say 'Don't worry, we're doing something'.I cannot recommend purchasing this game right now. My advice is to keep an eye on it, because it's an awesome idea and it has so much potential (potential which it had better reach, given the 700k that was donated to it via Kickstarter), but you'll be disappointed if you blow your Steam budget on the current stage of this game (as of 1/2/2014)			"

								Sorry, but the UI for this game is still too terrible at the current time. The developers really need to make fixing the horrible UI priority number one! Basically none of the standard UI paradigms used in this type of game are used in Castle Story, and it's impossible to figure out the UI without watching tutorial videos. I actually find Dwarf Fortress much easier to use. It seems like the devs are determined to push context menus and hidden (no UI cues) editing modes as the solution to everything. When all you have is a hammer, all probelms look like nails and all these devs have are context menus, causing them to think that everything can be solved with context menus.

								As of the latest patch, this is now a game. Using systems similar to Towns, Gnomeria, and Dwarf Fortress, you command your little yellow dudes to build castles, brick by brick, to defend against random monsters as you try to conquire floating islands. It's pretty simplistic but if you enjoy the Dwarf Fortress game type combined with base defense mechanics, this game will scratch an itch. It's still early stages but it has a lot of potential.It's rather unfortunate this game has so many negative reviews. It's in Early Access for a reason, the developers needed a lot of help to figure out in which direction the game should go to appeal to a bigger audience. As of the latest patch, the game is much better than it's ever been. I could actually understand most of the negative reviews for the earlier versions but, seriously, the game deserves a second chance. This is just another showing of how the Steam review system doesn't operate properly for Early Access games.			"

								While I get the frustration with waiting eons for a game's completion, there are clear indicators before purchasing that this game is incomplete. The game has bugs, but they're squashed relatively quickly thanks to a responsive and dedicated development team. The game could have more content, but your expectations should have been lowered when you saw this was early access. Plus the mechanics and gameplay are clean and, from watching earlier videos, have clearly been iterated on with care.I don't feel like I've been lied to by the devs about this game's state, and for an early access game I've had a tremendous amount of fun playing it. I look forward to Castle Story's completion whenever it happens, and I hope the devs aren't discouraged by the negative reviews that solely cite the game's slow dev schedule.tl;dr Manage your expectations before buying this or any game. Like a good early access game, mechanics are solid, gameplay is fun if you like RTS-type games that are more in the micro management end of the spectrum, content was lacking but is now solid and constantly improving.

They don't care about any one's opinions and there snobby stuck up guys, they have horribly gui, horribly gameplay, horrible mechanics and much much more they make it look so much fun then you buy it waste your money and never touch the play button again.Every little post they do never actually does anything really to change the game.it's almost like everyonce and a while they make one tiny change and post it as an update but lately they dont give a crap.

								I've quite rare opportunity to write negative opinion. This game is fantastic, but after 0.5 update it crashes on loading screen. I tried run it on every screen resolution, every quality level, and it doesn't gets up above 0 percent. I have Windows 7, but I've downloaded Windows 10 and installed it on virtual machine, but it still doesn't work. This is my first and last early access game. Big minus, promised to be interesting.PS. Yeah, 10 hours I've played when this game was prototype. Rest time I spend on loading screen.			"

								I've not seen a single thing improve upon this game since I first bought it.  At first, I thought the game was just not for me, and then I started looking around and realized I'd made a horrible purchase on the game itself.  The development team, as posted by other reviewers, has been on record as one of the least professional teams I've ever found.I suppose for what it is the game in this state can maybe be fun for an hour, if you're bored. It sure lasted me a whole hour before I began to get buyer's remorse, and haven't touched it since.			"

								Just to start, i liked the game it was fun to play, build things, explode barrels inside towers to see them fall, and the survial was fun. But to me it wasn't memorable to save the worlds i had, nor did i had the insentive to do so. the game is great to a point, gathering materials, building from bloack by block plank by plank was fun because it made you think about the design of the castle, or tower, or anything you were making. but that is where the fun ends.Your not able to move dirt, level dirt, nothing to help build the best structure. i found a lot of times where i am building things ans the dirt wouldn't level when i placed a stone block on it, even if it was lowered into the ground i face the same problem. i also came to major bug of the brickons frezzing up and not responding which made the game unplayable at times.Overall dont spend the money on this game till they fully release it with all the bugs fixed, save the money on something else. the game is fun, but it has a lot of bugs still in the game at the moment.

								Another early access release that will probably never get finished.  All developers claim they are ""offering"" early access as a means to get the community involved in creative aspects of the game. Or for bug testing reasons. The fact of the matter is they are more than likely in a financial bind and have no other means of finishing the game. Thus, they decide to market their unfinished piece of crap under false pretenses. And once they realise that they have milked their target audience already by selling them an unfinished game. Finishing said game would be pointless in terms of financial gain. We see it time and time again. Its probably time we stop buying into ideas. Ideas dont provide hours upon hours of entertainment.

								I didn't expect this game to be complete because it's Early Access. I didn't, however, expect anything which was being sold to be this incomplete.It's very buggy and there is no purpose to it what so ever. It's not like Minecraft or Terraria because you can't discover or craft. You can collect wood, stone, blue stuff and orange stuff. You can VERY slowly build castles and kill boring enemies which run at you at any given time. The AI is awful, it's not like the trailer. Your soldiers (archers or footmen only) will attack what is immediately infront of them, otherwise you have to specifically tell them what to attack.In short, this game is boring, buggy and I regret buying it.

								Conceptually very cool but in its current state entirely unplayable . Watch in amazement as your workers freeze doing the most rudimentary of actions like pick up a log or placing a stock pile. Also forget about mining, I have never seen a worker not get stuck coming out of a tunnel. In my first game alone I had to restart within less than a minute as all my workers were carrying logs which they refused to drop (even when commanded) in order to build a stockpile (necessary for resource collection).Much dissapoint.

								I've had this forever now, had it before it was on steam. When it first came out is was really cool, then I got sick of it for a few years, come back, and now it's much worse than it originally was. There are translation issues, and even parts where it's not even english. The graphic setting have been removed, game looks horrible, and pixelated. The screen resolution is only up to 720p, normally that is okay with laptops and small screens, but I have a large desktop monitor that supports 4k, so 720p doesn't fit propperly and looks terrible. The AI is horrid, they get stuck contantly, don't build in the proper order causing issues. Oh yeah the game is unstabler, crashes, major lag, high memory usage. It's worse then when the first previews came out 3 years ago. The forums they say ""Yeah our bad, hopefully we can fix it in the future."" Honostly if you're looking for a game similar i'd reccomend banished. This game will never be finished, and is broken.			"

								I really want this game to work, I really do!! It has been in a halt for such a long time now that the user has lost it's temper.. And I don't blame them.. Laggy gameplay after a while, really bad path finding, AI goes into halt, etc...For a long time now - really small updates have been happening in the game, so small that it has actually annoyed the user more than it has satisfied them. But the developers have finally done something right. Every friday, there is a livestream on twitch, where we see them working on the game in different aspects. Error testing the game, modeling upcoming objects and writing and correcting their code. This tells me that they haven't abandoned the game.I can see the potential in the game, when it's fully optimized and the mechanics are fully formed.There's nothing quite like Castle Story in the market. Some like building, others see exploration, and what I see, is minecraft meets age of empires.			"

								My brother bought it for me when it was on kickstarter.We were really trying to get into the game, and we envisioned the possibility of building giant structures like the pictures above suggests. Building mega as in minecraft, but doing it faster with many-a-workers.As people in the review are pointing out, the controls are not intuitive, and many small aspects like deleting an item or deleting a task, seem like a hassle. I am a miner, I need places for my stuff, but when digging out a 7x10x8 hole, the biggest part of my base will most likely be storage, which takes up more space than you can actually fortify.My Brother and I are only waiting for an update, expansion or a fix for broken promises and our broken dreams.

Shame on Sauropod studios for not making good on a promise. Keep blaming it on your 3rd party distributor.End Rant2 years later I got my tshirt, 2 years ago I might add, I am loading this game up again based on previous want for it to be good and new positive feedback. Not going to recommend until I think it lives up to it's original pricetag.edit #3 loaded up after not playing for quite some time even though devs communicate rather well and regularly.

The AI is still horrible, the game is buggy and the  Devs are more interested in Dev Blogs, going to conferences, moving and other personal things instead of actually working on the prototype game that has been on EA since day 1. I was hoping that after the refactoring patch, that took 6+ months, the promises of Content and fixes would be forthcoming. This is not the case.

								I really want to like this game. But survival mode is just to damn hard. They need to give you more options, you start off with one warrior and one archer... ok... then the timer between waves is just too short. Considering how slow the bricktons build. I'v been playing survival on the small map for awhile now & i still haven't even came close to erecting an actual castle. Other little stuff annoy me like beartraps and how you manually have to lay and fix every single one. The lack of hotkeys!!! Or how you can't pause in build mode. For example i burned all of my time trying to figure out how to landscape and had like 2mins left before next wave. Also can we get a 'King' unit, a brickton that really breaths life into the game? Idk either that or give me more options... let me set the timer at least because its just too short and the bricktons are too slow its so damn annoying.I want to recommend this game but i can't			"

								I DO like this game. But there are some issues. The biggest, glaring issue, is that castles are simply are NOT the meta in this game. The second is that, despite being a micromanagement simulator, micro in combat does not fly well, although it's absolutely necessary. The first thing I'd like to advise is, save often, and if you lose ANYONE in the hoard mode, you need to reload the save.Now, about the castles part. They simply ARE NOT the most effective defense. You are building castles against creatures that have the ability to punch through walls, and eat several arrows, essentially anti-castle creatures. You don't even have all the historical options to build the castle with anyway. You will simply lack the ability to create arrow slits, machicolations (although I suppose you can make one with the beams and beam slot block, I don't think the archers can use them), and proper gate houses with murder holes. Even if all these things were possible, the micro required to manage these things just isn't there. I've tried several occasions to build a proper keep, three bricks thick. I got to four or five bricks tall before they started completely overwhelming the defense, drilling a hole into the wall, and using that hole as cover. At a certain point, the repair and reset time eats up all your gathering time, meaning the castle will never be completed before you've lost. Now, it seems that, if you leave the castle without a door, you can minimize the damage to the castle, but then your Bricktrons are vulnerable, and at the mercy of you managing their own stupidity.If you want to get to high rounds, it seems the proper way to go about things is to create mazes, full of hurdles that will slow the Corruptrons down. You want to give the Corruptrons a seemingly easy path to your crystal, so that they aren't compelled to break any walls. It takes them extra time to climb up and jump down from blocks. Then, you want to line up your archers so that they face down a long corridor of hurdles, and have your knights hiding around a corner at the end. But getting to high rounds isn't necessarily what I bought the game for, it was more or less for building castles while doing it. Which isn't the most efficient way to accomplish getting higher rounds. That's a problem, in my opinion.Now, about it being a micromanagement simulator. Many people have had problems with the Bricktron building AI, but I've overcome it simply by realizing the sort of order they do things. You cannot create an entire castle in blueprints, and simply let them go about it. It's all about LAYERS. In order to make sure they build things in proper order, you must only place the bricks that immediately come next. So I'm okay with the building AI, more or less.But then comes the combat AI...it's frustrating. Perhaps the tools exist that are a better option than trying to click on a weak Knight and spam-clicking so that they will retreat, or clicking on a tiny point in the command bar (which doen't show which unit is injured), but I haven't found it. There are commands to make the Knights stand still, but they WON'T. Almost every time you try to force them back to the crystal for healing, they immediately want to run back and die (that is, if you tried to build a keep around your crystal like me. If there's enough distance that the AI will not detect the enemy, i.e. the end of a maze build, they won't be as stupid). When in a cluster, it's hard to select the Knight you need to fall back, and it's really annoying that sometimes they won't give you time to select other wounded Knights to fall back before they suicidally try to jump back into the fray and get themselves killed, not to meantion blocking other troops that need to fall back. As for Archers, they have trouble aiming downward.If I were to make suggestions, I would like to ask Sauropod studios to take a look at other RTS games, as well as do more research on actual castles, and make improvements based upon that. A good way to improve the AI is to give the option for a proper stance system, that doesn't reset every time you are trying to move them. Also, clicking in empty space should deselect all things, rather than having to click on the task to unselect. Remove the number keys from the task list, they aren't used and are better suited for creating groups.It is possible to soldier through these faults, but many quality-of-life changes are needed.			"

However world editing was adding in 0.7, which includes being able to move the crystal.			"

								I got the early access to this game for about 2 years ago or so, and I had my hopes up for the developers and the game itself this whole time. With seeing that the game right now updates pretty often I can tell that it is going in the right direction, although I see many bugs like bricktrones pathfind problems and them getting stuck anywhere pretty much for no reason still occur pretty often. I really wish I had a tutorial about how to build an actual castle, step by step with showing how most of the stuff works cause I found myself pretty much unable to build a simple watchtower for the archer (probably cuz i'm stupid). As of the version 0.7.5 the game looks pretty much laggy and unstable sometimes (at least for me) I got some relaxing expirience in the sandbox mode while I was calmly trying to build something what should look like a castle, but I didn't hook me up for long. Then I tried playing conquest mode which I found pretty boring cuz of corruptrones attacking me every 5 minutes while I was trying to build something, it's got annoying pretty quick so I just left, the only thing I haven't checked is the multiplayer mode (cuz no friends) which should be fun in my opinion cuz of many things you might do with your friends from PvP to ""who's the largest?"".Overall I think that at this point with the developers hardly working on the game right now this game has a very good potential in the future, but for now in my opinion this game isn't something what you want to buy right now. You should definately keep an eye out for this game cuz there's nothing like this out there, for now you can just find something else to play.I might change my opinion in the future, depends on how the game will change.

								Development is so incredibly slow. I've been watching it since the second day of the kickstarter. Frankly, I'm surprised it hasn't been abandoned yet. There is still some hope, but the game as it is right now is not worth paying for.Pros:- Easy to work with building system- Cute graphics- OK combatCons:- Unintuitive interface, especially the build screen- Poor optimization for pathfinding for anything more than 10 feet away- Tedious management: Catapults don't reload automatically, once a resource area is exhausted they just stop moving- Slow to build, especially when you have to wait for pathfinding- Very shallow combat: archers, footmen, and a catapult. no upgradesI like to compare this game to Stonehearth. The scope of the games is very different, but the core functionality is much the same. Stonehearth accomplishes building much better than Castle Story, by providing scaffolding to help build tall structures. With Castle Story you have to micro-manage pathways, so more complicated builds are incredibly tedious.			"

								I really love the Idea of this game.I bought it on very early ""early access"" and hoped for the best.There is only one problem with this game. and this problem has allways been there, was never solved and is absolutly gamebreaking.The little yellow fellas can´t build the castles you plan!The pathfinding and algorithm to choose witch block or plank to place next is broken like hell.Sooner or later they are totally stuck cause they can´t reach a spot right in front of there feet or having placed blocks right in the path to the very next buildingsite.Ok, you´ll say. This is early access. They´ll fix this.I thought that too, but now its NEARLY TWO YEARS and several updates i´m waiting for them to fix it.Sometimes a patchnote calls out ""improved pathfinding"" but belive me: just forget about it.I don´t think the devs are capable to manage this. They tried it for years and didn´t get it.			"

								Alright, so I've been following this game since before its alpha release on kickstarter and heres what I have to say. I absolutely love and have loved this game ever since I discovered it, but there have been some setbacks in its history. There was a long period where many fans were worried this game had stopped being developed and were all glad it has continued. The new gamemodes and maps as well as multiplayer are really great advances since the beginning. The only problem I have with this game is that the pathfinding and task AI of bricktrons is much less smooth than the AI of corruptrons. This makes sense because the corruptrons dont have to harvest resources or build anything. Unfortunately this stops me from getting very far in survival mode or reaching a victory in Conquest. This is a bit upsetting as these games can take up quite a bit of time... Then again, perhaps im just not very good. 8.3/10			"

								The idea is good, but it becomes vitually implayable after about an hour due to excessive lag. This could be forgiven if the archer AI at least was capable of selecting targets they could actually fire at, as opposed to trying to shoot through walls, friendlies, etc. And even if those issues are not at play, they will stand idle when the nearest enemy is standing below them at the wall, where, remarkably enough, actually dont attempt to shoot through the wall. Nor will they attempt to shoot at an enemy a little further away. They will simply stand and wait for their inevitable demise. Alas their fire cant even be micromanaged due to lag.So at this point you figure, well what the hell, lets toss in the infantry to kill em. After 4-5 lag-killed attempts to drag a selection box around them, you resort to clicking the select all button. Send them in, by clicking at the enemy. The result natually being that most of them end up atop the wall, rather than go outside and kill the enemy. So, the next time round you click outside the wall and pray to god that their AI routine kicks in before they are slaughtered. They usually stare off a good 5 seconds in the distance before this happens, and a lot can go wrong in this time. And did I mention lag?It's a shame, I really liked the concept, but there is just no way to make this game work - these sort of issues should have been filtered out a long long time ago in a 3 year development process as they really dont take long to fix. I dont think this game will end up as advertised.			"

								There are a lot of reviews that are negative but the vast majority of these address the game in its former state. This review is for the 0.6 Update. Remembering that this game is still in an Early Release state you should expect bugs, glitches, incomplete functions, and less features than a full game. All disclaimers aside I played the game for about an hour tonight and for the first time in several years I finally feel like the game has progressed somewhere. This most recent patch added new gameplay modes and fixed the most gamebreaking bugs that have been around forever (the AI and AI pathing algorithms causing Bricktrons to become stuck doing nothing and unwilling to take any further commands). During the hour of play tonight I ran across no bugs and the longest it took any Bricktron to understand my commands and obey was about 2-3 seconds. Compared to the hours in the past where they would just stand around this is a HUGE improvement. Further, none of them decided to suicide themselves off the side of the island.In it's current state I see many further updates will be needed to complete the game, yes, however it's finally at a point where I can start playing it and enjoy the game. I'm headed to bed now but I'm excited about waking up early to continue my save where I left off tonight. That's a first for me on this game.			"

								Well, it's been way over two years. I purchased this game only to find it to be utterly unplayable. The controls are some of the most complicated mish mash, convoluted by requiring all mouse buttons, the scroll wheel and 6 keys on the keyboard just to move the camera! Early access was 2 years ago. This should be on version 3.0 by now, or at least a sequel in the works. Instead, it is still the same old junk that originally came out. The creators must have bad vision, because they failed in executing. At least some early access games have a certain amount of playability.I guess they laughed all the way to the bank, and still want to collect money. Steam should pull this game from Early Access, at this point they are just allowing money to me made from incompetent developers.			"

								I used to have a negitive review on this game, I had gotten it when it first came to steam i really enjoyed it. But the developers abandoned it at the time. I frequently check back to see the updates for the game because I had high hopes for it. I know see the developers taking the game more seriosly and thought my old negetive review was no longer correct. The game itself is nice and relaxing the only problem was the AI and difficulty to do things, but through the constant new updates and the game finally getting attention from the developers I feel that they have done a pretty good job to fix that problem. I really liked to see the developers getting back to the game and not just leaving it abandoned even though there is not a large community for it, they really stepped up their game and cleaned up their mess. It used to be a game that I had regret buying and it made me sad when I saw it in my library, but now I like seeing it there, Its nice to get on the game a relax and play it when I get burnt on my other games. So when you see the games review as mostly negetive thats old news, the game has changed now and should totally be given a second shot and in my opinion is now  worthy to buy and enjoy.			"

								Very poor execution.None of the features asked for by the community have been implemented. No real progress has been made in the game.In fact, what made me write this review was trying to play a hard survival only to fail over and over again bc the friendly archers and warriors are too stupid to kill a single enemy. Literally watched my warrior and an enemy exchange places 10 times running back and forth trying to hit each other....This tells me the coding is very poorly written and the AI, which should be one of the more outstanding features, is the worst features in the game. Total deal breaker for me when im doing everything right and broken game mechanics kill my minnions.I give it a 3/10 only because the music and sounds are high quality, but everything else is attrocious. Really have tried to enjoy this game, perhaps closer to development the game will be more playable.			"

Just from the backlash that they have been getting from the community you would think that they would realise that they need to change their approach but their either too arrogant or too stupid to do so. ive tried to hold off making a negative review in hopes that they would finally produce something good but after 2 years of almost nothing i cant hold off any longer			"

								Rule out the game from the list of games that I am waiting . Why ? Yes, because it does not develop . Certainly not! In the latest update the developers have promised Fixed bugs . Moved to a new sound engine . I do not know what they went there , but boiling kettle whistle managed to remove only twisting environment sounds to zero. AI still impenetrably stupid yellow ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s on the uptake into the stand and what to do. A small example , cut down a tree, lies 3 logs. 3 briktrona sent to pick them up , run the chain , first get to the logs , it takes .... the other two hang think are sent to another log. Second briktron takes a log last zavisaet.dumaet running the latest . I am not familiar with programming , but also because it is clear that the same briktrony selected logs and instead of checking with the choice of his running mate, they are aware of this option only when they set the log is already taken . Why are they so painfully long choosing the next target , a mystery to me . And nothing , but this has been almost half a year ! For eighteen months the studio releasing full games . Someone seems to but because it's indie . EPT , yes they got 700,000 bucks! Why with this funding and a half years, it not only has evolved ( into the gameplay has not moved a single step from the time display on the kick starter , added a new barrel torch the menus , everything. ) But do not get rid of many bugs ? Ponder and a half years + 700 000 dollars. And the game is still in an early alpha stage , with bugs that nobody fixes and with the same dull yellow ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Why not hire a normal sane programmer , but he would have half a year it would be licked , why the game is not cluttered with new chips ? (Well, that is clear, add new bugs as old ones are not brought no sense ) So nah nah . Out, then we'll see , but for now nothing to talk about			"

								Holy cow this game has burned me so hard over the years. My first and last Kickstarted project, because of this steaming pile right here.It has a lot of potential, I'll give it that. It enchanted me on first glance. It kept me hopeful as the devs failed over and over to make meaningful updates, either written or coded. Not anymore.Boring, buggy, slow, aimless, shallow. That's what we've gotten from 2 years of development. Nary a vision in sight for its future, either. It's sad.Potential is all the game has, and while I'd love to be proven wrong, I'd bet my Library on it never living up to it. Even half to it. The devs just don't have the passion, vision, or experience needed.So yeah, pass. Please, for your own sake, pass. Ignore the cool screenshots and videos.EDIT: Though all of my initial points still stand for the game and studio as it is in the present, this post:http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/2445q8/when_was_the_last_time_we_actually_had_an_update/ch5hwguhas been brought to my attention. If they can deliver on the things listed here, then by all means, it will get my glowing recommendation. Until then, pass.			"

								Okay, it's a good concept, there are many a good idea behind this game. Sincerely, i like the concept.The problem is the team making this game. They've proven their incompetence more than once.It will take a very long time to finish, Updates are minimal and have stopped anyway in november, due to refactoring of the game (i.e. they blundered to start with, at least conceptually)Perhaps when it is actually finished it migth be worth buying. But that will be in half a dozen years at best.Until that point, or until they start organizing themselves, don't buy, don't support, it's a waste of time and money.Update 17/01/2015After they finaly released thet refacftoring patch, it still does not work good enough. Oh yeah there is one new big worl with a new ia. Guess what, the same problems again, with the bricktron still giving up hope for life, and still random lags, oh, and still refactoring !			"

								In the current (beta) state I'm not recommending this game at all to anyone but the hardcore players who don't mind weird (annoying, unintuitive, often useless) controls or lack of content (the latter is becoming less of an issue lately).I'd like to point out that I do know what the term ""Early access"" means. I do understand that bugs can happen, and I'd easily recommend the game should it be just buggy. But the controls I'm complaining of have been just as annoying as they are now for a year (since the prototype) so it's really hard to consider that as a ""bug"".The devs are working on bringing more and more content to the game and fixing bugs, but the work is amazingly slow (this  beta was at first promised for fall 2012, was then postponed; the prototype came out more or less a year ago by now and apart from new game modes and multiplayer it wasn't much different back then) and some things just never change.The UI and controls have been more or less revamped since the original prototype but are still just as annoying and unusable as they were in that prototype - or even worse.The most basic yet most important action (building blocks) is hard to reach in a weird menu that currently (as far as i know) you can only open by first selecting the builder group then holding the right mouse button and moving the mouse (???) to make the radial menu pop up; while taking a screenshot can be reached by just one click on a dedicated button on top of the screen.Camera movements are less annoying now (you don't have to hold a separate button just to make the camera move/zoom by the mouse) but are still weird compared to any other games I've played.I haven't tried multiplayer so far as sadly my buddies were smart enough not to buy the game yet.The sounds got better since the prototype and the graphics look really good and just as promising as it did 2 years ago on the Kickstarter page. But thanks to all the issues i've listed above currently it's just a wasted opportunity for a good game.			"

								Updated Review, 0.5Game has improved, but still lacks clarity in how it works.  Little minion dudes now listen to you much better, and attempt to follow through with commands, but they still get stuck.  Often they pile up at a resourse or just on top of each other trying to get something done, and they refuse to move around each other to get things going again.Also, they aren't very competent at building, either.  Tried to have them flatten some land, only to have them keep trying to place a block that would just dissappear.  Also tried to start placing stone blocks, but the guy would only pickup dirt and then say he couldn't use it there.It is getting updates, so it's not been abandoned... but right now there isn't any reason to buy it unless you are genuinly interested in being part of alpha development.  There is a lot of promise... once this game actually works, but for now, I advise just holding off.			"

								Two years this has been released on early access and it has yet to actullay get finished, reasonably playable or functional. It's a game with a great idea behind it. I love the thought of building a castle and defending it. The issues I have are how this has been executed and the lack of care by the dev team. I've watched this played and I've played it. It doesn't take more than an hour or two to realize that it has some big flaws that need fixing. Once of the biggest issues I've found is that archers, whom you want on towers to get the best shot angle, will randomly decide to run off your tower, killing themselves instantly. This is very frustrating as even the infrantry units will run up a ram to the top of a wall and dive off to their deaths. There are lots of other issues like the controls menu not being properly completed, it still shows the control defined names in the code. The graphics options are bad, even for a Unity game, there can be so many more choices on how to change the graphics.Ideas on how to do basically anything is non-existant. There is a tutorial yes, extremely basic, but it works. It doesn't tell you how to do other tasks like removing blocks, removing tasks or the like.Overall, this is a great idea, just very very very poorly executed. You might get an hour or two of fun out of it. If you are willing to stick with it, deal with the stupid issues that should be fixed, and make it work, then you can get a few more hours out of it.BTW, Multiplayer is non-existant, so that's a big lie there.

								I'm torn on this one. The idea is neat. It is not what I was expecting- I was thinking the units were more automatic a la Dwarf Fortress and randomly built a castle based on certain constraints and orders you set. No, instead, you literally choose to place a blueprint for each and every block of the castle. This is great too, but the issues arise when fighting the rough UI for terrain management and the like. The game has its own style and charm. However, at this point it has very, very awkward controls. Once you begin to get the hang of the system, it gets better, but there is still a lot of fighting against the UI when trying to align zones or work easily by switching bricks (everything runs through a right click/drag menu that has a slowness to it.)Also, and this isn't new for games of this nature with AI beings, you will find your Bricktrons (workers) more often than not standing around doing nothing because they can't find a path, can't find resources that are next to them, or for no apparent reason whatsoever... I just had to quit my first game because a small archer tower I was making was simply deemed impossible to build by my workers- no matter how I tried to rectify issues, they stood there doing nothing, either complaining about resoruces that were i a nearby stockpile, or unable to path to some point, even though there were stairs or other means of traversal. Not a unique problem for games of this sort, but it is in need of work as of June 2016.Now, all that said, I think the game is headed for a successful conclusion, it simply needs more TLC from the devs, who seem to be on the ball. If I could ask for one thing though, it would be a more streamlined UI with ease of use (and speed) in its place. For instance, once in ""build"" mode, you could quickly choose block types via the scroll wheel. I currently give it a yes, but with the knowledge it is not as smooth an experience as other games of its sort at this point. Looking forward to future iterations.			"

Sorry, but the game is still in a dire state, no matter how many little fixes you've pushed out or attempted to bodge in to the code.You'd expect better progress, or even a full RELEASE (?) after 3 years and $700k backing.

								After playing a few games through I was in. I love the idea of this game and I look forward to the devs fixing the game breaking bugs. The pathfinding leaves much to be desired. Your knock-off minon characters, while adorable, aren't the brightest little guys. The building UI is difficult to use and the game seems unbalanced. It takes ages to build anything defendable and I frequently found myself just staring at my screen waiting for my structure to be finished.I anxiously await the bugs to be squished and I will definitely be giving this game another shot after an update... hopefully soon.I say I recommend this game but you may want to add it to your follow list and check it out again after it's gone through an update or two.

								I'd have to agree with the people not recommending. The game only seems to update when there's a sale. Great PR scheme, but just a warning now to everyone. -Actual Review-There are numerous bugs in the game and the 'tutorial' doesn't actually help (that or the mechanics are so horrible that it is unplayable). There is so little content that it is laughable to call this even a product in the alpha stage. The game will suck you in for about five minutes until you realize there isn't much to do in this game except get frustrated about spending the money you did to have a 'game' in your list you won't touch ever again.

I hope something change in the future but after so many years it seems pointless to bother with this game anymore, a pity.			"

								This, is castle story.A game where you can build castles.You can play multiplayer with friends, or singleplayer by yourself.The game originally was broken as heck, but it was heavily patched up and fixed.For an early access game it is very good quality from what it originally was.The gameplay itself is fun, but more fun in multiplayer.You have three units, and a catapult you can build.In order to build with stone you have to designate a quarryAnd in order to build with wood you have to chop trees.Pretty easy, right?NOT SO! In both multiplayer and survival you have to defend your workers against rival players and corrupted stone monsters!Unless you don't like fighting, which you can play sandbox mode, and build in peace.Thanks for reading.TL;DRSandbox elements, with some Strategy.

								the game is great... i get this is an early early game but the game is unplayable most of the time and just anoying, not fun. they need to fix these problems.the grafics reminds me of the first age of empires made, that needs to be updated. the grass is bright green lol.the combat system is so dumb. its clunky and buggy. one of your knights sees an enermy 5 spaces away, so they run that 5 spaces to attack, mind you the enermy unit has moved from that location but your knight still runs there and attacks nothing, then has to run to the new postion and attacks nothing again if the enermy has moved again.if you build a big tower with archers on it and an enermy destroys 3 or 4 blocks on one corner of the tower, some of the blocks on top drop down and you carnt re-build the blocks that are higher then 2 high. idk it seems abit dumb.the bugs with workers are great. your worker or most of your workers get locked into a job but wont do the job there stuck in so they do nothing. so you have to get them killed to build another worker.if the game is 20 bucks and they some how finish this game, wtf is the price going to be? 50 bucks (i just threw up).

								this game is a brilliant design concept but it most certainly has NOT been adaquitely tested.  I understand its early access but more often then not the bricktrons do not receive commands at all.  The simplest interactions between bricktrons cause the entire attempt to produce the simplest of structures to fall appart.  This Game Needs Serious Basic Company Testing.  It is in my opinion worth supporting but not worth purchasing if you anticipate actually being able to play a good functional game.Please keep trying guys its got potential.			"

								I was really looking forward to this game when I saw a teaser trailer more than 2 years ago.  Unfortunately, the game development has not progressed significantly over that time.  There's really not a whole lot of content in the game and what little is here hasn't changed substantively.  It's playable but I would say based on the lack of progress and limited game material after more than 3 years of development this is a risky purchase at its current price.  There are far better crafting/building/survival games out there with better development cycles that add significant content on a monthly or weekly basis.  Send your early access backing dollars to those developers that produce.			"

								I've owned the game for awhile now, at least a year and a half. I understand it's a work in progress ""early access game"", but not much development has occured. I have seen some small new feautres added, but the game remain barely playable. Pathfinding for the characters is some of the worst I've seen, and everything works really clunky. At best, when the game is complete, it will be a time waster, and that's about it. It does show potential to be decent, and I hope they improve it.			"

								Another wave of black clay men are quickly advancing towards the southern walls of my Castle. On the wall stands a group of my yellow clay men workers, having just finished a big renovation project after the wall was almost destroyed in a previous assault. They stand no chance of holding the wall so I scroll over to my group of warriors, currently mopping up the few remaining hostiles who just tried to destroy my western walls. I order most of my warriors and archer to rush to southern walls, If I am lucky they will make it there before the attackers and I will be able to hold my castle, if not they will swam into my courtyard, kill my workers and surround my warriors. I am confident that my warriors will be able to hold my newly completed and fortified walls so instead I have a look at my recently attacked western side. There is small gap in the wall caused by the now dead attackers that I need to get repaired before any additional hostiles decide to follow up on their friends previous assault so I have my workers evacuate the soon to be attacked southern walls and send them to fix the bretch. Neither the workers or the warriors arrive. The warriors and the workers run into each others, stopping for what looks like a long and pleasant chat as they try to path around one another failing horribly as the attacker make a huge hole in my new wall. All of my yellow clay men gets surrounded slaughtered.SUMMARY:Castle Story is a game with what sounds like a great concept but has horrible execution. The two biggest issues are the pathing and UI. The pathing causes your claymen to frequently bump into each others, stopping them in their tracks as they try to find a way around their new found friend despite it being plenty of space on both sides of them. The UI requires you to navigate multiple radial menus just to build a stockpile, it is very clunky and unnecessarily complicated. I would stay away from Castle Story, it has been almost 3 years since the initial early access release and not much has happened since then.			"

								Castle Story is yet another game that will never be updated. I have owned the game for the better part of a year, perhaps more. I had waited around a year or so before finally buying it. So, in case you aren't the best mathematician I've known about this game for roughly two years. In those two years I have yet to see a major update. This game is not Early Access because it is obvious the developers have no intention of creating a finalized version of this game. Like so many other Early Access games, this one is sure to be a pimple on the♥♥♥♥♥of the videogame industry. This game is the perfect example of why Early Access shouldn't be a way of selling a game. The potential is so strong. The game, like so many others, could have been a shining success story for not only the developers, but the fans as well. Instead it seems this game was a simple cash grab.That aside, the gameplay is still okay. If you realize you are buying a final version of the game and you still want to try it, then do so. But don'[t buy expecting any form of update. "

I hope the devs get back on track again, because this game is charming and would probably be fun if it is ever finished. As it stands right now, there is only one map, and it is painfully small. A random map generator would have gone a long way to making this game better. The bugs are understandable, being that it is early access,  but the lack of progress in fixing those bugs is deplorable.			"

								-original review- (2014)This game looked awesome and I was excited for it. When I got the alpha for this game, I thought I saw something that could be great. And for a while I was ok with the small gitchs, and annoying little bugs in the game.YOU SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME. The devs will treat you like crap, and blame the community for asking too many questions, the game has been stagnant for over a year. The forums have started seeing posts deleted, and users are getting banned for giving out useful information, and asking real questions respectfully.-2015 review update- Unfortunately, this game seems to be spinning out of control. The devs have banned anyone asking clear, concise questions regarding the progress. The game was actually more playable two years ago than it is now. They spent a great deal of time refactoring the game, telling us that once this was done, we would start seeing content updates, and real progress. Then, when they claimed the refactoring was done... nothing.. Eventually they abandoned the 'roadmap' and progress lists. They do have a 'bleeding edge' which was being updated fairly frequently for a time, but that too has stopped. Now we have an unplayable game. Instead of fixing the game they had with correct AI, useable UI, Multiplayer, and map editing, they began adding a slew of new 'features', almost none of which actually work.The game was a great concept. It's simplicity was one of its greatest draws. Now it is an incoherent mess.-2016 review update-Castle Story is Becoming the game that it claimed to be at the start.The game has slowly become playable over the course of 2016 however with this development pace the features the devs promised will probably come out in 5 or 6 years I recommend waiting to see if it ever gets a full release before buying the game. This game may yet pull off the 180 and become a game worth buying. However this glimmer of hope may be fools gold because over the time this game has been ""In dev"" they've been to PAX east, they've ordered in Castle Story T-shirts and Castle Story plushies, they've got new gaming rigs, they've painted the walls of their office with a cool Castle Story mural, they've been out in the woods making noises, they've played Magicite, and just now is the game finally starting to become the game they claimed they had created. This is not the work of a professional dev team this looks a lot like a group of people way over there head and just rolling with it. Lets hope I'm wrong and that they can deliver what they promised while clinging on to the little shard of credibility they have left.TL;DRThe devs have deleted threads or posts with any negative criticism and the development pace is still ridiculous, their shady behaviours (vote manipulation, shills, bans, etc.) howerver seem to have stopped. Come back in 5 years and then buy it on sale if anything has changed.			"

Early Access Review
								Let me start by briefly describing what castle story is. The game is a voxel based, real-time strategy tower defense hybrid with a world editor and a building system that allows for a lot of creativity with a good physics engine. It brings back memories of my childhood playing with Legos (without the mess), allows for builds similar to Minecraft (using blueprints, gathered resources and workers instead of having to do everything through first person) and includes tower defense style elements in a world of floating islands in the sky. The most popular game mode is called Invasion and it tests your defenses against waves of an ever-increasing amount of enemies that can knock your archers off walls, break down your defenses and even throw enemies into your base! To defend yourself you have beefy knights, archers and catapults along with various floor traps such as bear traps and explosive barrels. You can alter the world to change the direction which the enemies take or create bottlenecks where you can do a lot of damage to them. You can team up with friends to help deal with more difficult maps in coop mode. There is also a game mode called conquest where you fight the corruptrons (AI) or other players (multiplayer) for control over different areas of the map with the objective of taking over the entire map. This game type makes defenses less static and brings offensive elements to the game and you can team up with your buddies to take on the AI where you each have your own bases and units. You will inevitably build defenses and leapfrog forward, capturing more and more terrain.Based on the recent improvements to the game, it seems the development team has grown, as can be seen in the increase to both the game quality and responsiveness in community feedback. The game’s most recent patch, 0.7, brought with it a lot of great changes and many people who played it before this patch and didn’t like it or had performance issues may want to try it again. There is now a world editor which is both powerful and quick and easy to use. Multiplayer has been implemented as well. Moreover, the performance of this game has improved greatly and your builders and warriors respond much better and quicker. While I did enjoy the game before the most recent patch, the game has improved leaps and bounds and it seems the developers have doubled down in their efforts to flesh it out and polish it. There is an active and growing community of mapmakers and active players as well, both new and old. However, that said there are a few cons to the game in its current form: the game still has its fair share of bugs, especially prevalent in the recently introduced multiplayer. Additionally, multiplayer can be tricky to set up, though they are working on implementing a better system/ dedicated server. The game isn’t for everyone as it demands patience and planning but can be extremely rewarding once you understand the basics. While the game might initially seem simple, there is a surprising depth to it once you get to know the mechanics and since the game is still in development, your ideas and concepts might be implemented into future patches. Looking back at how much I have played and enjoyed this game, I think it’s worth the full price, though I did buy it when it was on sale. If you are dedicated to the concept or want to support an indie developer that has doubled down its efforts, I suggest you pick it up or at least put it on your wish list and wait for it to be on sale.The verdict:If you: enjoy voxel based games that allow you to build whatever and however you want with a world editor and physics-based construction, like tower defense games that test your patience and strategic thinking in which you can immerse yourself and relax, like real-time strategy, resource management and building bases brick by brick, then this game is for you.

Thats right, after all that time not one thing including all the same bugs there were before. This company either doesn't know what they're doing or they do and then they're just taking our money and running.Hold off from buying this game. It has too many bugs and is far from ready. 3/10			"

								Sadly I can't recommend this game - I'm cool with early access but not when the game doesn't get updated in literally MONTHS... The user interface simply could not be more awkward, you'd have to work *really* hard to make such an incovienient non-intuitive interface.  There are a number of simple issues that could fixed and would be a great reason to make WEEKLY updates... I honestly feel like they authors have taken my money and are laughing - maybe they might make an update.... maybe..... very disapointed - and it spoils it for all the other honest early access games...

								I don't recommend this game, because I bought it half a year ago and I don't see any improvement in the game.The workers don't move for no reason at some point at the game (sometimes it's from the beginning of the game, sometimes after half an hour). They stop building tunnels unless you delete the task and set it new again or when they dig a mine, they remove the way up or they don't know how to use it while it's directly next to them. For me it is unplayable and I don't feel in the mood to play it again. I know that it is an alpha, but as I said I didn't see any improvement in the game yet.Maybe I play it again, when it is in beta stage.All in all I like the setting of the little yellow buddies and the idea to controll them to build and defend your castle.I still have my expections in the game and hope that it will get better...

								I finally had the time to try out all these new updates and the developers are finally going into the right direction with the game. However, for a game that’s been in years of early access, there is a lot of problems that still don’t allow you to actually play. There appears to be some sort of memory leak because overtime the game begins to lag, heavily. There is also a bug where dead idle workers have their icons remain within the UI, which can completely cover one side of your screen. Trees also don’t regrow, which limits you quite a bit overtime. So basically you can’t play for long with the current build, therefore I can’t recommend the game.I will change my review and recommendation when those important things get fixed. Also some other minor problems with the game is that some of the controls and features are awkward, such as landscaping. It seems to function the way I don’t want it to, even though I finally realized how it worked. If you move it, it seems to mess up. I also played conquest mode and I believe waves came too soon, we need some time to build, annoying fighting and building at the same time. Hope I can get back to this game soon, very promising once it’s actually working.			"

								This is not a game. There is some code here, but it is not nearly coherent enough to be 'played'. Everything is broken, and it is a crime that the devs are asking so much money for nothing. Do not buy. This pile of code single handedly made me hate the concept of early-access before it was common-place practice, so I guess I can maybe thank it for protecting me from other such purchases, but really, don't get suckered into this one because it's on Summer Sale. tldr; This might be a really good game one day if they ever finish it, but it is irresponsible to put it on Summer Sale as it is now.

Early Access Review
								First of all, the game's really early release, so I didn't expect much. But I got even less that that, in my opinion. While there is a ton of potential, and I'm really looking forward to what the game COULD be, right now it's sorely lacking in quite a few areas.The first, and by far the biggest and worst, area is the controls. Less than half of the controls actually feel streamlined and as if they should work. All the rest are clunky, hard to remember, and completely out of left field. I mean, hold space and drag your middle mous click to move your camera? What? And the controls can't be changed individually according to task. You can just change what keystrokes/clicks the game recognizes. So, for example, you can't change the ""turn blueprint"" key, oh no. You have to change right click entirely, which messes with about 6 other keybinds at the same time. So, yeah, the ENTIRE control scheme needs reworked to something a human would use, not an alien.Next are your citizens, or ""bricktons"". Now, I know, there are probably a few bugs still, but it's really sad how bad it is right now. It takes around 5 seconds for them to realize you gave them an order, their pathing is atrocious because as soon as they find a path that works, they don't change it again, even if you make a shorter one, unless you force them to. They block each others' movement, forcing you to babysit them just in case they trap each other in somewhere doing the whole ""East Going Zax, West Going Zax"" routine. And sometimes they just refuse to listen at all when you tell them to do things, instead opting to stand about 3 times away from the job and staring. So they need to be able to occupy the same space, and the AI needs reworked big time.Then there's the digging. I hate the way the quarry works, because you can't make a custom size, only a custom depth, which leaves the land looking terrible with deep♥♥♥♥♥holes pock-marking your areas instead of one nice, large hole that encompasses all you needed to mine. TUNNELING IS THE WORST AND MOST TEDIOUS THING I HAVE EVER DONE IN A GAME, I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW IT GOT SO BAD. You literally have to tunnel horizontally ONE BLOCK at a time, going back to reassign the job every time they finish it, having to reassign the workers, too, because you can't have multiple tunnel jobs on one order. So, basically, make the whole digging scene more customizable, and have it not be the single most tedious task you will ever do. Also, randomized maps wouldn't hurt. I don't like playing with the same map over and over.And as for the building? Other than the keybind madness that the alien that designed this game came up with, it's good. I enjoy the customizability and the different options and stuff that are in the game. That being said, though, it could do with some fine tuning, such as some keybinds to move your blueprint one space at a time, that way the horrific mouse detection isn't so infuriating.Lastly, there's the UI. It's sweet, simple, to the point. A little boring, but good. One thing I would definitely change, though, is make it so you can toggle the task bar to stay open by just clicking the little star. Just one of those picky little things.Now, for the moment of truth. Despite the scores of flaws I see so far, the game has a ton of potential. It just needs some tender loving care from the devs and the community to bring it up from the depths of hell. So do I recommend this game. No. Not at all. At least, not YET. Because I don't want anyone's vision of this game tainted by the current build. But eventually, when it gets worked on some more? By all means, yes. Buy it. I did have some fun with it, after all.

Early Access Review
								EDIT: After A bit of further testing almost 9 months after I last touched the game, it looks like things have gotten even worse. Granted, some new maps and features have been added, like Iron, but now your brisktrons will randomly path themselves off the map, committing suicide in the name of hauling lumber. I've also encounterd an issue where the game freezes for seceral seconds, and then all of your bricktrons are all stuck falling, unable to move or do anything else, leabing you no ther option than to quit and star over, or reload from a save file. :END EDITI purchased this game on EA about 6 months ago after seeing several videos of gameplay. It looked promising. I was excited for a more realistic base builder so to speak. I didnt expect the game to be too fleshed out yet, since that's what early access is. Having played several hours, and feeling like the game had great potential, I put the game down to come back after the devs had ahd a few months to work on it.Queue last week. I booted up the game, started a new game, and began building the exact same castle on the exact same map I had before. As the first wave of baddies approached, I noticed that they ran around willy-nilly, and just seemed to punch at anything. not particularly impressed, I continued.About 10 minutes later, it became evident that some work had been done to the AI engine since last I played. Except it seems that the work had been to delete half the brains of all the entities in the game. The workers would regularly all attempt to place the same block, take the same narrow path when there were a multitude of options, and regularly block each other in to the point where 5 of them were all stuck in one spot, all trying to get past each other, but to no avail. I even noticed the knights swinging their swords the WRONG WAY when in combat. I real flop if you ask me.All in all, the game looks promising, but it appears that the dev studio is working by the old creedence ""One step forward, two steps back""			"

								""Early Access"" is an understatement. This game has a wonderful and engaging idea, but do not give these developers anymore money until they actually deliver a playable product. The early access says: ""Please be sure to read THIS DISCLAIMER before you buy the game, it will give you an insight on what is or isn't actually working!"" I'll give you a hint: what is working? Nothing. What isn't actually working? Everything you see in the trailer.			"

								This isnt a bad game. Its just not all what you could hope for. Multiplayer is so broken at this point its a miracle anyone has been able to use it and while many people complain about it so far they have done one small fix that to me made no difference at all.Instead they seem to devote most their time adding christmas and halloween season art. Patches are few and far between you would swear they have taken money and done a runner.Sandbox mode is more or less pointless with no enemies, and last time I played challenge mode and created a catapult it crashed the game because it was glitchy.Games like this that get left at 80% done are one reason I have become very skeptical about buying Alpha's. I want to support developers to make games not make an early retirement.			"

								I have waited for this game for so long. I love the idea, and the characters are absolutely adorable. Although, I had no idea it was still in ""early access."" I haven't played too much of it yet, but I have already encountered the problem of Bricktrons just standing around even though you have assigned them a job. I didn't even try to save yet. Also, when recalling your workers, they shouldn't just decide ""oh the danger is gone"" on their own, because they are always wrong. They walk right outside while the Corruptrons are still there and let them inside to kill everyone. I shouldn't have to repeatedly recall my workers while the soldiers are fighting outside. I still reccommend that you keep an eye on this game, just don't buy it yet, unless you think the price will sky rocket later. If these bugs are fixed, it will be one of the most fantastic village survival games out there.			"

								Feelings of disillusioned loomed 6 months ago, but with a recent update proudly touting the return of the pause function and that objects that fall into the abyss are now removed from the world instead of indefinitely floating in space, it became clear this game would never deliver.  Did the people that wrote the seed leave/die, or is Sauropod simply out of their depth in taking on this sizable AI feat?  There's been no appreciable improvement in minion behavior-- which is crucial to this game -- for a year.  Even things that seem like obvious bug squashes loom.  They still kick the logs they just harvested off the edge of the world.  They still go idle randomly.  They still build themselves into a corner.   "

								8/8/2016I decided to try Castle Story again today. I installed it and it straight up just dosen't load. A small box pops up with options about how to start the game. It's set to standard (only option) graphics.When I hit play... the screen turns purple and music starts playing.Sigh, why do I keep trying this game?DO NOT BUY.---12/28/2014I tried the new update and noticed quite a few improvements. I wouldn't say it's worth buying yet though.Update Pros:- Things feel a little bit more smooth.  The AI didn't seem as bad as when I previously played.- The explainations and ingame notfications are getting better.- Seems to be less lag with some speed improvements overall.Cons:- Islands are still too small.- AI needs work still.  Seems to be 1 out of 5 times you interact with a Brickton they will stop responding entirely. This leads to a bit of an issue considering some of your Bricktons are archers/warriors. I've lost my base a few times due to this bug.- Saving is hit or miss.  Sometimes saved games work perfectly... most times Bricktons go missing or it crashes on load.- Clicking on workers has become challenging. It isn't as nice to right click and drag to select multiple workers now.All statements in previous review still apply.----6/28/2014I've had this game for quite a few months now and I'm still excited about what it could become.With that said...  the game isn't close to being finished and there are quite a few baffling design decisions that have been made.- Why islands? The small terrain causes incredible frustration while trying to do the most basic things. The islands themselves aren't necessarily the problem but it's how the game can't handle them. The AI is incredibly buggy and stops responding or gets confused on the narrow strips of land. Also, the majority of trees harvested end up flying off the map.- Additional ContentWhy continue to add other content (multi-player?!? etc) on top of a not-solid base game?Please don't continue to build ontop of a game that needs some serious overhauls in level design, AI design, general gameplay, and in-game priorities.With all that being said, I hope they turn it around and figure it out. Every once and awhile I'll play it for an hour or so.			"

Don't waste your time or money on this junk.EDIT:With the new 0.6 patch the path finding is supposed to be ""fixed and much better than before""Tell that to your bricktrons.

Yes, it is true that this game has been in Early Access for quite a long time but trust me, the devs are now more active than Valve. Please keep in mind that Early Access means we are testing the game and need to tell the developers our thoughts about it. If you just say that this game is bad and has many bugs, they can´t improve for you. This game is really worth buying. Oh and if you have the problem of the game starting to lag after playing for a while, thats probably because of the many stockpiles you have built. => Dont build many stockpiles and it should run perfectly.

								There are so many loose ends in this game it is amazing.. It should be take of steam considering it is still on alpha and is 3 years old!! As another person wrote - it is like burning your money!The handling of camera is crewed. ESC doesn't mean cancel the task you are doing.There are no way to cancel one piece placed wrong, you have to cancel the who buildThe workers sometimes just stand still..This is from 15 minutes playing!

								Very very very slow development in the time since its Kickstarter. So many bugs, and they keep adding up every update. Updates are supposed to fix things, not make them worst. I bought this around August 2012, not even joking when I say the two biggest things added since then where a new UI and a very silly game mode. They have their money, and are just doing small stuff to try to make it look like they are actually doing something. Before you buy this crap really do your research. And on top of that their forum moderators are very biased and try to ""silence"" people whenever they can, especially the one called Box. So before you even think of buying this google the kickstarter page and see how much progress they have done in all of this time, then go to their youtube channel and watch that one epic trailer they made and compare that to actual gameplay now, its not nearly as epic. There are better games out there you can spend your money on, dont waste your time on this travesty. And for you ""this is early access"" people, this was out way before Steams early access. Them adding it to Steam was just a shameless money grab to try to get more money, which Im still curious where it has gone to. I cant see the results game wise.			"

Buy only if you really believe that the developers vision of the outcome of the game matches your own and you you don't mind waiting for it to be worked out by there relatively small team. "

								I really want to like this game, but the most important thing standing in my way is the interface.I don't fancy playing in creative, so my view is from the survival aspect. In survival you have to quickly start building a castle and defend it against wave after wave of ever-increasing numbers of attackers. The key word here is quickly.There is no pause, so you cannot stop and plan your castle out and then set your people to work, so you are instantly stressed. This could be fine if the interface otherwise supported speedy planning and building, but it does not.The game seems very much built for consoles (or at least using a controller) because it just about only uses the mouse totally disregarding the keyboard for anything but camera navigation. In a game with so many things to build, getting even the simplest things made is a pain.In order to build anything you have to first click the right mouse button and hold it for about 1 second. Then choose build mode. Then right click and hold for about a second again to get a radial menu where you then select the category of things you want to build and then you can finally select the specific item you want. So even building the simplest little storage box quickly takes 3-4 seconds. If you then want to switch items you want to build, you have to again hold the mouse and go through the waiting once more. In a game where you have 10 minutes before the first wave of attackers and ever less time before the next attacks spending 3-4 seconds per item you want to place into the world will make you frustrated beyond compare.Again, I love the style and the idea, but the interface just kills it.It seems like the designers like a sleek no on-screen menu interface so much they are willing to sacrifice a lot to get it. I urge them to reconsider seeing as any amount of waiting for menus in a no-pause survival game is infuriating and stressfull and is bad game design. Please, dear designers, consider adding a toolbar at the bottom and more use of the keyboard so the all the waiting for menus goes away, or at least add a pause function. A pause function would not remove the irritating wait time, but it would remove the infuriating stressfulness.			"

								A nice concept. Not really a game in there at least yet. What is disgusting is the implementation. They collected quite some money on kickstarter. Either they are incompetent or bordering criminal - but development speed is crawling. The recent .50 update for example is still not usable. This is years after original planned development. Now release date is early 2016.... amazing. With the current speed demonstrated in the last 2 years I would rather think it is 2026 or later.Hope is there - also that they find a game in the concept, because right now there is no real game in it. But past performance is an indicator of future performance, so it will not release in any really usable way in 2016.It is a fun little sandbox with some enemies coming in game mode. It sadly is unstable and has a horrific performance.			"

We need some kinda fast scafolding or ladders maybe to help this along. Logs also seem to have lost the ability to be placed sideways so you can make nice looking cabins or bridges.

								I'm torn no this, honestly. I love the game, and the gameplay, and basically all its elements. BUT in the two years I've owned it (and eagerly awaited progress mind you), nothing has been achieved or established. A part of me wants to encourage this type-of-game but not this development method, but unfortunately those are mixed due to steam early access. So in short; if its on sale for less than 10$ hop on it, if its more than that ask yourself if you want to encourage this kind of almost transparent money grabs taking good ideas and basically ruining them.

								I highly advise against buying this game. The developers don't ever update the game and they never fix the glitches and bugs (which are plentiful). The A.I. is horrible and the characters are almost always running into each other and just randomly standing in the way for like 7 seconds at a time. There is also a serious lack of content. There is just one mode, where you have to hold out against the enemy A.I. and hope that your own broken characters who don't know how to walk don't get run down because they can't climb stairs. I am pretty sure that the people who made this game took the money and ran. Don't buy this game unless you want to regret spending $20.EDIT: December 30, 2016OK, so I have come back and looked at the game 2 years later, and I have a few more comments to make on this game. The dev team has finally added some more game modes, so we know that they haven't completely abandoned ship. The problem with this is that they are fixing the things that didn't necessarily need to be fixed. There is still a serious lack of content in  other areas. In this game, when the players wanted updates they wanted more real content, such as more characters to use, not more gamemodes that give us different ways to play a broken and unenjoyable game. Some people will say, ""It's in early access, quit whining, it's supposed to be bad, blah blah blah."" The thing is though, that this game has been in early access since 2012, when I bought it. In 4 years, the only thing that they have accomplished is adding multiplayer, so your friends can join in on the unpleasant experience. They also added a new enemy, but that doesn't matter if the game is unplayable. The game doesn't even have more than one graphics setting, which is ""standard"" (it isn't even that good of a graphics setting). For now my review still stands, and I for sure do not recommend buying this game.			"

								I honestly think that this is the worst game I have ever played. Just listing the flaws would take several pages. But here are some:- Worst interface ever. The interface is SO bad that it kinda remind of old Dos games. It is like the designers have never played a game in their life. For example, it takes 6 clicks to load a game.- Nonexistent AI. Workers will cross your city to pick up a material, while there was the same material right where he was.- Workers freeze regularly. It often takes up to 12 seconds for a worker to start executing an order.- I think it's the first time I turn my speakers off in a game. Not only is the music and FX bad, but the Options don't work (as most of the things in the game) so even set at 0% the music still plays.- Graphics are bad.- TONS of bugs.However, the worst thing is that the game has absolutely nothing good or slightly original to it. It's basically Warcraft I horribly executed by a talentless team. "

								This is going to be used as a textbook example of why you should never buy an early access game.  These guys sold a lot of copies of an exercise turned tech demo.  If I were in their boots, I'd be done.  Why make a game when you cut your losses and run... and by losses, I mean a whole lot of cash up front with absolutely zero accountability to finish the game.Yes, early access means it's not done... and that's the problem with early access; It never has to be done to be sold. NEVER!I wish I was back in school where I would make little ""game"" concepts.  A few exercised examples and you pass.  Never had to worry about making it a full functioning game... that would have taken the entire semester if not longer to finish. ...but if I polished it just enough to put on kickstarter... cha-ching!  A few days or months of work for a pay out equivalent to the entire gaming dev life-cycle.  From a purely financial point of view, the payout from work is done.			"

								I've got to say that at this point, I'm unhappy with my purchase. I've owned the game for several months and I'm all for supporting new concepts and funding new developers but the lack of communication, failure to offer deadlines and extreme delays for updates is just too much. Sure, problems come up but this is unprofessional and Steam should be more wary of ""Early Release"" titles. I wish the Devs the best, hopefully they have a finished product some day and years from now if I have the urge to check up on this game I may be pleasantly suprised. Until then its just a name to forget.			"

								If you like to watch Grass Grow and Bones Decay, this game is for you.  This group uses all the Playbook excuses you can have for not actually having any New Content in two years. The Dog ate the coders work notes....Please don't fall into their trap. I was a Kickstart supporter 2 years ago before it made it here.  The game idea is neat but there are far more better developed games being churned out elsewhere Monthly.  Stay away from this game until at least the Year 2020.I love the Defensive Responses to pretty simple Questions. You'd think these guys were developing something for the Government.  This game needs to be put in the hands of REAL developers period. Maybe they can make some sissy iOS games for crappy Mobile devices but as far as I see this is a joke. Utter waste of Money and Time. The KS requested only 85k yet they get a huge 700k and this is where we are.  Steam needs to pull this Off the list now!So Now they resolve issues on things they don't want to see or answer with Deleting the Post. I was within the guidelines and 3 times over the last month my post has been deleted. It's clear these guys are tired of bad press but until everyone knows about it you should NOT pay for this crap plain and simple. I can not believe the utter unprofessional attitude these guys have. They have NO business sense at all.7-9-2016  So after leaving this game for Dead 2 years ago I figured after an Update notice on game I would load it up... WOW. ABOUT F'ing time. This is where the game should have been 2 years ago.  I might actually give it a chance now but I see there is some optimization issues. I also ran into a few bugs in Conquest mode.  So just more of the same from them.			"

Early Access Review
								I thought this game was going to be great.. i really did. but there are way too many bugs for me to enjoy it. i know it is in beta so there should be bugs but there are too many game-breaking bugs. i only get to actually play the game about 25% of the time. When i click play, 75% of the time nothing shows up yet it says im playing it. this has happens way too often.Also, it crashes. It crashes a lot. So i need to save my game every five minutes so i dont lose progress when it crashes. But, after about four crashes in one setting, it gets better, but i still save a lot to be safe.Lastly, the A.I is almost completely broken. At first they work well for about four waves besides when half of the bricktrons stand in place when i call them back to the castle when the corrupted are coming. After about wave four, the builders dont build, and when i click on them to move somewhere they stand still. Even the corrupted are buggy. half of the time, they go straight past the castle and stand on the edge of the island and i need to send my warriors after them to get the loud, but good, music to stop. And half the time the warriors just stand in place as thcorrupted raid my castle and kill all of my bricktrons.Ok, that was a lot of hate. I do like this game when it works, but dont think you should buy it for the $20.00 price until its fixed. This game can be good, but needs a lot more work and i think you should wait until its out of beta or at least a bit more fixed.			"

That is a very sick joke played by a development team that gets payed to drag their feet around for a year. It's played on us, the paying costumers.I urge people to stay well away from this game until it is actually released, as a full game in its final release.I am certainly going to try and demand my money back.

								I, like many, originally backed this game on Kickstarter. The very nature of kickstarter is like most other investments, where the backers are absorbing all the risk on a promise of some sort of return, be it financial or in this case, a game. Of the various things I've backed on Kickstarter, this is the only one I truly regret.Why?Anything that I say has already been said in other reviews. The progress in development has been incredibly, painfully slow. Games that were pitched/came out after Castle Story have rapidly over taken it in every way. Commonly cited examples are Space Engineers and Prison Architect.Even if you could objectively state that development progress isn't slow, consumer psychology is a powerful thing. Why are goods sold for £0.99 instead of £1.00? We perceive it to be far cheaper, when the reality isn't such. If people believe development progress to be slow, then it's slow unless you definitively prove otherwise.So if I agree with the other reviews, why am I coming out of the woodwork?It's the antagonistic nature with which this studio engages with the player base. There will always be people who are unhappy, it's the very nature of exchanging money for goods/services. However, beneath all the anger and poorly chosen words are legitimate concerns and questions that go unanswered, or worse still, answered with equal levels of vitriol and abrasion. Think of the silent observers, like I used to be, quietly asking the same questions? Some of the exchanges between the community and the developers of this game are legitimately scary. Reading the castle story subreddit was an eye opener.In conclusion, it wasn't a mistake to back this game originally. With the information I had and the strength of their pitch, I was happy to invest and I would do it again. However with all the information available to all of us today, my opinion is that investing would be a mistake. All I can hope is that it would stop them treating the people that invested in their ideas, which by extension means investing in them as people and their future, with such contempt.			"

								This game suffers just like all the other Early release games.  Basically they have a great idea, but they never get past the 90% point.  In professional development this really can't go on.  If beta was suppose to be 1.5 years ago, then it is absurd that we're not at that point.  If any publisher was funding it, it would've been over a long time ago. This is not specific to this game, but I feel I must point it out here, that every month they're doing minor patches instead of large improvements and working toward finishing the game.  I must applaud indie developers on their efforts, but if you're Kickstarted, you have obligations to meet and a game to deliver.As far as playing the game itself, the controls and tutorials were mind-bogglingly poor, and that is the main reason I quit playing.  I still like the idea, but I cannot honestly recommend the game in its current state.			"

								Really this game needs ALOT of work it is almost impossiable to figure out the game's controls. Most of the time your ""Workers"" or Bricktrons won't even do the most basic of tasks. You will find it that the only thing you can tell your bricktrons is to walk around, they won't do anything else. Maybe when a ""Big"" update comes out, hopefully soon, it can fix most of the hundreds of issues that the game currently has. In the suvival mode, the enemy will spawn right inside your castle or base and kill all of your workers and leave you with nothing but the non fighting knights. The knight class Bricktrons will  let the enemy pass if you do not control them on your own.			"

								***EDIT 03-15-2016***""Just forget about this game for the next two or three years"", I said... two years ago.  Castle Story is now far more functionnal. Your bricktrons have made tremendous progress in their pathfinding - they now DO manage to go where you ask them. They might still be a bit... slow to accomplish what you order them to do, but eventually, they will succeed - if what you asked them is possible, of course, and you might need a few try & retry to understand their particular logic. But still, as a sandbox game, it manages to realize a good part of what it was supposed to realize - wich is good.  ""So why is your review still negative?"", might you ask. Well, the answer is quite simple: right now, the game still isn't fun.  First of all, the bricktrons are slow, and building anything takes a HUGE amount of time. The IA isn't exactly helping about that, and it is a shame that the devs still haven't thought about the first button you would think of in this game - a button to fast forward, that is.  Second, there are little options in the matter of building. A few stone bricks, a few woodlogs (very complicated to use, by the way), you should be building very little variations of the same model of towers and walls pretty quickly. After two or three hours, the game is already awfully repetitive.  That's were the ""invasion"" mode might get fun: testing the resistance of your citadel by repelling infinite waves of ennemies. Well, problem is: too few ennemies variations, too few units, and most of all, the IA is a mess and cannot hope to compete with any RTS' AI. Your archers might actually be more dangerous for you own troops, and the knights never do anything right; and of course, you have no real control about the attitude they should use. So, for now, the strategy is rather plain: build a tall tower, put all your achers on top of it, rince, repeat. And pray that the ennemies don't get at the base of the tower, for your bricktrons are too dumb to lean and shoot downward. And, to make matter worse, repairing any damaged structure is a real pain in the back, as your bricktron can't seem to fix anything beyond their reach, their reach being something around two yards high. Of course, that's precisely the height where the ennemies like to dig (sigh).  So it appears that I still was awfully optimistic when I told people to wait for two or three years: right now, I do believe that Castle Story will finally be a fun and fully working game around the year 2020.*** *** *** ***ORIGINAL REVIEW:This looks like a hit. This smells like a hit. Too bad, for months now it's been nothing but a buggy, twice-in-a-year-updated wreck of a game. Your builders are stupid, they can't do anything right. Nothing of what you see in the trailers is actually doable right now. So, my two cents: just forget about this game for the next two or three years, maybe it' ll become something that you might actually call ""a game"". Right now it's an expensive prank.			"

								I've held back on playing this game for atleast a good year or two, but decided I'd pull it out today to see what kind of progress it had made. Sadly, I was very disapointed.There seems to have been hardly any progress on important mechanics - such as removing things you've built - are still missing, make the game almost unplayable. The camera controls feels clunky, and there're issues with sound being cut off.The game is, despite being on the unity engine, running very smooth, and if you're able to get past the bugs and the controls it can be quite enjoyable. But as of now I wouldn't recommend dropping almost 20€ on it, in it's current state.			"

								This game suffers just like all the other Early release games.  Basically they have a great idea, but they never get past the 90% point.  In professional development this really can't go on.  If beta was suppose to be 1.5 years ago, then it is absurd that we're not at that point.  If any publisher was funding it, it would've been over a long time ago. This is not specific to this game, but I feel I must point it out here, that every month they're doing minor patches instead of large improvements and working toward finishing the game.  I must applaud indie developers on their efforts, but if you're Kickstarted, you have obligations to meet and a game to deliver.As far as playing the game itself, the controls and tutorials were mind-bogglingly poor, and that is the main reason I quit playing.  I still like the idea, but I cannot honestly recommend the game in its current state.			"

								Don't buy it!I don't know what kind of people can recommend this game. It's a great idea and you can have fun at the beginning, but after few hours of gameplay the bugs really start to annoy you.Not to mention that there was absolutelly no updates that would bring new content, except some pumpkin heads that would make a false impression for new customers that the game is in active development. The truth is, the game is in the same state as it was upon it's initial release, maybe a few bug fixes, and also bug appearances.I'll say it again, don't buy it.You've been warned!			"

tl;dr: This game is still in Alpha stage, with lots of gamebreaking bugs, it has appeared very clear the devs aren't competent enough to finish it.  It has yet to be demonstrated that they are actually still working on it. I highly recommend against buying it.Sauropod studio has made close to no progress on their sole project in the last 2 years, despite having received an ample amount of money through crowdfunding (kickstarter then Steam early access).They are not struggling to live and work on the game at the same, they simply are incompetent. Moreover, their general attitude toward criticism is childish at best, they do not hesitate to censor any comment if they can.Add.: the developpers only recently (after 2 years of ""work"") learned what OOP (object-oriented programming) is. ""Refactoring"" was then needed to update their code in our century.			"

								I've been watching this game since the first video of development they started. The game looked so ambitous and creative and it definetly is. I really wish I could give this game a good review but i just cant. When ijumped into the game it was amazing giving your bricktrons objectives to build, mine and dig to make the best defense for your bricktrons main crystal. Once you've gather bricktrons to speed up your build it all just collapses into this pile of glitches and bugs. You want them to do a job? Good luck even controling them as they just sit there and give you a blank stare. The work they need to do on the AI needs to be alot better and just to make things worst random lag spikes start to pop up. They get suck, they cant figure out what to do, the blank stares?! The team has alot of work to fdo to make this game succesfull because like I said before this game has a lot of potential but really what a let down.			"

								Really this game needs ALOT of work it is almost impossiable to figure out the game's controls. Most of the time your ""Workers"" or Bricktrons won't even do the most basic of tasks. You will find it that the only thing you can tell your bricktrons is to walk around, they won't do anything else. Maybe when a ""Big"" update comes out, hopefully soon, it can fix most of the hundreds of issues that the game currently has. In the suvival mode, the enemy will spawn right inside your castle or base and kill all of your workers and leave you with nothing but the non fighting knights. The knight class Bricktrons will  let the enemy pass if you do not control them on your own.			"

								This game is ok but as of right now it will be a very choppy experience. I don't mean the actual game is choppy or anything it runs quite nice but you will not have a whole lot of fun. First thing I would like to state. The A.I is horrible. Some times to the point where progress is impossible. your archers wont shoot, your knights will just run away, and your workers will just stand there daydreaming not listening to anything you tell them to do, and especially since the game is based around building and defending from waves of enemies, it may seem like a good idea and it does have lots of potential it is not worth full price as of right now, get it on sale maybe but you won’t be installed it until its fixed, because at the time of writing this review the game is barely playable with a multiplayer aspect that doesn’t even work. Good concept and graphics and I can see the potential in the future. It will not be worth it until it is released.			"

								Having sunk hours upon hours into this game I can safely say, this is an incredible game in its own right.Whilst updates are rather infrequent with new content being added every 2 months or so, the game itself is endless fun. It does take a while to wrap your head around a few of the building mechanics but after doing so it is ridiculously satisfying, allowing you to build gigantic castles and towers from which your units can attack.The multiplayer is also a lot of fun with a rather bizarre take on a strategy game, rather than building a town to support your units development, you are literally building a castle and a few small outposts to defend shards that you must capture to give yourself an edge in PvP.The one downside I would say this game has is that it is a bit slow to start, however this is remedied by the fact you can summon waves when you are ready for them, meaning you can summon the first 20 or so waves within 20 clicks. This is virtually suicide but if you feel like doing this, go for it.I would highly recommend this game.			"

So far it seems they haven't tauight themselves to program in any meaningful way, and all the programmers they hire seem to swiftly quit.It sadens me to discover that instead of working hard on fixing real problems with their game, they have spent a great deal of time and resouces adding cosmetic (useless)  enhancements for christmas and halloween, as well as amassing many fake reviews and other PR spin to try to fool others into donating more of their hard earnt dollars to their existing holiday fund that was around $700,000 from kickstarter, and a mininum of $300,000 from steam (yes, thats around $1 million dollars)Grade A scammers. You have been warned.SAVE YOUR MONEYDO NOT BUY THIS GAMEEvery wonder why this game has so many negative reviews but the forums are overwhelmingly positive?That's because this games developers activly delete negative forum posts and ban those post's authors in an effort to hide the fact that this game has not recieved any significant update with ingame improvements in over 3 years.Every year prior to the Christmas, for 3 years running now, Sauropod have released a series of fake updates to Castle Story to create the illusion of activity in hopes of cashing in on the Christmas season sales.You don't hear about it on the forums because everyone who comments about it gets swifly banned.Save your money, avoid this game at all costs.

								The first few hours of Castle Story seemed to scratch a castle-building itch I had been having. Seeing as this is an Early Access title, I was more than willing to endure the countless AI bugs that left my Bricktrons doing absolutely nothing and repeatedly ignoring my commands. I was determined to build and epic, sprawling citadel to defend against the oncoming waves of enemies. Sadly, it wasn't long before defending against the repetetive waves of identical, easily dispatched foes lost its charm. I could not fault Castle Story for its lack of content, it IS and Early Access game. So, I waited. A check of their website said they were ""re-factoring"" their code. This was indeed a lengthy process and five or so months later, they announced its completion and that regular updates would soon resume. I held out faith that after the ""re-factoring"" of their code, updates would come much more quickly. After all, this was what the developers told us. However, here we are now, several months later and they've wasted time and money to create a ""Pause"" feature and some Halloween content. The addition of Halloween content to this game was just adding insult to injury. I find it incredibly difficult to believe that after months and months of waiting, Suaropod has failed to create anything of substance which could be implemented, even it were in a buggy state. Abandon hope all ye who enter. Castle Story, is an empty, lifeless shell of what your hard earned money actually paid to see.			"

So far it seems they haven't tauight themselves to program in any meaningful way, and all the programmers they hire seem to swiftly quit.It sadens me to discover that instead of working hard on fixing real problems with their game, they have spent a great deal of time and resouces adding cosmetic (useless)  enhancements for christmas and halloween, as well as amassing many fake reviews and other PR spin to try to fool others into donating more of their hard earnt dollars to their existing holiday fund that was around $700,000 from kickstarter, and a mininum of $300,000 from steam (yes, thats around $1 million dollars)Grade A scammers. You have been warned.SAVE YOUR MONEYDO NOT BUY THIS GAMEEvery wonder why this game has so many negative reviews but the forums are overwhelmingly positive?That's because this games developers activly delete negative forum posts and ban those post's authors in an effort to hide the fact that this game has not recieved any significant update with ingame improvements in over 3 years.Every year prior to the Christmas, for 3 years running now, Sauropod have released a series of fake updates to Castle Story to create the illusion of activity in hopes of cashing in on the Christmas season sales.You don't hear about it on the forums because everyone who comments about it gets swifly banned.Save your money, avoid this game at all costs.

								DO NOT BUY THIS GAMEThis game is boring as hell, I love waiting for my bricktrons to place ONE wood log where they can't even place it.What is wrong with the bugs in this game, I know it's in alpha still but it's the buggiest game I have ever played in my life and it gets so boring after 6 waves, you just discover some tactic in survival mode like building hurdles and then the game just becomes so easy. Do not buy this game, seriously trust me, you will be bored of it, it takes an hour to make a little fortress four bricks tall.EDIT:One year later and the game is still s h i t.			"

And it's looking like there isn't more to come anytime soon.My advice, you'd be wasting your time waiting on this title. When, or if, more content does come out for it, I'd actually consider a positive reccomendation for this game.+Gameplay+Concept--- Developers			"

								I'll say this I can and have sat down and killed hours playing this game simply with the content it has.  There is alot of enjoyment to be gained from building your perfect castle and seeing it be defensable.  However there is a feeling of loss after that and lack of direction.  I understand the frustration of the community with the lack of updates, and I feel the same frustration but I have invested more time in this game than many others that cost twice as much.  On that basis alone I feel that while this game has not progressed to a level of gameplay I feel it could attain I have gotten enough hours of entertainment out of it to make it worth it for me.  That being said without the addition of new maps I wouldn't go so far as to recomend this to the average person.			"

Early Access Review
								I cannot say how angry I am right now.  I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!! Seriously, I want my money back.  The demo shows this cute little game where you circle areas of terrain and the little yellow dudes do what you say.  I bought this game, downloaded it, and started playing it.  It starts with a few dudes standing around a blue rock.  I click on one of them, they highlight with a little circle, I click on a tree, and they stop being highlighted and keep right on standing there.  After about ten minutes of increasing frustration, I finally succeed on getting two of them to cut down some trees. This causes one of them to fall off the world, and the other to quit working completely.  Meanwhile, I've been trying to get the others to build some sort of anything at all.  Highlighting an area of the ground causes a little square to appear and then disappear as soon as you let go of the button.  This causes the the little yellow dudes to continue standing around and do nothing.  This game is niether fun nor intuitive.  If I could give stars, I wouldn't give it any. I posted my review back in February 2014, it is now November of the same year, so I decided to give this game another try.  Literally nothing has changed or improved in any way.  The little yellow creatures still don't move (I got a message from the developer when I complained about it last time-- they said it was just because I couldn't figure out how to play the game) and there are no new maps.   Still can't reccommend this game, still want my money back.Update: September 2015.  I saw the update queue on my computer and decided to try the game again.  Bricktrons:  The bricktrons will now move, and will perform assigned tasks most of the time. They do have a strong tendency to freeze as their A.I. seems to lose track of what they are doing, but it is possible to build things, as long as there aren't more than 6 bricktrons on screen.  They get in each other's way very easily, and I have had to restart my game more than 4-5 times in a single gaming session due to freezes/crashes. Tutorial: I played the tutorial, and it did help me figure out the controls. However, I did run into problems where the menus simply wouldn't pop up, or if they did, it wasn't the menu I needed at the time.Conclusion: If this was the game I had downloaded almost 2 years ago, it wouldn't have been half bad, and I would have given it a positive review,  If the game continues to improve, I will switch my review to recommended.

								This is the first time I have written a review so im going to just start out by talking about the game then I will get into a more pro/con format later in.I played castle story back when it was just out of the prototype stage and there were many problems. two of the biggest problems were the path finding of the units and the camera's controls, everything else was injoyable. I have taken over 2 year break from this game. After the break I have come back to islands (maps) that are 10x as big as the ""first island"", two new game modes conquest (capture the point) and invasion (wave survival), a normal camera control system and enemys that you have to defend against. To add on to all that devs are getting ready to launch a multiplayer update where we can share control with friends or battle against one another (but as thats not in yet I will keep that out of my mind for the rest of the review). The game mode conquest is not very injoyable to me but the invasion mode is very challenging but fun so I'm going to focus on invasion. In invasion you start out with a few workers, a knight, an archer and your crystal (homebase) so you stright away get to work setting jobs and delgating how many workers you want doing diffrent jobs such as chopping trees for wood, working the iron mines, working in your querry for stone to make bricks or building your stronghold. Now building is a little unique you have to build your structures one brick at a time (you can click and drag so its not tedious) which means you can end up with a stronghold that can take multiple hits of explosive barrels or one. You can make you stronghold tall or wide its up to you but you do have to make sure you put supports under your structures so that your building doesn't collapse on its self. So I would say that castle story is a game that has seen a lot of growth and is at a stat were its fun to play.Some pros and cons:Pros:very good lookingeasy to build structureschallenging to balance jobsvarying sizes of mapsterrain deformation/reformationyou can build any size or shape structurestress systemcamera is not unusable like early releasesdevs are always releasing updatesCons:takes large amounts of time to complete structresbig map has some framerate issuesnot all game modes on every mapbugs where enemys dont charge your basewhen builting unless you have two wide paths there may be some pathing issuesminor lighting bugsIf you have the money to spare I think castle story is a game you should pick up.

								The video to this game got me hooked early on. It wasn't long before I finally splashed out and began sinking many hours in to the game. There is nothing like building up a huge castle (or multiple castles), along with catapults and lots of explosive barrels to fire at ones enemies.I have only played the single player game modes, my favourite now being 'conquest' where I can dominate the map and corner the Corruptrons. I can have lots of fun making things go boom with explosive barrels!The game is not perfect yet, there is a lot of refining that needs to take place. My main gripe is the game suffers from feeling a bit laggy once there is a lot happening on the map. Having said that, I still thoroughly enjoy playing the game and can recommend to any one who would enjoy being creative with building brick by brick.			"

								VERSION 0.6.4 REVIEW===Pros & Cons+ Pros ++ Very good mix of Sandbox, Tower Defence and Strategy that actually works+ You can build your very own fortress and defend it with an army+ Totally destructible / modifiable environment+ Added sandbox mode to build without worry of attacks+ Simple enough control system allows you to do what you need quickly+ AI has improved much since past versions and now can do complex tasks without errors+ Good building system / task system that doesn't make a mess of what is going on and keeps it clean+ Multiplayer has been improved and now works properly+ Good variety, for an Early Access, of parts and structures to build- Cons -- Camera system could be better- You still have to dig resources in sandbox mode, instead of having everything unlimited like a proper ""creative"" mode- Kinda poor variety of units to either build or to face in battle as enemies===Personal opinionCastle Story is surely a game with lots of potential, and still has time and quite a long way to be able to fully express the possibilities available to its gameplay. Still, it has improved a lot since the past versions, devs actually listened to the community on what should be done to improve the game, and did it.This mix of Defense, RTS and Sandbox can be found in very few other games i know of, and it's worth to give a try to anyone who likes building his own stuff and/or RTS in general.It can really be fun to defend your own castle, underground fortress or whatever you want to build against increasingly difficult enemies, think of it as a Stronghold mixed with Minecraft, pretty epic isn't it?I will update this review when updates come out, stay tuned.===ACTUAL RATING: 8/10 "

								Very promising idea. Very poor execution. The UI tries to be minimalistic and fresh, but comes off as clunky and unintuitive. Spending most of my time trying to remember how to get it to do what I want is usually a bad sign. Anything you want to do is buried below at least two or three levels of menus. That's a big no-no for anyone who knows how to do a UI.The performance for a game like this minimal really shouldn't be bad, but it bogs down after only a few minutes. That makes it even more difficult to play.Even worse, the AI is frustratingly dumb. In a game like this, I would've fixed and polished that first, even if the UI wasn't ready. The little workers spend way too much time in a stupor when time is often of the essence. When they do work, it's often not very efficient. They can build themselves and others into a corner. Stockpiles can fill up with worthless junk while the vaulables sit untouched nearby. Often they fill up the nearest stockpile instead of the most full, giving you a bunch of half-full and unusable piles. One missed or misplaced block (or even one closed door) can render an entire castle useless.Just needs way more polish and actual listening to feedback. With the updates coming every few months and not really seeming to do much, I wouldn't hold out much hope. Avoid this and go buy something fun.			"

								In its current state is what I would expect from a early access title... however this has been in early access for YEARS and I assume this is because of their small team size and Real life issues.You can do multiplayer (if you do the work around, and dev has confirmed working on a fix.) The game is far less buggy form the last time I played this (1 year ago). Is it worth the 20 USD at this point... I would be at a 66% yes and a 33% no... as multiplayer is a big thing for me there still some small bugs that have appeared but I now that these issues have been made aware to dev and its in their pipeline. When these issues and a few more branches of units and maybe some research feature to make units stronger or faster. bricktron tank maybe?Its a game none the less and I do recommend this game to people that want a casual stratagy game with creative elements.

								It's been a long time since I knew this game had potential, but Sauropod encountered problem in the first steps of the development. After 200h ingame, I stoped. I came back yesterday, and I have to say: this potential clearly became reality with the last patchs.   There are 4 main modes (for the moment): -Peace mode: build your own castle (tunnel and bridge) and expand it to a whole map in peace mode. Perfect to practice!!-Survival mode: try to survive as long as possible to the enemies waves. You'll have to smartly build your castle and defend it with your archers, knights, catapults and traps. (dificulties: easy, normal, hard)-Conquest mode: build multiple structure and try to expand your kingdom to capture enemie's base without being attacked in your main castle. (dificulties: easy, normal, hard)-Coop peace mode: build with your friends!There is also a map editor and a lot of new content upcoming.     Don't care about these old review pointing the bad optimisation, or saying this game is dead. They are wrong, castle story is alive, improving and WAITING FOR YOU SOLDIER! If you like strategic/construction/war game , this one is definitely for you!!!			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game in February of 2014, and it has come a long, long way since that time. I remember buying a copy, and buying another copy for a friend of mine, and we both were very impressed with the functionality and gameplay straight off the bat. Early on, it was a little rough around the edges, but seeing as the devs are keeping it updated and adding more and more as time goes on, I have no doubt it will keep getting better and better. The multiplayer is pretty cool, fairly functional with a few small bugs, but I'm going to chalk those up to be the fact that my friend was hosting the server in Michigan and I was connecting from Arizona. The bugs I mentioned were buildings popping in and out of existance, Bricktrons popping in and out of existance (both of these item popping into and out of existance bugs reset after a server restart. Nothing ingame was lost.), and crashes occationally when my friend would stop the server. As of right now, 05,16,2016, the multiplayer gameplay is a little bland. There's not much to do other than try to make cool castles and watch as bricktrons dig their way into the ground, then eventually seal themselves in their own mines. There is no PVP combat yet with the warriors, but you can still lop arrows at your friend's worker bricktrons when he sends them over to your base to say hello. BUT, the devs Shatojon and Evax livestreamed a new work in progress update teaser with co-op corruptron combat and base building 3 days ago on 05,13,2016. I can't wait until they release it. I will update this review with my thoughts after I have explored the update, but my first impressions from seeing the livestream are very positive. A co-op bricktron combat alongside co-op base building is exactly what I wanted from this game.Overall, I am very pleased with my $20 investment. Some people tend to say that every hour of playtime should considered to be about a dollar, and if you come up short on hours spent playing, then it's a bad investment. I personally don't think that's a very good idea of how you should look at the picture. I see it as this: if the game is fun, then it's a good investment, if the game is bad, it's a bad investment. You'll never know if it's good or bad until you invest. Don't take my opinion as the gospel, nor should you take anyone else's opinion as the gospel, since we all have different opinions. If the game looks fun to you, invest, if you don't want to, don't. Just don't whine and moan when the game isn't perfect even though it says right above the ""Add to cart"" button that the game isn't perfect and that it is still in early access. Don't♥♥♥♥♥♥on the developers who are making this game for a living for not completing the game quick enough. They're taking their time to make the game as perfect as they want it to be, updating it and keeping in contact with the customers. Hell, the developer Shatojon even added me and sent me a message asking my opinion on the game. Has any AAA game developer gone out of their way to actually talk one on one with a customer before? Did Ubisoft go out of their way to ask their consumers' opinions on Assassin's Creed Unity after it was released broken? Nope. The only thing Ubisoft's CEO has said was that ALL Steam users and all PC users are pirates, and that he doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ if the game is broken for us.  Would you, the consumer, really rather have a broken game on release and a CEO of the company you're buying the content from telling you to get bent because he's an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, than a game functional in early access and a group of devs who really bust their asses with a game they want people to enjoy? Seriously?			"

								I'm hereby refunding this game. its plain.. whats the word? abysmal. it boasts castle building but your braindead workers can't build anything but a 2 block high mini wall before they choke up. so you're thinking ""i'll just build one high walls up so they can climb!"" NOPE! throw out your human enginuity for this game. they're fine climbing up 1 high walls while carrying blocks only if they're placing another one high wall. but if they need to climb up AND place a block down next to them, thats just too complex a task for their little empty heads. whats even worse is that i tasked a worker to gathering lumber, and he somehow, twice in a row, got himself stuck in between tree trunks and logs that he couldn't get out of untill i assigned someone else to move things for him.the stupidity doesn't stop with workers oh no. i made a little knight to guard around the well i was building and the idiot climbed onto the 2 high wall and got stuck up there. was there a door? yes. litteraly right next to him. my archers also seem to have completely lost the concept of a bow, as they will only attack from melee range.i don't have the proformence issues that everyone else has, and im sure ym pc isn't as good as them, but it does studder sometimes when they're trying to find their path.this game isn't worth $20 or $17 for the sale.

								I originally purchased this game, like many others, as soon as it was available. The idea was simple: I liked the game, and wanted to see it improve. The problem came when no improvements were made.In two years they've fixed one or two major bugs, optimized the engine slightly, added the ability to save - but that's the extent of it. With the money they've collected, and the amount of people working on the game, this result (or lack thereof) is disasterous.This kind of slow, $#@%ty work might be acceptable in the public sector, but in the private sector there's accountability, and there's backlash when you take people's money and don't make good on your end of the deal. Simply put, Sauropod is yet another dishonest group of people taking advantage of the early-access / crowd funding systems. Don't give them your money.			"

								Addivtive. It's still a bit buggy, but if you're patient it's well worth it.Sadly, I'm changing this out. Its been nearly a year and I've seen virtually no progress actually made aside from a PAUSE button. I used to follow their blog updates anxiously but now? Silence. Not a peep. So if you're looking for great gameplay and a fun sandbox, look elseware. Just con artists here.			"

								This is a cute game with a really fun premise. However, the path finding is so buggy that you simply can't make anything like what the screenshots show you. At most, you'll get a 10-brick wall before your characters become so unresponsive that you are clicking everywhere in frustration just to get them to react at all. Watching cheese grow mold is more interactive than this game.If the devs ever fix the bugs and get this game working, it has the potential to be a quit fun building game.			"

								Can this be short?The fact is, I love this game. You may be thinking ""Then why in the world are you not recommending it?"". Here is the answer: This game lures you in with the concept of a fun sandbox with cute little creatures running around following your commands. The horrible truth is revealed when you are 1 hour in: You really should of spent that $20 on a pack of bacon. Yeah, a pack of bacon's fun lasts longer than this excuse of a game. The bricktons do not follow your commands, the building system is untrustable and takes a long time to even understand how to build a wall and they added a wave system with way too much time in between waves... But the reason I still like it is because the game is a great idea. The sandbox TD stratergy game is a great idea, but just not developed enough. If Sauropod wakes up and discovers that they created a mess of a game, and they fix it, we would have a good game.Well, so much for a short review. "

								Great game! Still needs some improvement, as there are the occasional bugs here and there, but the creators are doing a good job of patching these. A few things that would make Castle Story better would be online play, (with strangers, not just friends) some more 'bricktrons' as there are only 3 kinds, and some more game modes! The only thing I dislike about this game is the multiplayer, however I love the awesome maps, great visuals (sunsets and the crystals look amazing at night), and the gameplay is very nice! I recommend buying this game, as the creators are working hard too keep this game updated and playable!			"

								12/10/14 UPDATE: There's a new patch! Nope, nothing in the way of actual content...they've rewritten three major aspects of the game (graphics, AI and new voxel engine). REALLY?! After over two years of development, they're still rewriting the basics. If this doesn't say ""STAY AWAY"" to you, then nothing will. ORIGINAL REVIEW: This might be an awesome building/fight game in about eighteen years or so. I love building games, and as a result I get easily bamboozled by the promise of games like Castle Story -- take charge over a group of vaguely humanoid bipedal lumps named 'bricktons' and have them build castles and buildings and such, make weapons for them so that they can defend themselves against all manner of goblinry. There's gonna be mayhem and fighting and explosions with arrows and stuff flying everywhere. With catapults and everything.Unfortunately, as it stands right now, it's little more than a tech demo -- the UI is flaky, making it difficult to mine and build anything. The Bricktons tend to stand around more often than actually do work due to incomplete AI. Despite excellent graphics and animation, the game itself has a unique lack of polish to it -- it's tough to even know what to do in a logistics sense, and the UI makes doing it a struggle even when you've figured it out.What's worse is that Castle Story has been in development for an amazing length of time for it to be in such a state (just over two years at this point, and their kickstarter has been funded to the tune of $702k when they asked for just under $30k). As best as I can figure out, the development team had to rewrite vast sections of their game for some reason or another at some point last year (rumor has it to accommodate a Linux version, which is preposterous if it's true).However, their development blog of late has been more concerned about their going to PAX East and moving to a new office than trivialities such as the state of their game (and reading between the lines, it would seem as though their time at PAX didn't go so well...which is hardly a surprise given the state of the game currently).All-in-all, avoid Castle Story for now. Hopefully it's coming out in the next two years or so and I can change my recommendation. I play a LOT of early access games, and this one is frankly the second worst when it comes to time in development.			"

								(TL;DR at bottom)I was looking at this game when it first came out on kickstarter - and bought game when it came out on steam because I thought it had such a great potential. It still does, believe me! Tho.. I've played it a bit back and fourth and have seen a couple of 200MB and 300MB updates but has there been any changes? Sadly, not that I've seen. The gameplay hasn't changed and the workers bugs out all the time and there's nothing you can do to prevent it. How are we supposed to test a game and give feedback when we can't even play the game properly?In multiplayer it's near impossible for someone else to connect to your server and when they manage to do so you can't even see what they are building and one of you randomly win because of god knows what.I had big hopes for this game but as of now I do not recommend this game to anyone.TL;DR: Do not buy this game, it might seem like the devs are updating the game but they aren't.

I can't say for sure if this was a scam or not. If it was; the damage is pretty much done - if it wasn't, this team has shown NO progress to speak of for an untenable amount of time.			"

								Well, simple put... i dont know where to start... So here goes nothing. First ill talk about what the game is. Then on to other things for new players. First This game... ITS SOOO GOOD. It's utterlly my dream game still in the works! You start off with nothing but your spawn crystal and some yellow plebs. the game has a spiritual feel because each pleb dude has a soul pretty much. and like the old japanese hermit said in that one movie or show... everyone will return to which they came... anyways. they are your builders... then you got the Warriors and Archers. which look sick btw. Then you got the curruptrons which are rocky oppisites of them yellow plebs i talked about. they will hunt you if you do survival or conquest. (game modes) Now that we got characters done lets move on to the game itself, You and your plebs go on to venture the floating islands with cartoony or voxel..aly really-really-great-graphics-for-this-voxel-game. As you venture youll notice there is a day and night cycle. You should probably get some shelter. So now... you put down some stockpile platforms and then you order half you men to get wood and the other half to start a quarry or use that nearby mine. From there.... It will leave you one question. Question? you ask... If it wasn't obvious it was WHAT to build... the options are LITERALLY UNLIMITED. thats why i like it. The game has wonderful phyics that make me tear to the tree that just fell off the floating island that i wanted all the way to making me tear for the shear beuty of shooting the supports on a cliffside castle with explosives and a cannapult. Now medival is kinda the theme of this all, but it isnt just castles you can make... Palaces, Cathedrals (Can't spell today sorry), Over hangs, MASSIVE Castles that expand to lots of nearby islands. Ragdoll physics are there and probably the MOST IMPORTANT TIP AND FACT... Its a waiting game.. kinda... you need to be able to wait. Its a long term game. meaning your projects will take some time mainly because you need to go for the resources and build probably a warehouse for the resources needed for the Huge castle design blueprint that you made. that warehouse might not be enough. This is why i wished the game was A TAD bit more faster. BUT its COMPLETELY fine to me how it is in my opinion. ands thats just that. Its a great game. Definitly A game to try and worth doing a youtube series on in the future (wink) anyways, I think i wrapped up most of the parts i wanted to talk about... SO THEN... I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR YOU... What will you build with your Plebs? :P			"

Early Access Review
								Rather cute game, which I wasted a few hours on.Now as a disclamer, I do realise that this is an early access game, but as it stands, it is barely playable. At this point the core game should be up and working, with a few minor bugs here and there. (i.e. No major game breaking bugs.)Firstly, I was constantly fighting with the pathfinding/AI of the bricktons (Workers).Half the time they would either get clogged, run on the spot, refuse to be assigned to an objective, become unselectable, sometimes wait 5-10+ secconds to figure out a simple path from A to B, take the longest and most inefficient route and in general; they do not do what I want when I want it. Almost NEVER.You have the choice between two combat units: Archer (Ranged) and Soldier (Melee)The Soldier being useless, as 99% of the time will run past the enemy he's chasing.So you have to basically rely on archers. Except they're prone to shooting each other in the back, and trying to shoot through your resource stashes, destroying them with a single arrow.There are also catapaults, Which i couldn't figure out how to work (Couldn't seem to assign any tasks to them or drop stuff on them)The level design looks cool, but functionally is an absolute pain to deal with.I lost countless resources (Trees and stone) into the abyss thanks to them (especially the trees) being next to the edge and 95% of the time, the physics would tip towards the edge instead of inwards. (And you have no control over how they fall.)There is also no variety in the enemy's you face. Only the one zerg rush type. The save system is also buggy, I saved my first game (After about 1-2 hours of play) and then immedietly reloaded it. (There was a builder looping a falling sound, who was stuck in a mine.) It wouldn't load, so I lost that save.If the other reviews are anything to go by (And the release date of Sept 2013) It doesn't seem like any of these problems will be fixed anytime soon. There have been patches recently, but there are still an absolutly massive number of issues.This is interesting concept, one that I liked the look of, but has been very poorly executed. A majority of it seems to be implemented with Unity's stock-standard features, And it suffers for it.I wouldn't buy it again.TL;DR: Cute but terribly broken game with the outlook of few to no useful updates in the future. Go elsewhere.			"

								I will not be playing this game ever until it reaches full version. I played for less than 30 min on survival and one of my workers  got stuck in the mine when I hit recall workers to get my workers to safety. So there goes 1 guy but I can power through its just 1 bug right? Then my archer immediately after manages to shoot HIMSELF and kill himself. I didn't even wait to see what happened next because I had just lost two of my bricktons or whatever they are called. I understand it is early access but they hardley ever bring out patches. And when they do it is something small like 1 bug was fixed. I understand it is hard to make a game but within 30 min I encountered two bugs that ruined the entire experience for me. Lets hope they fix these bugs. It is fun for about 15 minutes at a time for me and not in survival. It has to be in sandbox because I just love building so I get to fufill that childhood dream but only for a bit before something happens and I quit the game again. Don't buy this game unless you can deal with bugs that may or may not ruin the map you are playing on. Great concept. When it works I love it. But it needs more time.			"

								Don't buy this vaporware. The game hasn't been seriously updated for a long time - its still the glitchy, broken, bare-bones mess it was when it was first released here, and the deluge of ""refactoring"" and ""bug fix"" patches the devs have spewed out since then has done very little to change that. The trailer and screenshots are misrepresentations of the actual game. It has been nothing but smoke and mirrors, empty promises of new content just around the corner, only for more patches consisting of obscure bug fixes and background code changes. Anyone who still defends these developers under the pretense of ""early access"" is in serious denial of the fact that for all of the money they've made off of this ""game"", their progress has been embarrassingly shallow.

								I am one of the purchasers of this game back when they first released back in 2013.  I think I even bought it less than a month of their release date.  I must say they have come a long way...  Granted they are still Early Access, I do hope they are able to achieve a v1.0 and it looks like they're getting close!I will make note that I did not play this game for a good year or two, waiting for better updates and finally checking back, I am glad I did.  I will be returning to playing this game for countless hours to come!I understand many reviewers may not be happy with this game then, and even now.  But they DO forwarn you that it is still in Early Access.  For some of us, we may even be playing at an Alpha level and still enjoyed ourselves.  I was willing to make the purchase for an early access game like this one because I saw potential, and I still do.Ultimately, I would recommend this game in two ways: One, for those who are willing to endure some bugs and be a part of the development to create something great! Two, to wait for Sauropod Studios to break out of Early Access when they have everything smooth and crisp for all gamers.  For you builders, designers, and thinkers out there.  this game can definitely be for you.Keep chipping away Sauropod Studios!			"

								Edited as of 30/09/2014Castle story is a funny little building game about bricktons. You control them, commanding them to cut trees or dig stone and gems. With gems you can make torches and create more bricktons. In creative mode you can create buildings to your hearts desire, in survival mode you have to make a castle to defend against the evil corruptrons.Pros:- Nice graphics and artstyle- Make your own buildingsCons:- Hard (or challenging) controls to control your bricktons- Buggy- Little content. After your 2nd castle you will have seen it for now.- Develepors have not updated in approx. half a year, and the updates that have happened were bugfixes or similar background updates. Conclusion:Castle story can provide some fun, but in the end of the day it's a game with hardly any content. It's also not recommended to support developers that hardly seem to do anything.			"

								Pros:1. It's a fun game for the first little while.2. I really like the look and feel of the game.3. Local LAN Coop.4. Steam Workshop.Cons:1. There isn't much content right now.2. The game lags to the point of unplayability after an hour.3. My play style would be a slow build up of resources, build an amazing Castle and wait until I have superior numbers before attacking. So I play on easy... (Which is fun for me) - However, I cannot seem to get that play-style working. After an hour, my Castle isn't anywhere nearly finished, I have 3 swordmen and 5 archers which all die really quickly and my base is slowly destroyed by hundreds of tiny corruptrons whilst the game lags to the point of being unable to defend myself.Summary:I look forward to playing in the future. This game is not worth £15 currently. (I hope my funds go to making this game better) - If you're considering a purchase, I would say yes - because if you don't, the Developers might stop working on it and I will have wasted my £15... :D			"

								As an original KS supporter, I have been extremely disappointed in the lack of progress.  We have not recieved a proper beta and its been nearly 4 times as long as originally promised.I don't feel this game is ready to even be sold to ""early adopters"" or whatever scheme you want to call it.  Certainly this could change at some point down the line but save your money for now and if you are interested in the game, simply keep an eye on it and wait.  It's really a basic prototype which is being generous IMHO.You will also find that the community manager has no people skills and is difficult to put up with.  If I was the community manager for a game that has failed to even meet one single promised goal, I would be kind and respectful to my critics.  Instead, he is quite honestly a rude jerk which is unfortunante.  In the end, I hope the game is successful as it is a great concept but hold off on your purchase.##Edit##My original review was posted FEB 24th, 2014.  It is now Jan 20th, 2015 and there has been ""progress"" as in they have released a few patches, but the game is technically in the same state it was in, they got a new community manager who is worse than the previous one, and there is no end in sight.  If you buy this game, I will sit outside your house and call you a big dumb chump.  Steam should not allow this sort of unfinished garbage even on its store.			"

								This game is so annoying, I don't know if it's because the updates, or if the game is just crappy itself. But it's really buggy.I spend over 2 hours trying to figure out their controls, and their YouTube videos and Steam Forums didn't help. The forums kept saying one thing:The controls are confusing and awkward.After 1 hour of trying to figure out the game mechanics, I gave up and played another game instead.Unless they fix this game in later updates, don't buy it if you don't want to waste $20 of hard earned money.

								Strongly advise to NOT buy the game. They made a lot of money on kickstarter 1.5 years ago, and did not make any visible progress since then. The video looked very promising, but the actual game does not offer any sort of content, no maps, no variety. User experience is terrible, I had to look up youtube videos to actually control the unity properly. Also after a time, lets say 30 minutes, FPS goes down terribly every game so it becomes unplayable, and hasnt been fixed in half a year or since I got it from my kickstarter back. This early access is just a cheap way to squeeze more money out of it.			"

								I have owned this game since the kickstarter came out.  The video you watch still has more features than the version we have.  The slow progress would be one thing but the fact that we are stonewalled by the developers makes it much worse.  The only answer you'll see from the community developer is ""we cannot make any statements regarding the game."".  They will not give us anything to show us what progress has been made.  We went from weekly blogs to monthly vlogs.  The first two vlogs were monthly, now they're 30+ days.  They give us insight into how a game is made but provide no measurable progress for new material that will be in the game.  From bugfixes to new content we haven't seen much of anything. Maybe we'll see a change but after 3 years it's doubtfull.			"

They say they are ""refactoring"" the intire gamecode so the can implement things better in the future. There are some really annoying AI bugs that will frustrate just your basic gameplay.If you still think it's worth your money...than go ahead and buy the game.My advise is to wait and check back 1 year or so (yes it's that slow) and see if it became the pearl as everyone thinks...

								When I kickstarted this it seemed promising. The Devs were straight out of ""game design school"" and seemed to have talent.Played it a lot when I bought into it's kickstarter, enjoyed it although there wasn't much to do.2 years on....still the same stuff to do, no new content, no progress as far as I could tell.The store page has a line that says ""Do you want to be involved into the evolution of our project?"". Many people do, but seems they aren't taking constructive criticism very well. The company policy is not to give out information regarding updates and when they will come for fear of reprisals from the community should they have to backtrack their information. Due to this policy kickstarter backers/customers can't get answers to their questions no matter how polite they are. Questions regarding new features/what they are currently working on get the same response...""We can't give you an answer/you will get to know in due course.""Yes, it's EA, yes I backed it, I'm not bothered about the money wasted....I'm not that bothered about the lack of progress. I just won't play it, I have 100+ other games to keep me entertained.What does bother me is a new bunch of devs trying to push out their first game have not learnt anything about the PR side of game development.  They choose to batten down the hatches of their impenetrable bunker and just slowly get on with things without the input of the backers who 'want to be involved in the evolution of their project'Let's not be too hard on them though, perhaps they are reading and taking note of the discussions and or suggestions.....just a shame they 'aint telling the fans about what they are doing/attempting, would like to do or won't attempt to do from all the mountain of forum content!Early Access on steam needs to learn from these types of ""developments"". :Make it so that to be EA'd the devs are contracted by way of ""The Early Access Promise"" to the community to push out lets say at least 3 major updates a year when in alpha, perhaps less so in beta. Every EA title must have a roadmap, a clear version 1 release date, or a set of goals per year that they must achieve within reasonable time frames.Lastly, every EA title that fails to deliver on these set goals/release dates should allow the backers to pull their money out and steam removes the game from their library and deposit the funds into their steam wallet.Doing the above steps would ensure that not only can customers back a project and have more faith in the team to deliver but also devs need to up their game to ensure they are organised and efficient in how they spend the money backers gave to them.After all you don't ask a bank for a loan for $1million to start up a business and they say ""There you go, we will get the money back from you whenever"". They want a business plan, projections of profit etc.			"

								Very neat concept but the game suffers from unplayable frame rate drops. On medium settings, game starts ok at ~ 30 fps, unfortunately it only gets worse as the game progresses. Searching threads for relief, I found dev posts all the way back to 2013 where they promised optimization, well, 3 years later, this thing chugs on my rig like I'm trying to play latest gen FPS with graphics set to ultra.Also, what's the deal with this game controller GUI? Can I have a simple ""build"" menu with all the items displayed in one overlay? The bad:* For a simple voxel game, graphical performance is horrible.* GUI - Keyboard / mouse unfriendly.* AI - Doesn't handle pathing issues / conflicts very well. The good:* If you can overlook the 3 above, the game can be pretty fun.			"

								This game is absolutely rubbish. They say that this is actually a working game, however, it couldn't be further from it. 12 Minutes was all I needed to see that these ""minions"" have had no thought put into how they move and what they do. They become confused, the processes to make them do simple tasks are too clunky and complicated. They are too hard to operate with. I bought this game thinking I could use it for its primary purpose; to be played with.  However, it is a waste of money. Simply looking around the map area is a laborious task in itself. There is nothing about this game that is simply easy to do or fun. There are so many bugs and things to fix I couldn't keep playing it. There are no tutorials or anything to tell me how and what to do.EDIT: I recently downloaded the game again after quite a while of having it sit in my ""NOT WANTED"" category. It's still awful. Despite plenty of time and the graphics on ""fantastic"", there are several graphical glitches, such as a lot of pixelation, missing textures and see-through blocks. It's like watching Youtube in 144p but worse. The controls are still too complex and overly sensitive. There's no tutorial that I could find and if you click the wrong thing, there's no way to un-do it. For the love of all that is good and holy don't buy this game. If you haven't, bend down on one knee and thank Gaben by name. Just go buy Minecraft*.*BUT NOT STORYMODE!			"

								Before you buy this, know that there has not been any significant content update for several months. I understand early access means in development, but that would actually require some development on the developers part.While the game is entertaining for the first few hours, it becomes boring quickly, lacking the ability to do more than just build a castle. The survival mode is moderately entertaining for awhile but in essence, its survive against waves that come at you in a straight line. Its predictable and therefor gets boring easily. There are several pros and cons, the pros being a unique new type of gameplay compared to other sandbox games, however it has many shortcomings such as lack of building materials and lack of blocks, which severely limits creativity. Making this sandbox game, not worth the money.Overall I cant recommend a game that is boring and has not progressed in development for months. If things change, I will definately change my review.

								Terrible Developers.Over the last year they have been working on trying to make a simple voxelbased game work properly.There has not been a single new content patch and the game is still not working correctly.This is a basebuilding game where you defend yourself from Evil Rock-People that want to ravage your base at night.You do this by building and as time goes on you have to build strategical walls and place archers and soldiers inside your base.There is a multiplayermode that barely works where you can wreck havoc and do as you please to your opponent but as of now there is no co-op feature and setting up a server is hard work for those who just want to jump in and play as there are no dedicated servers.As it sound it is a faily simple game yet quite hard in the later levels if you play in the survival mode. Though I woud still not recommend this title as it is not going anywhere. On it's own it is quite fun but it is a thing that you would only spend a few couple of hours into and then never touch it again until they add more content and depth to the game.I've only come back to play it because the first hours was a pain since nothing worked.Might be worth buying on a 75% sale.

								I strongly recommend this game if you like building games.In this game you begin with a few workers and start extracting ressources to build the castle of your dream, or anything that you dream of, hire more workers or soldiers. You place the blueprints and they will build it. There is a variety of ressources, stones and wood blocks and structures such as columns, door, catapult, lights and more.

There is also a fighting part to the game, if you play invasion or conquest mode, you have to defend against hordes of evil creatures called corruptrons.I have this game since a 2 or 3 years and development of the game was continuous, features are added regularly, and the devs are close to the community, they listen and reply to feedbacks and suggestions.The is a multiplayer mode, which is basic at the moment but will get optimised soon according to dev team.

Castle Story is a quite interesting game to be honest. I've wanted this game since 3 years ago when I couldn't play it, do too it only could be played on Mac from what I've seen on their forum. But one day I saw it again, but this time It were on Windows too, but this time your game would be saved in steam instead, so I didn't have to do anything in their fourm, which I didn't understand. xDAfter Some time they've even added Multiplayer, which I have never asked for. So I brought two of my friends and played with them the first week it was added. And we had a great time killing each other, even if one of us couldn't join. but we kinda grew up, and I had a really long brake from this game, but then But thanks to them they brought my interests back with new updates and their stream on Twitch, that show us the work they've done, that might even be added.   But the gameplay, Is really fun once we get to know the ""Map Editor,"" which is basically were you create your own Sandbox island or D-day as I would call it, since the Bricktron (your enemy) will swarm you and kill you one day. If you are playing playing Invasion, of course. But there is a Sandbox mode, but **** that! xDNow I am just waiting for the ""Map Editor"" to make so you can place your own stone bricks for your castle, because I don't want to build an amazing castle every time I die, I am right?But this game is a 8/10 if you're a guy like me that love to build and fight, with your very building you have created!

								The ability to let the player be creative in the making of forts and castles is a very important feature in a game like this... and it is done well here.I bought Castle Story a while ago (before many of the current feature were implimented) and had fun creating catles and defending them. A couple months ago I rediscovered Castle Story and had a blast with the new features like Conquest Mode.While playing the game I didn't really encounter any bugs or glitches with the game.  Pros:-Allows Creativity-Interesting setting (on floating islands in a sort of isolated place)-Different features allow for more types of play style.-Challenging yet excitingCons (some might just be my computers fault):-while building castles I find it difficult to build or fix things on the inside of the structure-when I have been playing for a bit and the waves in Invasion Mode start to get more difficult I find that I need more        Bricktrons, but my gameplay gets a bit choppy when I get to around 7-8 Bricktrons. When I get to 10 or more Bricktrons my computer just can't handle it and will either crach or become very difficult to play.-when I put my archers up on the walls they will do fine unless I choose to fight with my swordsmen too. Then I have to micro-manage them to make sure they don't hit friendly troops.Overall: Castle Story is a good game and is worth the money. If I had to give it a rating it would be 8/10 (my rating will probably be higher when the game has been completed) still though if you have the creativity and a computer that can run the game well, then for you it could be way better than you might think.As a little note for the end of my review I would like to be the selfish player who puts out a few ideas that I have no right to demand for but would still like to see.    :)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1) It would interesting to see a way to play as the Corruptrons either in singleplayer or multiplayer. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2) A way to save creations would save a lot of time as well as giving the players a way to hurry past the parts of the game  he/she may find tedious.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------3) In Sandbox mode it is super fun to just go nuts and build a bunch of stuff but it would be interesting to see how such creations would fair in Invasion Mode, but it can be boring to have to rebuild them block by block (especially if they are large creations). So a way to put Corruptrons in Sandbox Mode would be fun and allow players to test their creations before starting an Invasion Mode playthrough. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------4) It would be fun to be able to rename the Bricktrons to names that are more personal or funny.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thats my thoughts on Castle Story.

								The idea of this game is great no question!I love the micro-management and building aspect, with a pinch of TD games. This just needs better multiplayer optimization because the game lags when only 3 players play (me and my friends). Please continue the updates, patches, and optimization, I see promise in this game!(EDIT)I am unsure as to if it is my friend or the game, but we are unable to even play. He crashes by loading into the game, or placing something, or even trying to download into the lobby. Developers please work on this!(NEWEST EDIT)MAKE SURE WHEN PLAYING WITH FRIENDS THAT BOTH OF YOU TURN OFF HAMACHI OR EVOLVE OR OHTER MP SUPPORTERS AS YOU WILL NOT BE IN SYNC WHEN TRYING TO PLAY TOGETHER)Keep up the work lads, just please make sure syncing is not an issue to have someone disconect due to the syncing issues!

								not really a RTS, bad design, horrible ai, not a fun experience bought 2 copies one for me and a friend.. regret.. regret is all I can say. Wish there was more to it but sadly it's a let down for me.*POSITIVE NOTE* The developers seem to care a lot about their game and they also seem very kind with the community. Was taken back a little bit as they actually contacted me for this very review. I still stand by my negative review as the game is buggy as mentioned before and I would not recommend purchasing more than 1 copy of the game to try out. I will probably change my review after a few more iterations of the game is released but as is I can't stand behind a positive review and be truthful. I will get back to you guys with that list as I have to go through my notes about this game. Keep up the good work I can see great things coming from this company.			"

								Could be fun but pace is really too slow, I got quickly bored waiting for the yellow guys to build blocks, especially when they got stuck as pathfinding seems to be quite an issue. The building list is quite limited as well for now. I have a decent computer but the game is really slow on ""big"" maps, probably (and hopefully) because it is still early access and there is no optimization yet. Not recommended as of now, may review my evaluation later when there will be more updates, as the game still holds a good potential.			"

								TL;DR -> Castle Story is about building Lego castles and defending said lego castles with lego people against either the CPU's evil zombie lego people (in co-op with other players online now too), or against other players lego people in multiplayer. Its fun for folks who like lego in simple terms.Yo, you like lego? Yeah, me too.So I bought Castle Story way way waaaay back in its early days when it was first released on steam. Back then Castle story wasnt fit for purpose, and it had soooo many problems and bugs.Now, instead of taking to the steam forums and filling up the review section with whining about how ""EARLY ACCESS IS BAD"" like most steam-kiddie reviewers tend to do nowadays, I waited for the game to be closer to finished so I could see what I'd actually spent money on. A good 4 and three quarter years later the game still isnt 'quite' finished, but its rather close to it.At first, development on Castle story was quite slow, very slow in fact. Its the one thing people had the most issue with and rightly so too. As of last year however (2016) development has started to ramp up and the game has exponentially increased in both size and quality, adding multiplayer and completely revamping/adding new things that it so desperately needed. Castle Story as it is right now is definitely worth its price tag, more-so if you have people to play it with. The best part though is that it isnt even finished yet, and hopefully we'll be seeing even more new stuff added to the game in the future.			"

								I was one of the kickstarter backers of this game back in 2012. Back then I was really excited for Castle Story, but because of school and other reasons I forgot that I owned the game when it was finally released on steam. Over the years I kept an eye on the game, and was pretty disappointed that no significant improvements had been made on it until now. Only very recently did I find out that I had a key, and decided to give the game a try.All I can say is that Castle Story has made some pretty significant progress over the past few months. Blueprint coping, multiplayer conquest mode and the map editor were all very much needed features for the game.The only qualm I have is the lack of variety of maps, but with steam workshop integration in the works, community made maps will be much easier to download and play.Very excited for the future of this game!  8/10			"

But these Devs are just sooo clearly inexperienced and arnt learning much in the process. I bought this game about a year or 2 ago. It was a bug ridden mess that didnt know what it was or where it was going. Now its today...and its still a bug ridden mess that doesnt know where its going. After this long a game should have a solid concept with content. This game still is just a basic build with, in my opinion, very little content. Theres bugs everywhere you look and, on top of that, the game just crashed on me lol. I can look past some bugs for a good game thats enjoyable, but this game is 100% micro-management of your workers, and 100% frustrating. I cant recommend this game to anyone until it has a lot more content and a lot less bugs.			"

								A game with a lot of potential. Mixing the resource gathering and combat of an rts and the building of a game similar to minecraft, there is a lot of fun to be had. I can see this been a very good game in the future but at the moment it is obviously unfinished. There is a lack of direction along with a lack of modes and activities. As there is no multiplayer yet there is basically not much to do. This combined with a clunky UI can combine to make a quite frustrating experience. I'd would say hold on and wait for the game to be finished. As said before there is the potential here to be a really fun game.			"

Back then it was terribly bugged and it was a Steam deal going so I thought 'lets give it a try'. It was fun for five minutes, like most of the Alpha releases and I left it lying, with hope that in time, the developer could make this a really good game.

It is very intertaining and easy to log many hours into the game for purely not wanting to get off. I would highly reccomend it to friends or anyone else reading this.			"

								This game USED to be a great lot of fun, even though its updates was SEVERELY slow it was a fun surreival game, i didnt much enjoy the sandbox mode as it is just overall pointless tough. It USED to be fun in surrival mode, however the last few updates they've pushed out has COMPLETELY ruined that. The edition of a new enemy creature a big hulking golem that just ONE SHOTS everything! Your meele units which was a NEED to keep hordes of minions away has now been demed COMPLETELY useless. And it takes 1-2 rounds to spawn one of your own minions! And you need archers fighters and builders. So yeah fighters are USELESS now to the incompetent Balancing. Not to mention the stupid ♥♥♥♥ing ai targeting. You'll be reloading your game atleast 2-3 times every late round after wave 8 because your archer kill one of your other archers! They just KEEP ♥♥♥♥ing killing eachother..So as of now, the game is NOT worth 20 euro. Not even 15, not even 10. Anything below that and its a worth while game to grab if you got nothing else to go for. 4/10 personal score. It used to be great, but the recent updates with crappy AI and unbalanced scaling has just made it a worthless experience.			"

								This seemed like a good game, but until you get into it, its confusing and weird. So, you would think that right mouse would control camera or some other button, but no. It takes around like 4 keys, holding them down at the same time and ALSO, moving the mouse around. This game also wont sell well if there isnt other language support. I bought this game 1 year ago and it has NOT improved at all! Controls are clunky, game is super confusing, if you wanna do anything at all. you have to have like 9 miners, 1 warrior and 1 archer. DO NOT, buy this game now but buy it when it is out of access or if they made MAJOR improvements to the game. I wish I got a refund...  "

								Every update is 1 step forward and 3 steps back.  Developers are fresh out of school, and have no skills at project management.   Some day, some year, this game may actually become playable, but I expect that day will be many years in the future.  That's assuming the developers don't completely run out of Kickstarter and Steam Greenlight funds first.  The only semi-positive note about this game is that the developers are still working on it.  But following this development process is like watching a blind kid trying to drive a car.Reasons for negative review:  AI is horrible. Path-finding is horrible. Now you might say ""well, it's early acess, blah blah blah"".  With each update the developers boast about how much they've improved the AI and fixed the pathfinder, every update proves this to be false.  The pathfinder and AI function should realy be at the base of the game, and if it's not correct, the game will never be worth playing.			"

								For the longest of times I did not like this game, I liked the ideas behind it, but not the way it was executed, the AI was awful and the performance was questionable at best.Now however the AI is actually good, it doesn't take them half a day to react to what you want them to do, they still sometimes, take a second to react, but it's not often that that is the case, the majority of times you tell them to do something, they set off to do it near instantly, which is pretty damn good.I might come back to this review and actually give some more detailed info on the game and how it is and blah blah blah.

								I first purchased this game a few years back.  I tried it a few times, and while i found it fun, i found issues with it, and decided to wait a while longer before i really gave it a fair shake.Cut to recently, when i again decided to dive back into Castle Story, and I am glad i did!The game is fun!!!I was amazed at how different the Castle Story of today looks and plays over what i initially experienced.  I've been playing it for a while now, and i have yet to encounter any AI issues, framerate issues, or honestly, ANY bugs of any kind.Give this game a try... the road has been slow going, but i think it was worth the wait!!!

								Castle Story is a variation on a tower defence game, you get resources & a team of men to build a castle to protect a power crystal from corrupted trons. Your bricktron men can be workers collecting resources & building, or archers & soldiers to protect against the corrupted trons. You can add a small variety of torches, doors & catapults to your castle to increase its defensive capacity. It's fun for a while, but building a castle can be a slow process. Bricktrons often get stuck or caught on items, or end up bunching up together as they all attempt to perform one task. Gameplay is very limited beyond thing & development on the title appears to have completely stalled. Not worth purchasing until closer to release.			"

								I love the graphics and the concept, but the user interface is too complicated.  Too many m enus and too many buttons to push.  A few suggestions that might make the game easier to play...maybe some of them are already into the game, but I couldnt get far enough to find them.  I only played for about 5 hours but couldnt seem to make much progress.1) Pressing space bar everytime you want to move the camera is a pain.  Scrolling could be accomplished more easily by moving the mouse cursor to the edges of the screen.  Camera rotation should be as simple as pressing the right mouse button and moving the mouse.2) Too many menu options make it difficult to wrap ones head around the game.  For example, there are two build options. Each build option has its own menus.  Why not put them all under the same menu, and order them from simple to more complex.  Its the same with mining.    There is mining for the ground, and then a mining menu for mining cliffs.  It would be easier to put them all under the same menu.3) Creating tasks can be really fun, but not for simple things like harvesting wood.  In order to harvest wood, you have to create a wood harvesting zone and then send workers to harvest the wood.  The zone is currently too small and harvests only a few trees.  What would be really neat would be to left click on a worker, hold down the left mouse button to bring up the worker menu, then mouse button up to select the ""harvest wood"" option.  The menu dissappears and the cursor changes to an axe.  Left mouse button down where you want the center of the zone and then mouse button up when the zone is large enough (basically create a custom size circle by dragging the mouse).  You can do something similar with mining, although you could have a couple of different shapes (circle, square, straight line, etc)4)  The AI is messed up.  I dont have any suggestions there because I cant see the code, however, the little buggers keep pausing while doing tasks, If I had to guess I would say that they are stuck in a code loop.These are just a few suggestions.  I wrote code to pay for my college degree, and have been designing software for over 25 years.  One thing i learned is that the interface is everything.   This is a REALLY COOL game but its just too difficult to play.			"

								I found myself interested in this game before it was even available on Steam. I became excited with the concept. On the outside it looks cute and intresting, the Developers promised a Castle building wonderland where you construct and defend you castles from strange night corrupt versions of your builders. This peaked my intrest because it was both simple, yet engaging, not over complicated like a lot of games have become. Just clean good fun. So when it was available for Early Access I of course bought it. Now it has a lot of work to do, most of the basic concepts are there but a lot still need to be included, and a hell of a lot of work needs to be done on the features that do exist to remove bugs and glitches and other nastys. I know what your thinking, it's Early Access, thats to be expected.Well... That was a year ago.Nothing has changed, nothing has been added, sometimes a small bug fix will be released but nothing more. I don't even check for updates anymore. They game developers have taken at least a million dollers for this and yet nothing. I'm afraid like a lot of early Access games they have taken your money and ran. This game, and a few others like it have ruined Early Access for me. I no longer intend to buy them because of it.			"

								I really want to like this game. It's essentially a castle building/defence simulator that has potential in droves. However, the game faces problems in the AI and has not had any significant updates for ages. Castle Story's AI is servicable at best, but the 'bricktons' will constantly stop and admire the scenery. The AI is at it's worst when assigned to a building project. They will constantly build the closest block to them, meaning that quite regularly, they will completely freeze as their pathfinding spends time trying to redirect the brickton. This wastes precious time in survival mode when you are trying to set up defences before the next wave of enemies comes charging in.The lack of updates makes it feel like the devs have almost abandoned the game, as in the past year there has been no significant update to the gameplay at all. The promise of world generator has been hovering around ever since I bought the game a year ago, but I have still to see any evidence of it being implemented into the game.TL;DR : Game has large amount of potential but falls flat with buggy AI and lazy dev team "

								Status as of 2014-07-19.Cute game that has immense unrealized potential.Minecraft de-light in RTS setting.Features: - 2 game modes: Survival, Sandbox, (currently editor is disabled) - A few stone blocks & structures - A few wooden blocks and structures - Some awkward quasi-magical explosive devices. - 3 units, worker, Melee, Archer - 1 map (of questionable design)Bugs: - Very few, game has never crashed on me thus far.Annoyances: (This is where the experience currently falls flat due to being an RTS) - Clicking on unit does not always result in selection of said unit. - Drag-select does nothing when beginning on anything but empty ground. - Right-click to move, sometimes does nothing. - Melee units does not always attack nearby units - even when attacked. - LOS for Archers is not transparant. - Archers will gladly shoot through friendly units, damaging or even killing them. - Worker AI, while improving, is still frustrating. (Getting stuck, slow to respond, etc) - Interface is clean but feels extremely clunky for some operations.This game is very close to being worth a few bucks, but as it stands it gets boring within minutes. Beyond fixing the issues listed under ""Annoyances"" the game needs a few more maps along with _at least_ one more game-mode(why not a assault the stronghold, opposing strongholds, or similar) before I would recommend it to anyone. The game is extremely charming and I really wish the developers would give it some more features before it becomes another ""Towns""-vaporware-product. "

								I cannot stress this enough. I am a 32 year old guy, yes, ""old"".

Back then it was terribly bugged and it was a Steam deal going so I thought 'lets give it a try'. It was fun for five minutes, like most of the Alpha releases and I left it lying, with hope that in time, the developer could make this a really good game. I just returned to it about 10 minutes ago 26/05/14 and NOTHING HAS CHANGED! Pathetic excuses from the developer, blah blah blah. He made his money and f*cked off!			"

								TL;DR: Look at games like Stonehearth or, for the brave, Dwarf FortressIssues- Poor UI: The user has very little idea of how to access anything and the UI is SLOW and cumbersome (too many clicks). Shortcuts are a hit and miss, with none of them being mappable! Huge mistake for a game of this nature. The animations are also way too long for opening every little menu.- Performance: This has gotten a lot better, as it seems the bricktrons can figure out something to now. Although there are times where you see them stop and think.- Game Play: Super abundance of gold and iron while no blue crystals in sight! (Blue crystals = spawn more guys). The game is excessively challenging and losing more than a single bricktron at the beginning is crippling. Save frequently!- And the wood system... I still cannot understand the physics behind. GL making floors for your casltes!Pros:- The genre is relatively slim and this game brings a LEGO like approach to it.- The graphics are charming (except the UI).Overall:After years of coming back to and attempting to play this game, I will finally bring myself to uninstall it and won't look back on it. For a game I started following 2011, the five years has been rough on Castle Story.  "

And ive owned this game for 6 months or so... and in that time frame the game has only been updated 2-3 times. And the last one even though it was massiv, its still didnt improve the gameplay.. surely its running betta I suppose ... but this should have been done before the actually alpha release imo anyways.(and yeah ive only logged 4 hours, but its simply been to much of a mess to play seriosly, even for an alpha version.)But atm I wont recommend it ... but hopefully .. and I really do hope that someday this game will reach its supposed potential and then ill get you a new review...

								Long and tedious work on this game. Now got a new ""engine"", but still full of bugs and that took like 6 months to make. I wouldn't recommend for this price. Atleast the saves work now and what you build doesn't just fall off the screen when you load your game.Good potential though if you like sandbox building games			"

								Five-hundred and forty-one days.  541 days.  1 year, 5 months, 23 days.  This is the amount of time to date since the Kickstarter campaign ended. Literally NOTHING has been accomplished.  I understand this is an indie company but after all this time, they don't have a playable product.  Updates are infrequent and frivolous.  Dev logs consist of trivial nonsense.  Sauropod Studios is way over their head. Your combination of few employees and complete lack of knowledge pertaining to anything about making games has quite literally turned Castle Story into the biggest disappointment in indie gaming history. I don't expect Sauropod Studios to ever make another game, ever. You obviously do not have the proper team or experience. Very disappointed.			"

								I find this game to be flat out amazing at worst. To begin with the bad things I have found has been the path finding sometimes taking a long time but that is getting improved constantly. The game has many different things to do wether its from a multiplayer or single player aspect or from a survival or sandbox one. It is very intertaining and easy to log many hours into the game for purely not wanting to get off. I would highly reccomend it to friends or anyone else reading this.			"

								A game with a lot of potential. Mixing the resource gathering and combat of an rts and the building of a game similar to minecraft, there is a lot of fun to be had. I can see this been a very good game in the future but at the moment it is obviously unfinished. There is a lack of direction along with a lack of modes and activities. As there is no multiplayer yet there is basically not much to do. This combined with a clunky UI can combine to make a quite frustrating experience. I'd would say hold on and wait for the game to be finished. As said before there is the potential here to be a really fun game.			"

								Edit 1: found a link to dev stream (youtube)!  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoPV9C0yhD9JS4UqC8sBWcgEdit 2: game was updated to 0.8.  Substantial improvments. Why wait? Buy it!      Deleted my now outdated review.Very pretty, satisfying gameplay. After the 0.8 update, fps problems have been fixed along with basically all of the bugs I found previously dissuading.  Furthermore, units are much more responsive and archers do NOT go flying when they get hit by rocks!  As of this update, I'd say this game is 1000% more playable, and probably the best  title in my library.  And its still in early access.  Go buy it.Deleted remainder of review.  Caaaaause update!

Summary:Don't buy this game unless you have friends to play with, you like doing  the same thing over and over and you like an AI that is dumb as a it comes.What's wrong:Replayability:You have 3 gamemode: sandbox, invasion and conquest which is a multiplayer only gamemode.There is no substance to any of those, you just have to repeat the same tasks: build, defend, create yellow shitling and you repeat.The workshop maps are good, but by the time you played 3 of them, you just want to do something else and never come back.Gameplay:As stated before, you don't have much to do appart from building and fighting, which are both annoying and boring.The fighting is the most basic thing they could have implemented, you place your yellow shitlings where they can shoot or hit the grey guys and that's it.For the building, there is so much to say.The variety of blocks is wild: arches, stairs, squares, cubes, rounded useless♥♥♥♥♥♥and some siege thingies.Even other building/defending games like Besiege, Minecraft, or even Lego Creator Kights Kingdom that came out in 2000 and was already a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥back then.And all of those games had more content after a few months after release.The AI:It seems trivial nowadays to talk about a mediocre AI, but in this game we hit rock bottom.The AI can only go from point A to B, move ressources and exchange ressources to free to way.When building it never plans which part would be best to build first not to get stuck later, which, trust me, happens all the time.You will spend more time getting them to do their job than doing something usefull in the game.Performance:To put it simply, the game eats more ressources than it should, it's unoptimized and will make your computer overheat to a point than even other ressources intensive games never reach.Graphics and Audio:It's average, nothing to remember.Your will ear and see the same things all the time, keep youtube on the side with some music, it will ease the pain.Conclusion:Don't buy it unless you have money to waste or you like this kind of empty games.And don't say to yourself: ""I'll buy it and get a refund later"", because Steam doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ if you played 3 hours and you feel violated and want to get a refund.

Early Access Review
								This is the earliest early access game I've seen so far....basically a prealpha with patches that come rarely and when they do, they are literally padded nonsense that makes it look like they are patching but if you load the game and play it, you'll notice nothing...some game breaking bugs are still there 6 months later....no content adds..oh wait...we did get hats....and the devs have more than enough money to write a game that would be functional but are too busy finding ways to launder that money into their own pockets and not providing us a good game....9/8/2014 updateI'd like to see more minerals/crafting/units/gameplay/ ANYTHING. Still not sure where this game is going, I ask what the end result will be and was promised for 8 months that a road map that clearly told me what I wanted to know was coming. The roadmap analogy:A man stops you saying he will paint a picture of something you will enjoy. I'm intrigued, so I give him 15 bucks and he hands it to some french guy who splashes some paint on the canvas. It's pretty but so far it is just a splash of paint and clearly doesn't hold my interest long enough to call it art. I wait, but the french guy walks off with my 15 bucks to a coffee stand and orders some coffee and sits down. The original guy I handed my money too tells me that he is just taking a break for the christmas holiday;an hour or 2, and will be back shortly. I'm a bit unpleased, voice my opinion, and say I'll be back. I come back a couple hours later and the french guy is back at his canvas staring at it but nothing has changed. Instead, I see he has made himself a nice shiny billboard moved to a larger part of the park. Hmm, perhaps he needed more breathing room, I try to talk to the french guy, but I'm completely ignored, but the original guy comes back, we will call him, crate, so crate tells me that he is working hard but all I see is the same splash of paint on a canvas from before. Annoyed with crate and the french guy I walk away. A couple hours later I decide to check to see if my painting might have done anything. Holy hell, The painting still hasn't changed, I inquire to crate about WTF is going on. He tells me that the painting has changed and shows me a list of things he says has changed but it is still the same damn splash of paint and NOTHING has changed. The french guy is absent, Crate informs me that he went on a buisness trip down the block to promote his painting. Hmmm, should he have something to sell before advertising farther? The french guy comes back shortly after with another guy. They talk and the other guy leaves. I ask crate whats going on and he informs me that the splash of paint on the canvas is all wrong and needs to be corrected. The french guy throws a white sheet over it and says it'll be fixed shortly. An hour later I come back and the two guys are talking about their unveiling of a new improved ""refactored"" version of the painting. The white sheet gets pulled and....ITS THE SAME ♥♥♥♥ING SPLASH OF PAINT from before. I voice my opinion and low and behold, hundreds of people like me are now standing with me wanting answers. Crate answers some, but most are silenced with a quick hammer to their heads. An hour later, I decide to check on it, I'm not sure why at this point, perhaps it's the mentality to watch a train wreck occur, you know it's going to sad but also like, HOLY ♥♥♥♥, did you see that guys brains go flying all over. Anyways, you'll never guess whats happened, that's right, NOTHING....that splash of paint is still there, but now theres another painting right next to it with marks pointing to the other painting saying that this white part of the canvas is almost done while this smear hasn't even been started. I'm not even sure where to begin here, I still have yet to be told what this painting will be in the end, I was told I would enjoy it, but so far 93% of the people that bought this painting, HATE IT.....

								I naively purchased this game as part of their Kickstarter campaign, and I deeply regret it now.  In short- the controls are unintuitive, the gameplay is buggy and there isn't much to do.  After two years of development, you'd think that they could make some progress.  Based on how the development team operates, I'd strongly recommend against purchasing this game (or any other that they make).  it's just a waste of money.			"

								Since the developers are being extremely frugal with updates for this game (read: they haven't released a SINGLE UPDATE for over half a year), yet claiming they're working on it (according to their Kickstarter newsletter, at least...), it's difficult to praise Castle Story. Sure, it's got a pretty original idea, with the only thing possible to compare it to being LEGO, and the visuals are nice, but an early access game that's never updated just can't be praised. AT ALL. I've played a lot of early access titles, and they've all (or at least most of 'em) been updated at least semi-frequently, with both bugs-n-glitches fixes as well as the chunky content updates. But Sauropod Studios just seem to completely focking ignore giving the community ANYTHING whatsoever to play with, or even TO PLAY! So my recommendation? Don't waste a single cent on this shïtty-äss scam of a ""game""! 1.3/10			"

								The game needs an EASY mode where you don't have to ""micromanage"" every little thing that you want your guys to do.  There are WAY TOO MANY steps necessary to just make your guys do the most simple things.  If you don't do the steps in the correct order they just don't do anything.  The game is very frustrating at this point.  Not fun to play for the newcomer to the game.  Very confusing game control for the person not knowing this game.Mike			"

The game is very not worth 20 $, thank god I've payed around 10 $ when it came out, but then again even for 10 $ it is a chore to learn to have fun, if you're expecting something like minecraft that a 5 year old could pick up, I suggest you to look elsewhere, but if you're living on wellfare go for it you have all the worlds time to explore this game and understand it and maybe then you'll be kind enough to write us a Guide on how to play this piece of shiat...

								A promising game, I enjoy playing it so far though there are some issues like pathfinding, memory leaks increasing ram ussage and minor bugs, overall I expect them to be worked out over the course of development aswell as their news on upcoming patches are very promising, the next one at the time of this review will speed up action time aswell as pathfinding for the AI which will be very nice. This game is fun and challenging but what else would you want from a castle survival game ^^ If anything keep on eye on the game to see when the development of the game reaches a point in which you are happy with it to buy, I am happy with my purchase and look forward to future patches to make it even better. I also do not know if the price will incrase after release but it is something to look into if you plan to wait. oh and a tip, two stone thick walls are useful aswell as putting bricks behind your archers to stop them being tossed off the walls when the corupt throw their rocks at them.

But it still takes a bazillion years to build even the simplest of fortifications to prevent your guys from being absolutely murdered.

If the ammount of time it took to make more guys was atleast half, I think it would finally be playable to me.Until then this game I bought 2 years ago shal remain negative.			"

								 I've got alot to say about this game, both good and bad but mostly good, I'll start with the bad. I know the developers are working on the game and that they've had alot of trouble with the pathfinding in 3D for the bricktrons (but now it's working perfectly!). But content in the game is not so noticeable, new enemies and wooden ramps and a couple of curved bricks and all that but in the mean time my archers are shooting all my knights all the time, that makes me ending up with a hundred archers and just a handfull of knights placed at locations not reachable by the archers. So my general tought is prioritations, but on the other hand, it would't be wrong to have a ballista, boiling oil on the walls, workshops with a smith to upgrade your knights etc etc etc... the name IS castle story and the medieval guys had some pretty sick and awesome inventions that's just waiting to be reincarnated digitally, I really recomend the dev's looking in some history books. And a few other things that bugs me is that i cant place catapults or stockpiles on wooden floors, I mean, that's how everything in this world is built.			"

It's been in developement that long and there's been so very little content added in.  I'd barely call it a game, really.

								Pretty interesting game, Its like Voxel minecraft, its most recent Update actually adds all the multiplayer features they said they were adding, so Looks good.assuming you like to micromanage.Not sure if its worth the 20$ asking price at the moment, But defidently look into snagging it on sale!!

								Side note thing: I think this game has a really good idea. I think the game itself is amazing too. I have no idea why people hate this. Every problem they said they had has never happened to me. I do think $20 for this game might be a little too much though. I think it would do better if it was atleast maybe $10-$15? I wont stop supporting these devs (No matter how much hate they get) UNLESS, this game utterly fails. Then id have no reason to support this game if it utterly fails.Anyway.Castle Story is a Resource Management,Survivalish game. You build castles and protect your castle along with a crystal that can summon warriors, archers, and workers. There are 2 different modes right now (Sandbox, and Survival) There is also a tutorial you can take too. Which I would reccomend. Pros: +Great idea         +Characters move just fine for me         +Nice musicCons: -A bit buggy with building (It is Early Access)         -Devs are a bit slow (but I dont mind)                                                                                     Thats all I have to say for now, This is all my opinion.

								I enjoy the challenge in this game, deciding ""Do I need warriors, Archers, or workers?"" the ultimate struggle. The only thing bad things I have to say are the absurd amount of resources it takes to spawn in new guys compared to how long it takes to get blue crystals. And I'm assured that it could be just me, but I can only play this game for about 20 minutes at a time. I get relatively bored of it fast. But I do think the gameplay and challenge are interesting, but I also enjoy the sandbox factor. Being able to customize and build a fortress as I see fit while fending off hordes of rock monsters.

								The game needs an EASY mode where you don't have to ""micromanage"" every little thing that you want your guys to do.  There are WAY TOO MANY steps necessary to just make your guys do the most simple things.  If you don't do the steps in the correct order they just don't do anything.  The game is very frustrating at this point.  Not fun to play for the newcomer to the game.  Very confusing game control for the person not knowing this game.Mike			"

The only updates for this game are either bug fixes that no one even knew existed or holiday changes such as christmas and halloween. It is a good game however you would have played everything the game has to offer after a few hours.			"

								honestly it is quite fun, it has multyplayer (although i have a glitch were my game freezes and they have to save it then load it again, and this happens alot, a dev told me it was because i had it for a long time and they are trying to fix it, and this is only in the multyplayer mode) which is alot of fun to play with your friends against each other or against the AI , it has a sandbox mode so if you want to build your dream castle you can do that there, a survival mode which is a mode were you survive againt waves of corruptrons increasing in difficulty, a conquest mode which in multyplayer non co op is you against your opponent or multyplayer co op or single player is you (or you with your friends) against the corruptrons were you have to try and capture every crystal on the map, which the corruptrons are doing as well, and a map editor if you want to make your own maps and post them on the workshop and you can also get maps from the workshop and download them, honestly there is alot to do in this so it will be a while before you get bored of this gamemy only problems with it is the bugs and AI (which it is not finished yet so it is bound to be fixed)and some things i would like to see done in the game which would be a vs AI mode were its just like multyplayer non co op were you try and defeat the enemy, which in that case it would be AI, also i would like a blip sound when someone chats because it is a little annoying always looking at chat to see if someone chatted or not, and a way to disable stockpiles so bricktrons will not try to dump recources into them as i have had a few issues with the ai going to a dead base and then getting shot at by archersoverall i think if you dont mind bugs you should buy this game as there is alot of content to it especially for a early access game			"

								This game is going no where fast. There hasn't been a single content patch since this released on steam (sep 23 2013). It's just been minor bug fixes and that's about it. I am not sure how many people work for Sauropod but it seems it's a one man team. It will take them 2-3 months to replease a patch to fix bugs including no content at all! I backed this game in 2012 and I've regreted ever since. They released the beta(?) almost a year after their expected released date which was just ♥♥♥♥ing insane.I go and check the updates done on the game every month or two and I am dispointed every, single, time.The release to steam was a joke, it was pretty much the same game as the prototype with the tacted on broken survial and mulitplayer options. Well besides I think they rebuilt the whole engine because of their god damn incompetence. AND GUESS WHAT? THE ENGINE IS STILL ♥♥♥♥ING BUGGY. The Bricktons still go brain dead when they get stuck, just a ton of minor bugs that seem so obivous but haven't got fixed in ""patches"" that seem to only fix minor bugs.It's stupid how LITTLE these devs have done in two years.As you can see from the current ratio of thumbs up to down(6:94) This game is not worth 20 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars, hell it's not worth 10 dollars.Stay away!___________________________________________________________________________________Update(6/8/14)They are done rewriting their♥♥♥♥♥♥code for the second time and it only took them what a year? Oh yeah everything is the same. Maybe a few less bugs. But still zero new content. Still not worth getting. Get a better Indie game like Space engineers, they update EVERY WEEK.

Sure some small fixes here and there but zero content. --Update(3/28/15)Still no signs of any devlopment			"

								For the longest of times I did not like this game, I liked the ideas behind it, but not the way it was executed, the AI was awful and the performance was questionable at best.Now however the AI is actually good, it doesn't take them half a day to react to what you want them to do, they still sometimes, take a second to react, but it's not often that that is the case, the majority of times you tell them to do something, they set off to do it near instantly, which is pretty damn good.I might come back to this review and actually give some more detailed info on the game and how it is and blah blah blah.

								This game USED to be a great lot of fun, even though its updates was SEVERELY slow it was a fun surreival game, i didnt much enjoy the sandbox mode as it is just overall pointless tough. It USED to be fun in surrival mode, however the last few updates they've pushed out has COMPLETELY ruined that. The edition of a new enemy creature a big hulking golem that just ONE SHOTS everything! Your meele units which was a NEED to keep hordes of minions away has now been demed COMPLETELY useless. And it takes 1-2 rounds to spawn one of your own minions! And you need archers fighters and builders. So yeah fighters are USELESS now to the incompetent Balancing. Not to mention the stupid ♥♥♥♥ing ai targeting. You'll be reloading your game atleast 2-3 times every late round after wave 8 because your archer kill one of your other archers! They just KEEP ♥♥♥♥ing killing eachother..So as of now, the game is NOT worth 20 euro. Not even 15, not even 10. Anything below that and its a worth while game to grab if you got nothing else to go for. 4/10 personal score. It used to be great, but the recent updates with crappy AI and unbalanced scaling has just made it a worthless experience.			"

								This seemed like a good game, but until you get into it, its confusing and weird. So, you would think that right mouse would control camera or some other button, but no. It takes around like 4 keys, holding them down at the same time and ALSO, moving the mouse around. This game also wont sell well if there isnt other language support. I bought this game 1 year ago and it has NOT improved at all! Controls are clunky, game is super confusing, if you wanna do anything at all. you have to have like 9 miners, 1 warrior and 1 archer. DO NOT, buy this game now but buy it when it is out of access or if they made MAJOR improvements to the game. I wish I got a refund...  "

								Every update is 1 step forward and 3 steps back.  Developers are fresh out of school, and have no skills at project management.   Some day, some year, this game may actually become playable, but I expect that day will be many years in the future.  That's assuming the developers don't completely run out of Kickstarter and Steam Greenlight funds first.  The only semi-positive note about this game is that the developers are still working on it.  But following this development process is like watching a blind kid trying to drive a car.Reasons for negative review:  AI is horrible. Path-finding is horrible. Now you might say ""well, it's early acess, blah blah blah"".  With each update the developers boast about how much they've improved the AI and fixed the pathfinder, every update proves this to be false.  The pathfinder and AI function should realy be at the base of the game, and if it's not correct, the game will never be worth playing.			"

								To start, I was one of the original backers of this game on the kickstarter years ago, probably one of the first few hundred, and put a good amount of money into it. Not just saying that to be a hipster about it, but I’ve had many ups and downs with this game, some updates were disappointing, no progress in updating, taking forever to implement feature that made this game worth what I paid for, and at one point I completely forgot it existed for many months. But after years of waiting, the game is at a point where I can honestly say it’s worth every penny you pay for. It’s still early access, but the devs started to deliver what they promised with the kickstarter. This game has loads of potential, and a lot to offer. Frequent dev updates are keeping people up to date, and I thoroughly enjoy the game! "

								This is a very fun game and has been so much fun to play, love the game style and the fact you can plan out massive builds or just build on the fly. and there are more game modes that have become available since my original purchase.Don't get me wrong there are still a few kinks, but its great to see the devs actively working to create updates - and who continuously strive to improve our experience of their amazing creation.

								I've abandoned this game for 3 years until recently, and i decided to try it out again, see what's changed. Not THAT much has changed, but there are noticeable differences. I abandoned this due to the AI at the time, but now the AI is actually competent and the game is playable now. The game might be slow paced as they have to mine rocks in order to build bricks, but it is quite fun building. There is quite a variety of blocks to choose from, from normal 2x1 to rounded ones and archways. Stairs too. 3 years ago the edit mode (mode to place blocks) was extremely difficult to use and it just wasnt fun to build. But now they've refined it and it is quick and easy to select and place blocks. No snapping in the wrong places anymore. There also are other modes where you get attacked by rock monsters and you have to defend yourself by placing down archers and catapults, which is fun. I mostly like sandbox though. There also is multiplayer, but i havent tried it yet. But from what i've heard, multiplayer is stable. So the end verdict? This game might not be perfect, but it sure is shaping up.7.8-10			"

								To start, I was one of the original backers of this game on the kickstarter years ago, probably one of the first few hundred, and put a good amount of money into it. Not just saying that to be a hipster about it, but I’ve had many ups and downs with this game, some updates were disappointing, no progress in updating, taking forever to implement feature that made this game worth what I paid for, and at one point I completely forgot it existed for many months. But after years of waiting, the game is at a point where I can honestly say it’s worth every penny you pay for. It’s still early access, but the devs started to deliver what they promised with the kickstarter. This game has loads of potential, and a lot to offer. Frequent dev updates are keeping people up to date, and I thoroughly enjoy the game! "

								Castle Story is a bad game.I have waited and waited for patches but none have came. I want a refund but since I live in the Corporate States of America comrade Ridah can have no refunds.So let me spit down why this game is bad.The UI/Controls are very poor  and consolized. Its almost painfull to try and play this on PC and as of 1/13/2014 there is only a very very basic game here. Its almost insulting they can get away with selling this on steam or many of these types of early access games. Valve dousn't care, they take the money and so does the dev. Beyond that, theres no one watching over this stuff. But back to the game, basically the UI is so consolized its confusing and just really awful to use on PC. The AI also have issues where they will occasionally just stop responding, stop working, and nothing can make them go back to work. Even if you did get to build something theres not much to do, its just not fun.I gave it a chance, its just horrible. Theres only the basic guise of a fun game and beyond that...nothing. I think an EA game would be better honestly, atleast they have to release a full game to fool people to buying it. Its messed up when I can say comparatively to this, that EA games are ""full"" games when half of the content is cut for later DLC releases at a premium overprice.			"

Early Access Review
								I wanted to like this game. It was like building in minecraft only you have a small army of AI units to tell what to build. On paper it sounded great but I have massive doubts about the developers ability to refine this game to a playable degree. The .3 patch reverted about a years worth of bug fixes and has nearly broke the game to an ""unplayable"" state. This game is plagued with bugs that will waste hours of your time trying to figure out how to work around it just for the sake of stacking blocks. Their video blogs are just annoying to watch as all they do is talk about what they would like to accomplish while never really hitting these goals. It sounds all great but little to none of it ever gets ironed out. I bought this game over a year ago and have seen little forward advance. The last big patch cranked down the texture quality in order to increase the map size but failed to fix the major problems that these smaller development teams seem to struggle the most with. Mainly the AI's pathing issues. They constantly hang up and get ""confused"". In the end I could spend the same amount of time on minecraft survival solo and build more then 20 bricktons could accomplish even after hours of fine tuning how to work around the many bugs castle story has. The grand goal of this game seems to be able to mass an army of AI builders to construct an elaborate fort to defend against the corrupted but in the end if you could seize control of just one of the bricktons and manually control them you would do much much better to achieving this goal. At that point I have to say just stick with minecraft. Until you see a tidal wave of reviews saying they have finally made the AS (artificial stupidity) actually resemble AI, then steer clear of this struggling under developed game. Good idea but an extreme failure to polish into a playable game.			"

								You know I really like world builder type games and I love RTS and this game promised to be both. Did it succeed? No but it also didnt fail. Castle story had alot of potential but these devs have abandoned it. And if the devs are reading this dont start typing up a respose saying ""we haven't abandoned the game."" because yes you have. I have had this game almost sence day 1 and I'm still having the same bugs and issues and the biggest one is simply the main focus of the game. The more blocks I place building my defenses the more it lags. It starts to get really noticable around the 80 block and 10 bricktron point. and the lag gets to the point where none of the bricktrons were taking commands and I was experiencing .5 fps... Thats 1 frame every 2 seconds. That is beyond unexceptable for a game thats been out this long. I may not be running a $1,000 gamming pc, but if my machine can handle ""World of Tanks"" and ""World of Warships"" running the graphics on normal settings why can I not play this game on the lowest graphic settings without lag so intense that none of the units respond? Yes there have been content additions. Yes there are some really nice tectures. But if the game basically becomes unplayable after 30 minutes of game play whats the point? Maybe if the devs put out a patch or update that fixes whatever is causing such intense lag I'll consider changing this review but until then 2/10. not total garbage but not worth a quarter of what they're asking for this game.

								TL:DRDev saw I was not happy, then he helped me step by step and now I'm enjoying the game a lot more.It means a lot to me when the Devs interact with the players and take the time to help out.I couldnt for the life of me figure out how to create a stockpile, needed to refine and store resources for building, so I pretty much couldnt do anything and the Tutorial was not helpful with this task. Basically all the power in this game comes from holding down the RIGHT mouse button and depending on what or where you are holding the cursor, the options will change. SOMEHOW i missed this but all is well now.I tried playing this game a few times over the years and struggled with the tutorial and wasnt able to figure out basic game mechanics. Tried it again today hoping to see that it had changed because I was always keen to see where this game would go, but alas. I was stuck in the same rut as previously. I went and wrote a review explaining the faults I saw and decided I'd be back in a few more months to see what has changed.Well, one of the Devs went saw the review, added me and offered to help, he politely explained step by step what I had missed and now finally I am able to play!The tools (once you've figured them out) are simple and the options limitless as to what you can build.Really stoked to have been helped by the Devs and its made all the difference with my attitude towards the game, go sell some of your unused AWP skins and pick this game up, these fat little yellow men are way cuter than your 'worm god stat track' AWP anyway.

								After playing the latest patch (The one claiming to fix the unit pathfinding issues) I can honestly say I am giving up on this game.  It is a great concept and I truely hope the developers see it through but after their boasts that they fixed the pathfinding issues I can honestly say that it is clear they did not test this patch for more than 15 minutes because after about this long playing you will spend more time trying to fix anything that causes your units to get hung up.  Which is just about anything.  If the developers actually fix this pathing issues add new gameplay content to this game (something they have not really done in at least a year.... ( well excluding the halloween unit skins -__- )) I will gladly change and rewrite this review.			"

								This game is annoying had a whole article I wrote but it was erased so here is the short version. I have a 8 core amd processor with a 7900 HD sapphire 3 gb graphics card. This game runs choppy...no clue why but its annoying as hell. Then the crickets...WTF why would you put such a constant annoying noise in the game. Most importantly the little s**t for brains brick heads are as dumb as a Trump supporter. They just get lost and stop working and god forbid their task takes a little effort because they just shut down right away. You need a feature like dungeon keeper or whatever so you can whip them to make them actually work. Building a castle is impossible and nothing makes sense and I have played quite a few games where you build cities, castles, space stations you name it but only 1 other game comes to mind that is so arguous in building and that other game is super complex, you've made a simple game more complex than necessary. I am sure over time this will get better but as of right now this game just pisses me off to no end.  Really hoped I would have enjoyed it more rather than being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that I have no clue how to delete items (had to google everything to figure this game out) and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that building up is the most annoying thing ever.

								Good ideas... But don't worth the money spent for.It's Steam sales for Christmas, and guess what... Developpers haven't made so much updates since few days than during all past year. Don't believe there is any regular developpment to improve the game.My advice: wait some years and maybe this game, when finished, will worth the money... Which is not the case currently.Bonnes idées... Mais ne vaut clairement pas le prix demandé.Ce sont les soldes Steam de noël et devinez quoi... Les développeurs n'ont jamais fait autant  de mises à jours depuis quelques jours que durant toute l'année qui s'est écoulée. Ne pensez pas que le développement pour améliorer le jeu soit régulier.Mon conseil: attendez encore quelques années et peut-être que le jeu, une fois terminé, en vaudra la peine... Ce qui n'est pas le cas actuellement.			"

Early Access Review
								So I played the game ages ago. And then remembered that it was on steam. I then saw that the Devs actually remembered that they had made this game and that it was super broken so they did a update for the first time in 2 years. So I got it.I played it for a bit, and for a while the AI was working rather then just standing around even though they had set jobs and were able to do them. But then it kicked it.... The AI faults started.... From just randomly dumping everything on the floor, to (as said above) ignoring their jobs and just standing around doing nothing Everything about the game is good but the AI. The Graphics are pretty, the Idea is amazing, the Physics work and the models for everything fit so well with nearly no clipping.It could be one of the best games I have ever played, but its AI just makes it so you CAN'T do anything. Can't build because you need them to build; Can't mine because the AI.....I hope they do fix this games for if it ever gets relesed. And when it does, I think that it will be one of the best games on steam			"

								1) This game is not for everyone. The core gameplay focuses on creating castles, one block at a time. Most gamers would find this game tedious and boring (as did I).2) There are only three gameplay modes:-Sandbox: The only thing you can do is build a castles-Survival: I found there was very little challenge in this mode. I got bored after 2 hours. I'm not sure if the developers realized that it's more efficient to build walls at choke points on the map and station archers on the walls than building a single castle that leaves your workers vulnerable to attack while working (especially while the recall button doesn't work properly).-Multiplayer: couldn't get it to workI wouldn't say that $20 is a fair price considering the lack of content.3) I wouldn't say this game is bad. It's just that it isn't for most people and has a very narrow appeal.			"

								So, Castle story,When I saw the game for the first time it was in end 2013, and it was something like 0.1, now, the game is still not in 1.0 but the changes and improvements are amazing! There are surely still some issues on the right or on the left, but this game has an amazing potential (as the dev. Team, big thumb up there) !In Castle Story, which has nothing to do with CS, you will have to defend your Bricktrons and their/your Cristal, against the Evil and Bad Corruptrons, or even other player playing Bricktrons. You are able to buimd up far in the sky, and far under the Earth, but remember, never dig to deep! It will always end bad!I think if Castle Story improves some things, it will be an even more amazing game as it is now like:-Something like a story mode, or something like missions ""save the bricktrons"" ,""survive 100 waves"" ,""kill all the corruptrons""-Maybe adding something like Water-Adding more bricks to build, for big and complexes castles, examples are in the workshop/guides...and some minor stuffBut I personnaly think that this game has great potential and a glorious future!

Not all the maps support all modes!Sandbox: this is the ""normal"" mode. You just build castles or whatever you want.Invasion: you have to defend a crystall by building a castle and defences. The enemies come in waves and you just try to hold out.Conquest: there is some crystalls scattered around and you have to take them all.It's a early access game and it feels like it. You get a pretty bare bones game with some fun gameplay! If you want to build some castles, this game is for you!			"

								Do you like obtuse radial menus? Then Castle Story might be for you! But wait, there's also buggy little yellow dudes that get stuck on everything including but not limited to terrain, each other, trees, and much much more (there isn't anything else in the game). Combat is an exciting mix of either instantly killing everything that attacks with a single archer, or losing everything to a single overpowered enemy that one hits everything you throw at it!There's also many exciting game modes, varying from nothing attacking you with lots of tedious clicking trying to get units unstuck to a trimmed down mode where you can't change the terrain and the previously mentioned enemies attack in progressively stupider waves. Although, I guess with the way the yellow dudes get stuck on everything the lack of mining is really more of a blessing.Did I mention how your yellow dudes get stuck on everything and then just stand there waiting for you to move them yourself?Horrible control scheme mixed with utterly stupid pathfinding and task queuing system makes this game a NO! Maybe worth $0.1999. Save yourself the trouble of requesting a refund and skip the story these developers failed to tell.			"

								I should've listened to the top reviews and saved my money for some other game. I found out about this game in the early days of development, then forgot about it. Now, today, I found it again and though I'd give it a try - despite the negative reviews. After roughly 2 hours playing, I understand them. At first it worked fine. But the longer I played, the less my Bricktons responded to my commands. At the end, just before I quit, my minions refused to dig a dunnel, despite the pleasant words I gave them and the smooth jazz I played for them. Also, the stockpiles I built before I quit were invisible, and I couldn't manually put stuff in them.I'm sorry, devs, but I cannot recommend this game.			"

								The concept of the game is what will undoubtedly convince you to purchase this game if you have not already... I think the concept is awesome... That being said...  If you dont care about things like... game breaking bugs, or being able to actually build things in a game about building... then this is the game for you... Sure once you figure out what the bugs are and how to work around them you can start to get things done... and thats what a fun game is all about right? Bugs are fun to figure out how to work around... it makes you feel special and smart... also keep in mind that this game is early access so things are still being developed... they are right? its not like the game has stayed almost exactly the same since its been released or anything... I really really wish i could get my money back. For the love of god... i will never back a game or buy early access untill i do more research on the devs themselves... just having a good concept for a game isnt enough. The concept of this game is the only reason its still bearly alive and not vaporware.			"

								This game has a lot of bugs; however, none are particularly game-breaking and can be easily overlooked.Sure, it crashes when you shut it off some times, but you lose unsaved data anyway, so it's not like that's a big deal.Castle Story is a very interesting game: the simple mechanics belie the complex strategy the game is capable of. It's an excellent exersize in resource management, and the end-result once you get good at it is simply breathtaking.The strategic learning curve is fairly steep: be prepared to lose a few times figuring out what works and what doesn't. If the mechanics weren't so staggeringly simple, I would compare it to Dwarf Fortress.The price tag is a little steep, but if it goes on sale, even 25%, I would say it's definitely worth a try. "

								A few years ago, they were deleting topics that disagreed with them from the forums, and development looked dead. I recently took a look to see if it had gotten anywhere, and it's really taken off. There's weekly developer livestreams, great interaction with players, and new content, bug fixes and optimizations rolling in regularly.I love the freedom you have to mess around with the world, to create or change chokepoints as it fits your strategy. On the side of things to improve, to me, it feels a bit too fast paced as I like to think things through well and make sure everything's 100% right. And the game doesn't really like the scale I try to make things in. "

								When I first came across Castle Story a few years ago, I spontaneously bought, and got a few of my friends to get it aswell. However, after realizing that the multiplayer at the time was ""somewhat"" unplayable, my friends lost interest in it. I gave the single player a chance, and ended up spending the majority of the next few weeks accumulating a few days worth of gameplay. By that point however, I felt I exhausted the amount of gameplay for the very early access version game. Needless to say, it was still a great time spent in both the survival and sandbox modes, using the unique building system and hybrid resource collection system, while commanding an army of yellow marshmellow men. Jump forward a few years, I tested the game again recently, and was very impressed with the complete overhaul of the game. I had been following the game's developement for a time, but actually trying it out, I was very glad with the changes the devs brought, and their active role in the community. I definetly got my money's worth out of the game, and I encourage others to see what this game offers.			"

Early Access Review
								I found this game a couple of years ago. It looked like a fine game, with nice happy graphics, and a different gameplay. I believe i am right about the gameplay being ""different""...... you start out with a couple of workers. An update made it possible to go into mines, so you would not dig holes all over your world, to get minerals. But when you have created your very base of your castle, things just goes wrong...... When you command your workers to build the castle a little higher, they just stand there in about a minute and do nothing. Then the night comes, and the monsters comes, and the workers ... well ... they die because they still tried to figure out how to build the castle a little higher. That is probably the biggest issue about this game, even when you cut down trees, the pieces of wood like explodes all over the place because of the gravity. The workers can´t figure out to do something for themselves or something as simple as go through a door, or to drop block of stone, so you have to control all individualy, and how easy is that when you have about 20 workers??Now to the good stuff ...The very idea of the game is great.The graffics are very good.there is different modes to play in, and different worlds.The game is hard, and only gets harder, in a good way.An update that brought a new enemy to the game, that was challenging in a great way.so .. not everything about the game is bad ;)Though, this is only my view of the game.But when i take a look at the price for the game, i say no. Don´t play it. unless you want to use hours to see your workers die over and over again, because they are trying to figure out to do something as simple as going through a door, or drop some stone... xD			"

								Think of Castle Story like you are a God of minecraft players and you really want them to build castles. At its core gameplay this game is fun, I haven't done much of survival yet, as I was mostly interested in creative mode. The game has some quirks and some stuff needs improved, such as pathfinding speed. Once you have multiple bricktons working on the same project they get confused at times or have a hard time getting where they need to. Especially if you have two trying to use steps on different jobs, they both sit there going, ""I can't reach my destination."" I feel like this game needs to add more to what it has, otherwise its going to be very short and repititive for people. It has multiplayer but no way to search for players. No good way to get rid of ores you don't want.Pros:Fun building gameNice looking simplistic Graphic DesignInspires CreativityCons: Still has a way to go with polish and game playGlitchy2-3 modes with few levels to play onNo Global Multiplayer			"

								Its fun for about the first 15 minutes or so, then you get a bug where your workers  will simply stop responding to tasks. Imagine, if you will, playing Age of Empires when al lof a sudden, one of your villages won't do anything. Then another wont, eventually you can't build anything in your task group anymore. Really stuffs you up. Looking at the forum, this seems to be a bug that continues to plague users. Its a shame, I know when I saw it on Kickstarters for the first time it looked hella fun. It really could be a super fun game too, but the bug is game breaking. It could use more than two maps, perhaps one with large terrain as everything seems like small bits and pieces connected by land bridges.I'd say wait for some time, keep an eye on its updates if you really are keen for it. When it appears the bug effecting your workes productivity is gone, then give it ago. Or wait until its like, two dollars or something.			"

								I really wish i could like this game, but after 2 years since the kickstarter not that much has changed. Building anything takes too much time and effort and almost everything seems broken or unbalanced. I thought the 0.5 version would help, but the new beams are even more broken than the wood logs where. However, my biggest issue with the game by far is the AI. The AI has been the biggest issue since the first prototype, it is totally broken. You cant leave the AI alone at all, they will ♥♥♥♥ everthing up by placing blocks in a dumb order and they will probably get stuck a few times too. I always feelt this game had a lot of potential, but since the game is broken all the way down to its core, I dont think the devs will ever be able to get the game out of early access.			"

								This game is Truley awful, before i go on sorry for my bad handwriting, english isn't to great. But for all seriousness this game is bad, i bought this game for me and 3 other people expecting this game to be a really unique and entertaining game to play and so far it isn't worth my time to keep up with the updates or anything at this point. I have never seen a crew as bad as this that has taken so long for their best update to be, you can now pause the game play and move your camera around. Thats it.  For three months of it just sitting in my steam library that is the best update it came up with. Not that troops ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ai making them throw logs off the cliffside by the dozens, them nuking your own base due to them accidently shooting a orange gem barrel ( which in all honesty was pretty funny) and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemys that all and all take forever to actually get good fights from them, and on top of all that just their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ build engine. When i saw you can build your own castle and defend i was up for that alll day everyday and when it finally arrived and half the time i can't do any of my builds because the ai's are ♥♥♥♥ing idiots who unless you baby step them all the way will not be able to do anything but stare at the wall and act like what is it you want me to do? Honestly for the amount of time this game has been out, the amount of bugs or problems this game has, and ontop of all that, the lack of work on the developer side makes this game a 2 out of 10. Im extremely disappointed about this game, i regret giving them any of my money to support this bull♥♥♥♥♥♥project that they are clearing not working on, and i regret the amount of time i put into this game in hopes that maybe im just playing this wrong and it'll get better, oh and more importantly the time i put into writing a review about this game, im only writing this in hopes that anybody that reads this will steer clear from it and put their money into something that is actually worth their time.

								Ok so I really like this game however there are some problems that need addressing, bugs.1. Builders getting stuck for no apparent reason2. Builders not following orders, standing around idle for minutes at a time before doing anything.3. Other players being able to unlock your doors in multiplayer.4. Builders not taking from the nearest stockpile.If these bugs get fixed it would be amazing!			"

								A few years ago, they were deleting topics that disagreed with them from the forums, and development looked dead. I recently took a look to see if it had gotten anywhere, and it's really taken off. There's weekly developer livestreams, great interaction with players, and new content, bug fixes and optimizations rolling in regularly.I love the freedom you have to mess around with the world, to create or change chokepoints as it fits your strategy. On the side of things to improve, to me, it feels a bit too fast paced as I like to think things through well and make sure everything's 100% right. And the game doesn't really like the scale I try to make things in. "

								When I first came across Castle Story a few years ago, I spontaneously bought, and got a few of my friends to get it aswell. However, after realizing that the multiplayer at the time was ""somewhat"" unplayable, my friends lost interest in it. I gave the single player a chance, and ended up spending the majority of the next few weeks accumulating a few days worth of gameplay. By that point however, I felt I exhausted the amount of gameplay for the very early access version game. Needless to say, it was still a great time spent in both the survival and sandbox modes, using the unique building system and hybrid resource collection system, while commanding an army of yellow marshmellow men. Jump forward a few years, I tested the game again recently, and was very impressed with the complete overhaul of the game. I had been following the game's developement for a time, but actually trying it out, I was very glad with the changes the devs brought, and their active role in the community. I definetly got my money's worth out of the game, and I encourage others to see what this game offers.			"

								I found this game a couple of years ago. It looked like a fine game, with nice happy graphics, and a different gameplay. I believe i am right about the gameplay being ""different""...... you start out with a couple of workers. An update made it possible to go into mines, so you would not dig holes all over your world, to get minerals. But when you have created your very base of your castle, things just goes wrong...... When you command your workers to build the castle a little higher, they just stand there in about a minute and do nothing. Then the night comes, and the monsters comes, and the workers ... well ... they die because they still tried to figure out how to build the castle a little higher. That is probably the biggest issue about this game, even when you cut down trees, the pieces of wood like explodes all over the place because of the gravity. The workers can´t figure out to do something for themselves or something as simple as go through a door, or to drop block of stone, so you have to control all individualy, and how easy is that when you have about 20 workers??Now to the good stuff ...The very idea of the game is great.The graffics are very good.there is different modes to play in, and different worlds.The game is hard, and only gets harder, in a good way.An update that brought a new enemy to the game, that was challenging in a great way.so .. not everything about the game is bad ;)Though, this is only my view of the game.But when i take a look at the price for the game, i say no. Don´t play it. unless you want to use hours to see your workers die over and over again, because they are trying to figure out to do something as simple as going through a door, or drop some stone... xD			"

								So, I have 26 hours in Castle Story.I have been with this since very early in its conception, way back into the days of around .3 or so.Heres what I have to say:This game is one of those that can really give you a fun and challanging gameplay experiance. It may not be for all people, but few games really are. Castle Story is one of those few games where you can make legendary stories of your play, stories of heroic units fighting of massive odds, or building that legendary structure and the trials and tribulations involved. Its mechanics are solid, and continuing to improve. The difficulty involved in the survivial mode and the conquest mode are enjoyable, and present a challenge as you move further on and increase the level of difficulty. This game may be early access, but it is by far better than many. The development team actually LISTENS to the community, and has made great leaps and bounds in its production of the game since the early days. They started of with two developers making this in there own home, and now have a full team devoted to giving us a game that will meet the expectations we have put forward.Now, this would not be a fair review if I did not put at least some of the problems forward. The ai has improved massively since its inception, with greater and more efficent pathfinding and work orders. But archers will still shoot themselves in the foot. Or they will put an arrow in the back of your valient warrior holding back the dark tide of enemies. Or a fellow archer who happens to be between them and thier target. Now, this is a component of the difficulty of the game, as stated by the developers, and I can understand that. Its kinda fun for me to come up with ways of preventing such friendly fire incidnets, but it can become tedious to micro your archers to prevent fraticide among the lot. Especially once you get further on in the survival mode with dozens of enemies breaking down your door. The only other real major complaint I have is it is insanely difficult to actuall bridge islands, something that could be seen in the earliest of promotional material for the game. with the improvements to the building system, it is sightly easier, but not very much so. These problems are more annoying than anything else, and for me dont detract very much from the game. And as I said previously, the developers are paying attention to the community. Plus, they are keeping us up to date on developement, and thier should be a pretty big update coming along soon that will really make the game shine: World Editor. For so long we have been teased by that greyed out button in the menu, and just over the horizion is that very World Editor we have so desperately wanted.My Rating for this game: 9/10 would buy again :)			"

								Castle Story is the first game I ever kickstarted and why I did it was because of the concept. To build your own castle with resources a la Minecraft and defend it in the way you like. But nearly four years have passed since they got to the Early Access model on Steam - I'm really disappointed what this game I really wanted to become. When I got the prototype access version, it was buggy and reasonable to me. Tried the game again (now in Early Access) about two years ago and it was really buggy couldn't do anything (!) - workers just stood there and did nothing, no tutorial how things works in the game, controls was clunky... so I tried to play again with a friend and realized that she had the same problem. In frustration I uninstalled the game.And two years later after my rage quit, I took time to see how the games is going. After 30-40 minutes of gameplay, I must regrettably say that I can't recommend this. I'm really sad because I want to love this game, but in current state? No. - And I think it can't be better. :(... But Sauropod Studios, please prove me wrong...			"

								A game that once had potential. But over the 4 years its been in early access, it hasnt shown any improvement. The ai is very disappointing because you tell your bricktrons to mine a quarry but they just stand there confused. The ai's pathfinding is a pain because a bricktron will build itself in an unexcapeable situation, so you'll have to either build a little staircase or delete some blocks to get him out. The devs are just plain lazy. They say they're working on the ai, but it just got worse over the 4 years its been in early access.The maps can be frustrating when you chop down a tree and all the wood just flies off the edge of the map. Your bricktrons will always be getting stuck in mines and on ledges, so you just have to let them die when the next wave of enemies comes around until you lose all of your bricktrons forcing you to restart the game.The ui is also very terrible as I struggle to navigate the horrible selction wheels and try to find the right tool in the menu.1/10 HAD potential.

								Castle Story is a physics based sandbox defence game that challenges your Ingenuity in creative and strategic ways.The game leaves you to decide how to best fend off foes wether you build, terraform or prepare traps and defences with penalties if you take shortcuts to structural integrity ^^My experience have been mostly possitive in light of being an alpha/beta. Although if you are buying before release heres what bumps to expect.- They have alot of ground to cover when it comes to ai because of how they often run into trouble and you are forced to maticulously backtrack and test your way to find the problem. - Building has been heavily slowed due to the ai and you will more often then not build intricute scaffolding to finish your constructions only to tear it down and collect later.- Never ever have the same blueprint for wood and stone (has yet to be fixed).- Your archer minions are heinous backstabbers that kill off the others. Guide their hand well.The game provides unique gameplay from person to person, beutiful ambiance, physics that makes every encounter new in many ways, overall an intersting game i cant wait to play as a finished product.

								This game is Truley awful, before i go on sorry for my bad handwriting, english isn't to great. But for all seriousness this game is bad, i bought this game for me and 3 other people expecting this game to be a really unique and entertaining game to play and so far it isn't worth my time to keep up with the updates or anything at this point. I have never seen a crew as bad as this that has taken so long for their best update to be, you can now pause the game play and move your camera around. Thats it.  For three months of it just sitting in my steam library that is the best update it came up with. Not that troops ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ai making them throw logs off the cliffside by the dozens, them nuking your own base due to them accidently shooting a orange gem barrel ( which in all honesty was pretty funny) and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemys that all and all take forever to actually get good fights from them, and on top of all that just their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ build engine. When i saw you can build your own castle and defend i was up for that alll day everyday and when it finally arrived and half the time i can't do any of my builds because the ai's are ♥♥♥♥ing idiots who unless you baby step them all the way will not be able to do anything but stare at the wall and act like what is it you want me to do? Honestly for the amount of time this game has been out, the amount of bugs or problems this game has, and ontop of all that, the lack of work on the developer side makes this game a 2 out of 10. Im extremely disappointed about this game, i regret giving them any of my money to support this bull♥♥♥♥♥♥project that they are clearing not working on, and i regret the amount of time i put into this game in hopes that maybe im just playing this wrong and it'll get better, oh and more importantly the time i put into writing a review about this game, im only writing this in hopes that anybody that reads this will steer clear from it and put their money into something that is actually worth their time.

								It is surprisingly fun to build a castle, brick by brick. Sandbox is really relaxing, and will let you flex your artistic muscles. Conquest and Invasion on the other hand, are not. And with the latest update bringing PvP over Steam, the frenzy of battle has reached new heights. Highly recommended for fans of strategy games, and builders of all ages.Plus, the developers are really helpful, and will frequently stream on Twitch, playing against community members, and showcasing new changes. After the hurdle of rewriting the entire AI, the game has been updated frequently, and with new features almost every month.			"

								I have always enjoyed the concept of being able to build your own base and defend it in the way that you like; this is what originally drew me to castle story. When I started playing around 2 years ago, I had so much hope. At that point, I never found a game quite like Castle Story. While I am glad that I did find the game as it has yielded some interesting gameplay, I would have to regrettably not recommend this game. While castle story does do a good job of offering the chance to build yor own base in the way that you see fit, it seems that it is encumbered with basic issues that make the overall experience much less enjoyable. An example of this was today, when I decided to come back and test the game, which, having happened after an update to the game, made me update  my save files, rendering them to sandbox mode from their original invasion mode. This update has dramatically changed the core gameplay of the game and I believe that it is worse for it. It has taken the little joy that I have felt towards the game out. I will come back again in a few months and hopefully be able to update this review positiviely, but only time can tell.			"

								Let's start off by why I do NOT recommend buying this game.Personally I loved the idea of having a ""GOD"" game where you could micromanage the whole building construction and plan out buildings in advance. But this is becoming like the DayZ of GOD games. Each time you launch it to see if they have fixed anything since you last played, you just end up finding more bugs.f.x.AI: The minions, after a while they become unresponsive and don't follow any commands. Your new game can work fine for a bit and then when there have been too many actions performed they stop reacting and moving altogether.Even with the devs best efforts, the updates have been minimal and at best bandages for the game. (Last update 0.8 - 22.12.2016)There are still huge flaws in the game and some of those should have been fixed even before the early access release.This game is a fun idea and nice spin on both pvp and basebuilding games, for the first hours I really did enjoy the game and how it was styled but a huge let down is the development speed.Considering the early access release date for the game: September 23, 2013, the game has progressed at snail pace and I suspect that it will never leave early access and if it does, It will be in 2035.Wait for the ""full release"" if it ever comes out.

									This here’s a lengthy and informational review on the game Castle Story.	Please note that this game is still in development, and can and, in fact, probably will change (seeing as this game is far from finished and there’s lots of work to be done).	What is Castle Story? Its the story of, well, a castle. You get these cute little guys called bricktrons who want to defend themselves from ever increasing waves of little ankle-biters known as corruptrons. How exactly? A castle (duh). There are 3 types of bricktrons currently in game. The first is the worker bricktron. This cute plump little guy is the backbone of your fortress. He will gather resources such as wood from trees and rocks or orange and blue crystals from mines (or pits if your playing in sandbox mode). They can also place bricks (automagically converted from rock in stockpiles) to form your castle. There are also various structures you can build such as doors, pillars of wood, planks, lanterns (trust me, you’re gonna need them), etc., as well as stone structures such as stairs, pillars of stone, half-bricks and arches. The next kind of bricktron is the knight bricktron. He is armed with a sword, shield and helmet who defends the castle. They have a HUGE amount of health compared to the other bricktrons, and work well with the last kind of bricktron, the archer bricktron. This bricktron is armed with a bow, quiver full of arrows and a sexy Robin Hood hat. These bricktrons are able to shoot corruptrons at range (albeit not as accurately as you’d think). However, their health is rather weak, so their main use is on top of battlements.	Then you have the antagonists of the game, the corruptrons. There are only 2 types currently implemented. The first and most common type is called the, well, corruption (it doesn’t really have a name). They are short, stocky, weak little guys who go for your bricktrons and structures. They can also throw rocks at archer bricktrons to stun them for half a second. They are one-shot-killed be arrows, and two-shot-killed by a knights sword. The other type is called the big corruptron. This guy has HUGE health and can one-shot-kill knight bricktrons. However, he is really slow.	Wood is used in wooden structures, stone makes bricks, yellow crystals make lanterns, and blue crystals make more bricktrons. Simple resources.	That there’s the game. Now to my analysis.	The game idea itself is FASCINATING. Its stronghold meets minecraft in a way. But it takes a LOT more time than you’d think to build your castle, and it really is VERY difficult to build a castle and defend it like the one in the advertisement. Heck, your corruptions wont even come through the front door, they’d rather just pummel through your walls, right under your archers where they cant shoot the attackers to defend the wall. In fact, it is nigh impossible to get a castle even closely similar to it. You might see only one in your entire game experience. That is, however, NOT the most outstanding issue, that being the AI. The AI is completely broken, ironically through a huge patch that featured ‘improvements’ to the AI. How you ask? Here’s some reasons.	Corruptrons, once they’ve found a target (which is right when they first come into being far, far away) will NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER pick a new one until he’s updated through being blocked from his target or the target being destroyed. Even worse, knights can’t attack moving targets because they have to stand still for a second to rev up their attack, and by the time he’s ready, the target has moved out of range. So its impossible to hurt enemies with a knight unless they pass right by you or are attacking their target (which could be the knight). Even WORSE, this mechanic makes big corruptrons completely overpowered. Since they one-shot-kill any bricktrons, knights are not an option unless the big guy is attacking a building. Archers are supposed to be the counter, but fail for 2 reasons. Archers have a TERRIBLE accuracy, and so are useless until you have LOTS of them (which is FAR beyond when the big corruptrons come out). Secondly, Big corruptions have LOTS AND LOTS of health. It ill take you at least roughly 10 arrows before you could DREAM of killing one of these things. Fortunately, since these guys are slow, they come after the much more spry corruptrons already die, so all your archers should be able to pick out the big guys. But thats REALLY hard in the early game when you may only FRANTICALLY save up blue crystals in order to get maybe one or two archers. The only viable option is to hope he targets a bricktron, then use it to kite the big guy around while your archers hurriedly fill him with arrows.	Your worker bricktrons are dumb as rocks (BA BING BAA, JUST GO PICK UP THE WOOD LOGS! I KNOW YOUR SAD ABOUT THE TREE YOU CHOPPED DOWN GOING OVER THE CLIFF BUT COME ON!), and they run away from corruptrons…sometimes straight into the claw of another corruptron.	Thats not all. The UI is TERRIBLE, and organizing stockpiles is pretty important (especially to make sure not to stockpile blue crystals so that they put them straight into the great crystal (It’s so uncomfortable to type crystal)), but annoying. Once your castle really gets going, builders take at least 3 seconds to decide where to put the brick they just picked up. The graphics are not great. The developers are too busy fixing the mess to actually add a lot of content. Nobody’s on the multiplayer. Planning a castle before it’s actually built takes a long time. Because of the targeting system, its really hard to defend your workers before you have a castle (before the 4th wave or so). Sometimes, workers decide to play fair and let a corruptron hit them. Archers give friendly fire, and are VERY naive about it. etc.	Now on to the suggestions to the developers. I’m thinking that either the big corruption should be slower, have less health (or boost archer attack), or deal less damage (COME ON, ONE-SHOT-KILL?!?). I think that instead of making different types of bricktrons, your bricktrons should be able to ‘arm up’ either with craftable weapons or automagically. This would allow you to have more kinds of resources to find, and allow you to have different tiers of weapons. The game should definitely have more of something to it than castle building I think. I myself am a game designer, and so feel qualified to make a couple suggestions/propose some ideas.	So what do I think? Don’t get this game until the developers hopefully fix it.4/10With fixing, it has the potential for at least 8/10Bye for now - HydralskMan!			"

								So I decided to update my review. I have owned this game for quite some time now, and I like the game, don't get me wrong, but there are things that the Devs need to work on.The main issue is lag, now before I updated this review, I stated the lag has gotten better, I now retract that comment, and say, its much worse, worse then it has ever been, and thats over the last couple of updates that I have noticed this, My system hardware has not changed since I got this game, My system is not slow by any means and there is NO reason this game should cause lag like it does, not one other game lags on my machine at all, with all the graphics maxed out, this one lags like hell with the graphics turned all the day to fastest, the lag when I first got the game was very minimal, some points that make it difficult, but never to the point that the game lags now.When you first start, little to no lag, over time, you add more workers and warriors/archers and then it just gets bad, unplayable, and all I had was 12 workers, 6 archers and 1 warrior, i use to easily triple that when i first got the game, with little to no lag, but to make matters worse, add in the waves of enemies and then you can't even control your guys because the lag is so bad, a good gamer can micro their units and take no damage, but when you get so much lag that you cant control your units, the game is over, unless you got good defences and playment of your archers and warriors, but if you play like I do, you rely on micro management and move your characters around to take as little damage as possible, lately I try a game and the same thing always happens, i lose within the first 2 hours because of lag.needless to say, like I stated months ago when I first wrote this review, this game does not show progress, it is showing regression, do not spend money on this game, the developers aren't showing any promise anymore.I know it takes alot to make a game, I know developers have a lot on their plates, but this game lost its hipe a long time ago, when the developers decided to address content over improving the game for better performance, or maybe they lack the ability and experience to do so, either way, I can not say that this game is worth supporting anymore, unless the developers can get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together and fix the lag in this game, it is a dead horse.I am no longer following it at this point. On a side note, when I first wrote this review, there was like a 65% positive review rating on this game, and now its dropped just above 40% positive, so I am not the only person who feels this game needs extreme work.

								It was a fun concept and simply seeing the mechanics play out for a couple of hours is pretty deligtful but your options are too limited, and there is just something fundamentally wrong in the underlying coding. I don't know what it is; it doesn't scale well with multiple unts and construction AI and physics is broken. It isn't fun. It's dull, and the developers aren't fixing it. In a way I feel sorry for them that they obviously simply can't deliver even a shadow of what they wante to make but it's becomoing too late now. Don't buy this game. There are games out there worth playing and more competent developers worth funding.			"

								I had some really high hopes for this game and I still want it to succeed. With that said, I supported the kickstarter and still only have less than half an hour on this game on Steam (I played back with the alpha test as well). The concept is really awesome. The biggest issue I have is how badly implemented the controls are. It feels really counter-intuitive. I don't know why they're trying to reinvent the wheel, but it really doesn't work. I hope they learn from the negative reviews and put some more thought into the game. This is definitely one of the reasons I'm not supporting Kickstarters and Early Access anymore. I know development is a lengthy process, but you really have to consider why there are such scathing reviews and why other Early Access games can actually be fun to play.			"

									This here’s a lengthy and informational review on the game Castle Story.	Please note that this game is still in development, and can and, in fact, probably will change (seeing as this game is far from finished and there’s lots of work to be done).	What is Castle Story? Its the story of, well, a castle. You get these cute little guys called bricktrons who want to defend themselves from ever increasing waves of little ankle-biters known as corruptrons. How exactly? A castle (duh). There are 3 types of bricktrons currently in game. The first is the worker bricktron. This cute plump little guy is the backbone of your fortress. He will gather resources such as wood from trees and rocks or orange and blue crystals from mines (or pits if your playing in sandbox mode). They can also place bricks (automagically converted from rock in stockpiles) to form your castle. There are also various structures you can build such as doors, pillars of wood, planks, lanterns (trust me, you’re gonna need them), etc., as well as stone structures such as stairs, pillars of stone, half-bricks and arches. The next kind of bricktron is the knight bricktron. He is armed with a sword, shield and helmet who defends the castle. They have a HUGE amount of health compared to the other bricktrons, and work well with the last kind of bricktron, the archer bricktron. This bricktron is armed with a bow, quiver full of arrows and a sexy Robin Hood hat. These bricktrons are able to shoot corruptrons at range (albeit not as accurately as you’d think). However, their health is rather weak, so their main use is on top of battlements.	Then you have the antagonists of the game, the corruptrons. There are only 2 types currently implemented.

 Typical Kickstarter game development cycle Guess I can't blame them, they got everyone to give them money for a just-playable game alpha, why bother going beyond that? Development is incredibly slow, and the improvements that are made while nice are not critical issues. New textures, shader and enemy types do not help AI that struggles with basic pathfinding and multitasking. I love the concept of this game and think that visually it is just the right amount of visual splash and cute/basic asthetic, but I cannot recommend anyone who didn't purchase it during the kickstarter support the dev team any further. I would normally add to this that in the future I hope to change my review to a YES like I do with any game that has sufficient patching and support post-launch, but I don't think this is going to be one of those sadly.UPDATE: Years later still in early access, which either means they a) have no concept of the time required to develop a game or b) knowingly sold a game years ahead of release for full price.

Even worse, knights can’t attack moving targets because they have to stand still for a second to rev up their attack, and by the time he’s ready, the target has moved out of range. So its impossible to hurt enemies with a knight unless they pass right by you or are attacking their target (which could be the knight). Even WORSE, this mechanic makes big corruptrons completely overpowered. Since they one-shot-kill any bricktrons, knights are not an option unless the big guy is attacking a building. Archers are supposed to be the counter, but fail for 2 reasons. Archers have a TERRIBLE accuracy, and so are useless until you have LOTS of them (which is FAR beyond when the big corruptrons come out). Secondly, Big corruptions have LOTS AND LOTS of health. It ill take you at least roughly 10 arrows before you could DREAM of killing one of these things. Fortunately, since these guys are slow, they come after the much more spry corruptrons already die, so all your archers should be able to pick out the big guys. But thats REALLY hard in the early game when you may only FRANTICALLY save up blue crystals in order to get maybe one or two archers. The only viable option is to hope he targets a bricktron, then use it to kite the big guy around while your archers hurriedly fill him with arrows.	Your worker bricktrons are dumb as rocks (BA BING BAA, JUST GO PICK UP THE WOOD LOGS! I KNOW YOUR SAD ABOUT THE TREE YOU CHOPPED DOWN GOING OVER THE CLIFF BUT COME ON!), and they run away from corruptrons…sometimes straight into the claw of another corruptron.	Thats not all. The UI is TERRIBLE, and organizing stockpiles is pretty important (especially to make sure not to stockpile blue crystals so that they put them straight into the great crystal (It’s so uncomfortable to type crystal)), but annoying. Once your castle really gets going, builders take at least 3 seconds to decide where to put the brick they just picked up. The graphics are not great. The developers are too busy fixing the mess to actually add a lot of content. Nobody’s on the multiplayer. Planning a castle before it’s actually built takes a long time. Because of the targeting system, its really hard to defend your workers before you have a castle (before the 4th wave or so). Sometimes, workers decide to play fair and let a corruptron hit them. Archers give friendly fire, and are VERY naive about it. etc.	Now on to the suggestions to the developers. I’m thinking that either the big corruption should be slower, have less health (or boost archer attack), or deal less damage (COME ON, ONE-SHOT-KILL?!?). I think that instead of making different types of bricktrons, your bricktrons should be able to ‘arm up’ either with craftable weapons or automagically. This would allow you to have more kinds of resources to find, and allow you to have different tiers of weapons. The game should definitely have more of something to it than castle building I think. I myself am a game designer, and so feel qualified to make a couple suggestions/propose some ideas.	So what do I think? Don’t get this game until the developers hopefully fix it.4/10With fixing, it has the potential for at least 8/10Bye for now - HydralskMan!			"

								It was a fun concept and simply seeing the mechanics play out for a couple of hours is pretty deligtful but your options are too limited, and there is just something fundamentally wrong in the underlying coding. I don't know what it is; it doesn't scale well with multiple unts and construction AI and physics is broken. It isn't fun. It's dull, and the developers aren't fixing it. In a way I feel sorry for them that they obviously simply can't deliver even a shadow of what they wante to make but it's becomoing too late now. Don't buy this game. There are games out there worth playing and more competent developers worth funding.			"

								Pros:The game is just awesome! It may has some bugs but the devs make sure they are fixed!The devs also do streams on the game with the players which is just awesome! They are listening to the players opinions and also play with them wich is very cool, its awesome to be so close with the devs, to know they are there!The game doesn't get boring and there is always something to do in it! You can download lots of maps from the forums and the steam workshop when it realeased. There is also a multiplayer mod which sounds very cool! (I didn't get to use it yet but it sounds awesome!)Cons:There aren't any cons except one, the game is a bit over priced and I think that a game in early access should cost a little less.As you see, the pros just kick those cons in the♥♥♥♥♥ so you should definitely buy the game!

I knew that there is a lot to do, and i know the developer give their best , but in my opinion these dude's are working on wrong priorities.So unfortunately in consideration of the cool idea which i won't deny - for now i can't recommend the game for you!Sorry :-( (and sorry for my bad englisch :D)			"

								I have been watching this game for years, and I was fearful it was another pre-alpha money grab, then when a huge update came last month I decided to finally buy it. Are there bugs? Yes. However the only bug I have experienced was very minor and fixed by closing and re-opening the game, with no harm done. Castle story is a game that isn't easy to learn, for the first few hours I experienced things that I thought to be bugs, when in reality they were just mechanics that were not explained and I had no figured out yet. +3 great game modes+Great for creative minds+Castle Building+explosive catapult shots paired with nice destruction physics+great textures and models++devs active in the community+++World editor, still needs some love but recently added and all-in-all AMAZING (complete with workshop to share)+- Multiplayer that can be glitchy+-Patience required, not gonna learn the game in 30 minutes-tutorial needs some work-some minor glitches (then again this is still early access so disregard this one if you wish)-pathfinding will sometimes need micromanaging when too many workers are doing the same thing and get stuck -aside from multiplayer enemies don't have buildings to destroy with catapults :(Would I recommend Castle Story? Yes, though again, patience is needed to learn the ropes. This game is an amazing mix of building, RTS, (medieval?) and strategy that I highly recommend to buy.			"

For I have seen close to none. Good concept, barely worked on. Lackluster effort from the developers. Do NOT buy this as it is very unlikely to be finished by 2020, or any time beyond that.			"

								I backed this from the beginning. Must be 2 years ago. Loved it, couldn't stop playing, even with the bugs. It was a game in itself finding a way round them until the game just failed. Lots of dev chatter and promises felt good.Then nothing really changed.I checked in every few months until the whole thing felt very sour.I've just booted it back up just out of boredom and curiosity. And it feels almost exactly the same. Just a slight graphics update, better UI and the bricktrons move a tiny bit slicker.. 10 mins of playing and one of them permanently bugged out chopping an invisible tree.Sorry, but after ALL THIS TIME if the core mechanics are still bugged and it feels like the SAME early development game I officially give up.So many great indie games have come and gone in this time.Word to the wise, read these reviews. Many of the posts with both rants and empty promises seem to be gone. Although they seem to have been replaced with new ones. Unsurprising.Not sure if it really IS a con, or the devs just simply suck. Who cares. Just keep your money and move on.EDIT: I just realised the youtube trailer that got me interested in the game (which is completely misleading and better than any build I've played) is 3 YEARS OLD.

								My thoughts as I first go into the game a while back was, ""Woah, I can build anything I want? Cool!"". That was cool and all but go old real fast. Nothing changed. BUT NOW! Multiplayer was a HUGE aspect that was missing. It adds soooo much to be able to collab with friends, build a Trump wall while trying to figure out this game TOGETHER! I was worried for a while the devs just ran out of money or hope. But those small pointless updates half a year ago I guess were actually small steps toward the current build. I wouldnt recommend this game to anyone a year ago, but I'd definately tell people to give it a shot now. MP has really given this game (and game modes) new life. I am glad the devs finally re-focused.			"

								Don't buy this game.I might change my mind in the future, but as it stands right now, this developer is probably the most incompetent and lazy I have ever seen.  I don't say that lightly.  They claim that they've spent more than a year refactoring and rebuilding the game engine, meaning there have been a total of zero content updates for upwards of three years.  Nothing has changed because of that.  Performance is still crap.  The game still crashes.  Save games still get ♥♥♥♥ed up.  There's still only like three maps, and the map editor has actually been turned off because it's so unstable.The glitches, bad performance and downright dysfunctional AI is what lies beneath the otherwise cute and attractive concept and presentation.  Notch was right when he said he wishes he had made this game, because it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ disappointment and he'd have done a better job of it.You thought Starbound was a scam and that developer was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ liar?You haven't seen Castle Story.

This is a reviewNo sh**IntroI'm not going to write about how long the development of this game has taken. It's irrelevant to the game in it's current state and to be honest, I doubt any other studio the same size as Sauropod could have done it any quicker. Some studios (Hello games) could have taken another year of two with their project.Another point before I start xD This is an objective review. I don't owe Sauropod a positive review. I'm writing a positive review because I belive the game deserves it.Pros and cons...Pros Satisfying building elements Beautiful landscape, especially with the undergrowth they showed in a demo recently An easy to use world editor in which you seem to loose hours of your life if you aren't careful A good game to play whilst listening to podcasts Friendly staff (as far as I know) You can build bloody bridges! Yeah man!! Bridges!! Things explode... Need to remember not to build barrels next to my walls for future reference Regular livestreams MultiplayerCons 8Gb of ram is not enough for conquest. You can manage invasion provided the corruptrons aren't digging too much Some of the controls aren't explained clearly enough. I for example didn't know how to use the camera properly xD Some mechanics allow you to become undefeatable in invasion mode, like digging away the island or spamming a                       line of archers, although that depends on the map you are playing. Trees don't regrow When setting a cleaning task that is above a quarry your cleaner will often decide to pick up rocks that your miners are currently mining and more often than not cause a jam. Corruptrons need a way to cross empty spaces other than beeftrons throwing minitrons. Perhaps they could build fragile bridge constructions with their own bodies. The bridges would decay in a couple of minutes and every piece of the bridge would sacrifice a corruptron EndAll in all I recommend this game. Just keep in mind that it's an early access game, there is always a risk involved with early access games.I have gotten enough good gameplay hours out of it to make it a worthwhile purchase for myself. Games as all other media is a very individual thing. I for example enjoyed the star wars prequals (insert unpopular opinion) matter of fact I think Revenge of the sith is the best movie in the franchise. So just keep that in mind. Even though I like this game, you might not.-Rain "

								Edit: Do not buy this game.

Early Access Review
								Got this game some time ago and has made a lot of progress since then.  The updates do not come often...but when they do come they certainly do update issues, add new and useful content/features and make the experience more enjoyable.  The game at start was a bit rough, I mostly like to build up but had restrictions because of the AI and pathfinding.  Improvements on both keep coming along with new features that make me look back on that wanna-be castle I built and think..""Hmm..what can I do with it now with these new improvements?"".The game will be great I think when complete.  I think it is still very playable now as Early Access.			"

This is a reviewNo sh**IntroI'm not going to write about how long the development of this game has taken. It's irrelevant to the game in it's current state and to be honest, I doubt any other studio the same size as Sauropod could have done it any quicker. Some studios (Hello games) could have taken another year of two with their project.Another point before I start xD This is an objective review. I don't owe Sauropod a positive review. I'm writing a positive review because I belive the game deserves it.Pros and cons...Pros Satisfying building elements Beautiful landscape, especially with the undergrowth they showed in a demo recently An easy to use world editor in which you seem to loose hours of your life if you aren't careful A good game to play whilst listening to podcasts Friendly staff (as far as I know) You can build bloody bridges! Yeah man!! Bridges!! Things explode... Need to remember not to build barrels next to my walls for future reference Regular livestreams MultiplayerCons 8Gb of ram is not enough for conquest. You can manage invasion provided the corruptrons aren't digging too much Some of the controls aren't explained clearly enough. I for example didn't know how to use the camera properly xD Some mechanics allow you to become undefeatable in invasion mode, like digging away the island or spamming a                       line of archers, although that depends on the map you are playing. Trees don't regrow When setting a cleaning task that is above a quarry your cleaner will often decide to pick up rocks that your miners are currently mining and more often than not cause a jam. Corruptrons need a way to cross empty spaces other than beeftrons throwing minitrons. Perhaps they could build fragile bridge constructions with their own bodies. The bridges would decay in a couple of minutes and every piece of the bridge would sacrifice a corruptron EndAll in all I recommend this game. Just keep in mind that it's an early access game, there is always a risk involved with early access games.I have gotten enough good gameplay hours out of it to make it a worthwhile purchase for myself. Games as all other media is a very individual thing. I for example enjoyed the star wars prequals (insert unpopular opinion) matter of fact I think Revenge of the sith is the best movie in the franchise. So just keep that in mind. Even though I like this game, you might not.-Rain "

								Tldr: Bad encounter with 1 hostile dev, also had a response from a respectful dev. Review started as not recommended turned to recommended as the main bulk of devs care for the community more than it appeared.When I first played this game patch 0.5 (something) it was really laggy with the path finding and all. Could barely run the game after 40 minutes due to more units trying to pathfind. Now in 0.6 that issue personally for me is fixed, I have had no lag whatsoever since (haven't played for hours on end to see if it applies to very long term invasions). ProsPhysics (somewhat... bricktons may fall in the wrong direction when stone hits them :< )Smart AI (Tunnels their way to you etc)ConsSome bugs (comon its early access, you were warned)As its in early access things are very prone to changes.Island will not regenerateVisuals 7/10Multiplayer may need some things done to differentiate which unit is whos. (turns out to be rather big problem)Hats etc coming in the futurePlaybility 7/10As of 0.6 the major change was performance enhancements and no longer be able to choose what you mine, and stone being removed. During your playthrough what needs to be kept in mind is islands are not regenerativeCreativity 7/10CatapultsBuilding whateverUnique character namesDevs 4/10Staff employed during the 0.6 patch on the steam community team sat 50/50 with me, 1 person responded in a hostile and indifferent tone for no apparent reason and didn't answer my question, then another responded to my query politely and respectfully. When I thanked the 2nd person (basically case closed) the 1st guy responded again with a hostile and indifferent tone for no reason which basically tipped my 50/50 opinion on whether or not to recommend the game. Afterall the devs basically determines how the game would go.Overall opinion on getting the game 4/10After some consideration and indepth playing of 0.6 I personally didn't like the game anymore. But would still recommend the game. However that changed when I had a distasteful encounter with a staff member of the game's steam forum.Edit: The staff member in which I had the encounter with no longer is working with the devs. Whether through his actions elsewhere or inspections of his responses. Meaning the dev team cares more for the community than it had appeared to me. Therefore I reckon it would be a game worthwhile to get in early access as your suggestions would be considered and shape the final form of the game.			"

								Granted I only played this game for 40 minutes after buying it a couple of years ago, but that was because the AI was awful and the gameplay was so slow that it didn't feel like I achieved really anything in the time that I played. I reinstalled it recently to see what had changed and it seems that in that time the only real change is a new thod of building and new graphics, that would be great if the game actually was fun to play but unfortunately it seems the developers have decided to focus on adding new art, shaders and animations, when what it really needed was some gameplay speed increase and better AI, and most importantly, some sort of reason to play, at no point after leaving the game did I have any desire to return because there didn't seem to be any point.Overall, the developers need to get faster at working on the game, and make sure that the changes they make are big ones because your game could be the best looking game in the world, but it doesn't make it fun, which it isn't in its current state.

								Imagine a castle building game where you build dense walls to survive hordes of enemies, and use soldiers and catapults to repel their swelling mass at your doorstep. That is not this game. At least not the way that you might imagine it. I am aware that the game is still in beta when making this review and I can forgive things like work queue locking up, or the path finding of the workers taking them around the map instead of through the door I built for them. However, that does not excuse the terrible selection process, which is pivotal and my primary gripe. I purchase the game over 6 months ago, played it, got frustrated with it, but I did not condemn it. I reserved my opinion with the it's beta status in mind. So I came back recently, hoping that game had advanced and ironed out the problems. They did advance it and supply two game modes instead of one, and some prefabbed worlds, however my biggest issue still remained.Selecting your units is hit or miss, at best. Don't trust the drag select box. and don't trust shift/ctrl selecting either. You have select individuals and give them commands as individuals... assuming you can select them. The cursor will hover right above the intended target and somehow the hit box is not responding. So if you're ever in a pinch and you need to move your workers, might as well kiss them goodbye. You click frantically to simply select them and they die in the process after one hit. It was very frustrating seeing how my next issue is with the recruiting of new units. Maybe I'm missing something, but I've two dozen little stars floating around my crystal... why are they ALL used to make ONE unit? When later on there are only a few stars and it seems to be enough for that one unit. Hell, sometimes I've got plenty of stars and I can't make a unit. It was inconsistent and made no sense. The game otherwise is fine. Not really edge of you seat type stuff, but it fills whatever child-hood need there is to build massive structures with nothing but blocks, and then see it crash down when you knock it down. Not much in the sound department, and the graphics are very bright and friendly. I wish the enemies had more to offer, however since it's really easy to bottle neck them and shower them with arrows. With the problems, and low replay value, I can't recommend this game.			"

								They're allowed to still call this game ""Early Access""? It was first put up a YEAR ago, and there's been absolutely no progress on it.Which is sad, considering that the game's not bad in concept. But nothing works in the game. Nothing. People have reported various small bugs over the past year and they sometimes get looked at, but when have the devs ever tackled a larger issue?Who cares about a new material to work with when your workers get themselves stuck all of the time? Who cares about survival mode when the game is literally too lagged out to respond to what you're doing? I looked at the updates and thought things had changed, but of course, they haven't. They probably never will.Would not recommend. I couldn't even play through the tutorial again, my Bricktron just places the log in the circle at the very start and it rolls off the side of the island (Good job with that one, game devs) and it just never continues from there.

								Im happy to say I got a T-shirt from the kickstarter. I believed this would be a really fun game thatr yes, would take some time to get moving and smooth any rough edges. But when my shirt came in the mail, that was the last exciting moment I had with this game. I havent seen anything really change in the years since my cool T shirt came in the mail. some texture and shading graphics changes. a lot of dev blogs with nothing much happening. I remember actually turning off the feed because I got tired of of seeing their little update broadcast and it wouldnt be anything new or anything people were asking/complaining about. The controls are still very strange, there are still crashes and bugs.... So many times I have kicked myself for paying for early access games and being let down as usual. This game has been a good example of this unfortunatly. I can't recommend this game to anyone.			"

								Frankly, I don't understand how Steam shows that this game has 'mixed' reviews. There have been no changes to the game since years ago, the development cycles are glacial, and the content is not forthcoming. This  game is never leaving early access ( as indicated by many, many other reviews), and honestly, I'd keep an eye our for other projects by these devs  -- they are either woefully inexperienced with no chance of completing a project or simply made this as a cash grab.

								There's just not that much content. I haven't touch it in over a month but by this point I feel confident in knowing that I probably don't need to. Buggy as crap and all around limited in scope. I bought the game because of the trailer. What they offer is completely underwhelming by comparison. Let's just put it this way: if I had bought the game recently, I'd have implemented Valve's new refund system.			"

								DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IT WAS LITERALLY MADE AS A CASH AND GRAB!!!!!this game has been on early access for what I believe 2 years and they have done nothing to add to the gameplay. Each update that they have release are either a bug fix, which they have to fix again later, or a stupid skin change when its a holiday. It is apparent that these developers don't understand how to make a game as they don't have a road map or any idea as to where this game is heading. I feel sorry for those who thought backing these guys up was a good idea. These guys are the reason why so many people start early access as they think that they can just take money from people and believe that giving a half♥♥♥♥♥game is alright. ♥♥♥♥ these developers.			"

								A fantastic game that is stuck in a state of everlasting alpha.It has been in development for years now, and a little while back they made the game better with the new update. The problem is that this is the only update that acually had some acually content in it for a very, very long time. It seems to me that they work like 15 minutes each week because they spent the kickstarter money on being on holiday for a few years. I don't think this will be finished, ever, but at some point they will remove the early access label and call it a finished game.			"

								As an early backer I have to say - this game is a ripoff, development is near dead, updates come once every few months (and even then they just fix a few bugs and change almost nothing). The Dev team are full of amateurs who have no idea how to run such a project. They got overfunded which led to them overextending and now they are just living off of the huge amount of money the kickstarter acquired with barely any time spent developing this UNFINISHED GAME.

								Granted I only played this game for 40 minutes after buying it a couple of years ago, but that was because the AI was awful and the gameplay was so slow that it didn't feel like I achieved really anything in the time that I played. I reinstalled it recently to see what had changed and it seems that in that time the only real change is a new thod of building and new graphics, that would be great if the game actually was fun to play but unfortunately it seems the developers have decided to focus on adding new art, shaders and animations, when what it really needed was some gameplay speed increase and better AI, and most importantly, some sort of reason to play, at no point after leaving the game did I have any desire to return because there didn't seem to be any point.Overall, the developers need to get faster at working on the game, and make sure that the changes they make are big ones because your game could be the best looking game in the world, but it doesn't make it fun, which it isn't in its current state.

Early Access Review
								[Current Review/ Opinion]I consider myself to be a really open-minded person. I want so much to love this game, but I really hate the devs. I've had this game for like a year, and nothing has changed. They pulled the ""We're in early access so lets take 8 months off and claim we're overhauling our earlier systems"" card. Now I hear they're adding modding - no doubt so the community can finish their game for them.This as a whole makes me... Sad. I just watched a video on the newest update (0.4.0). What changed? Idk, supposedly bricktrons are more intelligent. I see very little proof in this.If anyone is silly enough to pay $20 for this game at this point, ugh. I'm willing to meet you someday and give you the biggest hug and kick in your man/ lady parts. They want an arm and a leg for this unfinished garbage. It's such a cute game, and the aesthetic is so charming. But thats ALL it has to it. Don't, for the love of God buy this game or support the incompetence of the developers.[Old review for reference on how much my opinion has changed since 2013]I DO recommend this game, but heed my warnings before you buy it. It's Early Access. This tends to scare a lot of people off. This will be long winded (if I take the time) but insightful. Both pros and cons will be listed. This recommendation will be altered for better (or worse) as the game gets developed. Let's get started!Pros1.) Sandbox. Need I say more?2.) The games art style is unique, and in my opinion extremely beautiful in it's own respect. It definitely makes an impact.3.) The lighting is very well done. The glows of torches, and subtle dynamic lighting adds a nice touch4.) RTS-like managment (i guess). Multiple control groups/ tasks/ things to control at once.5. It's basically a sandbox tower-defense survival game. You collect resources and try to beat the time as you build things in which to survive. Day or night, the timer doesn't care. When it's done counting down, prepare your defences.Cons1.) The game runs slow when you get into the mid/ late game. You can tell optimization is lacking (Early Access)2.) The pathfinding needs some major reworking. Your workers are basically stupid.3.) Workers are basically stupid/ dysfunctional. This deserves multiple mentions.4.) The game isn't updated quite as much as I wish it were with groundbreaking fixes.5.) Archers, STAHP killing your friends. Seriously, why? Stop with friendly fire. OR. JUST. DON'T. SHOOT.6.) The game becomes quite repetitive in it's current state. You start off every game doing the same thing in the same location. You build up a little at a time, fight a wave, build a bit more, etc. Late game it just becomes a snore. Either you do, or don't have what it takes to survive that late. There's plenty of variety in the blocks, just simple character quirks make the functionality kinda... Clunky.7.) The f-ing control scheme. Don't even get me started. It takes some SERIOUS getting used to.			"

								Be prepared to rage a lot. Your bases will get destroyed and your bricktrons will idle, even with work available, and your knights will be useless when compared to archer spam. Even with all that, Castle Story is still fun, its nice to watch as your castle goes from a tiny single tower holding all your archers to a massive fortress that holds siege engines and thousands of archers. I've never touched the multiplayer though, never found anyone willing to join me.			"

								I bought this game years ago and if it was an official release I would probably be demanding my money back; however, unlike all those negative reviewers here, I was fully aware that I was buying a half finished barley playable product because it looked interesting.has this game lived up to its promise and delievered to its full potential? no, absolutley not. but its an early release so I already knew this going in.building a solid structure from the ground up and fortifying it is a very satisfying experience, its like a strategy version of minecraft, but this game so far lacks a lot of depth and that is what I am patiently waiting to see happen. there was no promise of a release date when it was made an early release, the devs have not broken any promises and kudos to them for allowing us the priveledge of an open window into the progress of what I truly believe will be an excellent product when finished.to summarize, do not buy this game if you want to actually play it, that $20 they are asking for is a ticket to observe progress, not an actual game.I do beleive that $20 is worth the price of the show and if I knew then what I know now, I would have still bought it.

								This game is horrible. In the disclaimer it states, ""A not so buggy version of Survival mode that still needs some balancing"" Well if by not buggy you mean it is playable to an extent then yes. But. The game has awful Framerate and randomly lags to the point where you cannot play the game anymore. I love the idea of the game and loved to see all the updates but in all the months I have had this game I have seen 2 updates. The first was a rewrite of the whole game to make it run better which does not seem to be very evident and the other update added the giant enemy that was advertised in the trailer. So really nothing has been added and this is very disappointing. Oh and a god awful feature is that your archers will shoot each other if an enemy is infront of them. They have no decent AI in this game.			"

								It's a cool game and has some interesting elements of construction and tower defense. It does, however, have a list of impressively irritating AI issues. They are not so much specific things that do not work, but rather most of the typical commands regularly do NOT work and the worker is bugged out. This requires time consuming effort to fix. Most of the build time between assaults can be spent trying to hand hold the workers and fix them once they are bugged.			"

								Castle Story is a game that mixes the allure of tower defense and minecraft into one fun experience. Though still in development the game offers a great experience. It has a sandbox mode where you can play around and get a feel for how the game and physics work and then a survival to put your skills to the test. There is a multiplayer as well but I haven't played a large amount to be able to review it. Overall, definitely worth the money if you have it and want something you can easily put hundreds of hours into.			"

								Bad AI, thats all folks, the game has some terrible AI. units get lost wen trying to build stuff, the building mechanic itself is limited and awkward, and units will kill themself from friendly fire, i got like 3 archers and 4 warriors against 3 corruptrons... the archers hit the warrios by accident, killing them, then they miss every shot they shot against the corrruptros, then the corruptrons kill them... a very frustating moment guys, dont buy.besides, the updates are very slow, very very slow, like... 2 updates every 6 monts, and shity updates too! like ♥♥♥♥ing hats from halloween or a ♥♥♥♥ing christmas tree... are you serius??? make the game better instead of ♥♥♥♥ing useless crap!!!i believe this is a great idea and concept for a videogame in hands of a bad developer.After the developer comment:-so they told me to send them a e-mail telling them the issues whit the game, i belive thats not necessary, they already know what to fix.- about the friendly fire, they told me to put my archers in a specific location to prevent that, thats just ignore the problem instead of fixing it.-and they told me to be patient, it takes time to fix a game, you know? i agree in that, it takes a lot of time and EFFORT to fix a game, but come on,  i own the game since 27 of nov. 2013  and i still have the same issues, how much time do i need to wait in order to enjoy the game? sorry, but the game its a broken mess and is not worth your time, at least for now, we'll see in the future how it goes (in like 6 years by the looks of it).

								Another update, and the on-going disaster continues. The new version is yet another step backwards. Invasion is just awful now. You must actually mine the stone itself, which sounds like a good idea until you consider the following:1. Mining speed2. Wave speed3. Unit speed 4. Atrocious pathfinding5. Rate of acquiring new units6. unit strength7. your patience to deal with years of sub-par developmentIn previous iterations usually very soon after a unit died you'd be able to replace them, you need to. Otherwise invasion isn't remotely fair. The waves get bigger and bigger and if your forces get smaller and smaller it's inevitable that you're going to die. With the new setup, you're lucky to last even a few waves on normal. No idea if they've fixed the performance associated with waves 9+ since it's difficult to last that long. You are given 4 workers to start. You send 2 to mine, and 2 to build and chop down a few trees to get started. By the first wave, you can barely have any stone at all, let alone units. By wave 2, you might have the start of a small section of wall. You usually have not gotten additional units by this point. By Wave 7 I had something resembling a box, but I'd only managed to get an additional 4 units by that point. Wave 7 consisted of something like 10 of those rock throwing enemies + big ones that one shot your melee units. Archers are useless against the rock throwers as any wall, etc that they are one, they're immediately knocked off of and the melee guys are one shotted by the big enemies. You're already outnumbered and your forces are pretty useless. The devs don't even remotely understand the concept of balance. They'll cry a sob story about it being early release, but after this long, I can't say that I ever expect this to turn into a finished product, let alone a good finished product. The UI is becoming unwieldy and awful. Constant changes, none for the better, make it confusing and time consuming to set anything up.			"

								Uh yes, it is a fun game I can see it getting repetitive though, but it is fun. The only really bothersome thing is that its so hard to play multiplayer with friends. Unlike mindcraft and terarria which make multiplayer with friends easy, castle story is so much harder to set up mutiplayer and I actaully havn't done it, I've read online of few people who have. However we have to remember this is in Alpha stages and is early access, so there is alot of room  for improvement and hopefully the developers take advantage of that.			"

								2/02/2014TL;DR: Incomplete, bugs, steep learning curve, castle building fun but needs polish!An interesting castle building simulation game, where you hand build your castles block by block from the ground up.First Impressions: Survival Mode (Sandox wasn't playable at the time)1. God Damn IT!!!! Why aren't you minions WORKING!!!! Seriously at this point the AI is a killer. Some things it does well, others you have to manually solve for yourself, thus the second impression...2. Steep Learning Curve, you need to trouble shoot why your minions won't/can't build your castle. Hard to do if you haven't learnt the intricate steps your workers do to build things.3. Friendly Fire, basically your hard earn archers decide to kill each other!!!But after figuring out how to trouble shoot the AI problems, it is a fun game. Expect atleast 1 hr of frustration figuring out the controls.This is a game in early developement, and what they have is ""fun"" but very much incomplete and needs more work, polish and consistent updates to consider buying.Happy Building :)			"

								Throughout the ages I've been more prone to pay Real Time Strategy (RTS) games.  However with the birth of ""Sandbox"" games I find myself seeking that desired game to have the RTS style with a sandbox methodology.  This game definitly has the possibility of becoming one of those games that I can truly enjoy.  Although I do find myself getting board with the mundain of waiting for the mining of enough resources to get more units I do find this game enjoyable.  There is definilte room for improvement, so if you feel like playing a very interesting game with a RTS sandboxy feel go for it, however from my position I would say hold on and wait a bit until they get more updates for this game, as the game play can get ""boring"" at times.

								I have been following this game for a while.  I just recently switched to PC gaming and this game is why.  I don't know much about game developing but I do know that Independantly Controlled AI is a real pain to program so dismiss any bad reviews about this game concerning the time it's taking.  I remember making a 2D version of this game on GameMaker and holy crap did that take forever.  Unless you watch this game grow up I would say wait till it's official release.  But if you're like me and a 3D RTS with Complex Controlable AI is a game of your dreams then I would highly recomend this.			"

My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway. "

I just came back to see if there have been any recent updates and have a look at the development history, only to find there is almost none.This game is so slow in development that you are stuck with the same build for almost a year at a time.DO NOT BUY until the developers pull up their socks!!!

								This game does not get NEAR enough credit than it deserves, while there are pretty much never any multiplayer games open, its very fun to face off with a friend in battle, the graphics, while cartoon, are very good, the main problems are the clunky AI (JUST PICK UP THE LOG YOU STUPID MINION!), the building physics (JUST PLACE DOWN THE STUPID BLOCK YOU IMBECAL, THIS TOTALLY FOLLOWS THE LAWS OF PHYSICS!!!), and annoying graphical bugs.Pros/Cons+Rewarding Building asthetics+Combat+Steam Workshop implementation (Sorta)+Nice Cartoon Graphics-Clunky AI-Horrible Physics-Minor Graphical BugsWhile there are quite a few problems, you have to remember that this is an early access game, and the developers are still actively working on it. I have had lots of fun playing this game, i would give it a 8/10, Would have all my workers fall off the edge of the floating island trying to chase the logs that rolled off.			"

								Such a simple game with such a broad array of things to do. That's how I see this great game. You protect a centre crystal as the main goal of the game, but I presume you figured that one out by now. Currently there are three types of bricktrons (aka characters) you can make which include workers, knights and archers which blend perfectly to protect your little castle.It's surprising how creative you can be using all of the building options availible (there's a lot) by digging into the hills and valleys around you, building walkways from each archer tower to another and building walls Trump couldn't even dream of. The game runs really well, it's cheap and the devs at Sauropod Studios keep the community up to date with what's going on, constantly adding new things and smashing the few little bugs which are never a problem but more of a funny part of the game which makes it what it is. With the recent addition of the workshop and the up coming 0.9 update the game is only getting better so get it before it comes out of early access!			"

								The game, although simple, has enough content to make $20 a reasonable price.There's block by block castle building, survival, and if you convince a friend to get it you can play against one another.If you like easy, relaxed RTS games then I recommend this game. However, If you're looking for a hardcore, fully fleshed out, serious RTS then I'd recommend something else.All in all, the game may be simple, but keep in mind that it is a work in progress and the developers are working hard to make a $20 game have $60 worth of content.

								I feel like this game needs all the positive games it can get. so i posted a review:When I first found the game in store, it looked really REALLY cool. But due to all its negative reviews i decided not to buy it. Three years later i checked the store to see how the game was doing. It had bugfixes and new enemies! But the reviews were still negative, but i decided to bite the bullet and purchase the game.the thing was. There was no bullet to bite! The game runs perfectly on my gaming computer and it runs fine on my laptop. So I wondered. Why were the reviews were so negative. the game runs fine so the only thing i could think that something was ""worth"" complaining about was the tutorial or the fact the game has been in beta for 3 years. I am a programer myself and coding something that allows you to control ai and make them place individual blocks to form a structure would be VERY challenging. And beleive it or not over half of the reviews were based off the fact that the game is in beta after 3 years. And listen people 3 years is litteraly the past NOW the game is great NOW for you strategy loving people. For those of you who having nothing to complain about: get over it. it's your fault for purchasing that game that was probably going to take a long time to devolop any way, do research before you buy a game.Game is great Sauropod keep up the great work.

								I really want to like this game, I really do... But there are so many issues that hold it back. Survival mode is a biut too hectic You can't really establish good fortifications because the waves come to quickly. I'm all for pressure but the waves come to fast.  Next, the unit responce is super lagged. I can't keep my warriors from engaging the big enemies because each time i give a comand to move they stop and attack...   If you kite mobs around a group of archers it seems like half the time the archers don't attack... The hole this is just clunky. I really hope they can streamline it a bit and make it fun. because I want to make a custom keep and defend it... but you can never get to the point to have a nice castle.   If they could add survival as a component to sandbox that would be nice. Like build a castle and see how many enemies it can fend off.Anyway thats just my opinion so far at version 0.5			"

								Fun concept and has potential to become a good game, but for now it's too many bugs and the state of the game is not worth the current price. The AI is simply lacking too much and you will have workers getting stuck and warriors who basicly do nothing to defend your castle. The building system suffers from bugs too and once your castle gets some size, the ai struggles to place blocks where you want them			"

								As you see, this game has recieved many negative reviews, and most are true, for the game 1 year ago. Now, the devs have improved the game and fixed many game-breaking bugs, and the game itself is quite playable and enjoyable. We are on 0.7 and the devs have been rolling out patches and bug fixes quite regulary over the last couple weeks. It may not update like Keen Software House, but it is almost nowadays. Buy it!			"

								This game had a ton of potential when it first released as an Early Access title. The concept of building castles, defending them, and letting your creativity flow was attractive - at first. Over the years the game hasn't changed much. I try to plug in an hour or two from time to time to see how the game has progressed and it simply has not, it feels like it has been abandoned (even though it hasn't been). The updates are often hotfiixes and backend work. Long story short - I can't recommend this (yet).			"

Early Access Review
								This game is dead.  Its promised blend of building and strategy looked great, but no doubt the rotting corpse of this one will join the towering pile of unfinished sandbox games that will be Steam's legacy in the genre.For some, Early Access has come to mean ""take the money and run"".  I don't think that is the case here.  This game's history has followed the theme ""we bit off more than we could chew, and made promises we couldn't keep.""  After nearly TWO YEARS, the game has progressed hardly at all, and is only marginally more playable than it was several patches ago.  Perhaps it will be finished one fine day, but it would be foolish to wager money on the proposition at this point.The game features a team of tiny yellow people that follow your orders, which involve mainly gathering supplies, building simple bock structures, and defending those structures. The problems with the game are simple.* The pathfinding is strange and sometimes fails, getting your minion stuck somewhere between where they started and where you told them to go. Sometimes this leads to looping behavior. Pathfinding problems increase exponentially if you create structures of any non-trivial complexity. Creating systems of stairs and layers of fortifications eventually causes your minions to freeze and become useless.* The game has virtually no content. You can chop trees and mine, and build blocks. You can build a few very basic structures, which are periodically attacked by roving bad guys. The enemies are uniform and boring. Terrain is unrelieved grass and identical trees.			"

								The game itself looked promising when I first saw it on steam, which was around the time of release. I played it for a small bit back then and thought it had great potential. I recently came back to it to see if it has improved and so far not much that I have seen is actually new or innovative. The game still looks promising, but in its current state it doesn't seem like a game to purchase to play outright, only to support. Just my opinion of it; wait a bit for it to improve and grow as this does seem like a good game in the future.			"

								A good idea, with a lot of potential. And then a minor amount of game, that qualifies as a 'tech demo'. Of course, it takes time to make a game, and early access games can start close to the pre-alpha state, but this is quite bare.However, this game has been 'released' as early access over two years ago, after being in development (Kickstarter) for a year before that. Almost no content has been added in these THREE YEARS, and they mainly focus on improving or fixing tiny details.This seems like a blatant moneygrab if anything. Not recommended. Actually; the Kickstarter backers should sue.			"

								This game is awesome! If you like dwarf fortress but its too complicated for you or you just don't like to play ascii, this is a very good alternative! This game also features multiplayer, so you can finally show who's the better dwarf man to your friends!It's like a version of DF for kids because of the art style. Even though the games are very different in terms of mechanics, in terms of feel they are pretty much the same. You've got your dwarves Bricktrons, the building blocks, the catapults, and much more things that you will most likely find back in dwarf fortress. It is a very ""game"" centric game compared to DF because you do much more in terms of fighting and less in terms of managing, making sure everyone is not missing their sock(s) etc.Even not compared to DF this is a very fun game where you get to create your own castle and play a medival style game.I got this game a while ago and patiently waited for the dev's to update the game, I am not dissapointed. Even though it's updated pretty slowly, it is getting updated, and to me, that's what matters.			"

								Though it is in Early Access, this game is fantastic! You are able to implement your own designs in the game to make the castle the way you want it. It is easy to learn, and fun to play. I honestly cannot wait for the full release of this game because, though it may take them a wee bit to update, the content they add in when they do is brilliant! What i would like to see fixed however, is the invisible blocks that force you to build around them after you've destroyed the blocks that were there. But, overall, i love cute little bundles of joy, i love designing my own castle, and i love the feel of this game. 9/10 for me at the moment :)			"

								Alright, so here is probably going to be my longest review, TL;DR Dont listen to those negitive reviews about slow development and game breaking bugs. The development LOOKS slow, but its also picked up in pace, its just that they are relasing in bigger chuncks and never really any small stuffs.Going to keep editing this review to keep it currentOn to the main review!Very, VERY good game and getting better. My ONLY issue with it is that currently multithreading is not supported, but soon they will work on that. And all their promises are coming, just not instantly, gotta have patience. That means in later rounds you start suffering lag. No matter, wait a year or so and then multithreading will be availible.Building castles here is very fun indeed. Other games like stronghold crusader 2 do a poor job at it and don't require much strategy. Stronghold 2 does it better, but nevertheless you are still limited, prefabs only for towers and such. Here, you can build a half wall half tower like thing that is nearly impossible to capture due to super clever designs and such. Making it hard to get to the other side of the wall is easy, making it hard to capture the top of the wall is hard, but dooable. Fun to watch my enemies (Other players sometimes :D ) send in 10 times as many men to assault my walls, but find themselves in a kill pit with my archers above them raining arrows down :D "

								This game is / was literally a scam. The developers got something like a million dollars on their kickstarter and said it would be done in a year. 2 years later next to no work has been done on this game. Almost no features have actually been added. The game is still extremely buggy. The only ""work"" that has sort of been done is the GUI has been messed around with. The devs took the money and ran.AVOID AT ALL COSTSSCAM / 10			"

								I enjoy playing castle story, however as with many other early access games there is still work to be done. The survival mode gameplay has the potential to be really fun however at the moment it becomes repetitive very quickly, The game itself looks nice and is complemented by a decent soundtrack. When you consider it is early access i'd reccomend picking it up now/when its on sale, playing it for 2/3 hours and then leave it until more updates are made.Pros -Nice ConceptEasy to use build systemVisuals and Audio Cons -Lacks hours of gameplayLack of choice when building6/10 but could be a 7/8 when released as a full game.

								This is a nice game. I have no idea what i'm doing, but it's nice. It's kinda like minecraft, so if you like minecraft you might like this. But it is a little buggy, and the AI still need some work. You spend like an half an hour trying to figure out what's going on, then an hour or more building your castle, and then... I don't know, maybe start a new? If you have a short attention span like me your pretty screwed. The Gathering of Resources and building takes forever, but then again I make like four Great Wall of China's around the Blue Crystal thingy that you start off by, the thingy were you span other little fat yellow guys, and have a massive pile of stuff in the center around the Blue Crystal thingy. This game needs some birds, like Cyanistes caeruleus or Carpodacus erythrinus or like a Pterodactylus antiquus.  "

								It's evident the game isn't complete. It's evident that it can be tedious at times. This is my fourth time playing this game. The first three times barely covered two hours of game time. I was frustrated by the setup, aggravated with the lack of a tutorial and generally regretting buying this game.I decided to load it up tonight and jumped into Survival Mode. I know. Suicidal idea, given I suck on sandbox, right? Well surprisingly, I actually pick up the game better. I fail the first time and restart. This time, I was able to create a working base. For the first 15 waves or so I'm barely holding on, even getting down to three workers at one point. Then, I start using what I learned from playing around, and now I'm actually sending out soldiers outside the three walls and started to push them back. I had to admit, I was pleased with my progress...Less pleased that it's now 4:30 AM and I finally realize ""I should probably stop playing now"". I played for five hours straight, more than twice my first three playthroughs.TLDR: There's problems with the game. As expected, given it's early access. It's a bit of a learning curve. However, if you can beat the curve and get yourself organized, you're in for a treat, especially if you're into the micromanagement aspect. There are a few bugs (I get really ticked when trying to get my guys not to build parts before they can finish the rest of a section; sometimes they get cut off when they do). I'm of the hope as they work on the game, those bugs will be ironed out. Regardless, I'm giving this another shot and I'm hopeful that this time, I can get into it better.			"

								Hello all, I feel that after 400 hrs of playing this game I am qualified to give a realaistic review of this game.  does it have bugs? yup lots.  but that being said it is very playable and fun you need to understand what type of game it really is.  its not a fast paced game by any streach.  but if you love castle building this is what you have been waiting for. Even in the state it is now I love it.  I do feel the Devs are takeing a long time to do things... but as slow as it is, it is moving along. i believe this game will continue to move along and get beter and beter for 20 bucks well worth the money...  you should see the caslte I have build with the new huge map they just added!!!!

								I really recomend this game for its advanced gameplay mechanics and the gameplay itself! have little yellow workers build your own castle on a series of floating islands! who doesn't want to do that? also, the fact that you can choose to be able to break your landscape and live free of any enemies, or you can choose to be unable to dig, and live in fear of the evil corruptrons, of which you can choose to huddle in your castle and hope they dont completely destroy you, or fight back and take a stand! Anyways, I really hope they get the map creator back up! That is another feature I love! I give this game a 8/10, the only downside being the hard-to-learn controls and the bugs. I hope they fix all the bugs soon!			"

On Survival you defend against waves of baddies and in Sandbox you just build without worry. There are some pathing bugs and such but nothing that is a deal breaker as I have had worse on full versions. I really enjoy it and boot it up regularly.			"

								Castle story is a really good game, I love the building aspect of it the most because it really puts your mind to the test to find the best fortification. As this game is still unfinished I can see a lot of potential for story and future gameplay options.This game is like a combination of Minecraft, Tower Defense and a building simulator, and it is that combination that really drew me to it, I have always been a fan of lego, minecraft and anything where I can build freely, I also love to be able to build structures and see how much they can take before giving in.As for gameplay mechanics, the camera adjustment in game was a little tough to get used to at first, but I got used to it relatively fast, the graphics are smooth and lighting is really nice, there have been some issues with the characters in game not responding to a command every now and then and that has resulted in a few deaths, but that was a rare occurance.my final thoughts are if you like minecraft, lego, defence games or if you want to try something new and cool then get this game, you can't go wrong.

								Okay to the reveiwers comparing this game to other game companies. This is Sauropods first game! Do not compare it to Introversion, they have made several games before and know how game coding works. When you have a new company, like Sauropod, its hard to get out of the starting gate. As being their first game, i expected long overdue updates, and this game is starting to go in a direction they need it to go. Yes, the AI are still dumb as bricks, even in the new update. but the Sauropod team are doing there best, so cut them some slack and stop comparing them to other companies that have many games released. I find myself coming back because this game is special to me, it has a certain mechanic i like. I like watching my archers stand on towers while shooting death down to my enemies. I purposely build a tower the wrong way just to see it fall to see how the physics engine runs. This game is really fun to play, we just have to keep our minds open to what we are playing. As for me i am standing by this game and its' developers and i hope for even better content in the future! Keep going Sauropod!			"

								Great Game with a fantastic idea for a game that has the potential for long, interesting gameplay, but it just hasnt had the updates it needs to realize its full potential. It's fun enough for an early access game, and hopefully in the futureit will be a great in-depth full game.			"

Early Access Review
								Before I start, don't let my play time fool you.  I purchased and played Castle Story long before I got a Steam key for it.  It seems updates hit Steam before anywhere else (for most indie games) so I like to grab the Steam keys for my early access games whenever I can.That said, let's talk about Castle Story!  It's full of bugs, saves go corrupt once in a while, and you'll pull your hair out sometimes trying to figure out why the hell your guys aren't doing what you tell them.  Sounds bad eh?  It isn't...Aside from the bugs, which should be expected in any early access game, Castle Story is a solid game that brings you everything it promises.  The developers are very active and seem to care about wanting to both improve and finish the game, which is always a risk when you’re talking early access.  The game itself can be a little frustrating at times.  At the moment the AI system is pretty broken.  This can leave your little yellow guys sometimes sitting around picking their noses, even though you just told them to do something.  The mess is simply due to the poor way the AI was initially designed.  That said, the developers are working on a complete rebuild of the AI system so we’ll definitely see improvements in this department soon.Construction in this game is pretty lacking, but you don’t notice it.  You’ve got about 5 different blocks your people can use to build walls and structures with and that’s all you really need.  I’ve had some really good “castle” builds with just those basic blocks.  I have every reason to expect them to add a few more blocks to the game, like maybe some angled ones, but you don’t really miss having them when you’re playing.  The pre-construction “blueprint” style of building is also extremely useful.  You can plan out your structures before you even lay the first brick, or change the design on the fly.The biggest frustration I have with the game, aside from the broken AI, is the falling trees.  I absolutely love how they have trees incorporated.  They get cut down, fall over, break into logs, but then it all goes wrong...  Most trees grow on the edges of the islands (floating in the sky) and when you cut a tree you have about a 99% chance that tree is going to fall toward the edge and all your logs fall into nothingness.  The only way to stop this is to go through the very resource intensive and time consuming process of building a wall around the trees so they can’t fall off the island when cut down.  In addition, trees cannot (as far as I know) be replanted currently, so once you clear an island that’s all the wood you have.  Any wasted wood, from falling off the island, is gone for good.The audio in the game is ok.  It’s not going to be winning any awards, but it’s not bad either.  I would have liked a little bit more of an audio track.  That said, you don’t really miss it.Castle Story is one of those games that you might not obsessively play, but you’ll keep going back to just the same.  Why?  Because it’s a fun casual building game that doesn’t really require a lot of concentration.  It’s not for everyone, but I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys building Castles with a little “tower defense” thrown in.			"

								I have only spent a few hours playing castle story at this point.  What I played I like quite a bit.  The little yellow guys are pretty rad, they remind me of lemmings for some reason.  It's in beta, so don't expect a finished product, but there really is a lot of very cool potential in Castle Story.  Voxel mania for life!			"

								game is really fun and is adicting. just be sure to save. the game has no auto save feature so if you forget you lost everything since last save i just lost a kingdom that took 10 hours to build and there is no possible way to get it back. still has alot of bugs to but i think they will be gone soon. my advice to who ever made this game please make auto save because the dang game is so easy to just get into and forget alot that when it crashed made me want to just delete it.

								Great game, especially for an early access. There are a few little glitches (bricktons occasionally just kinda stand there when you put them on a task even if it can be done) but thats to be expected with an early access game.			"

								Still in Alpha but it is a lot of fun to play. You lay out the blueprints for stuctures that your Bricktrons build using the resources that they farm. On Survival you defend against waves of baddies and in Sandbox you just build without worry. There are some pathing bugs and such but nothing that is a deal breaker as I have had worse on full versions. I really enjoy it and boot it up regularly.			"

								Castle story is a really good game, I love the building aspect of it the most because it really puts your mind to the test to find the best fortification. As this game is still unfinished I can see a lot of potential for story and future gameplay options.This game is like a combination of Minecraft, Tower Defense and a building simulator, and it is that combination that really drew me to it, I have always been a fan of lego, minecraft and anything where I can build freely, I also love to be able to build structures and see how much they can take before giving in.As for gameplay mechanics, the camera adjustment in game was a little tough to get used to at first, but I got used to it relatively fast, the graphics are smooth and lighting is really nice, there have been some issues with the characters in game not responding to a command every now and then and that has resulted in a few deaths, but that was a rare occurance.my final thoughts are if you like minecraft, lego, defence games or if you want to try something new and cool then get this game, you can't go wrong.

								This is a pretty cool concept for a game. I look forward to it being more developed and seeing what features get added in as it reaches a full versino release status. For anyone that hasn't played it before, it is kind of like a combination of Minecraft and an RTS game like Starcraft. It's really cool.			"

								Review: Great Game! Time consuming, Lots to do/explore. But watch out, it takes a couple games to get used to because it is a little complecated. I would recommend this game for people that like stratagy games, building games (such as minecraft or terraria) and games that inolve commanding your allies to attack enemies.Personaly, I love this game. I play it almost every day. (Recommend to buy)			"

								Castle Story,Don't forget the game isn't finished.I love the 'survival' mode, where you have to gather resources and build a defence around your crystal as you fight of waves of corruptrons. If you don't like fighting teh corruptrons just go to the free mode and build the biggest bad.ss castle you can think of. Yes the game has some bugs/glitches, but that's with all early access games. And it's still a fun to play game, that looks great and runs smooth (with a small bugg here or there).I hope they keep working and updating the game, because I've seen some great improvement.			"

								Its not a bad game, it has its ups and downs as it is to be expected, if ive got any problems its the simple minded tasking and movement, they don't place blocks in order and can easily screw up a mid to large scale building by placing blocks in the stupidest places, ive had quite a few screw-ups and restarts because their pathing is just horrible, other than that, this game is actually quite nice and relaxing to play, first time i played it about 7 hours went by on a saturday morning and i was quite surprised, so if your looking for a cool aesthetic sandbox game, this is perfect!!!!!!

								Really Great concept for a game. Alot of people are saying that there isnt enough to do yet, but they arent telling what the designers had in mind that they havent released yet. The worlds that are available so far are pretty limited, but pale in comparison to giant worlds they are working on, or the campaign system that will be the main storyline of the game. yes it has it's quirks, yes it might not be alot now, but this game will be far better then what it is now, when they actually release it as a finished game and continue to add more content from there.

								HiI just recently bought the game and thought it was really well thought out just a few things that were missng, for example i think it would be a really good idea to have a tutorial that goes through everything in the game and not just where you have to read it, but where you get told to do something and cant move on untill u have so in order to fully grasp what you can do and how you do it. Because it took me a good 1 hour or so to figure out what i could do and how to do it.Jedandroby			"
