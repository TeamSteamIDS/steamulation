												I quite enjoyed this, but I cannot recommend it as the difficulty spikes and the game just feels unfinished overall			"

												A very fun game that makes you feel like a valiant Confederate raiding Union supply lines, some parts feel unfinshed, but you can't blame that on the small company that made it			"

												A  very fun little game i recomend it for beginners in the strategy genre, but even seasoned strategy fans can enjoy the moderate challenge this game provides.			"

												Did the Achievements and was done with it... The game is not bad but don't run good on Modern PCs and it's too troublesome on the gameplay part...			"

												 I think it's a fun game if you like the period. Gameplay can be really slow if on foot, but having horses speeds it up a lot. The buffs and upgrades in regions were neat. It's a challenge to save every man in your force, but fun if you take the time.    Maybe it's the Southron in me talking, but it was a refreshing indie game experience.    I look forward to more of Tilted Mill's future releases!			"

												This game does get repetitive over time.  However, it does provide some nice moments of stealthy and shooty action as one controls a band of Confederate fighters and conducts raids on Union positions.  The missions have some variation with randomly generated maps:  this allows for a unique experience each time.  One also has to keep track of unit skills and differences, and the fact that as units go up in rank they also go up in stats.  One needs to play it safe:  you can't let your veteran troops die, but sometimes fresh meat is bound to fall in combat.  But since all troops are identical save Mosby and none of them are characterized at all, you might not 'care' about the lives of your men that much.For an indie game that demonstrates a nice and fitting musical score, and a game about people fighting for the losing or villified side of history, this is a nice game.  For a historically accurate or I daresay compelling experience, look elsewhere.			"

												A game that doesn't seem to quite work that well on newer computers. Not too hard on difficulty, and fights seems to revolve on whether your guys manage to hit the enemy first.Still, could be good practice for micro skills if you decide to go sword only.			"

												very unprofessional game. Many unworkable bugs. But for 8 bucks what did you expect? This game would be the Indie Game version of ""Canadian Netflix"" horror movie. You know those made for direct to DVD movies staring some B rated old star from some obscure 90's science fiction film, or 80's teen movie. Yeah that kind of quality.  "

												At least I only wasted $2 on this during the Steam sale. That's about its only redeeming feature. Oh that and it's an American Civil War game based on the life of Mosby's Raiders. 4/10			"

												This was quite fun for the first several hours but quickly becomes repeated maps and starts to grind.  I really liked the setting and the unique subject.			"

												Well designed. Enjoyed the historical accuracy. Easy to grasp the game set-up  to play. Tilted Mill did well as this, pity they haven't gone on to more American Civil War themed games.			"

												I picked this game up looong ago. About the time it actually came out in 2008. I played it a little but due to lack of interest and most importantly: patience, i left it aside for my WoW-addiction i was feeding back in those days.It isnt the best game around, thats for sure. But i very recently started playing it again and i approached it differently. Playing it the way the game actually wants to be played, stealthy, slowly, scouting ahead, pulling a few soldiers away and taking the time to save each man in your small unit.It feels great, sure every battle you do is pretty similar and repetition is one of the major drawbacks but the progression is nice and working towards upgrading each town and getting as much hardenend and seasoned veterans is fun.dunno if the current â‚¬10,- is really worth it, id more likely price it at 7 or 5 considering its 8 years old. But i must say, im really having a blast.			"

												well so far i ve got to say this is a terrific little game. resource management squad level tactics using muskets horses local popular support and a currency based on reputation aquired during missions. maps and starting details ( stats for individual units, number/location of enemies etc)...randomly generated to facilitate greater replayability.  the game seems stable enough, runs well on windows 7 (64bit), graphics aren t great but they ll do, game play is easy and intuitive. the music is evocative of the period and overall i d say the game has considerable charm. its also a lot of fun!
