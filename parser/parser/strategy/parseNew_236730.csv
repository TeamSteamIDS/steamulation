												Anomaly 2 is the sequel to the innovative 2011 Anomaly: Warzone Earth. It’s a reverse tower defense game or tower offense in which you protect the attackers and destroy the towers. The premise of the game is simple – alien machines have invaded and Earth is in ruins. You are the only hope to reach the titular anomaly and destroy them. Regrettably, Anomaly 2 has more story exposition than its predecessor which wouldn’t be a bad thing if it wasn’t very poorly written and voice acted. You have all sorts of terrible cliches including hillbilly marines, an elderly German scientist and a younger female doctor all with equally horrible accents. At least you can skip all the cutscenes.Anomaly 2 is all about the gameplay and that’s where it shines. The player takes over the role of the Commander unit which is tasked to protect and guide the military unit convoy. You can choose your route on the fly and you can buy, sell and upgrade units at any time. The novelty in Anomaly 2 that provides a pretty big twist is that you can morph any of your units to suit the challenges of the current battlefield. For example, the armored vehicle with a long range gatling gun morphs into a robot with devastating short range flamethrowers. The morph mechanic does a great job at keeping you on your toes as different situations require different tactics.Your convoy can only consist of up to six vehicles and you only have five unit types (ten if you count the morph ability). The enemy towers are more varied than that. Apart from the low level towers, there are also big boss towers which deal great amounts of damage, predator towers which only appear as you’re already passing through, hacker towers that form a disruption field in which your units will attack your Commander unit and so on. As the Commander, you have four different abilities – repair units, launch a decoy, target a selected enemy and disable enemy tower. All of these enemy towers and the morph and Commander abilities come together to create a a very dynamic and at times extremely intense experience.The campaign goes on for 14 missions across a slightly disappointing variety of environments. The first half of the game takes you across a frozen United States mid-west and New York City whereas the other half you’ll be fighting through the jungles of South America and Rio de Janeiro. Even though each mission is different enough, it all kind of boils down to snow levels and jungle levels. It also feels too short, the game only starts to really get going and then pretty soon after that it’s over.The graphics are great, both the friendly and enemy unit designs looks really good, the weather effects and the explosions look awesome. The soundtrack doesn’t really stand out, but the sound effects really heighten the intensity of the carnage even further.Anomaly 2 successfully manages to carve out its own place in a rather saturated genre thanks to its new ideas and interesting tactical gameplay mechanics.7 OUT OF 10 (VERY GOOD)			"

												Anomaly follows up the story of Anomaly Warzone Earth. Earth's been invaded by aliens, you're going to lead a bunch of vehicles to blow up towers. If one has ever played custom maps of Tower Defence in Warcraft 3 or what me not, you'll find it pretty similar. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=294231543Except this time, you're on the attacking side.Units can morph about, giving more depth in the strategy used to blow up the towers. For example, a unit has 2 attack modes now and can be given the ability to switch between either mode at any time. Each mode has their own respective advantages and disadvantages and can be combined with the original Anomaly strategy of unit swapping, and throwing in special abilities such as smoke, repair or decoy. The soundtrack is in my opinion, way better than the original. But then again, Anomaly had a great soundtrack to begin with. The graphics are great, both the friendly and enemy unit designs looks really good, the weather effects and the explosions look awesome. The soundtrack doesn’t really stand out, but the sound effects really heighten the intensity of the carnage even further.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=294883094 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=294661539IF you haven't had enough of Anomaly, there's always Anomaly Korea, the original Warzone Earth and even the mobile campaign on Steam to purchase!

												Anomaly 2 does almost everything absolutely right and it is hard to find flaws within this title created by 11 Bit studios. Anomaly 2 is graphically a gorgeous game with a sleek interface and impressive environments, gameplay is challenging and hectic with good pacing and focus on tactics and micromanagement, not to mention a good amount of depth, while keeping it highly accessible. The campaign will likely net you a decent amount of time, there’s leaderboards for those that enjoy fighting over the number 1 spot, and the now all new versus multiplayer mode breathes more life into the title, while giving you the chance to take vengeance upon the machinery hating humans. In the end, all I can fault it for is the annoying voice acting and lackluster story. Plus, this game would benefit a ton from a skirmish mode, which is sadly not a present feature and would be a great addition, especially were it to allow you to play as the machines versus AI. It is a fantastic game within it’s genre and you need not think long about picking this one up if these games are you cup of chaotic tea. Full review:

												Short answer, is it worth your money? If you like tower defense, yes. If you don't, I'd try the original cheaper (and very good) version first. Long answer, it's the first game, with a pithy little story, hilarious voice acting, gorgeous graphics, and nicely polished gameplay over the first. Each unit actually feels useful, the transformations are genuinely good, the maps are challenging and reward twitch gameplay. The not so good would be that the game can move faster than you can move your character around. More than once I dropped a repair node or decoy to dart back for a powerup, only to have my squad plow into death. the ability to stop your units seems like it would help tremendously. I also just don't feel like it has much replay value. Something needs to be done with regard to multiple game modes and assault types			"

												It's just like the first game, insofar as being a reverse TD game that has you on the side of the creeps, as a commander that controls the paths that your creeps take, the types of creeps you use, and what upgrades/buffs to employ.This sequel offers more varied missions that are apt to throw you a few curveballs, as well as more towers and creeps with various new capabilities. Properly managing line-of-sight and unique unit abilities on the fly is of greater importance in this game.Probably one of the few mobile ports that I would consider a worthy PC game in its own right, both visually and in terms of gameplay. Oddly, it does not include controller support despite having fairly streamlined controls, but it plays perfectly fine with just a mouse (leyboard can optionally be used as well for triggering buffs).Overall a solid and highly polished arcade action RTS.

												Not as good as the original. Anomaly 2, the sequel to Anomaly Warzone Earth is a good game. The shame is that it isn't as good as the original part of this series. Not from the technical standpoint, that's for sure, because Anomaly 2 is a beautiful game. It's attention to detail is really good, artistic design is great and graphical fidelity is more than enough. Even the music is good, and the voice acting is better than in the original. Only flaw on this side would be the UI, that despite being quite minimal, sometimes gets confusing. There are times when it's hard to see which health bar belongs to whom. Anyway, that's just a minor flaw. Its main problem is that it starts slow. Too slow. First levels are pretty dull. Specially if you played the previous game. It spends too much time being a tutorial. And it's a shame, because it's easy to get bored soon, too soon. Then everything gets better. Then its difficulty gets higher, new towers appear,  the game stops treating you like a newbie, and the fun begins. It's a shame it needs more than an hour to realize you are ready to roll. An hour in a game which lasts about 4 hours?  - I'm in mission 9, of 14 I think, and I've had 2.5 hours of actual gameplay, so I think 4 hours for the single player campaign is a pretty good guess. That's its mistake, and it's a big one. But once you pass trough that, things get really cool again, like in the first one. As for the multiplayer... I won't say anything about it. I'm really not interested in it, and I didn't even tried it. Don't get me wrong, this is a good game, but it would have been better not spending so much time being a tutorial. Maybe it's just me, but I love those sequels that assume you have played the first one and/or you know what you are doing. Anyway, mechanics are not intricate or anything that justify so slow learning curve. Everything is pretty straightforward and easy to learn. Do I recommend it? Yes, but with a bit of caution. Bear in mind that it could disappoint during the first missions.			"

												I will put recommended by I do so with extreme care. Anomaly is a fun tower defense game where you're on the offense while playing a bit of defense with what you got. Anomaly follows a story line where machines have taken over and humanity is struggling to survive. You play as a commander which has the ability to move about the map as he wishes. As the commander in the field, you can quickly change tactics or use a special ability at a whim. Upon getting hurt or shot, the commander regenerates his health. The units are not as fortunate and do not have this ability. This is where the commander steps in. To heal units (or to use any special ability), the commander has to put down a regenerative power up and units have to pass over it within a certain amount of time to heal. After a few seconds, the healing pad will disappear therefore proper placement is almost everything in the game. To acquire more power up supply, the units have to destroy machines as they leave stock behind. Other commander abilities include distraction (where a distraction is put down and targeted by the machines), EMP (where the machines are unable to attack for a period of time - certainly useful for larger opponents) and aim. Vice versa, being the machines your abilities are regeneration, berserk mode, taunt and kamikaze. I haven't had the time to properly explore these modes as there isn't much of an online presence within this game. During peak hours there are a few players playing but for the most part you'll be playing the one player campaign. Planning your attack is a key feature in this game. As the commander, you are able to direct your units which way to go. You may further your progress towards the ""safe zone"" in the game or you may go other routes which may lead to a bonus. Alternatively, killing more robot units will give you more stock for your power ups. This gives the player more flexibility and options in how to approach the game. Although extremely simplistic, a great idea for a game to be over and above immersive. They made the planning extremely easy to do (and easy to see the paths) and time stops when making your move. The units/vehicles themselves all each have differing abilities and 2 different forms. An assault hound for instance, can be a tank and be meant for long range battles where it's other (flame-throwing) form is meant to be in close quarters. This specific unit when in tank form fires a lot faster the more shots it takes. Other units can be used to immobilize enemies or provide shields to allies. Some units are meant for long range and deal quite a bit of damage but take a bit of time to fire again (and have smaller firing ranges). They too can switch to become close quarter fighters but each unit has it's time and place against certain opponents. Opponents can drastically change throughout the levels. You'll be fighting a nice small machine and start getting comfortable when this giant thing may come from no where. Some units fire all along a path and do consistent damage while some units need to be shot at a certain amount of times (and at a certain frequency) to evolve. There is this one shielded enemy that when fired upon quickly, will evolve into a very hard opponent. There are ways to circumvent these situations such as using units that shoot less frequently but deal more damage to not help the evolution process. What bugs me the most about the game though is the commanders movements. Especially if you are using the keyboard, there is no fluidity in the movement/animation and it feels like you can only maneuver in 9 directions. The visuals are quite appealing but at times seem that could have been a bit better. There are some scenery issues where instead of having a smoke animation, it will just be plain. When your units do miss a shot or fire a rocket into an enemy that has already been destroyed, that missile keeps it's course and does eventually explode when coming into contact with something (so a positive feature). The sounds are pretty good and the voice acting is suitable to what the plot presents. Nothing super outstanding in this department but the basics are met. The user interface within the game is easy to navigate.Overall, a decently good game that is worth a purchase on sale and only if you find this sort of genre interesting. RATING : 6.85/10Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ScreenShots :  What planning a route looks like. It's not always this simple as multiple choices become available later on in the game Longer levels will have checkpoints available in between to make sure you don't have to start all over again  "

												☺ A role reverse of Tower Defence done very well.☺ Intense gameplay.☺ Good visuals.☹ Feels more like an expansion than a sequel.☹ Limited tactics.(NOTE: This Review only takes into consideration the Single Player Campaign).Anomaly 2 see's you take up the role of a commander, who's squad are wrapped in a struggle against an infestation of machine towers who's only goal is to destroy all which enters their firing range. Anomaly proved you could make a great game by switching the roles of Tower Defence, forcing you to be in command of the troops rather than the towers and making strategic choices of what your squad is composed of, how and when to assist that squad during battle and the route you shall take to your objectives. Anomaly 2 goes a step further by giving your squad the ability to transform on the fly, expanding your options at any given time and also throws in a few more enemy towers.The gameplay can be quite frantic as you manage your abilities in the heat of battle and scoop up additional abilities from destroyed towers, you can also pause the action to assign a new route for your troops or change the order your squad is currently in at anytime.On a normal play through, I quickly found a squad set up that worked and while the transformations are useful at times (switching a front arc fire cannon to 360 degree missile fire for instance), I could largely switch to the preferred role and leave them be.Anomaly 2 doesn't really do anything the original didn't already do. In fact, I preferred the original over this game (both the story and gameplay balance). Anomaly 2 feels more like an expansion than a sequel in many ways and as such, I wouldn't recommend the game unless you've got and enjoyed the original Anomaly: Warzone Earth and fancy more of the same - but I'd stress the original Anomaly is indeed recommended!

												I didn't think I'd recommend any of the games in the Anomaly series but this one stood out among the rest. I only played the single-player campaign so that's what this review is based on. With that said, the story of the game definitely has a much broader feel compared to the previous ones as it takes place across three continents as humanity struggles against the machines for survival and a better tomorrow. It also has two endings which are determined by your decision in the final mission.The gameplay, units and towers are pretty much the same as the previous games with one difference: each unit can transform which repurposes it for a completely different function, so the amount of different units is essentially expanded to 10, each of the five purchasable units can be switched to its counterpart by simply double-clicking it at will on the battlefield. Still, the game is fairly simple and has four difficulty modes that can be chosen before the beginning of each mission.Again, I recommend this one over the others and perhaps the only reason to play the others is for what little storyline they have leading up to this one but it can still stand by itself because the opening cinematic can get the player up to speed on how Earth was thrown into a perpetual Winter. So I suppose it's safe to ignore the others and only play this one!			"

												Anomally 2 best described as a tower offense game contains a very interesting system whereby you create a route on an overhead map that your units will follow, your job from there on out is to moderate the patrol on foot, shifting them between various modes of attack, giving them upgrades, and making sure they remain healthy and away from heavy fire by placing down various objects such as repairs and decoys, I'm quite enjoying it so far! Impressive visuals too, but apparently I need Alienware to experience those properly. What a shame I don't have copious amounts of spare cash. :)My only gripe with the game would be that some enemies require use of a slower rate of fire to take down without♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥them off too much, but apparently the only way to prevent faster rate of fire units from shooting the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them is to sell them for a price less than purchased... because a cease fire function would be far too complicated to incorporate, wouldn't it, 11 bit? :|05/09/2014 update: The lack of controller support is somewhat disappointing, especially since it'd likely work perfectly with the game's system, and this game is set to be released on the PS4 shortly.  From what I'm reading, it was promised to be intergrated well over a year ago?			"

												If you've ever played the first Anomaly game, you pretty much know what to expect here. Anomaly 2 brings nothing new to the table, but what it does, it does well. For those of you that never played the first one; Anomaly is a reversed tower defense game. Meaning you create a path for your tanks and decide the order in which they drive to their destination. And, of course, you upgrade them as you see fit. You won't be building any towers. Your goal is to destroy the towers.The player has direct control over a commander. This commander will throw decoys, tell your convoy to aim at a specific target, repair them or disable them by using an EMP. These items are limited, although killed enemies will frequently drop these as well. You have to use them strategically in order to survive, because the difficulty increases with every level you play.The game has 12 missions. Each one should take approximately 30 minutes to complete. So in the end you'll probably end up with 7 hours of playtime, which is more than enough for a game this size.The game uses a top-down perspective to keep things manageable from a strategic aspect. Anomaly 2 uses lots of colors for its enemy designs and environments, and it shows. The levels are either snowy or tropical and they both look brilliant in motion.I will gladly recommend both Anomaly games to those who like a little twist in their tower defense games.[Rating: 74/100]			"

												This sequel lacks the same balance/pacing the previous one had, unfortunately. It is more frustrating than fun, and the interesting design decisions (morphing units) are lost under the frustrating ones (mostly new tower designs that require very quick response times or just seem flat-out unfair). Also, most of the things the units say are really annoying, and they say them A LOT. You can't disable the unit speech without also muting the cut scenes, either.I have not tried the multiplayer, so I can't speak to that. The game looks good graphically, but I just don't want to keep going with it.			"

												I really wanted to like Anomaly 2. The issue was that the game felt stagnant. Certainly there was action, but it was action that wasn't related to you or your skill, but rather the units you follow around on foot.There is something to do, it isn't just a video, but it felt very detached from me. Units have 2 modes that change their combat style. My actions were limited to 1) choosing paths, and these paths were always obviously either vehicle mode 1 or vehicle mode 2, and then deploying abilities to keep said units alive.All in all I felt like the game had an interesting idea behind it, but failed to make me feel like I was anything other than a bad support unit in a MOBA where you have no attacks and only can passively support your creep against towers. Not bad, but also not very exciting.			"

												When I first heard of Anomaly Warzone Earth I knew I'll love it. I played the GOG version twice and the Steam version 3 times. I played Mobile Campaign & Korea when the games got on HIB site and once more after I got the Steam keys.  Seeing Anomaly 2 trailer got me all hyped out and decided the game is a must have for me.Unfortunately the game suffers from the same issue all indie series that took the step from single player to multiplayer/co-op (Torchlight,Orcs Must Die,Trine,Sanctum). The game looks great, the level design is awesome and the new units are interesting, however, it lacks the feeling of the first game. This is hard to explain since I assume it depends from one gamer to another but if I were to put it as simple as I can I'd say Anomaly 2 doesn't feel as ""nice & cozy"" as the previous games in the series.While Anomaly Warzone Earth has small, very indie-like designed(read this as unique and with a personal touch) and somehow symmetric levels that make you think you can play the game over and over again and try new strategies without getting bored (and in my case that's exactly what happened with Anomaly WZE - and the ones mentioned above), Anomaly 2 feels like a non-indie game and looses that ""nice & cozy"" feeling. The levels, while beautifully designed, are big and lack symmetry, yet not very repayable in single player mode (but excellent in multilayer or co-op). However, if you're not a MP/Co-Op person, you might consider this a dumb down.Overall, the game is great and if you're a series fan you should play it but if you can't get over the first games in the series and if you don't intend to play MP/Co-Op, the game will feel big yet short and unsatisfactory.

If you're not familiar, the trailer does a better job articulating than I can, but reverse tower defense is the best description I can come up. The story is terrible with some awful writing and cringe-worthy voice acting, but that's reeeeally not a big deal for a game like this IMO.Anyway, relatively short unless you're into replaying missions for a better score, but fun!

			Views: 139		

			Anomaly 2 is a reverse tower defense game available on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/236730/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your thing: https://twitter.com/TheSocioPsycho...		

	Anomaly 2 is a tower defense game in reverse style, where you take a squad through a group of enemy towers to destroy them.  They provide a wellimplemented leader-board, which gives a chance to see how one compares withother players.  The story as well as the voice acting pulls you into thegame, which is nice.  	One nice feature to this game is being able to pick from multiple routes in the levels, so you don't feel as though you are trapped.  Thelevel of detail in available pathways gives you the option to build theway you want to-whether it be challenging yourself to a difficult route, ortrying to find the way of least resistance.  	Each unit you chose is affected differently by the enemy towers.Your units can morph into different units with different assets, which provides more options.  There is a large variance in the difficulty levels, where you feel like you have to fight through the levels, and be aware of what you are facing; trying to rush through a level can result in massive loss of troops, and possibly death.  Overall, the combat is balanced, andrequires strategy in order to succeed, not just brute force.  	The game is balanced and smooth, I never felt as though my time werewasted, it runs smoothly, and the story is done well.  The only fault I can find is a lack of content with not enough missions.  I have no problem recommending this game to those who enjoy replaying missions to get  better scores.

												It's one of the best looking Indie titles I've ever seen.Gameplay wise, you still use vehicles to destroy the alien's towers, but there is a twist:Vehicles can now ""Morph"" between 2 modes, each vehicle and their modes have a specified role in combat (so that's a total of 10 vehicles!). This gameplay mechanic adds more reflexes than carefully thinking through observations of the map layouts.The strategic elements are still there, but much easier than the 1st one. If you completed Anomaly: Warzone Earth on ""Casual"" then in Anomaly 2, you can just jump right in ""Hardcore"". Although there is a ""Nightmare"" difficulty, it's just Hardcore towers dealing more damage.Many sound assets are re-used from Anomaly: Korea. But the Original Soundtracks are really nice. They correctly capture the winter-appocalypse and heroic feeling, with rays of hope shining from the horizon. The OSTs are available for free on the dev's website, made my ""Piotr Musial"":http://www.11bitstudios.com/games/15/soundtracksMultiplayer is also fun. You can play as the Alien :)Friday, Feb 6 2014 Edit:#After delving deeper into the Multiplayer part, I have to say, it is really good. As you can imagine, Multiplayer pits 2 opponents against each other. One controls the Convoy (attacker) and one controls the Towers (Defender). The Convoy and its abilities mostly stay the same as singleplayer, but it's the Towers where it gets interesting. To balance out the odds, the developers added a few ""twists"" for the Towers.The objective of the attacker is to destroy the defender's core structure - the Generator. Games are based on point-system. Whoever reaches the designated amount of point first is the winner, or you can win by leading the oponent by X amount of points. The attacker gains points for destroying towers and some will provide more points than the others. The defender gains points for damaging the attacker's convoy. The Tower player will be provided with 7 available towers from the Singleplayer with the addition of the Harvesters. The Harvester is only available in Multiplayer and it harvests Abilities, Points and Carusaurum. You can have multiple Harvesters, but only one can harvest at a time.Towers' Abilities: Regen, Berserk, Taunt and Kamikaze. Additionally, similar to the Convoy's ability to morph their units, the Towers can emit Energy Waves when you double-click on them. Each tower comes with a unique type of Energy Wave that can turn the tides of the battle.Multiplayer also introduces Tech Upgrades. With each upgrade, the effect of the later one will get stronger, so planning is vital along with play styles. Amount of upgrades varies depending on the map's size.So, what do you get out of the Multiplayer section of Anomaly 2? A whole lot, I have to say, that is if you have someone to play with. The flow of the battle always changes, there's no clear winner as the points can rack up rapidly if done right. The Tech Upgrades give both players a wide array of play styles, from Endurance, Ambush to Full-on War. All of which will create very exciting battles against friends, or foes.Keep in mind though, there are no hot keys for the Towers, so clicking a lot is expected.#In the end, Anomaly 2 has proved to be ""my"" worthy successor to Anomaly: Warzone Earth. If you like Anomaly: Warzone Earth, then you'll probably like this game.			"

												Again, the dev team that made this game made it spick and span; it's good looking, the voice acting is good, the gameplay is challenging and the soundtrack matches brilliantly. I wasn't that interested in multiplayer to begin with and I couldn't find an opponent to play against anyway. Otherwise, I'd say it's a pretty good game. ***			"

If you like tower games you'll enjoy this but will not be a game you will put hundreds of hours into.			"

												An improvement on the first one.  The ability to swap your units into different forms is good, although I always have to bring up the menu to do it.  Since a basic click moves your commander, trying to double-click to transform your guys in the heat of battle never seemed to work well.  More units and tower types are welcome additions.  I like that they added in some specific counters for certain types of builds, but it does still wind up being a little shallow.  Main campaign is good, but I don't have much desire to go back and replay it on the higher difficulties.  The multiplayer sounds cool, but I don't know for sure, since I've never been able to play an actual game.  There never seems to be a single person on.  I have my doubts about the balance, since it seems like they gave the towers player some abilities that would make it near-impossible to lose.Nonetheless a fun experience.			"

												So i had no idea what this game would have in store for me, it was almost anomalous for me to even realise i had it. The music was kinda funky, and the overall image of the game was pretty slick. The game itself was pretty cool, just not what i was looking for when looking for nothing to play and being super bored. Didnt expect to be playing a tower defence game where i was the assaulting the towers for the sake of humanities survival... i think. Ending point, it was good enough for a pretty swift unistall on my part. (Also, no idea how i didnt get gold for timing on that opening mission when i apparently beat it on 00.00 duration... must have transcended the skill required for this intricate placement of repair circles)			"

												Anomaly 2 is a really good sequel, and fans of the original should be pleased with what they find here. The core gameplay of guiding your units around maze-like streets, while using abilities to help defeat enemy towers, remains intact. There are new units, each of which can morph between two different forms at will. For example, the artillery unit can either fire straight ahead at long range, or 360 degrees at medium range. This adds more depth and makes it easier to adjust tactics mid-mission, to take advantage of the new enemy towers' weaknesses. The presentation of graphics, music, voice acting and story is all very good. The campaign took me around 6.5 hours, and although I'm disappointed there's no singleplayer skirmish mode, there is multiplayer to add replayability. The controls work great with mouse and I didn't notice any bugs. I think this developer deserves to be rewarded for their efforts with a full price purchase.			"

Personal Rating : ""Must trying""Traditional Rating : 8/10It has really good concept; anti-tower defense. And it executed very good and charming.Instead of having the tower and defense againts wave of enemy, you become the ""wave"" and clearing up the tower, planning your own path, upgrade the mobile and weaponry, using the strategic placement of repair kit, EMP, and decoy.it also have variety of level and enemies, making it more interesting and challanging.the story so-so, sound effect not that bad.the only downside of this Anomaly are the commander system. I really don't like the point of using the commander to walk around and placing (and taking) repair kit, etc. It should be point-and-click or at least have something like airstrike or crate drop to repair or decoy etc. The commander sucks; No objection.

												Firstly, I would like to mention that I personally enjoy the Anomaly Series and I would definitely recommend it to my friends. Anomaly 2 is a Tower Offense game, instead of the traditional Tower Defence games. This makes the Anomaly Franchise stand out of other games. With that said, I do miss the voice acting in Anomaly: Warzone Earth and the distinct British accent. However, in Anomaly 2, it is replaced by an American accent. For the Anomaly Franchise, I would prefer a British accent, as that was the voice acting style in Anomaly: Warzone Earth and Anomaly Korea, and I felt that the American accent in Anomaly 2 made the gameplay inconsistent with the overall gameplay of the entire Anomaly Series and the American accent does not live up to the original style of the Anomaly Franchise. I would also like to mention that I had only played the Single Player Campaign. However, the overall visual experience of the game is still great and I would still recommend this game to my friends. +  For graphics and overall visual experience-   For inconsistent voice acting throughout the Anomaly Series			"

												This is the reverse of a recommendation. While fun, this game is incredibly short, has an 'awful' plotline that gives you an incredibly black and white choice in the final mission and only has crappy competitive multiplayer. I heard someone say that they believe this game could be an E-sport and I damn near laughed out loud. This game is awful. Mind you, the game itself is fun, but offers so little content and is so samey compared to the first one that it's well below 50. The best features are the graphics. Gameplay is decent, until you realize there's only two units worth even morphing in combat and more so that the game is so overly hectic that things just lose their fun value.So yeah, get it while it's on sale for like 5 bucks, but it isn't worth it's current price of 15 or whatever. It really isn't. I got more enjoyment out of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little organ trail than I did with this.			"

												This game is a unique little thing. It's a bit like an anti-tower defense where there are multiple paths to take and you can shoot at the towers, but also a bit like a tower defense game where your enemies can go wherever the hell they want and shoot at your towers. The story is just a sliver below average, and really only there so players won't complain about there being no story.The game (or series, rather), is in a class by itself, and, in my opinion, deserves a look.

												Anomaly 2 doesn't live up to it's predecessor.The story is in the same vein as the previous one: wierd alien things that can shoot at everything. You're trying to stop them. No major issues here, as far as i'm concerned.I don't really feel that the general gameplay is any better in this sequel than in the original. Yeah, there are some new enemy types and so on, but for some reason it just feels as if this game is less interesting than the original. It doesn't really add enough new mechanics.One of the things that really annoys me with this game is the fact that there is no controller support. There was support for it in Anomaly: WE, but not here. It makes no sense that this would be the case.The graphics and sound are pretty good, as they were in the original game. Can't complain there.This game does have enhanced multiplayer support, so I suppose if that's what you're after you could get this game. But I haven't tried it so can't comment on it.All in all, don't buy this game just because you liked the original. I don't really think it adds much to the experience.			"

												Anomaly 2... I expected much from this game as I loved the 1st one, but the devs made the mistake of so many games by adding to much that the fun get's replaced by the frustration. Adding the morph and way the enemies spawn so close to you that no mission can be resolved from a first time (not talking about tutorial levels) you hace to load last checkpoint so many times until you know exactly where the enemy will spawn so you can plan what mechs you will need at what time. When a certain type may not fire at an enemy you need to sell it otherwise it transforms into deadly machine. When your commander is not close enough to a unit and says we half to dead then it's already to late to get there... So selling, buying, morphing is getting to much to manage that I got frustrated and wasn't really having fun, making me quit and thinking the f word and saying NEXT.Graphics are very nice but here again compared to the first one i found that my units are less visible and sometimes die and you barely noticed it as the colors are way to close to the environement.It's sad as I hoped to enjoy as much as the first one but just couldn't.4/10			"

Anomaly 2Overall Score: 6/10Short Summary:A tactical futuristic tower defence game. But this time, you don't play as the towers.Your role is to command and lead a convoy of mechanical vehicles to the safe zone while destroying the enemy tower machines.You do that, by choosing & upgrading your vehicles and also using different abilities for your advantage.You never played a tower def game like this one so I think you should give it a try.Estimated gameplay hours: 7-10.+ Gameplay: 1.Friendly & Helpful - Training before the 1st mission, guide on menu and tips along the game.2.Fun & Addictive - I get satisfied by overwhelming the alien machines and by getting them gold medals.3.Different methods to win each mission.+ Graphics:  As for a tower defence game it is fine. It sets on a futuristic sci fi areas that suits well with the game and gives a unique experience and fun while destroying the alien machines.+ Tactics: 1.Use the map to set the path for your convoy.2.Choose up to 5 vehicles and place them in the convoy. Strategy involves here since each vehicle has it's own stats (Armor/Damage/Range) and it's own abilities for the squad.3.Use your abilities well. Repair (health) / EMP (temporarily shutting down towers) / Decoy (Distraction) / A.I.M (Focusing on tower on range).4.Know the enemy towers strenghts and weaknesses to take advantage and easier gameplay.+ Score board: 4 different difficulties and 3 medals. Challenge exists in this game there's no doubt.- Story: Simple storyline and goofy ending, didn't expect otherwise tho.- Multiplayer: 2013 game so yea the multiplayer is kinda dead except if you play with friends.Also, there's a different game mode which does not exist in single player which is unfortunate, where you control the towers and try to destroy the convoy. I guess the other games in this series has this.Enjoyment: (8/10)Repetetive: (2/10) - Can barely say that on this game. Not if you play the missions one after another.Replayability (5/10) - Different difficulties like mentioned. Also you can try to go for those 3 gold medals each mission. Good luck with that.Frustraiton (7/10) - Oh yeah. I had some raging moments. The checkpoints in this game save it from people. Even tho, I still had to retry different method and beating myself up couple of times for doing the same mission over 1 and a half hour.Boredom (4/10)Overall Score: 6/10* Skip it.** Not Recommended.*** Give It A Try.**** Recommended On Sale (This game worth half it's price)****** Recommended On Full Price.

												The question to ask when considering a sequel is 'what does this game have over the first game'? In this case, Anomaly 2's biggest changes are more micromanagement (boo), multiplayer (one player gets to control the units and the other player gets stuck with THE GHOST OF STAGNATED GAME GENRES), and changeable units (boo). It's a bit more RTS-y for my liking, whereas the first game hit that sweet spot between tense action and tower offense strategy. I was hot♥♥♥♥♥♥on Hardcore in the first game, but I ended up getting murdered at that same difficulty because of terrible visual design and THINGS BEING DIFFERENT. Other than that, nothing's really changed. So it's not a bad game, it's just a bad sequel.			"

												This game is a improved re-work of the classic flash game balloon tower defense or cannon defense. On the positves the game looks beautiful and has a wide range of levels with different enviroments. The game also allows your 'army' to transform to defeat different types of machines. However, the game price tag is too high for the game and is boring and repetitive with you spending each level just transforming your robots and healing them to help. i'm not a gamer that enjoys these types of games, therefore i cant give it a in depth review as i feel it would be bias to my opinions of this genre.

												This is nice little reversed ""tower defense"" game. Instead of having to build towers to defend, you play as the attacker. Controls are simple and game play is fairly smooth. If you like tower defense games or want to try your hand at them, this is a good one to do it with. Pros:-Easy flowing game-Simple controls-Difficulty is just rightCons:-Get's a little repetitive after a whileI'd recommend it at a 9.5/10.			"

												I will review all my humble bundle games and see which is worth playing and which is not! Like a lot of people i buy H.B. games as a pack because i want some of the games, but not all. I will play for 5 minutes (or a litlle bit more) and give you my opinion on it. Sometimes the game will surprise me, sometimes it will be a total dissapointment. Just keep in mind this is my opinion only and is not an objective view of the game. You might actually like it!The review will be constructed into 5 parts:1. Game description (from what i've seen in the time i've played).2. Did i finish the game (YES/NO/Maybe in the future) and why.3. Pros/Cons.4. Final thoughts.5. RatingSo let's beggin...1. Game description:A twist on the classical tower defence game. Now you are the advancing force and the towers are the enemy. It has some nice visuals and reminded me a litle bit about Starcraft. The story so far and athmosphere is actually pretty good, a postapocaliptic ice wasteland.2. Did i finish the game? Maybe in the futureIt's a nice concept but it get's repetitive fast. Probabbly i will finish it someday, but it's not the kind of game that keeps me pinned to my seat for hours on end3. Pros/Cons.PROS:- Nice athmosphere- Interesting gameplay mechanicCONS:- Gets repetitive after a while4. Final thoughts:It feels like an RTS but the options you have to choose from are limited. The atmoshpere is nice but the gameplay is a litle bit repetitive. If on sale, Get it!5. Rating7/10			"

												Pretty good, it's like a reverse tower defense. But I hate tower defense games.I can't really stand it, but that doesn't mean the game's bad. It looks alright, and it's kind of original. It also just plays well.I don't really have much else to say. You just sort of run around a bit, and watch your tanks and stuff do things while you tell them to TRANSFORM every now and then. It's... a bit boring, I guess.But hey, get it for $5 or something I guess, could be some good entertainment.			"

												I first heard of this game way back in 2011 and was pretty excited for it, despite it being an indie game. (I pretty much never get excited for Indie games) Anomaly follows up the story of Anomaly Warzone Earth. Earth's been invaded by aliens, you're going to lead a bunch of vehicles to blow up towers. If one has ever played custom maps of Tower Defence in Warcraft 3 or what me not, you'll find it pretty similar. Except this time, you're on the attacking side.Units can morph about, giving more depth in the strategy used to blow up the towers. For example, a unit has 2 attack modes now and can be given the ability to switch between either mode at any time. Each mode has their own respective advantages and disadvantages and can be combined with the original Anomaly strategy of unit swapping, and throwing in special abilities such as smoke, repair or decoy. The soundtrack is in my opinion, way better than the original. But then again, Anomaly had a great soundtrack to begin with. For its low indie game price, I'd recommend that strategy / tower defence lovers go for the game. It's fun, addictive and equally hair pulling at the same time in various situations. IF you haven't had enough of Anomaly, there's always Anomaly Korea, the original Warzone Earth and even the mobile campaign on Steam to purchase!			"

												While the original Anomaly series was fantastic, the second started to feel like a complete repeat of the first game, without much else but an underwhelming . I'd suggest buying it if you haven't played Anomaly 2, but otherwise, I personally didn't get a whole lot out of the game since I'd played the other two Anomaly games. That being said, if it's your first time with the series, you'll have a lot of fun with it, as the mix of to tower offense instead of the traditional tower defense is a great concept that really feels like a fresh new idea.

												It's tower defence in reverse, where you play the waves of attackers who try to get past the towers. Which is great idea, except that instead of getting to pick what troops you're going to send against the defenders each wave, you instead just watch a small convoy of vehicles that NEVER STOPS sloooowly crawling forward (presumably the initial alien attack destroyed the gear shift factories so all vehicles are stuck going 10 km/h) and occasionally drop buffs on them. Wait, no, that was the first game. This game copies an element that was in the console versions of the first game, where you run around (about three times faster than the vehicles!) as a commander and draw the towers' fire and stuff, just to really drive home the feeling of frustration and powerlessness. You know, just to make it absolutely clear that you aren't a badass warlord choosing which troops deserve the honor of attacking the pitiful defenders, cowering in their towers.			"

It it's credit it has improved graphics since Anomaly 1 but it's still essentially the same game and it feels more like playing traffic control cop than anything else. It's a reverse tower defense game but I don't feel like I'm doing anything beyond micromanaging what i'm doing. I seem to be able to just muscle my way through most of the earlier levels with very little thought. It may have gotten better had I stuck with it for a few more hours but if a game can't grab you an hour in it probably won't. It couldn't hold my attention.			"

												This feels like a downgrade after the first Anomoly game, gameplay-wise. You can tell the moment you start up the game and it says ""Best played on Alienware"", Alienware being a company that makes stupidly overpriced laptops for spoiled rich 15 year olds who don't know better, that they were focused more on improved graphics than actually making the game more fun than the previous one. Just look at the 0 people on multiplayer despite all the MP only achievements to see how disappointed everyone is in this game compared to expectations.And if I have to hear that stupid voice say the awkwardly phrased ""We're halfway to dead, sir."" one more time, I'm going to find whoever does the voices for this game, and stab them in the face while saying ""You're halfway to dead, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.""

It is hard to always keep track of what your troops should be transformed into at what time and it is just all the same from level to level. It wouldn't be so bad if the levels were designed better and there were no timed missions. Overall it is just not one of the better tower defense games.			"

												This game is very well put together. It has a great way of making you feel OP and then instantly killing your so called OP set up. I love it. With out giving anything away I will say you will get frustrated with how much fun and stress this game will give you. Its not often I find a game that can make me so mad I storm off to cool down just to come right back an hour later to try again.  I love how it gets your full attention right from the start.The biggest thing to get used to in this game is the low amount of units you think you have to choose from. I cannot tell you how many times I forget I can morf my units. This single twist has not only made the depth of play greater it has made your tactics a more thought out part of the game. No longer can you just pick the op final unit and just roll over everything. I tried and you can still die even on the normal diff setting. You will learn to use the morf so much that your scouting ahead looking for the location you will morf each unit based on the enemies you will face. Great job devs.			"

												If there was a Neutral rating, that's what I would give this game. In comparison to Anomaly Korea, it looks better and has some nice tactical additions. But there are a couple of things I really didn't like:-Switching the order of units rarely works-Being an independent guy and running around is kind of wonky. Sometimes there's not enough time to pick up all enemy drops-The ""Hardass Military/Marine"" story and theme of the campaign is SERIOUSLY stale and annoying after being featured in countless games for years... this was the biggest put off for me. Atmosphere matters a lotThankfully, none of these issues are present in the next game of the series (and IMHO the best one): Anomaly Defenders.			"

												A puzzle tower defense, in reverse-role.Pros and Cons:-its simple, thrilling and most important, challenging. Though potential, new ideas are usually are to come by in this game.-The game shines most in being challenging which pushes player to think quickly for strategy as their units continue onward their path without stopping (unless theres a path loop, you get to plan for the next). In multiplayer, the speed and timing is your best modus operandi, as one surprise may overlaps the other. Chess? Too much time.-Certain item drops CHANCE seems fixed from enemy turrets, allowing each chapter to have its balance of power through item use.-Single player is pretty short, although chapter in the latter prove to be time taking (especially on hardest difficulty), you can usually speed up in-game. (Which most games usually does by teaching you all the relevant stuff in following chapters and leave you the next 3/4 parts of the chapter to your own with a specific condition or a sort)-Multiplayer introduce further stuff that reveal more different combination of strategic gameplay for players to compete on each other with, unfortunately the population is not that many to play with since the online queue takes ages.it could be a casual browser, it could even be a sort of custom map on some game engine, but Anomaly series prioritize its awesome graphic heavily to have its own, and when I say custom, I view this game as a mini-game genre. Overall, although many of its features are still limited in for different strategical elements, I'd still recommend it for people to play the thrill of quickpace planning with their friends together.

												This game expands upon its predecessor in the right ways. Gameplay is more in depth and frantic and the visuals and sound have been greatly improved including an epic soundtrack. My only gripe is that the story tends to come off a little cheesy but other than that i would recomend this game to anyone who was a fan of the first game.			"

												Pros: Strategy game with a twist. The uniqueness is refreshing. Nice in-game videos, cinematics and story. Lots of micro-management. Good tutorial system. Cons: No saves while in a mission. The game runs smoothly but it feels like the graphics are not code-optimised. Probably just a problem in Mac OSX though. Still perfectly playable.Verdict: 8/10			"

												While the storyline and such are a bit cliche and predictable, the gameplay is almost as good as the original. While I feel the original held much more of a challenge the aliens seemed more powerful in the original, like you were always one step behind, the multiplayer mode, along with the transforming vehicles, certainly offer new possibilities.

												This game probably isnt for everyone, but I loved it.  I quickly got addicted and pretty much played through the entire story line in 2 days.  Its not really a long game, but the storyline is pretty good and the gameplay is fast and intense (and not easy, either).  Unfortunately, after beating the main story line I wanted to play online and apparently no one plays this game anymore.  After searching for an opponent at different times of the day and continouosly failing to find even a single person to play against... I had to quit.  I really wish there was an online player base, because I feel like the multiplayer would be so awesome.  Overall this is a great game; it just doesnt have a player base for multiplayer, which is too bad considering how fun the game is.			"

												A fun little reverse tower defense game.  Instead of building towers, you control to units that have to kill the towers and choose their path.  You can buy a variety of different vehicles, and each one can be upgraded during levels.  Each vehicle also has 2 modes, giving some nice variety.  There are 14 levels, which took me about 6 hrs to beat.  By the end, the levels got a little tedious, making this game good, but not great.  It has multiplayer, but there is basically no one playing it.			"

												Fun RTS game that is easy to learn, but has enough depth to keep you playing. Great for people like me who are not huge fans of the genre, but like to dabble occasionally. I only played through the single-player campaign, so I can't comment on the multiplayer.Note to Linux users, I had weird technical issues when playing the game with an AMD graphics card (seemed like Catalyst driver-related issues). Didn't have any issues whatsoever when playing the game in Linux with an NVIDIA graphics card.			"

												Amazing game just like the first one, it's the only indie game I have ever preordered and it's totally worth it. New mechanics were added in like morphing units, which makes the strategy combinations twice as interesting. Like the first one, you will definitely need very good micromanagement skills for the higher difficulties, if you're good at RTS games then you should be good for micro in A2. There's also MP which extends the life of the game. Graphics and sound effects are also well done. Top notch game from 11Bit.			"

												Anomaly 2 is lke Anomaly Warzone Earth just with everything dialed up to 11. Enjoy towers with specific abilities? Now they're more pronounced. Enjoy using powerups for specific situations? Now they're more specialized. Although this comes at the expense of wondering what certain powerups are even for.But just because every part of the game is in theory better doesn't mean the game as a whole is better. Anomaly Warzone Earth kept things simple. You can easily memorize what everything does and there was a story to drive everything forward. Anomaly 2 complicates things by slowing down the battles considerably. The story in Anomaly 2 although 'logically' good is not the same thing as being 'actually' good. And my favourite parts, the missions with specific objectives, have mostly been removed.			"

												This game gives a fun twist to the classic ""reverse tower defense"" genre.

You have troops that move along automatically but you have a tactical view so that you can change the direction they go when you come to a crossroads. You're a tiny person running around with big mech troops that you can morph and upgrade. They do the damage while you put down repair stations and decoys. There's probably more you can do but I haven't got that far yet.			"

The story is a little cliche but the voice acting is well done, the artwork in cutscenes(especially the intro video) is interesting and lastly the graphics are beautiful to look at although sometimes too much♥♥♥♥♥♥gets blown up and can lose track of where your commander is at lol.Gameplay generally isn't too complex to intimidate casual players but its complex enough to satisfy the hardcore players(like me) and the real trick to winning is ALWAYS set your unit path beforehand to the fastest route possible with the least amount of enemies otherwise you will be pointlessly adjusting it as you go which is only necessary on certain levels.I haven't tried the multiplayer yet so my review is only about the single player though I highly recommend this especially if you get it on sale.

												In very few words: get it, have fun.This is the sequel to ""Anomaly Warzone Earth"" and ""Anomaly Korea"". It is not necessary to play these beforehand (as there's not that much ""plot"" going on in these games, let's be honest), but it is recommend (especially in the beginning, as there's a reference or two thrown in there...). As a sequel, it has quite a lot of things in common with its predecessors: you command a convoy and can choose it's composition and path through the alien towers, which you destroy for objectives and currency, which you use to buy and upgrade units... And the commander, which you control directly, is able (and often has to) deploy abilities (buffs or debuffs) on the battlefield to help the convoy through crucial enemy chokepoints.This is at least twice as fun as it sounds. :-)This entry in the series has a few major changes though, like morphing (and different) units, different abilities and a more elaborated presentation of its plot. And in the end there's a plot twist with a crucial choice.Oh, and as a note concerning difficulty: there's no quick save, but check points you may ""drive through"" as often as you deem necessary. I played through in casual mode, which was not too hard - but you had to react and adapt to the battle, so it was still fun. I recon higher difficulty settings might pose a challenge or two. :-)			"

												A very positive surprise.I was going into this, thinking I wouldn't like it anyway, but then it turned out to be a great new experience for me.Single-player is engaging and challenging and also rather meaty if you're going for all the achievements and difficulty settings and leaderboards. Mutiplayer meanhwile is neat, but you'll have a hard time finding anybody to play with, and most people are rather bad at it, since, as I said, it's difficult to find someone to practice with in the first place.Bottom line is, it's a great strategy action game.

												It's not a bad game, but does it get stale? Yes, I've played both Anomaly 2, and warzone, they're basically the same, and the only thing that changes in the game(from what I've played) is your strategy, and how you setup your team. But like I said, it's not a bad game, it just gets stale pretty quick, at least in my opinion.			"

												This is a nice Tower and Defense game, although you are actually in the attacking role in this game, 8/10. I did not play the previous games, so I dont know how new the different enemy units are, but they offer a nice variety of skills and require quite some distinct tactics to beat them. Game is not so easy, you will wipe several times in normal until you understand the various weaknesses of the units. Story is quite good, a bit short but offers a lot of variety. Therefore, highly recommended if you want to play an unusual Tower and Defense game!			"

												Anomaly 2 is a sequel done right: it takes all the great mechanics of the first game and turns them up a notch, adding new interesting elements without losing what made the original special. What exactly does that mean for a reverse tower defense game? Well, first of all, that label seems even more incomplete - you often have a great deal of options for how you want to navigate or even approach a given level. One of the most striking improvements is the visuals: while the original sent you through some nice but generic cityscapes, you're now smashing towers in post-apocalyptic wastelands coursed by mysterious metallic structures, as well as some very recognizable ruins. Your units have also received some upgrades - each can now 'morph' between two forms at any time of your choosing, allowing for some interesting strategic flexibility not to mention effectively twice as many unit types to choose from overall. There's also some innovative level design, especially near the middle of the campaign.A few things were kept suitably the same - the tower lineup is fairly similar to that of the first game (a couple of new ones and some old ones have picked up new tricks) and the array of hero powers is pretty close in terms of functionality. The story that this game tries to tell is more interesting, but as with the first, it's done with fairly weak dialogue and characterization, and the mid-level intrusions never quite feel 'worth it'. It's also not amazing in terms of length - the 14-level campaign took about 7 hours. That said, it looks great and it plays great - the gameplay has been fine-tuned from the original, and it's an interesting, well-executed concept. Whether you've played the original or not, this one's well worth considering.			"

												Like the first incarnation, this is essentially more of the same, but that's not a bad thing, it's a great thing.The gameplay is still solid, it's fun as♥♥♥♥♥♥ though perhaps a little light on length (I think I finished it in 7-ish hours).  Still a great mix of tower defence and tower offence, and well worth the entry fee.			"

												Amazing game just like the first one, it's the only indie game I have ever preordered and it's totally worth it. New mechanics were added in like morphing units, which makes the strategy combinations twice as interesting. Like the first one, you will definitely need very good micromanagement skills for the higher difficulties, if you're good at RTS games then you should be good for micro in A2. There's also MP which extends the life of the game. Graphics and sound effects are also well done. Top notch game from 11Bit.			"

												Anomaly 2 is one of those games that has a hard act to follow, by redefining a genre. It's sometimes called ""tower attack"", in that you control a military attack column attacking enemy towers. Most games have you control the towers and destroy attacking enemies, thus ""tower defense"". This game is the other way around: you're attacking. You are the commander with ability to call in special abilities like heal, decoy, frenzy, and so on to enhance the column at key times, as well as plot a route that would hopefully give you enough time to defeat the enemy towers en route. What makes Anomaly 2 different is the vehicles now are morphable. That's right, each vehicle now has two modes: vehicle mode, and mecha mode, with different speed, and weapon capabilities. So morphing at the right time is also very important. Some weapons also ""charge up"" and does more damage the more time it shoots, so it's usable against a tight cluster of targets, while others are more suitable for spread-out targets. Otherwise, the game is still the same: you are rated for ruthlessness (how many towers did you destroy), speed (how fast did you finish the mission) and so on. The idea is not to lose units on a mission but often it can't be avoided. You need the currency to upgrade the vehicles for better armor and better weapons. Altering route is recommended can the game is pausable to go into commander mode and there are checkpoints you have to navigate as your objective. Enemy towers get really tricky, as some towers simply assist other towers and make you more vulnerable, while at other times, overhead cover prevents you from using the commander abilities. The missions are as intricate as ever, but otherwise it didn't change much. The background is extrapolated from the previous games, assuming we had mostly lost the war against the invading aliens in Anomaly 1 (and the other campaigns), but as you can guess, this gives us some new hope against the invaders. To master the game you have to learn the best time to use each vehicle in its respective modes, and have enough abilities on standby to proper execute the attack plan. The graphics ain't the best but it's meant to be somewhat reminiscent of satellite view, slightly off color, not quite photographic, but with a lot of details like ruined buildings, ruined vehicles, and so on. All in all, those who buy Anomaly 2 knows exactly that they are getting MOTS: More of the same, with a subtle interesting tactical variation of morphing vehicles and its different tactical implications. If it's what you dig, then this will deliver exactly what you're looking for... a different type of RTS challenge.			"

												Many are familiar with the concept of tower defense games, where you are building towers to fend off hordes of enemies swarming towards your (insert resource name here).  These paths are often full of bends and turns and you must strategically place different types of towers to most efficiently and effectively defend against the baddies.  In this game, you are the attackers, and defending are a race of robotic alien invaders who have taken over the world, and you must penetrate their defenses to create and deploy a super weapon to end their threat once and for all.Your mechanized soldiers form a convoy, which you can deploy in specific configurations and formations to combat the enemy towers.  Most of your troops have two modes you can switch between, often close and long range combat modes.  You also, as the commander, have special abilities such as the ability to repair your convoy and activate decoys to draw enemy fire, or an emp to shut the towers down temporarily.Your unit types and enemy tower types are slowly introduced to you during the single player game.  Also as a commander, you set the path that your convoy will take, and this can be altered at any time.  You purchase up to 6 units for your convoy, and can upgrade them as well using a rare resource which basically acts as money and either is obtained by taking your convoy down a specific path that has it, or randomly as drops from the enemy towers you destroy.The game is fun, and a refreshing take on the tower genre.  I wish the enemies weren’t all just chrome, as it gets bland to look at, and makes it sometimes harder to recognize what you are up against since they all look the same.I’d recommend this game to tower defense fans definitely.  There is also a multiplayer mode, and I have no idea what that is or how it works, but every single-player level has leaderboards which you can compete with others for the best score based on time and kills.

												In a world full of Turret defense games, a game with a timeline like this, really goes wonderfully against the grain. I love games that go the opposite way, or just give you the role that you traditionally wouldnt or havent played before.The fact that you become the ""invading force"" and have to tactically pick a path that is beneficial to you, is really refreshing. I really like how your little squad grows in strength, and can switch between two forms to meet and adapt to the board you have to deal with. Its fun, thats what I look for more, the details can really become unimportant. There is ONE thing I dont like. Its the fact that you issue orders and follow your squad around as a dude just walking the ♥♥♥♥ around in the middle of skull melting madness, filled with light and sound and explosions! Youre very weak, and the fact that your orders will have a delay because you have to walk to the place you want to an issue, can be very frustrating. But it's truly not that big a deal. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes tower defense and taking a different role in the history of gaming.			"

												tl;dr : Good and original game. Very quick campaign so you might want to wait for a sale if you don't plan on playing in multiplayer mode.Interesting concept of a reversed TD where you are the attacker. This plays more as a tactical objective taking game, where you build your squad, upgrade it and reorganize it in real time, while choosing the most effective path to your objectives and checkpoints. You also have some abilities that you an use and each unit can switch anytime between two forms that serve distinct purposes. Good gameplay overall, despite some minor flaws.There is a bug where in rare cases a checkpoint does not save when you cross it, it's very annoying but occurred only twice in my whole play through, so it's not a game breaker.The whole campaign can be easily finished in less than ten hours, but can be very challenging at higher difficulty, although there is no replayability at all and no incentive to replay the game at a higher difficulty (nothing to gain from it apart from personal satisfaction).If you're not interested in the multiplayer mode (where you can play either as the attacker like in campaign mode or as the defender by placing towers and using abilities), I would not recommend buying it at full price as there isn't much content in the campaign mode.

												Update 2: the only way to get a soundtrack for this game is to buy Anomaly 'bundle'. There's no way to obtain it otherwise by purchasing separately. Despite numerous attempts to contact them, they conveniently ignored it. Do not support this developer.Update: I changed this review to NOT recommended. Reason: There is no controller support despite it has been promised. Developer is good at lying I see.http://steamcommunity.com/app/236730/discussions/0/846959876041024118/#p1Original review:---I'm impressed with its level design, concept and background music. Tower defense and Tower offense, well, not many games present themselves as such genre.Setting itself as a post-apocalypse something I like most for a storyline (well, the other is zombehhhh). Storyline is decent at best, though, as the game emphasizes on gameplay much.Controls can be confusing, but thankfully you are given some levels to practice. This game's gameplay requires from player is careful plannings, though, so for casual players may not be interested.Graphic is good. Being indie but paying attention to tiny details. Go check the screenshots - you will not be disappointed.			"
