												Firstly, I would like to mention that I personally enjoy the Anomaly Series and I would definitely recommend it to my friends. Anomaly Korea is a Tower Offense game, instead of the traditional Tower Defence games. This makes the Anomaly Franchise stand out of other games. With that said, the original intention of creating Anomaly Korea is to be played on mobile devices, rather than on a PC. As this is a game meant for mobile devices, it is pretty much the same as the gameplay style of the original Anomaly: Warzone Earth, just that you would realise that there are no keyboard shortcuts, making it unfriendly for PC gaming. For PC gaming, my recommendation would be to get Anomaly: Warzone Earth or Anomaly 2, instead of Anomaly Korea as I find those meant for PC gaming more enjoyable and with keyboard shortcuts, making the overall gameplay more convenient rather than having to use the mouse all the time. Unless you are a hard-core fan of the Anomaly Series, don’t get this game and save up the money for Anomaly: Warzone Earth or Anomaly 2 for a better gameplay experience.			"

												Anomaly Korea provides an experience similar to the first Anomaly and Anomaly 2. It's a full package, with HD graphics and the exact same gameplay as the previous ones. It's also fairly lenghty, with 12 missions, ranging from easy to moderately difficult and there are a couple of new towers to keep you occupied as well. It's still a refreshing take on the tower defense genre. Unlike the other Anomaly games there's no commander to control this time, though. You'll only control the vehicles. It actually works better and keeps you focused on taking the correct route. Things can get pretty hectic after all and it's good to be able to see what's happening without having to worry about your commander all the time. Korea is another solid entry in the Anomaly franchise. If you liked the previous ones you'll like this one for sure.[Rating: 76/100]			"

Tower Offense?If you like the basic vibe of a tower defense game, get Anomaly Korea. It's a great franchise that reinvents an established formula in a very engaging way. I love the strategy and accuracy of keeping your convoy going, and the visuals are top notch. If I have any complaint it would be that the 12 story missions aren't enough. You could blow through this game in a day if you really try.What's Hot:Builds off the successful formula while adding a fresh perspective to tower defense, planning routes ahead of time with the tactical map, plenty of explosions and pretty scenery, Art of War bonus stages.What's Not:Plays exactly like its predecessor, only 12 missions.

												If you liked the original Anomaly (Which I loved), chances are you'll enjoy this. It bares no real differences besides the fact that this is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mobile port where alt-tabbing will lead to certain doom. If you've never played the original Anomaly I'd suggest skipping this, but if you're adamant, let me tell you what you have in store for you.This is a ""tower-offense"" game, the inverse of the usual tower defense. It's a short game, but there is a splendid variety of units for you to bring into battle, and towers for the enemy to set up. You will take on several story-based missions that serve as kind of a sequel to the original Anomaly (So if you've never played that, you'll have no idea what's going on here). The game challenges you in different ways such as preventing you from calling in more units, stopping you from acquiring more powerups (Very important tools you can use to give your units the edge in battle.), giving you a time limit, and etc.The story isn't as in-depth (Nor is it necessary to experience before moving on to Anomaly 2), about every unit is recycled from the original, there are NO graphics options to speak of, nor any audio quality options.It's a very unique concept but also much better done in the original Anomaly game rather than this crappy mobile port. It's ok, but really not a must-play unless you're head over heels in love with this series. I'll give this a 6/10. It's ok, it's not bad, but doesn't really live up to the name the original Anomaly made for itself. This PC port was clearly just made as a grab for money as the port itself has no effort put into it, and because of that, I cannot recommend you picking this up on PC.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: 11 bit Studios Publishers: 11 bit Studios Initial release: Nov 2013Genre: Tower Offense, Strategy #Worth/NotWorth: #WaitForSale BSERC - (Borderline Sardonic and Extremely Reductive Comparison): Slightly reduced version of bigger Anomaly gamesExposition, Concurrence and SummationAnomaly Korea is a mobile port but it plays pretty well on PC. It's Tower Offense rather than defense as you operate and command a convoy to destroy towers and generally have to get to a specific point to complete your objective. Other objectives are more in recovery of data though for you as the player it boils down to just arriving somewhere still intact. The game does a good job of introducing mechanics as well as the types of units available and what uses they might have. There aren't THAT many but enough to create some pretty decent strategies as well as make some fairly frantic experiences in real time. Tanks, Shield units, APC's and missile launchers. You're in charge of their order and the path they take through the city. The main mechanic you'll be dealing with is planning a path (that can be changed at any point) and placing power ups down to aid your convoy in completing the mission. Power ups are dropped from air support and can include things like damage boosts, repair kits, smoke screens and decoys among other things. All are placed with a specific diameter and duration and for the most part are useful in dealing with a specific type of tower. There are also situations where you must travel inside and air support is not available or timers are placed for example to keep a bridge down. Admittedly, these timed sequences are not the most relaxing stages as there is no active pause and this can lead to some sporadically frantic gameplay to keep your convoy alive.  You can also at any time change the order of the convoy. This is especially useful with shielded units to keep the front man from taking excessive damage. THE GISTThe game is not that long, as I stated, it is a mobile port. You can tell mostly from its jarringly egregiously oversized UI. It is a decently fun romp especially if you can get it on sale.Follow my curation for more "

												Anomaly Korea is a standalone sequel/expansion to Anomaly: Warzone Earth that serves to expand on the universe/mechanics a little bit. It is a reverse-tower defense game (Anti-tower defense? Tower attack? Is there a good term for these?), where you control a series of up to 6 units which are moving through a hostile field of towers, attempting to take out the towers and make it to your destination. To assist in this, you have a number of abilities (heal, cloak, etc) which can give your units a bit more of an advantage. Through each mission you're graded on a number of different variables (destruction, speed, losses), allowing you to ""medal"" in a number of different ways.It's a fun game, if kinda short. It's literally just more Anomaly: Warzone Earth, so if you enjoyed that, odds are you'll enjoy this. Achievements have been bugged on it and won't unlock correctly for MONTHS, but it sounds like they finally got fixed a few days ago, so there shouldn't be any problems. So yeah - good little fun, but only in the 3-4 hour range.			"

												Even if you never heard or saw this game before, you'd immediately recognize it as a smartphone port;  massive text, huge onscreen buttons for commands, clicking the screen to continue narration, etc.The Good:- Overall, I like some of the controls of this game a little better than Anamoly: Warzone Earth due to the lack of a commander running around.- It basically is another Anomaly game.  Just not quite as polished or detailed as the main game, Warzone Earth.- Decent graphics for what it is.The Eh:- Massive text fonts.- Voices and delivery are OK.- Campaign is short.  2.25hrs for me.  (I had ""enough"" though.)The Bad:- I would much rather right-click on the map for selecting abilities and designating their locations.- Right-click doesn't cancel Ability placement on the map (when I'd select an Ability button, but then want to cancel it--I'd mistakenly place it on the map)- Moving the navigation map around (by dragging it) would sometimes make changes to your turn selections if you dragged it from a place too close to an intersection.  More of a nuissance.Summary:  If you like Anomaly: Warzone Earth, this is more of that.  Just not quite as nice.  6 out of 10. "

Title:  Anomaly KoreaGenre:  Action, StrategyDeveloper:  11 bit studiosPublisher:  11 bit studiosRelease Date:  6th November, 2013TL;DRA Good tower defense game that will keep you busy for a bit, but do know it's an expansion. Upgrades are fun, and you have to look at your game and follow closely to win, unlike a lot of others which you can just sit back and drink your coffee. Or beer. Or whatever it is you drink. ProsMusicGameplay as a reverse tower defense is interestingGraphics for this kind of game is goodActually has a small storyline you can followConsOnly 12missions Gameplay I've not played any other Anomaly games before this, so bear that info in mind. A strategy reverse tower defense game, you set our your troop's directions on a map based on the mission purpose and the enemies  dotted around it. Once you've worked/planned out your route, you then watch the results of your choice with the option to add boosts, repairs,  and abilities to improve your troop's chance of succeeding their mission.  You have to be careful about where and when you use your boosts and upgrades to increase your success in a mission. You can get extra vehicles and boosts added during the level as well.It's a simple game limited in what you can do as you follow a predetermined path that you set up at the start. The birds eye angle makes it visually easier to see how your units progress and what's coming up.The graphics are quite good for this type of game, and the effects are pleasing. Its basicly a war tower offense game and that is what you can see on the graphics. The shooting- the towers- everything looks just really nice. And not to forget... EXPLOSIONSIt's like a reverse tower defense game. Instead of you building the towers, you're the mobs running through the defenses, trying to survive. The different POV here to this type of game is something I like.You complete missions for cash and bonuses, increased by the score you gained. Completing gives gold and a score, which can be used for upgrading and purchasing/unlocking new vehicles. Your missions are timed as well, making you choose the shortest path with the least resistance, though it seems quite a lot of the time the shortest path is the hardest and riskiest for your units.  It depends as well on the enemies you have to face as some are a lot more lethal than others. I find it gets challenging quite fast which leaves you needing to use your boosts and gold to make it through the missions, which can limit the chance to upgrade. It's also tactical to be able to rearrange the order your vehicles move in, especially when they're taking a lot of damage to save them. The running dialogue from the characters/units at the start of each mission and during help to give it a more urgent feel to the missions.  You don't really get personal info about them, just their reactions in the war zone, and a brief statement of the mission at hand. Though the story isn't amazingly detailed, there is one there and you do know what you're doing the missions for. The music for this game is actually really interesting during the selection menus - easily the kind you would expect in a movie.You can hear the influence of Korea in it and a driving rhythm makes the game a lot more atmosphere and tense. However, it doesn't take over the game and distracts the player, so it leaves you room to be able to focus on what is happening, so big plus there.It's surprisingly engaging for a game where you design the outcome at the start then follow through. These kind of games have the potential to get boring really fast because of the limited interaction /direct control  you have, as in you don't personally drive the vehicles through the map – they follow the path that is set out. As a reverse tower defense game, I actually really like this.There is the option for more game modes so there's more to do after you complete the main missions, which is nice.Seems quite a short game, only 12 missions. I'm aware it's an expansion, though I still think they could have done a little bit more. Though having said that there is some extra gamemodes as well Want moar?

I really like the Anomaly games so I enjoyed it but its a step down from Warzone Earth although a good blast.			"

It feels a bit uncomfortable to navigate through the game.The rest of the gameplay is well adapted for the computer, though.It is a pretty short game with 12 campaign missions, each lasting for about ten minutes in average.You can invest a large amount of time, trying to get the gold medals on hard, and try to beat ""Art of War Trials"", which are unlocked throughout the game.In the end,  fun little game to kill some time.4 out of 10 points for this one.

												The Anomaly series is a highly recommended tower defense series of games where you play the wave of units that go up against the defending towers.Anomaly Korea is basically Anomaly Warzone Earth Mobile Earth Campaign; that is, there's no human to control like there is in the original Anomaly Warzone Earth.  This one contains 12 new missions, several short ""Art of War"" scenarios, and, overall, this one is much tougher than the Mobile Earth Campaign.  Play the other Anomaly games before attempting this one.  All-in-all, fun and challenging at the same time.			"

												Bad port of a tablet game. No resolution options.  No controller support or even key binding options.  Not to mention the fact that the gameplay mechanics are overly simplistic for a PC game.But what is even more inexcusable is the fake Korean voice acting and language. The ""Korean"" accent is horrible - it's more like an American attempt at a Chinese accent.  The Korean words on billboards and such are mostly non-sensical.  Let's just give the devs the benefit of the doubt and attribute this to their ignorance and not some overt racism.  If you can't be bothered to hire a Korean voice-actor or research at least a bit more into Korean language, then don't include ""Korea"" as part of the title.			"

												This game is pretty unique. This is a reverse tower defense game(where you actually have to FIGHT the turrents, and YOU are the ""invader""). This game takes place a bit into the future, when aliens suddenly invade near the troop deployments in Korea. Your job is to navigate through the city and get out in one piece.I. Gameplay:To be honest, it isn't too much of a blast. You simply click on certain things to power them up, or every once in a while change the path of your military so they do not get wrecked by the alien turrents. You can use money you earn by killing alien turrents to purchase new vehicles. That is pretty much it. I got pretty bored after the 1st level. I did some research and found out this is a port of a game on the Appstore. Ports of mobile games are not good, and this is an example. II. GraphicsThis game in my opinion has good graphics. Nothing near a AAA Title, but definitly doesn't look like a pile of garbage. This game is around 700MB, and has appropriate graphics for that size. It has a unique graphics style which looks good for a game, too bad the gameplay can't match the pretty good graphics.III.LogicThis game has good logic. Nothing seems too out of place, and your character does not do wildly stupid things. Your character acts and feels human, which feels good. The idea of aliens invading does not have any things out of place.IV.Replayability/MultiplayerI do not see why you would play this again, and no, there isn't multiplayer.Final Score: 4/10. There are not any bugs/glitches that I could find , the game just lost a ton of points for its boring gameplay. It is a decent title if you won this game in a giveaway, but no need to buy it.			"

												Well, I finally got Anomaly Korea, so lets see how good this is. (I have played this game a LOT more than 13 minutes)Anomaly Korea is a top-view reverse tower defense game, when you are in control of a task force whose goal is either destroy all towers or get to a certain point on the map. The game starts off after the events of the original Anomaly. You play as a commander fighting a war against a race of sentient alien machines (that is literally what they are called). They have now targeted korea, and you are the only thing in the way of the machines at the moment. So, lets get to the review.Pros:- Good graphics, great visual effects.- A variety of vehicles at your disposal. From mechs to tanks to mobile shield generators.- You can change the formation of your convoy. (protip: keep your most powerful unit at the front to soak up damage)- There are special tactics you can use in the battle. You can use anything from healing to smokescreen.- Campaign is really good. Got me hooked in the first 10 minutes.- (I think this is the best part) you can change the course of your units mid-battle, which allows you to make split decisions when something new shows up.- Runs smoothly even on weak computers with decent graphics.Cons:- The game gets a little repetetive later on.- You have to play the first game in order to understand what actually happened beforehand. (for instance: where did these machines come from? What is their goal other than destroy everything?)- No multiplayer. :(Overall, this game is a great game to get if you are into reverse tower defense games. It mixes strategic path making and fast reaction skills to make an excellent strategy game. It's graphics are pretty good for being a port from a mobile game. There are actually uses and purposes for having certain units in your convoy.I give this game a 7/10 (Definitely worth a look). This game is awesome if you are a fan of strategy and tower defense. If you are new to the franchise, I highly recommend this game to start off with. The storyline is gripping, and it actually feels like you are fighting a war against giant robots.			"

												Anomaly Korea is an extra campaign for Anomaly Warzone Earth. Gameplay is the same tower offence style where you buy units and select the route they will use to travel around the map, while destroying or avoiding the alien towers. You don't have the commander unit, but can still deploy powers by clicking where you want to use them.The campaign is only 3.5 hours long, but there are a few additions that provide a fresh tactical challenge. A new type of tank has a powerful special attack that gains charge from each tower you destroy. A new power increases the firing speed and range of your units. And some maps have special conditions such as zones where your powers are disabled, or time limits to clear an area of the map.If you enjoyed the original game, you should get some entertainment from Korea, but you might want to wait for a sale.

												A sequel for Anomaly Warzone Earth this game was originally a mobile release and later ported to PC. As a result you never use the keyboard and everything is done with the mouse. Which is annoying because it means there are no hotkeys. The Commander system was removed and you get your special abilities on a sidebar on the left. There's one new ability, one new friendly unit and one new enemy tower called the Flamer, that replaces the Behemoth . The mechanic  of the hacker tower has changed and you no longer have to exit its area of effect. Instead you have to use your mouse to click three buttons. Everything else is the same. One of the cons of this game is that there are only 12 missions that are relatively easier than the first game. Story wise it adds nothing to the overall plot.Overall 5/10You're better off spending your $5 somewhere else.			"

												TLDR – shortened and simplified version of the other 2 Anomaly games since it was made for mobile devices. It’s more casual too so if you didn’t like the intensity of dodging alien weapons fire with your little commander unit, you might find Anomaly Korea more relaxed. 6.5/10Don’t worry if you haven’t played Anomaly Warzone Earth or Anomaly 2 since the stories aren’t tied together very tightly. All three stories take place in different parts of the world and while the gameplay is very similar in all the games, there’s only a high level overarching story to them. In fact, since Anomaly Korea is a simplified version, you might want to start with this game first and move on to the other 2 if you enjoy the concept.Just like in the other Anomaly games, the story of Anomaly Korea follows a military commander (you) trying to survive after an invasion by alien gun towers that sprout up out of the ground all over the world. As the name suggests, this time the action is in Korea (not that it really matters) and your job is to guide convoys of military vehicles out of harm’s way while blasting as many of the towers as you can. Anomaly Korea is a “reverse tower defense” game where the map is filled with various enemy towers, and it’s your just to survive getting through to the end. You see the action in a top down map overview perspective and can modify the path that your units travel through the city streets (to avoid or seek out confrontation). Just as there are a bunch of different types of towers, you have a bunch of different units that you can pick and choose from to build your small convoy. Build a decent force and upgrade them with money you find on the map to make it through each level. Your biggest advantage is the ability to use special “skills” such as repair and smoke screen to power up or defend your vehicles as they pass through hostile territory. You pick up the skills which are often dropped by destroyed enemy towers. The maps are pretty linear with very little room for creativity, but as I said before the game is pretty casual on the lower difficulties. Pros:+Gameplay is very similar to Anomaly Warzone Earth and Anomaly 2, except this time you don’t control a little man running alongside your vehicles, you just guide the vehicles in your convoy and “cast” your skills on map areas.  If you’ve played the previous games you can just dive right into Anomaly Korea and kind of breeze through the tutorial. In other words, the game is a lot simpler.+The game has easy Steam achievements and it drops trading cards. That’s reason enough to spend 3 hours of your time playing right? Additionally, for its small download size (about 600 mb) the game has decent graphics.Cons:-This is a mobile port, and it shows. There are very few (if any) game options and everything is controlled with your mouse. There are no keyboard shortcuts or game graphics options. It’s a shame because keyboard shortcuts would really make some of the fast paced levels easier.-The game is really short. 3 hours start to finish for the campaign.Overall, if you liked the other 2 Anomaly games, you can give this one a try. The download is about 600 megabytes and you can chill as your cars themselves drive around blasting aliens under your excellent tactical supervision.  "

												Just like the rest of the Anomaly series it's a reverse Tower defense and it does a damn fine job at it. Though with this game and Mobile Camp, they're more of a 'unoffical' DLC for Warzone Earth that were released on mobile devices. Unlike Mobile Camp, Korea tries to bring in a few different units and enemies which is a nice change over Warzone Earth cut and paste. Though you're better off buying these games on a sale or buying the entire Anomaly bundle for the best value.			"

												Not too bad overall. Decent graphics and interesting gameplay. Reverse TD games are different than the usual. Pretty good graphics for the price point. My only complaints are that the difficulty ramped up way too quickly, by level 5 it was more difficult than it was fun and some powers seem to do nothing more than give you something new to look at on the ground for a few seconds.

Warzone Earth was just perfect, played countless hours, they should have leave the game play as it was.I also have to mention the camera control, mouse scroll not working any longer to change between action/plan view, and the viewpoint is automatically set bac to ""follow"" mode when you closing the plan map.Big dissapointment.

												The reverse tower defense genre may strike you as odd, but it WORKS.  I love this game!  Wish they made more of them.			"

												Firstly it's fairly clear when playing that this is was designed with tablets in mind; big simple UI elements and minimal additional controls. The story seems to exist solely because there needed to be a reason for the game to become increasingly difficult and begins to logically collapse if you give it more than a passing thought. However, it never tries to make the story the driving point, so it's more of a neutral point than a con.There's no commander to control in this, which simplifies things slightly (both a pro and a con).If you enjoyed the other Anomaly games, I'd say it's worth a whirl.

												Expansion (standalone) for a great reverse Tower Defense game. So, what you can expect from it? 12 levels and few ""Art of War"" trials. Not so much but you can spend a few hours playing it and even more if you are trying to unlock every achievement. In my opinion, Anomaly Korea is way easier than main game or Mobile Campaing. Really, the only levels I had some trouble was the last one in campaing and first one in trials - the campaing one is really complex and the one in trials... well, let's say it was hard only because my lack of creativity. Graphics, music and almost everything is same, like in previous Anomaly games but that doesn't mean it's a bad thing. The only problem is, like with Mobile Campaing, Anomaly Korea is a game which I can recommend only for fans of series. Even TD games fans have sometimes liking it since you are the one making attacks, so if you are not familiar with Anomaly games it's better to check out main game first and if you will enjoy it, then you will love everything from this series.

												As much as this game is fun for a few hours, this game is leagues behind the other ""anomaly"" games: it only has a few levels, all the levels are rather formulaic and the game just simply appears to be a ""downsized version"" of the original.			"

												Not bad. Short but probably the right length. BETTER THAN THE MOBILE CAMPAIGN. The art of war bonus missions are a fun, uhh, bonus and provide some variety. I almost didn't play them but was glad I did. Some of the levels are good at directing you toward a certain solution or putting restraints on your normal capabilities so it keeps the game fresh for the most part. Still, by the end I went from playing on Advanced to Casual mode just to finish up as there was no good reason to go hardcore on a game I decided I wasn't going to attempt to master andd get all the achievements in.

												PC port of a tablet tower-offense (?) game. The gameplay is fairly basic and entertaining, but the hilariously bad voice-acting is well worth the purchase.			"

												Sometimes FPS drops significantly, maybe it is just for me i don`t know. otherwise Anomaly Korea is nice and fun game with tactical varieties. I will also try other Anomaly games when they are on sale. I definitely recommend this one, it should be nice purchase especially when it is on sale.			"

												This is the first Anomaly game that I play. Also the first tower offense game that I've tried. The gameplay is fairly simple, by choosing the routes where the convoy of vehicles advances. But there's much more to it than that. Different tanks, different turrets, different lanes passing through strategic corners or resources, etc. Graphics are really good, and so is the setting.			"

												Similar to the previous titles in this line, this is a reverse tower defense. You choose your vehicles and upgrade them as you navigate a maze destroying towers and machines in your way. This installment has all the fun of the earlier ones. I'm loving it.			"

												Anomaly Korea, is a pseudo-expansion of ""Anamoly Warzone Earth"", the tower offensive design while interesting  doesn't make up for the fact that this game is a mobile port and the controls aren't as smooth as you may want in a tower defense game, overall its not a bad game and if you enjoyed other games in the Anamoly series you'll probably enjoy this short side excursion of a game.

												There is an alien invasion in Korea und your are the only hope for human kind to defend the earthlings from the aliens by coordinating a small group of weaponized vehicles through the aliens' tower defence.The graphics and sounds are nicely done. The game mechanics are simple while forcing you to solve the riddle-like levels. How do you coordinate the vehicles without losing even a single one? Are you able to destroy all the towers? It's harder than it seems ...			"

												A bit disappointing.. it's a step backward from the original Anomaly. OK, so it's a mobile 'port'.. but would it have been so difficult to implement the same controls as the original PC release? The navigaional map feels claustrophobic, and having to click 'n drag your way around seems silly.. as do activating the big clunky ability icons. Also gone is the commander from the original.. now it is only the vehicles under your control. Negatives aside, it is far from a complete disaster and still fun to play.			"

												Interface is a bit clunky owing to it being a port from touch enabled devices, otherwise the gameplay is just as fun as Warzone Earth. A bit on the shorter side. Totally worth it at a discount.			"
