												After trying countless methods to get this game work,I gave up.That was on the Windows 8 days.Now I have Windows 10 so I reinstalled it and still I had like 5 fps.However I found a guide:First set configeditor.exe and discipl2.exe files in both catalogues Dark Prophecy/ and Rise of Elves/ to run as administrator. Then change both config files to use resolution1024x768 and thick ""Use Direct3D"", ""Strech to full"", ""Compability mode"". Unthick ""Play intro when game starts"".I couldn't ♥♥♥♥in' believe it. It worked!!!!!  I don't know if it will work for you,but give it a try. "

												Greatest strategy ever, amazing plot, sweet graphic. I have spent hour playing that game. The races are unique, every race has their own special units, that make your gamepley different everytime you play another race. The campaign is awesome. I have heard that there is problem running that game on Windows 7, though I have managed to start it.Please try this:1. In the Steam game library, right click the game2. Select ""Properties""3. Select the ""Local Files"" tab4. Click ""Verify integrity of game cache""This has been known to easily fix the ""Failed to find steam"" error. If the issue persists then it is recommended you try these steps:1. Open the Start Menu, right click ""Computer"", and select ""Properties"".2. From the column on the left of the new panel, select ""Advanced System Settings"".3. From the new dialogue, press ""Environment Variables..."" (at the bottom of the ""Advanced"" panel, just above ""OK"", ""Cancel"", and ""Apply"").4. In the top half of the newly opened dialogue (User variables) if there is:a - no existing entry for PATH, use ""New..."" to add it (Variable Name: PATH, Variable Value: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam -- i.e. wherever you have Steam installed).b - already an entry for PATH, use ""Edit..."" to add ;C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam (or wherever your Steam is installed) at the end of the existing value. (Note the semi-colon to separate the value that was already there from the new bit with the Steam path.)5. Press ""OK""6. Log off and log on again. You should now be able to run the Steam titles without problems.If you have further issues I suggest you contact Steam Support as there may be issues with your Steam Client.After that the game will start, but it can be really slow ( about 1 FPS), try than setting at highest possible graphic settings and check box called 'User Direct3D'. It starts on fullscrean, but it is slightly smaller than your whole monitor, so it should allow you to run it and enjoy that great game!			"

												Bought it and played it for 8 hours straight. Great stuff, similar to HOMM III. (Starting it in the 1024x768 resolution gets rid of the ""Can't initialize"" error. I had no other issues with the game and I can certainly say that it is not a broken version like some of the users said about it.) The only downside is that much like HOMM III, the gameplay is a huge timesink so prepare to notice a couple of hours flying by if you start playing it.			"

												To anyone who is concerned by the reviews claiming that this is unplayable; do not listen. I am on windows 7 and managed to get the game working in about five minutes by running it in compatability mode and tweaking the game settings.

You may have to fool around with different settings to make it run well but don't over look ths classic 4x especially not with such a low price.			"

												The game has some issues running on a newer issue(Mostly in the starting up process), but get over that and its fine. Hopefully they will update it, since they loaded up a Windows 7 compatiable version of the original game.Anyway, if you played Heroes of Might and Magic, your KINDA in for a similar experience, but with multiple differences. To call it a ""Heroes Clone"" would be inaccurate at best. You can level up your heroes, yes, but you also level up your units. Instead of producing hordes of units, your leveling up one unit, making keeping them alive more important. Even a low level unit like a cultist can level up and become a true tool of doom.All and all, I recommend this, but be careful if your running it on a newer system.			"

												Just wanted to say that I am thrilled to have access again to this classic old school turn-based strategy game, with some of the best artwork in the genre. I was a bit leery after reading all the Win 7 & 8 problems people had, but I have had none and the game is running perfectly, smoothly and without lag on Windows 8.1. I followed the instructions in the forums here to disable Steam overlay, set the exec file properties to WinXp svc pak 2, and set the config editor to enable""Use Direct 3D,"" and it worked like a charm. Great game, one of the original 'just one more turn' time sinks, and thanks to Steam for making it available and to those who did the troubleshooting to allow it to run on modern systems.			"

												A dark gothic themed fantasy turn based strategy games with many factions. Plays rather simply with squad formations mixed in with map exploration. The combat system differs from other entries of the genre and might either hit strongly or miss depending on the audience. There is a degree of repetitiveness into carrying your squad through every mission but your leader will carry over from mission to mission and will attain godlike strenght. Very memorable units and very strong story. The overland map does not look very well but once you get used to it it has the decency to be effective in displaying what you need to know and the style is still appropriate to the setting. The combat and zoomed in sequences look very good still in my humble opinion. This game will run well on any machine except for a slow mouse cursor bug that can be fixed. I will edit my review once I find up to date information regarding it.			"

												Such an amazing game. The Legend! Somewhere close to the HoMM on that turn-based-strategy Olympus. The core features of this game - amazing visuals and simplified strategy part, countless hours of fun!++Visuals - beautiful character arts, cool mobs models, brutal heroes and colorful landscapes - everything perfectly mixed to create an amazing feeling of a magical journey to the land of Elves and Demons! Even in 2k16, this game still looks gorgeous, despite the fact that there is no hi-res (So i would recommend using old square ELT monitor for the better experience)++Soundwork - 10/10 OST, amazing sound effects and what's more important - 11/10 voice over - seriously this game is the best example of how to make the perfect game.+Great campaigns - All the campaigns - humans, demons, undeads, elves or dwarves are equally interesting, and what's more important, you export your hero from one scenario to another, and this feature saved even in a single! or multi!player - means you can take your hero through the countless battles, and complete harder and harder missions over time! Or you can battle your friends over and over again, exporting your best hero, so you will have more and more intense battles every time.+Nonlinear units leveling system - means you can try various strategies with every faction, there is no PERFECT build, you have to find the one that fits you.+Intense hot-seat sessions - such a great party game, you can play with your friends or your girlfriend, a single game can take HOURS to be completely finished, yet you can finish the game pretty quick - once you lose your main army over some stupid mistake for example :0 Some personal suggestions in the end - for a better experience, try to find an old machine to play this gem - this game has its problems on new computers, yet they are fixable - fps issues, screen resolution etc - everything is fixable up to win10.2 - for better multiplayer experience I would suggest that small mod, that enables leadership 5 on all level 1 heroes (except thieves and other heroes that supposed to have leadership 1) that makes the game more dynamic, faster start and stuff.

You will need all the arsenal to conquer your foes: cunning, intel, what upgrades to pick for your units, because your units will gain XP in battles, being ruthless (or compasionate!), and so on and so forth.It is worth every single penny because when you press Play you will not start a game, you will enter a true fantasy world where all your actions matter!

												IMO, Disciples II's world is more appealing to me as of Heroes'.+ Atmosphere - the old-school, dark & gritty, renessaince-like fantasy atmosphere is so good on this one.+ Combat & Creatures - really like, that there is no 10k skellies/30 angels or whatever: you can have 5 creatures (+your hero) and battling through various enemies like demons, undead, dwarves, elves, nagas...you name it. Also you can build your little army, many ways to develop your creatures i.e. there are 4-5 ""evolution"" for a human warrior to finally have a Paladin or a Defender of Faith (each of evolution have different advantages/stats etc.).+ Random Map Generator - yeah, it has a random map generator tool as map editor: occasional dead ends on random maps here and there, but thats okay.+ Resources - I absolutely fell in love with those crystals and how to get them. Placing a rod near a mine or any other location will turn the world from the abandoned look to your faction's, the same for your Capitcal City and smaller towns.- Support: no proper widescreen 16:9 support "

												Great classic of turn-based goodness! Still is amazing to playthrough; aged pretty well compared to other old games.Great art design, good ambient tunes and simple yet engrossing game mechanic. It's also quite challenging on higher difficulties, and the average length of a game is pretty similar to a medium game of Heroes 3/4.Graphics are typical for the year, consisting of pre-rendered assets converted into 2D animated sprites. It's very similar to Heroes 4 in that department.It's a shame that there was no proper follow up to this old gem. Highly recommend this game over the 3rd iteration.			"

Some people say it works for them, but 90% of new threads on community page are people who can't launch it properly. You CAN sort of play it with the sound disabled and by turning off the steam overlay. But in this game sound design is excellent, and helps the immersion in this fantasy world a lot. So playing without it - you lose about half the charm the game has.Shame on whoever was responsible for releasing this game in such an unplayable state.

												This is a fantastic game. The turn based battle-system is simple and visually pleasing. The story diaglogue messages will contain the occasional typo, but what are you gonna do? Character artwork is excellent (especially Empire), and the music is superbly done - that is to say, you barely notice its effect, until you turn it off.I had a problem getting this to work initially, too. When it was ""running"", I went into the Task Manager, and changed the process properties directly to run in compatibility mode (WinXP SP3). I also run it without the steam overlay, but I don't know if that matters.My biggest gripe about this game (and it's a pretty big one) is every game is either part of the saga, or a pre-designed quest. There's no ""rock-em-sock-em"" mode where you pick a faction and just play. Unless I'm missing something, which is totally possible.			"

I remember making a Banshee (a disposable side character) and leveling her through all the skirmish maps as far as she would go.The gameplay is similar to Heroes of Might and Magic 3, get a hero, scout the map, capture cities, get treasure, and for me it has a similar boring-in-a-good-way feeling. The difference is that this is more RPG progression focused, you'll take a single hero over many missions and, instead of army stacks each, individual soldiers in your hero's party gather XP and go through several ""evolutions"".A problem for me was that sound broke and I couldn't get it back, which is a shame because it's pretty good and adds to the experience. Unfortunatelly this doesn't seem uncommon and I think alt tabbing out of the game is what broke it for me.			"

												Good old game with a nice story behind it. While I had problems running it in the beginning (my computer is I7 - Win 8.1 - 64 Bit based) I found out that the problem was connected to the audio settings (have a look in the configuration editor) and its CPU Affinity (seems to have problems with more than one assigned to it...).Disabling Sounds and Music and setting the application to use only one CPU (easytoolz => CPU Affinity) solved my starting issues and the app ran fine.Having a deeper look into it however, the sound issues seem to be connected to the secondary buffer size (advanced sound settings). After increasing it to the maximum I could enable sounds and music too.			"

												I know this game for a long time, and it is one of my favourite ones. When I bought it I realized that there are ""some"" troubles with the product. I face some probems with the start (it just doesn`t work sometimes), so the game usually has to be restarted several times in a row to launch.  But when it does, everything is OK and this nostalgia, unusual visual style and unique gameplay are quite worth of the money and dosens of hours spent on it. But it would be much better to get the Gold Edition if you want to experience much more and try completely functional Elf faction - but unfortunately it is closed on Steam at the moment, so... ;-)  But still, this purchase is worth of money, just because of old memories and old-school unique gameplay.

												Disciples II offers classic Turn based strategy gameplay and a compelling narrative that has an immersive dark atmosphere. A timeless classic who's art and production values are present in every facet of the game. From the lavish gothic UI and richly detailed character art and units the game is very beautiful. The art style has always made the Disciples series stand out. Gorgeous illustrated Unit portraits complement the nicely detailed maps, models and UI. When Disciples II originally launched it didn't garner the sort of appreciation it deserves. It became a bit of a cult classic and had improved on nearly every aspect of its forebear Disciples: Sacred Lands. I remember my first experience with the game was the demo I received through PC Gamer. I was hooked and drawn into its dark world. Its fantasy atmosphere was just that good. I loved that demo so much that when I saw Disciples II:Dark Prophecy and its two expansions were released in the ""Fantasy 6 pack"" I had to pick it up. Disciples II represents the very best of turn based strategy games and is right up there with the likes of Fire Emblem.			"

												Runs on Windows 7. Not sure where the compatibility issues with the steam version are, because it's working for me. A pretty good continuation of the original Disciples. What feels like the same great mechanics, with the added bonus of a facelift for the combat.Would be interesting to see if they develop a high-def version like Age of Empires, because some units get lost behind buildings, and amongst the landscape.

												This game has some similarities to the Heroes of Might and Magic Series. But those similarities are superficial, in truth it is using a different combat resolution and even a different leveling system. So buyers of Heroes might get disappointed by the game.There are several issues with stability under Windows 7, Windows 8 - those can get quite anoying and therefore you have to be careful if you buy this game and running it on a modern machine to make sure that you know exactly what you do. And then, again a big difference it has with Heroes and one that is taking the air out of the game, it's quite slow - no not as slow as in a chess simulation, it is slow with the enemy movements and with resolving enemy purchases and upgrades. It can get quite ugly waiting for the AI to make it's moves and it takes away a lot of fun. At the time of the original release the game might have been an OK - Game, but it hasn't the qualities of a classic game that turns up in the hall of fame. The Story was, not only slightly, weird - that again is holding against the game. On the pro side it has decent, but outdated graphics (given the original was release 2002 and Gallean's Return is from 2005) and a ""good"" soundtrack, that might get a bit enervating after some hours of gambling.

												DON'T BUY IT, DOESN'T WORK ON WINDOWS 7!I'm really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Steam released such a Win-7 incompatible sh*t and asked money for it. Since I bought it I managed to start the game twice in total with sound and all and once it's running it runs without a problem, but each time I spent about 15 minutes trying to start the g*ddamn game before I succeeded, without any sign why a configuration that worked once doesn't work the next time I try it. There doesn't seem to be any logic behind what arbitrary settings finally make the game work for that one single try. I would seriously demand a refund (if Steam did refunds) for selling a product that just simply doesn't bloody work 95% of the time.The game itself is very good, but now I regret that I didn't buy it on GOG instead of Steam...--Update after many months of playing the GOG version: The game itself is excellent and I really recommend it if your system is not Win7 (or if they solved that error in the meantime, I haven't checked).

												When this game was first came out I would have loved it, but because I only recently played this game it had not aged well compared to the many options out there. After the main campaign I had my fill and didn't even play the included expansion.You run through a series of levels only bringing your hero with you. The hero gains levels and you choose between different options to improve and keeping most of the items you find during the game, letting you customize your hero. There is the risk in the game that if you lose most of your leveled units your new unleveled units won't be able to defeat anything. This is a problem others have posted and having played the game I can see it happening to people.After all that, if the game still looks interesting enough, give it a try. You might like it.			"

												Disciples II was one of the best games of my childhood and it has a special place in my heart. Amazing atmosphere , great combat and improvement system and interesting storyline. If I had to rate this game due to this, I would give it 8.5/10. BUT THE STEAM VERSION DOES NOT WORK! I mean, sometimes it works, but it's really hard to achieve. I've tried to play it on two PCs and a netbook, but it looks always the same - compatibility mode, disabling nearly everything in configuration setup and playing in 1024p can give you a CHANCE TO PLAY, if you are patient enough. So overall: 2/10. I noticed that it is the problem with many older games. But if they are being sold on Steam, and someone is paying to play them, they should run, or at least had a note ""it may not run, purchase on your own risk"". I'm really disappointed.			"

The hero gains levels and you choose between different options to improve and keeping most of the items you find during the game, letting you customize your hero. There is the risk in the game that if you lose most of your leveled units your new unleveled units won't be able to defeat anything. This is a problem others have posted and having played the game I can see it happening to people.After all that, if the game still looks interesting enough, give it a try. You might like it.			"

												Serious issues occures during startup of game which lead to situation when its not possible to run game at all.Only responce from support is to turn off firewall and other applications which will already collapse security and makes computer defensless.That was very fine old game, and if there will be no issues like that for sure they will receive PLUS. But in that condition as its sold at steam they are worth double MINUS.			"

												TL;DR + and - at the end.In short - amazingly good turn based strategy, that is still unbelievably good today, so many years later.In long - I don't know what the story is all about. I don't really care. My enjoyment comes from the gameplay. I love interesting new innovative gameplay mechanics, that are well implemented in the game itself. So here we go. After playing Heroes of Might and Magic III (amazing game, check it out), i was thinking ""This is the best, TBS can ever be"". And then i discovered Disciples 2. Amazingly beautiful game, great depth in each race with the unit leveling, almost endless replayability with all the skill and items customization... The depth of this game don't come from adding more and more races and units and what not, like Heroes III does, just one new gameplay mechanic gets introduced, and the entire balance of everything shifts, because everything is interconnected. I was shocked, that i needed special character to capture territory, i need special skill to equip ancient artifacts, if i dig up an item from somewhere, i don't just know how to use it. This game borders with RPGs as well. I was playing and I noticed a grave. I clicked on it, and it told me who killed who on that place. Attention to detail. Today we will have huge particle explosion and nothing else. This game keeps record on who have you killed and where. I love this kind of stuff. So well done, so well implemented, all intertwine together to create this beautiful game. I can't believe no other game tried even, to create that kind of gameplay. 10 years old, still unmatched.+ beautiful visuals+ deep complex rewarding gameplay+ I need to give another point to the gameplay. One plus is not enough.+ works fine on Win 7+ attention to detail beyond many today's games- not scaling at all for high resolutions			"

I followed all the thinks they said to do and still never works, then on top of it Steam will not issue a refund and so for the last year and a half I have sent a weekly refund.

I played this game a number of years ago and simply needed to play it again. A solid and yet simple blend of startegy and turn based RPG combat, highly recommended to anyone vaguely interested in those genres to pick it up and give it a go. Nostalgia clouds my judgement but even so, 10/10!			"

												Fantastic HoMM-style turn-based strategy RPG built around Norse mythology marred by some poor game design choices. There's great variety between the races and each has their own campaign, with each faction having a distinct style. The combat is unique and feels like Ogre Battle but this is also one of it's biggest problems; similarly to Ogre Battle, if all of your units in a party die, they are gone forever. Your favorite hero and his units will transfer between missions so this means if one of your super-units dies you can potentially throw the campaign. The terrain control mechanic is a great visual representation of your area control but I find it downplayed in many missions because of a turn limit or boss rush. Hero customization is diverse and has more options than HoMM but they are slower to level up. Although it has aged poorly, this is a great HoMM alternative that is worth checking out if you're a fan of strategy games.			"

												This game is kind of a mixed bag.On one hand, I really like the unit designs and atmosphere of the game.On the other, the actual gameplay is pretty terrible.The problem with the game is that it advertises itself as a strategy game when the strategy is really to have your one leader and one band of guys roam the map fighting things...in turn based fashion.  To top this all off, only one faction (2 if you count the elves) get healers, so the end result is moving your stack of dwarves/demons/undead out of the base, blowing up some random crap, and going back to base to heal.  If you are playing with harder AI you will receive the privilege of getting pummeled with map spells which the AI can drop all day every day but you are limited by resources.  You take your one hero through each level and only the hero, meaning the first part of every level is releveling up the support peons.Game design suffers too, with such gems as:-units who can stunlock the entire enemy party!-the final boss who can stunlock your entire team AND deal damage while doing it!-front-line units who are immune to weapons, with the drawback, that, um....-each faction does only one type of elemental damage (save the dwarves) meaning that if you ever run into say, a dragon while playing as the devils, you're totally screwed.I want to like this game, but the gameplay just doesn't justify it.

												So i started playing this game again, i put around 500 hours on it before i new of Steam i own the box and Disks as well never did get Galleans's Return though i have Disciples II: Dark Prophecy and Disciples II: Rise of the Elves.What i need to do now is figure out how to get the Gold of both DP and Elfs, i am a Steam user and like things here only, its simple for me to use. (game start issue fix below)Started with my all time favorite DWARFSThe Mountain ClansTen years have passed since the death of the Dwarven Highking Sturmir Thunderhammer; ten years of relative peace for the dwarves. Since the end of the war against Mortis' Undead legions the Dwarves have become more determined than ever to recover their lost Runic knowledge. Little do they know that they will soon face an enemy more dangerous than any Undead abomination...The Mountain Clans are dwarves who live in mountain caves and possess runic powers, given to them by their god Wotan and rudimentary technology like steam engines and explosives. The Clans were allied to the Empire during the First Great War and still maintain a friendly relationship with the humans. The giants consider the dwarves to be their cousins and are willing to aid them in defending the mountains. The dwarven capital is guarded by Vithar, who sits at Wotan's right hand.Disciples II: Gallean's Return	2005	Gallean's Return contains the first two expansion packs, Servants of the Dark and Guardians of the Light precombined. This means that all the content of the base Dark Prophecy game is included as well.Disciples II: Servants of the Dark	2003	Contains:The original campaigns of 7 missions for the Undead Hordes and Legion of the Damned from Dark ProphecyTwo new mini campaigns of 3 missions (one for each race) that continue the storyline and start off with a high level of difficulty. A hero saved at the end of an original campaign may be imported for use in the mini campaign. If the player does not have a saved hero, several have been included with the game.Several other new minor features are included as well, such as new special characters, interface improvements, AI improvements and new maps.Servants of the Dark does not combine with the base Dark Prophecy game. When installed on a computer that already has Guardians of the Light installed it and Servants of the Dark are combined to form ""Gallean's Return"" which offers all the content of the base Dark Prophecy game in addition to the 4 extra mini campaigns as part of a single install. Gallean's Return was later sold separately.Disciples II: Guardians of the Light	2003	Released at the same time and the counterpart to Servants of the Dark, Guardians of the Light contains the original campaigns for the Mountain Clans and Empire as well as two new mini campaigns of 3 missions each, in a similar fashion to Servants of the Dark.Disciples II: Dark Prophecy	January 4, 2002	The base game contains 4 campaigns of 7 missions each for the Empire, Mountain Clans, Undead Hordes and Legion of the Damned.Originally posted by Stranger_X:Hi!

												Honestly I have no idea how this game is, as I have never gotten to play it.  No computer whiz, so I don't know what the issue is but it will not run on my comp due to some sort of compatibility issues.  Very well known bug with the steam version, as you can do a quick forum search and find out more about.			"

												One of the great turn-based games, I do recommend this to anyone who likes Heroes of Might & Magic and won't be offended by being restricted to 4:3 aspect ratio.  However, it seems that Valve hasn't made even a token effort towards compatibility; ""out of the box,"" it won't even run.  You can get it to work eventually after scouting around the Internet, but you'd be much better served by buying this game from a vendor who bothered to provide a working product.			"

												Playing Disciples II is the Turn-Based Strategy equivalent of sitting at home buzzsawing through a huge bag of greasy, salty potato chips. I know for a fact that there are way better things I could be doing.  I also know that what I'm eating has next to no meaningfull nutritional content. They don't even taste especially good, and I'm getting bored and frustrated and only eating out of habit.  So why the hell am I still eating?!  Well, the game does look pretty, in that early-Rennaissance-variant Grimdark(TM) way. It also offers reasonably steady advancement in power, and a few head-scratching tactical challenges. Mostly, though, it comes down to grinding, hoarding and (save) scumming. Grinding: learn to recognize the fights your troops can survive and still gain meaningful XP from, keep hitting as fast as you safely can till your dudes gain a few levels and a commensurate capacity to curb-stomp anything other than the final battle (troop upgrade levels determine any fight that hasn't been pre-determined by magic or thief spam: a difference of one level guarantees the higher-tier army will win, two or more guarantees a massacre.)  Hoarding: get mines and mana nodes. Money is necessary for Grinding, since the buildings needed to upgrade your troops get hella expensive at tiers 4 and 5, while mana powers the spells that tilt combats. Use as little mana and money as needed to keep your troops alive and upgrading, then when the map's big bad comes into view burn it to guarantee a win. Cast every spell you can, twice if you can, send mobs of Thieves to soften up fortified armies, send disposable heroes leading quick-firing ranged units, you get the idea. Scumming occurs when those first two don't work, or are derailed by unforseen circumstances, which becomes more common as you climb the difficulty levels. The couple of different auto-save functions make this slightly less irritating. The end result is a game where fights can largely be predicted in advance (no tactical genius can offset spell bombardment or superior forces), and strategy between fights is largely a matter of trial and error. You can let it eat up a ton of time, or you could go play something more interesting. (Yes, I know this review sounds like a three-hundred-pound couch potato telling his kids to exercise. Remember, folks: hypocrisy is the debt vice pays to virtue.)			"

												Disciples II: Gallean's Return is a compilation edition that includes the base game, Disciples II: Dark Prophecy, plus the two standalone expansions Disciples II: Guardians of the Light and Disciples II: Servants of the Dark. Disciples II: Guardians of the Light is a stand-alone expansion that lets you dive into the fantastical world of Disciples II as either the Empire or the Mountain Clans.The Empire is decaying from within as self-proclaimed rulers struggle for control of the now vacant throne while a cruel Inquisition sweeps across the human lands, causing rebellion and misery. Meanwhile the Clans, recovering from their near-destruction, begin to reunite their tribes. They have received divine instructions and now seek to uncover an ancient ritual that will let them communicate with their god, Wotan.Disciples II: Servants of the Dark is a stand-alone expansion that brings you into the never-ending quest for supremacy as either the Undead Hordes or the Legions of the Damned.On the dark side, the Legions of the Damned enact a plan to spread Bethrezen’s plague across Nevendaar. They sense the threat brought about by the rebirth of the Elven god and will stop at nothing to steal this power for their own purposes. Perhaps most pivotal to the conflict, however, is Mortis and her army of Undead Hordes. After all, the rebirth of her husband Gallean was her doing. He had rejected her for what she had become, a twisted, heartless beast. Now she would teach her mate a lesson... one that would scar his people for eternity...			"

												Although a lot of these reviews claim this game is broken and unplayable on Win7, that isn't the case, as a few minor tweaks (compatibility, run as admin., etc.) will make the game run fine. However, the game is by far one of the most unbalanced and least enjoyable games I have ever played. Anyone who has ever played the Might and Magic series will certainly be familiar with a high level of difficulty, but in that series a thorough grasp of the game mechanics combined with  a few false starts as you acquaint yourself with the lay of land will ultimately allow you to complete the missions. To take another example, the excellent Age of Wonders series (my personal benchmark for strategy/rpg excellence) is often said to be punishing, but the fact is once you learn all the game's tools, it's a rich and highly rewarding experience and there's no reason why you can't complete missions in fine fashion.Disciples 2, on the other hand, is simply an exercise in masochism. Yes, the missions can be completed, but not without an excessive and highly frustrating amount of bloodletting, dying, reviving, etc., as from the start you will find that EVERY enemy on the map is stronger than you. Nor does it get better, as your character's progression -- should you be fortunate enough to carry one from one mission to the next -- is minimal at best and hardly matters compared to the strength of the monsters. Buffers offer only the most marginal of enhancements to your troops' stats, costly spells bestow laughable gains (10 fire damage to 300 HP monsters, oh boy), and hard-won battles are rewarded by the most modest and least consequential of loot drops.It's only been from sheer stubbornness that I've persisted to the second mission (halfway through and looking bleak, overpowered beasts everywhere), but frankly, aside from the so-so graphics and music, this game offers precious little in the way of enjoyment.

												meh, If you're really familiar with classical Heroes of Might and III video game, and you have never played this game, I don't recommend it for you. It was maybe playable when it was released, but it didn't age well, like Heroes III.The interface is confusing, graphics are lacking overall good design, and gameplay is not that great compared to Heroes franchise.If you like collecting classical games, it is MAYBE worth it when it is on sale, otherwise it is not worth it, really.If you wonder how would I rate this game from scale 0-10, I would give it maybe 3-4 from modern gaming perspective, and maybe max 6-6.5 from classical perspective, but I've never played before any game from Disciplies series (when they were probably somewhat popular), so I might be wrong.TL;DR: If you like modern games, do not even consider buying this even on sale (unless you buy every game on Steam).

												Total waste of bits.I must have left this game running in the background, because I sure didn't play it for more than an hour. I simply couldn't figure out what I was supposed to do or how to play. If there's a tutorial, I couldn't find it. Whatever I paid for this, it was too much, the game was a total waste for me, I got zero fun out of it.I recently reinstalled it, because I couldn't remember what it was or why I had it in my library. Now I know why I don't remember playing it - because I didn't.I guess it's part of a series or something, and they expect you to have played the earlier games so that you just instintively know what you're doing.

												This was one of my absolute favourites as a baby gamer. What caused me to responde so much about this game is its atmosphere: its high fantasy, decadent design, the beautiful beautiful isometric landscapes, the sombre, solemn music, the epic quality of the story. I recall the sheer pleasure in immersing myself in this dark world where there are no good sides and everything is permeated by this sort of gritty grandeur. Gameplay-wise, it is very similar to the Heroes of Might and Magic titles, with a decisively steeper difficulty curve. Resource management is particularly tricky in this one, especially once you get to play the biggest maps. The different factions are all very well characterised not only in terms of design and contextualization, but also in gameplay. Every single one of them plays different strategies best: the Legion of the Damned has excellent nukers and favours brief fights, the Undead Hordes deploys excellent crowd control, the Empire thrives in longer fights combining sustain and utility, etc.Also their power spikes - provided by mainly by unlocking units and spells - happen at different times for each faction, providing added layer of complexity to the gameplay. To know when and why invest to accelerate towards said power spikes is absolutely key if you want to play the highest difficulty level - definitely the most rewarding.Added perk: an excellent scenario editor. I had the time of my life crafting from scratch epic campaigns for my brother and friends using its gorgeous graphics and the dumb-proof interface. A wonderful experience.			"

												Disciples, the awesome turn-based strategy game. Some people may like it, but others will find it boring. Just look into it; it's interesting. ^_^			"

												You just pick one fraction (not mountain clans) and this game will guide you through amazing storyline. Battle system in this game is my love from the childhood. AI is pretty weak, but thats not a problem. That still would be hard and interesting game if you want it to be. Just make sure to crash all mountain clans on your way. Seriously- ♥♥♥♥ them			"

												This game is exceptional. It's leaps and bounds better than Disciples 3. I reallllllllly want them to make an HD version of this. Keep everything the same and just update the graphics. They would make bank! At least with me anyway!			"

												Would love to Recomend this game,  Its a great game.  But good luck getting it to load through steam. SMH   You will get a black screen staring at you most of the time.   when it does load if you get a skype call or need to do something else  and minimize the game screen when you go back it will not work correctly.   I was very happy paying this price for this game.  But  Ive only gotten it to load twice so far and feel a little jipped.			"

												Disciples II is strongly reminiscent of Heroes of Might and Magic III mixed with the Ogre Battle series of games, and the mix is succesfully engagingThose familiar with HoMMIII should feel comfortable with the turn based play, isometric map, resources, town building and creature tiers. The primary difference is in the combat.As in Ogre Battle, combat takes place between squads that meet up on the map. Rather than stacks of creatures, each member of a squad is a single creature with a health bar. A number of rules dictate the squad composition: A squad has a limited number of slots, a large creatures may take up multiple slots, some units can only attack from the front row, others from both. To this end it's greatly engaging experimenting with squad composition and placement, building countersquads, attrition squads, and so on. I recommend this to fans of either of the two games it resembles, or simply fantasy TBS's in general			"

												A great time killing grindy RPG time battle game where you get to level your units and unleash holy hell on the enemy.  I like the art style and graphics, and the different factions are all unique as well.			"

												Worked on win 7 x64 out of the box for me. But there are a lot of complaints about compatibility issues. Refused to work in UWS UHD but did work in 1920x1080 (stretched) and worked as intended in 4:3 aspect ratio.			"

												A good mix of strategy and role playing this game is, with four factions, each with a decent sized campaign to boot, all following along a similar story path, but to their favor/disadvantage.  Very good atmosphere.The only downsides are that the game is not very optimized to run on newer systems, and the AI can and will be nearly flawless/cheaty on higher difficulties.			"
