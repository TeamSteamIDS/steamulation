												Upon completion of Nethergate (8/31/14, 5:54am), I've now finished every single Spiderweb game on steam on torment difficulty.In celebration I am considering setting up a shrine on the street and charging people 5 dollars to come and soak in my magnificent countenance.""Come!  See the man with no life!"" the brochures will say, ""So little life, that he spent over 900 hours playing through the Geneforge saga, Nethergate, Avadon 1 and 2, Escape from the Pit, and the second Avernum trilogy on the hardest difficulties!""Mothers will shush their children and tell them not to look as they pass by, the occasional kindly priest or do gooder will sometimes throw a few coins my way and mutter prayers to themselves wondering how one could have fallen so far, while groups of teenagers and young men will jeer and mock, throwing old tin cans and bits of rock at my head.But I shall sit serenely in my state of old school isometric RPG nirvana, my body covered in muck and spit, but my mind drifting outside of the cares of this world, pondering the time that my party was nearly wiped and I fought off a group of chitrachs with just my priest, or the time in Avernum 5 when I spent 20 minutes killing a wolf with 4,000 hp, or the time in Geneforge 4 when I repeatedly reloaded a giant battle to save all the Serviles because I couldn't bear to see a single of the cute little buggers get caught in the crossfire, or that bloody, ♥♥♥♥ing, redbeard boss fight (which, truth be told, I never did bother completing).  In short, while physically present, I shall have passed on from this world, lost in a realm a bit higher than the real, forever and wholly beyond the fray.....or at least until Spiderweb releases another game, anyway.

												Ave!A great, old school rpg and its really immersive for its archaic 2D graphics, as soon as you get a hang of it, you're in Ancient Roman era , fantasy britannia. Details and depth are really nice with many easter eggs, rich with history and has a really good sense of humour. The mechanics are satisfactory, got traits like fallout and skill point buy like MM's. It's sand-box'ish you can do your quests in any order as long as your party is skillful enough, travel anywhere if you have enough food in your bag, talk to everyone in game world provided you're not a Roman trying to find his/her way in a brigantes village. You can play both as Romans and Britons, they have slightly different stories.This game totally amazed me, by giving me much more than i had anticipated, made me wonder what is missing in most modern games. If you like 2D rpgs and can endure the mechanics like of Might & Magic, it will be a worthy purchase for its price.8/10 , at least			"

												I was exploring an abandoned mine when I found a deep pit. The game said the pit was really deep, but that I could survive the fall. The game also said that there were ""shiny"" things in the bottom of the pit. I jumped in the pit. There was nothing there. Had to load an old save game. 10/10 true-blood old school rpg, will scratch the itch.			"

												I love Spiderweb Software games - they take a long time to play, and they are almost as primitive as you can get with their graphics.  The stories are great, though, and the worlds are detailed and full of things to explore.  The UI on this one takes a little getting used to, but it's second nature soon enough.			"

												NetherGate:Resurrection is a classic! I played the original Nethergate back in the day as well as this update when it came out. This version is fantastic, just like the other. Choose Roman or Celt for different experiences, abilities and encounters! This is a turn based/party-based RPG with a lot of replay value and excellent leveling system and story. If you like classic RPG goodness sprinkled with historical context, you can't go wrong with NetherGate:Resurrection			"

												Nethergate: Resurrection is a worthy addition to the game collections of both role playing aficionados and those who want a fun game with a great story and freedom to go where you want to. It won't wow you with breath-taking graphics and music, but the gameplay will keep you entertained.			"

												The game's wit and humor can only be matched by it's strategical prowess and customization. You'll have plenty to do for both sides, especially for the cheap price of 5 bucks. Just be warned, this is an old game, so take that into mind when you are fiddling around with the interface.			"

												Nethergate was my gateway into computer RPG and shareware alike.. I bought a MacWorld magazine with a demo of Nethergate on it for my PowerPC 7300 and the rest was history. Spiderweb Software has provided me with a couple decades of entertaining fun through Nethergate and the rest of their games; so its fun to see their games being ""resurrected"".			"

												Nethergate is and old game but that does not make it any less great.The game takes place in the ancient roman times, you either pick between the romans or celts. Both offer a unique campaign and different gameplay styles which adds a lot of replayability. You control a group of various characters, typical rpg archetypes that have strength and weaknesses. The game offers a very good story campaign, despite the old graphics the game is very rich in text and dialogue. Furthermore it's very well written and quite atmospheric and just adds a lot to the overall enjoyability of this game. It might not be for everyone but I highly value the flavor texts and attention to detail.The story itself is interesting and actually really unique, you party needs to fulfill various quests and venture into the unknown facing all kinds of dangers and delicate situations. The game is a grid based tactical rpg which is played in turns. The gameplay is actually quite smooth and holds up well to this day. You have access to a large overworld and visit various places to fulfill your quests.The only downside of this game might be the outdated graphics but don't get me wrong it still plays very nicely and does not feel that clunky. It's definitely worth it for someone who values good rpgs with solid mechanics and nicely narrated storyline.			"

												One of my favorite Spiderweb Software games.  It's pretty old and doesn't have some of the improvements introduced in his later games but it's still really good regardless.  I really like the setting with the mix of historic and magical, at the time I had never seen anything like that and I still haven't seen a game that covers this particular time and area.  The game world is friggin massive with lots and lots of hidden things, and sometimes hidden monsters that will stomp all over you when you initially encounter them (come back later to see what they were guarding).  Being able to choose to play either the Romans or Celts is also really cool because the Romans have much better options in terms of raw military might while the Celts have more access to magical power.  There's also plenty of weird humor and the game doesn't alway take itself seriously.  I highly recommend this game if anyone is a fan of old-school cRPGs with a massive number of things to see and do.			"

												I wanted to like Nethergate, but the reality is I do not think the game liked me.  Like many of Spiderweb CRPG's it is more a labor of love than a polished effort.  If you have played other of their games and like the mechanics you'll be fine.  I liked the choice between playing Celts and Romans quite a bit.  The problem with the game is mostly none of the tools you really need (which is a common issue with Spiderweb's games) are in the game.  The quest/journal is laughably bad, after taking a break for a couple months I got back into the game and it was of no use.  I had the choice between replaying the game which I had invested a fair amount of time in or uninstalling and walking away.   I chose the later with zero regret.If it is on sale and you can tough through the multiple flaws, it might be tolerable.  Barely, but I would still not recommend it.			"

												While I enjoyed some of the Avernum titles this one has not entranced me. In fact because of the way it is displayed it is not only not engaging but downright hard to play because of the tiny graphics. (Even with the ""fixed"" resolution ap at the beginning it looks very poor.) And frankly it just wasn't my cup of tea. However if you like Rome based games (the game takes place in Roman Controlled Albion (because England is not yet a thing) and that may appeal to you. I did not get far so I am not really saying buy or don't buy but beware that it may be unappealing because of the size of the game window and graphics within. That said, if it is on sale at $0.99us or so that isn't a terrible price to pay to find out you don't enjoy it.			"

												Good game, well worth the price but it is very frustrating. You spend the majority of 10-20 minutes creating your party and fine tuning it the way you want, then you need to go and find the person who issues you your first quest. Then you go and do your quest, but you get stopped by numerous enemies who seem to be able to attack twice as often as you can. They don't do a whole lot of damage but it is still frustrating to be killed by a goblin who attacks twice as fast as you and you can't defend or anything. The movment and combat can be a little glitchy at times. It's not a bad game, it's not a great game. 7/10.			"

												I enjoy games that tell a story. Nethergate (so far) has been interesting. The graphics are not great, but after a short while I really stopped noticing them. The UI is fairly easy to get to grips with and rarely causes a problem. The turn based combat is fun, and thw game keeps me interested.I highly recommend reading through the help files.I think this is worth getting if you enjoy the old style RPGs.			"

												This game is fantastic, and I'm pretty sure that it's not even nostalgia talking. Cons: No music (beyond the simple music in the main menu), the ambient sounds that it plays in some areas are kind of awful, the graphics are archaic, the ui is not super intuitive, and in general it feels like you are playing a game that was made in 1998 (spoilers: you are)Pros: Despite all the cons I listed, this game is still REALLY fun and immersive! I played as the Celts and the story hooked me right from the beginning when your party of adventurers is summoned for mysterious reasons to the fortress of Nethergate. Although there is some historical context to the game, you are soon introduced to some distinctly non-historical creatures. You are plunged, in true fantasy rpg fashion, into a cave full of goblins to pilfer back a stolen relic of great significance, or perhaps into a fairie temple to bargain, or even to a dragon's lair. What really shines about this game is the attention to detail. The game is brimming with secret areas, rare treasures, rich detailed descriptions, interesting characters, easter eggs, and little clever touches everywhere. Combat feels good even after a thousand battles due to well-paced progression in terms of spells, equipment, and enemies. Playing on the standard difficulty, I felt that the game was challenging enough to require me to reload my save plenty of times, but never  punishing enough to make me ragequit. You always want to try just one more time because you know you can do better if you just used a different spell, or started the fight in a slightly different formation.So basically if you want to play an old, classic rpg that not only shows its age but wears it like a badge of honor, buy this game. I think you will find an experience that is rich and full of life.			"

												NOSTALGIA IZ REALLiterally played this game for 9 minutes and I am amazed. Those 9 minutes were enough to bring me so many good memories from over 10 years ago, playing other games from this developer such all of the Geneforge series, Avernum, and even the super throwback 'Exile' series. This game is on sale till the 19th, if you want a game that will last you thousands of hours (who cares about the graphics) get this- in fact get every game Spiderweb software has :D. My favourite series was Avernum, oh the glory days :Dp.s. Nethergate was one my least favourite series but every game by Spiderweb was so good that this is  game is still incredibly godly			"

												5 hours in it feels like I barely started the tutorial. The amount of hours I feel I would need to put into exploring this game's world and plot is quite deterrent to me at this point of time, so I dropped it (maybe I'll pick it up again one day).Regardless, it seems like a substantial and rewarding RPG, full of lore and exploration. The mechanics, graphics and UI are obviously dated, but it doesn't really take away from the experience, actually they add some retro charm. It's a well made game that aged fairly well, recommended.			"

												I'm afraid as good as Nethergate is, there is better. Spiderweb games seem to either age poorly and are not for those without nostalgia/patience as a weapon or age poorly but are enjoyable low-budget games.  I'm going to say compared to Avernum and Avadon, this is not as good. I do, however, credit it for its approach.  You either play as Romans or Celts with differences between them slightly including fighting style perferences and storyline.  The celts favour magic over mundane combat, while the romans favour mundane combat over magic.  Though I have not gotten that far into the storyline, its just it takes far too long to get where it needs to be.  As someone with a lot of games in their library, if the game doesn't capture me in the first half an hour, then its going to be skipped over quickly. Its a sad reality for us here on Steam with large libraries (blame humble bundle).  Its a shame because back 5 years ago I'd have given it a LOT more time and day.  This is why I'm saying its dated... Its likely a really good RPG but its out on steam in the wrong time.  I now this was released once before long ago, but thats the thing.  When it was released, times were different and you didn't alwyas have access to a lot of games.  So Nethergate was great then.  :-/			"
