												Fall Weiss covers the German invasion of Poland. Starting September 1 1939 the game allows players to control the Germans, Polish or the Russian forces. Players have 122 turns (each representing one day) to either conquer Poland or hold against the invaders. Each of the three factions has its own victory conditions:   German: Defeat Poland and Peace with/or defeat Russia Poland: Hold against the GermansRussia Defeat of Poland and Peace with Russia(NOTE the following has been fixed by the developers and custom games are now working)There also appears to be the option of playing a custom game. Which gives the player the ability to decide which of the 10 countries they control and to set difficulty levels for each.  NOTE I have not gotten this option to work, getting a scenario is not compatible error. But it makes no real difference since most of the other countries play little role in the gameWhile I like the game it is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. The biggest concern is lack of manual or tutorial; (NOTE THERE IS A MANUAL IN THE GAMES INSTALL FOLDER)  why the developers did not include even a short description of some of the mechanics for the game is beyond me. Luckily for those who (like myself) have played other Wasteland games the basics are easy to get. of course I still have no idea the effects of HQs and supply depotsGame play   The game takes place on a huge (141 x 133) hex map. Players are also greeted with a large number of units; one example can be seen in the German army starting with 178 infantry regiments. With such a huge map and so many units it is a bit over whelming. And this is where I think the game is turning a lot of people off.  I personally like the game but it clearly is not for everyone. You go into this game with the knowledge that you got to have a plan. Now that can be said for any game of this type but Fall Weiss takes it to a whole new level. A good part of the game is about encircling your enemies and to do this you got to know what troops you are planning to head in each direction. Without the ability to buy new units (only re-enforce losses from starting units) planning becomes all that more important.  You got to plan your breakthroughs, decide which units will go through the gaps and where they will hook up with others units (from other gaps) to encircle and cut off the enemy supplies. I am not going to lie and say it is all fun and easy but it can be rewarding to see your plans come togetherCONS    No tutorial or manual        UPDATE: ANother player pointed out there is a manual in the games folding. It gives a little information on the use of HQs and suooly   If you play as Russia you spend the first 17 turns watching the Germans and the Polish fight while you wait to be allowed to cross the border  Pros    get to play all three sides. Of course there is probably little possibility of the Poles winning    developer talking about mod supportIs it worth it  That depends, if you do not want to try your luck at planning the battles of an entire theater of operations I say walk away now. I believe the German campaign will take around 6 hours, let's assume the Poles and Russians take four hours each; that is 14 hours of game play. Not mentioning the changing some settings like French attacking in the west. In the terms of game play time it is worth the $20 dollarsFor those who may already own Panzer Corps and its DLC, feel this games a little too deep or looking for a bit more, I would suggest waiting till it goes on sale.

												The Campaign Series: Fall Weiss is the first game from what can hopefully become a series of detailed wargames spanning all the important campaigns of WW2. Fall Weiss depicts German invasion of Poland in 1939, it is not the first game to do so, but it does stand out from the others in a few respects. Generally this conflict is seen as having two sides – Germany and Poland. Most games do not depict Soviet Union's involvement in it.Fall Weiss includes Soviet Union as one of the major players. This is a bit ahistorical, but offers very interesting possibilities. But you can even go beyond that, Fall Weiss uses the same engine as other Wasteland Interactive WW2 games, and here too you can go into advanced options. For example any country found on the map is playable.The game itself is played out on a very detailed map, while most of the action takes place on the territory of Poland it does span enough area in all the other directions to give place for unexpected developments.At first glance the game may seem similar to Panzer General and its descendants, and if you are thinking of the ease of play – yes it does. But contrary to Panzer General, units can work together and this makes a huge difference. By clicking on the target and then clicking on units around you select which units will take part in combat.The game does one original and both brilliant and terrible thing. Instead of displaying the strength of a unit as a number that shows the number of people/equipment, it displays its effective strength. So you do not have to take into account the technology, command bonuses etc. What you see is the final number, the effective strength. That's brilliant, but at the same time it can be confusing at times. So this system has both its pros and cons. The scale of the game means you have under your control hundreds of units conducting few separate smaller operations, so it is a true wargame that requires some thinking. Still, playing as Germany you really can't lose. Personally I find this game the best of all WI games so far.			"

												First, I would just like to say, A turn-based, World War 2 strategy game, where you can recreate specific engagements from The second world war sounds like a great idea. Unfortunately, Fall Weiss, has a problem, a very big problem. It loves to crash on loadup. Checked the forums and apparently a lot of people have the same problem. Now, I get that some games have bugs. I love Fallout 3 and New Vegas and they are both bugged to hell. Fall Weiss, isn't a name brand the way fallout is, so we expect it to have less issues, especially when it comes to actually loading the game.  Wastelands Interactive, who put out the title, apparently hasn't bothered to submit a hotfix to resolve this issue. After almost an hour of trying tinkering and changing settings, sifting through forums, I decided this game just isn't worth the hassle. So, for the first time ever, It gets a thumbs down, simply for being a bugged out game that doesn't want to load.			"

												Game for hardcore strategists that know what Panzer General series is. However, read reviews before you buy it so you can avoid disappointment. I give it thumbs up because it has potential and with some more effort it can be good.+ detailed units (regiments of about 3000 soldiers)+ detailed map+ historically correct (Soviet Union in alliance with Nazi Germany; Slovak, Hungarian and Lithuanian units)- feels hopeless if you want to play Poland, feels boring if you try to play Germany- Slovakia with todays Russia flag is historically correct but confusing (perhaps use the Tiso flag?)- graphics are waaaay to go (hex tiles in XXI century should use some better techniques - tile size should be larger than hex size and could use transparency on edges to blur with adjacent ones, multilayer hexes are very helpful and easy way to make graphics better, rivers should not bent with 60 deg angle and should not look like ribbons)- map seems to be stretched in north-south dimension (typical mistake with hex maps?)- gameplay... it could be a chapter on its own:  - learning curve, where the hell is learning curve? oh, there it starts, in the blue skies  - it takes ages before computer finishes move (anyone cares?)  - beside the one huge map and single campaign there should be some smaller, subset maps for single battles and skirmishes (game could be much more interesting at this level and it would be easier for players to start)			"

												I've tried and failed many times to stick my thick skull into this unbelieveably dense game. That in and of itself is not a criticism, but I finally sat down today to really take a full collective processing of this game to decide wether it be worth my time. I've come away a bit more wise for my struggles. For all its overwhelming scales and options, it's more or less a classic hexagonal strategy game, albeit with a lot of bizzare, unpolished choices mixed in. It's also an incomprehensive mess. Also trash. Here goes.The first time I booted FW up, I was stunned and confused, not entirely sure what was going on or what I was doing as the AI took its sweet time slaughtering my units.  If there is a fast forward button, I couldn't find it. This continual, sluggish bombardment coupled with absolutely no context or control made me back out quickly. I exited to desktop so quickly, in fact that my haste led to Weiss locking up my entire computer leading to an intense struggle for control in which I learned to not play this in fullscreen for future reference. That was the most thrilling experience I will ever have with this game.Daunted but not defeated, I took some time away to arm myself before the war. Coming back with a knowledge that a single campaign can last upwards of 10 hours depending on your faction and settings, I settled in for the long haul, and for the first turn I really got into the whole thing. Yeah, I'll admit, I could've used just a most infinitely basic tutorial, or even a bit of context outside of a lame quote from the past, but beggars can't be choosers. Yeah, couldn't really understand why my panzers were taking more damage from infantrymen than against other tanks on a completely flat plain, or why oh why were so many unit names overlapping. Is that a photoshop of a Model T Ford? How big is this map? Is Fall Weiss really just a massive scale garbage looking and sounding Advance Wars?Oh, it crashed again. Oh, it didn't save anything.Oh.And that's how I came to write this review. After reading through so many on both sides, I've come to really like the idea, it's just a shame FW fails on such a basic level. I want to like it, I want to get into it, but Fall Weiss fails to live up to any expectations it places and genuinely, wholeheartedly does not care if you play it or not. I've never played a game that felt so bored with itself. Also, just found out that there is one campaign map. One. 15 dollars, man. What might've had potential when it first came out 2 years ago, Weiss...sure doesn't anymore. If you're looking to get in to the armchair general genre of PC strategy, pass this one at ALL COSTS. There are plenty of superior titles, and really, this game isn't worth anyone's time. Go for Panzer General or the Front series from Talonsoft as some of the other reviewers suggested. I know I will.			"

												I am not often the person to NOT recommend games, but this game I can NOT recommend because the AI turns are too long, no tutorial, the fact you're just thrown directly into the game without knowing anything about the game at all just entirely ruins the gaming mood for me. I just think that if this game is to actually MAKE it as a good game, it needs serious improvements in a lot of area's. That's basically the whole story on why I can NOT recommend this game. Good day, thank you for reading & God Bless you folks.			"

Try running in windowed mode and it doesn't load the game at all, just hangs on the splash screen. Run in full screen and when you start a game it CTD when the load bar fills up.			"

												If, like me, you played and enjoyed Talonsoft's titles, East front, East front II and West front, and like me, you have been looking for a game that compares to those great games.......Don't get this !!! now i know the screenshots look reminiscent of the above mentioned titles and you would be forgiven for thinking it looks good, but, it's not, in my opinion, it's a sad wannabe title, i don't mind saying that i found it awkward, clunky and quite frankly boring.Good idea, already been done and i'm certainly glad i did not pay £10 or whatever it's being sold for on Steam.

With a bit of patience is also a good history lesson for younger players.Świetna gra dla graczy interesujących się drugą wojną światową i zwolenników gier turowych.

												So I got sucked in.  I read the reviews and was very leery of getting this.  While it is in my wheel house (love hex turn based wargames), the reviews were NOT good.  But when it made it down to under $5, i says to myself why not......So i get it, download it and start to play.  I made it exactly 1/100th of a turn.  I figured out how to move, moved 3 German units, destroyed 1 Polish unit with equal damage to my units......no personality, no hook to keep playing.  That's it, that's all.  Believe the reviews and don't buy it.			"

												Why is this game bad.... when it's problems seem so obvious and easy to fix? Menu: checkboxes with black ink checks on black background, nearly impossible to see. Font size for entire game is too small to see, and this game requires constant use of text. Think size 6 font for typical fonts in typical word docs. German units (ostensibly, as name suggests, and also bc it is a Panzer General ripoff, most of the game is designed around playing as the germans) are nearly invisible on the map. They are tiny black swastikas in black and green forest backgrounds. They couldn't use color to mark the units? You never get that sense of, ""there's how we're deployed on the front lines"" because, you can't see how you are deployed without non-stop zooming in and out.  And the zoom is really slow btw.Gameplay: mostly unknown, because it's not worth it to fight through the text and visibility issues. I doubt they could screw up Panzer General style numbers based attacks, so, whatever. However since a big part of the gameplay is operating the map, then in that sense I can safely say it's crap. What a shame. How could such easily fixed issues get through. Makes you really wonder about the developers... do they even care? Why bother?			"

												Before I could not find a way to play all the same in this miracle, I wrote terribly aggressive comment that this is not a game, but, sorry, Sh.it, in which  you cant play.So, this is partly true. To play for the USSR is at all unrealistic. Just forget it. You cant play for the Russian. About Poland.. I did not play and not going to play, I had enough of the time, when I played for Germany. To understand what to do and especially HOW to do very.. very difficult. I cant imagine how such a strategy even came out.Buy? No. On the cards you dont get benefit because they cost about 0.08$, fun gameplay is not observed.			"

												This is an incredible wargame. It feels like a boardgame from the 70's without all the rolling of dice and math. It looks complicated, but you are really just moving troops around trying to surround, cut off supply, and all the good to do military tactical stuff. I cannot wait for the other 2 planned releases that are to follow this game. Because of it I now have a new love of wargames, its a little pricey, but worth the money. Be weary of lots of clicking.

												I was like you, innocently purchasing this game and opening up and saying YOLOSWAGBROYOLO and choosing Poland as your first game because you're so cool. Then you get wrecked from every direction and then you rage quit back to your little kiddy call of duty.This game isn't a joke, this game isn't a fast paced game. It's a hardcore armchair general turn-based slow-paced strategy game. You take control of either Poland, Germany(Then called the Nazis, or, in aircraft terms, Jerries), or Russia (Then called the Soviet Union).  You can take control of many other nations in custom gamdemode, but they're near useless unless you mod the game, and believe me.. modding this game is unbelievably easy, finally something easy about this game. >:D. If you like really hard games, or relaxing games that make your brain think, then get it. But beware, it's a major armchair-general styled game for you to complete a campaign it's 122 days, with one turn a day. Each turn you'll be spending some 10-15 minutes. (sometimes 30 or more even) So for $25 you're going to get a lottttt of hours played. And if you mod it... even longer. Beware, playing Poland your goal isn't to beat the Axis, that'd be like Britain taking on Russia, your goal is to hold the germans off for longer than historically, say, two weeks or so longer. Germany is a more relaxing gameplay, but it's still very challenging (The AI is hella good), if you play Russia, you have to wait 17 turns (verrryyy longgg) before you can even attack poland, though, I've heard you can declare war on Lithuania and fight them in the meantime.Wasteland Interactive has been out for a couple years roaming Desura and finally each of their tactical turn-based games got greenlit. So go check out: Time of Wrath, Strategic War in Europe, and of course this game. They have a couple more on steam but they're pacific theatre so I don't have them. They're all amazingly good, especially if you like this one.NOTE: As of 8/9/2014/ you can buy the game on Groupees for $1 (though you have to choose two games so it's $1.50)Get it here: https://groupees.com/babmb/Now,Pros: Amazing challengesSteam achievementsEmotes (?)Trading CardsSteam achievements are hard as hellThe graphical/art style is really catchy, fits the mood perfectlyHistorically accurate units with historical picturesCustom games, french invasion, change history, etc.Amazing AIIndie developer (more community based)There has been talk that workshop support is coming, which all other Wasteland games have!Just an overall great gameCons: Large frame drops around 40 minutes to and hour long. You can restart it or just wait (they usually end in 1-2 minutes)Developers get pretty political on the forums (though they are really nice guys, I've spoke to them before)If you play the Soviet Union you have to wait 17 long turns before getting any action You can't choose to automatically fast forward the enemies turns, you have to wait and watch for aprox. 5 minutes, which gets devistatingly boring, which is another downside to playing the soviet union, or the other neutral nations.The code is mostly in Polish (devs are polish) so it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥for me to edit code because I'm Lithuanian. If you like this type of game, then welcome to the new Panzer General. I've been suggesting Forest Brothers for the next ""campaign series"" game. (check their forums to read the suggestion)Get the game, $25 is 100% worth it if you're into this kind of games. "
