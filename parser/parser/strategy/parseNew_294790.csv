												WARNING - READ THIS FIRSTSeveral users have encountered a sound bug with the game. This can be fixed, but it may require several steps involving changing game files and mounting ISO's. If you are not familar with doing this, then do not buy the game. Please refer to the forums or PM me if you would like to know more.Valve - Please don't release broken games or at least provide support as to how to fix them (Vampire: The Masquerade also comes to mind).REVIEWHaegemonia is a space RTS that has some similarity to Homeworld, Sins of a Solar Empire and Stardrive. There are some limited 4X elements to the game as you colonise and manage planets, research new technologies, spy on other factions, hire heroes, manage your economy and experience random events. The game is more basic than the others listed. It does not have the advanced fleet management of HW, the diplomacy system of SOASE or the intense micromanagement of turn based 4X games such as Endless Space or Sword of the Stars. In this sense, the game is a jack of all trades, master of none. However, for its time, this was a fairly ambitious attempt at merging several genres - a feat still yet to be fully achieved (Stardrive was not a resounding success). If you liked these kinds of games, but occasionally desire a more casual experience, then you should find Hae enjoyable if not as satisfying as these other titles. If you are new to RTS or 4X, then Hae is a great way to begin learning some of the basics (this was my experience as I purchased the game when it was first released). Graphically, the game is still very beautiful. The ships especially eclipse the fidelity of HW2 (although the HD edition of Homeworld should soon be with us) and although some of the texture quality is not quite as good as Sins, considering the age of the game, it is far from distracting. The game runs smoothly (aside from the bug above) on the highest settings. The options menu is very limited in this respect, but this again may just reflect the age of the game.The sound assets to the game are fine, with farily satisfying ship explosions. The music however, is limited, with the only switches being between a ""peaceful"" single soundtrack to the ""battle"" soundtrack. It would have been nice to have some variance here with some different ""spacey"" soundtracks to give a bit more of an immersive feel. The maps are limited, but there is lots of variation. I would have liked to have seen more maps in general and some more maps that have environmental hazards that add interesting dynamics to the game (for example, there is one map with a hostile Solon base in the central wormhole hub). However, there is an excellent modding community for the game, and I imagine that it is possible to download more maps from there.As far as balance goes, spying is the best way to get a significant advantage. Your research points are limited (unless you change the parameters to otherwise) but stealing technological prototypes reduces the cost of research. Human's have an advantage both in spying and research, so they are rather overpowered in the right hands. I honestly can't see there being a bustling multiplaying community for the game, so this probably doesn't matter.All in all, the game is solid if a little limited. It's not the thinking game that perhaps some of its descendents and predecessors are, but if you are looking for a visually impressive more simplisitic space strategy title with a small price tag, I recommend picking the game up.Edits: Some spelling and grammar issues.

												Having modded this game extensively, especially during my work on the Vector Prime mod, I know a bit of the ins and outs of the game (not as much as the other members on the Vector Prime team).In short, the game can be considered a realtime lite 4X game. You start off with some ships, some planets or just your homeworld depending on the scenario. Your goal usually is to destroy all enemies (other victory conditions are entirely possible!). Allied victory is allowed on most maps. You colonize/conquer/glass planets, mine resources for money, engage in commerce by setting up trade routes to gain money, tax your population, research technologies, build ships, explore unknown systems and watch epic explosions unfold as your military base gets whacked by your opponent.The game does have a wider playing field compared to homeworld 2 (haeg maps can go up to 12 solar systems with various planets in them) but has less ships in the battle. Planets are your main production centers, which will provide a healthy dose of tax (if you did things right), production capabilities of ships, bases and buildings and the research capability is directly tied to population. High science output means less production speed.The game's economy has only 2 resources: Research Points and money. Money follows streaming economy principles in which sinking more engineering power on your newest battleship will make it roll of the construction line faster, but the money will be emptied from your coffers faster. Money gets deducted during construction, and doesn't require you to have all money on hand beforehand.Space battles are quite good in this game. Nothing more awesome than seeing a bunch of small fighters launch a rocket volley at that darzok battleship and seeing it break apart and explode in the most visually pleasing ways. Bigger ships do have some sort of subsystem mechanic, but its limited only to targeting weapons or engines (besides the default 'punch holes in the enemy hull till it explodes manner). There are 4 basic types of weapons: Missiles (hard hitting, but good ECM can counter them hard), Proton Cannons (Fairly fast, decent damage output), Quantum (Beware, splash damage!) and Ion Beams (High accuracy. nothing more awesome than seeing your enemy's mining base split in 2 by your nice beam weapon).The game does have some nasty limitations, both in gameplay and in the modding field. In some areas it can be seen that the game was rushed, mostly due to the lack of a campaign (which legions of iron does have). Also, another issue is the game's maps having ludicrously low unit limits often, which is something which you can change yourself without a headache.The Solon Heritage does feature some good mods, although most of the old modding community died off after the sudden disappearance of the haeggalaxy community. Still, there's some good mods around, including the mod i worked on with a few others:

All in all:Can you stand somewhat outdated graphics?Do you like realtime empire building on a small to medium scale?Do you like epic explosions and plenty of colorful tools of death?Do you like an epic soundtrack which will make your ears drop off your head and go roll on the floor?If the answer to that is yes, then by all means, buy it!

												This is honestly the space game i was searching for on steam! it may have been released 2002 but this game plays and feels like a grade A space RTS. I really like how fighters engage other fighters, it looks way better than how Sins and Empire at war would do it, fighters will turn into each other a little less than sweaw but not over shoot like sins which makes dogfights fun to watch. Explosions look extraordinary! Ships will break apart upon destruction and taking down a military space base is all to satisfying. In short this is a must have for those who love games space rts games.			"

												a very good game,,,simple interface and can be confusing, intergalactic movement can be difficult though asides from all that 3.99 isnt a wallet ripper for an excellent space based rts, though be aware solon heritage is simply a multiplayer local and net based to legions of iron which is basically only campaigns.

												this game is over a decade old and still looks better than most modern space stratergy games.full 3d.beautiful. Slow burning.Not a game for people after a quick bash, or 1hour long match...even small 1v1 games are a marathon, unlikely you'll ever finish a match in a single sitting.This game is more for sitting down with a good freind or two, barracading the doors, ordering a pizza and bunkering down for a night long sesh.If you like Civ and you like Homeworld, you'll love this.

												I played Haegemonia the first time several years ago when it first came out.  For the time, it had fantastic graphics and the gameplay combined real time strategy and 4X in a way that I haven't seen since, but wish I had.  The graphics have pretty much held up- they are comparable to early PS3 or XBOX 360 titles.The problem is that within an hour of launching the game, it crashes.  The Windows popup blames the game's sound files.  Once it crashes on you, it'll crash within five minutes of launch each time.If the game were stable and you could run it, I'd strongly suggest it to all strategy fans.  However, the as- is version simply doesn't run.  Keep looking.			"

												Like the first game the camera controls are really bad. The angels are the worse and are very annoying. It would be nice also I could at least speed up the boring travel parts more than 4x game speed. The tutorial was not very helpful and I had to restart because I didn't know what I was doing. I went to use a previous save slot (as the game saved it several times while I was playing). Out of the three slots it created only one worked and it sent me back to the game right when I quit..... So I have to start over again. Though I am not so sure I want to play this game anymore. It's slow, the tutorial isn't very good, and the camera controls are horrible.			"

												no idea what these ""too buggy"" folks are talking about, works great, no bugs at all...come on, its fun, costs basically nothing, has a big bucket of ships, techologies... you can mine, you can build stuff on planets... get it if you like space rts like homeworld.the only disadvantage is graphics. you cant get decent resolution, its 4:3 and no built in window mode, maybe there is a config trick i didnt saw yet, but its not so much on graphic at all, most times you see black background with stars and glowing ship engines. thats normal for that genre...

												Good expansion to a pretty decent game back when expansions actually included an assload of content. This game borrowed a lot of ideas from Homeworld and threw in some of it's own. I've always felt that Sins of A Solar Empire devs took some inspiration from this game. NOTE: Google and download Haegemonia sound fix  FIRST  .  Doubtful this bug will ever be fixed as I don't even think Digital Reality even exists as a company anymore (their website seems ♥♥♥♥ed and they haven't developed a full game of their own in nearly 6 years).

												You'd be hard pressed to find negative reviews that don't have to do with Windows 10 or the sound bug. The actual game is phenomenal. Always my favorite Space RTS back when Space RTS's were a thing.  3 Distinct races, but with the ability to overlap each other's weapons tech, but at a research penalty.  LOVE QUANTUM.  Quantum and rockets :D It's aged but still grand, and a different approach to RTS Space than the other games of the day. I wish this would get the remaster treatment that Homeworld got.			"
