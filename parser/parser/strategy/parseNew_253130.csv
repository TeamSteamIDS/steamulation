												Not bad. One thing I don't like in this game is camera angle of interior fire, it's just horrible and make it hard to see where I should proceed but others are good enough.			"

												Here's a link to the first part of my impressions series on this game 


YouTube™ Video: Rescue Everyday Heroes (U.S. Edition) Gameplay /w Commentary part 1 

			Views: 15,663		

			Part 1 of Rescue Everyday Heroes (U.S. Edition) impression series. This is the new version out on Steam just yesterday. Something you might like? Watch and find out.		

There's a surprising amount of fun to be had here, but the game is severely lacking in challenge if you're a core gamer. Still worth checking out though and the price is pretty right in my opinion.			"

												In Rescue – Everyday Heroes you play the boss of a fire station in charge of responding to emergencies of all types in the local area.  While described as a simulation, casual would be a much better characterisation.The game takes part in two parts, the first a Sims-like fire station where you hire and fire firefighters and paramedics, assign them different jobs around the station like dispatch or maintenance or improve their skills at the lecture room or gym.  Your also have to monitor their individual moods, assign them a job they like, it goes up, if something goes wrong in their lives, favourite football team loses, it goes down and they are useless.  You can also cover the fire station in all sorts of furniture, some useful, some purely cosmetic.The second part of the game is the actual fire fighting and treating injured citizens and transporting them to hospital.  Here you take a combination of vehicles to a locations in the city, bins on fire, plane crashes, truck crashes and the like and put out the fire and treat and transport any survivors.  Water is obviously the most important resource here, you either need to find a fire hydrant and hook up a supply hose and then the standard hoses to that or bring your own water in the form of a tanker.  As you make your way through the campaign newer vehicles will unlock, many carry their own water and even have a remote fire hose on the roof.  Eventually you'll just bring these firetrucks, someone's barbecue is on fire?  Smash down the fence with your trucks and blast that BBQ across the backyard into the neighbour's kitchen.  Fire out, job done.Paramedics also play an important role in the game.  Accidents often leave injured strew across the scene and the first job is to assign a paramedic to triage each and treat them in order of most injured to least and transport them to the hospital.  Once a patient gets to the purple state you lose money from your mission score so be sure to look after the most injured first.  Do they die if you leave them too long? I don't know, it never seemed to happen.  I once thought I had finished a mission but it said there was one more patient, turned out I'd parked an Ambulance on top of him.  He was fine, probably sued the crap out of the city though.  If things get too hectic you can also hire extra ambulances, doctors and firetrucks at a cost, but you'll never run out of cash.There are a few issues though.  Pathing is poor and clicking, selecting and giving orders is inexact at best.  Often trying to assign the second paramedic to a stretcher is an exercise in frustration as they either can't work out how to get there or the stretcher has clipped into something else.  Also why on earth can't firefighters carry stretchers?  I understand they are not trained in advanced medicine, but any clown can carry the other end.  It would give them something to do after the fire is out.  There are also no female fire fighters or paramedics.  Some mission take place indoors and here the performance can take quite a hit, chugging along for no real reason.The campaign is not particularly long, 5-6 hours at most, though there is a free-play mode where you only have to fight fires, no base management.  I played though the campaign in one sitting but I can't recommend paying full price.  On special or from a bundle and it's good fun for a few hours.6/10			"

												This game has a good 'concept' but failed to deliver via bad user interface and bad game play mechanics. You control a fire station, and as you start to get into the game it looks like it could be a nice 'time management' type strategy simulation. I could see it becoming a game were you had to get you're guys to work as a team to save people.. but as you hit the 2nd or 3rd mission that dream fades and you are left with the reality that you're playing a point and click game for teenagers working on there motor skills with a mouse. Most missions were you have multiple guys responding you quickly find they do everything so fast its easier to just pick one guy and do everything, for example the first thing you learn, connecting the support hose, then connecting an assault hose. If you attempt to use 2 guys to do this they get in each others way tripping over one another like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and by the time your first guy has laid out his 'support' hose, your 2nd guy is just tripping his way back to the truck to bust out the 'attack' hose. You quickly start asking yourself, ""why did I even tell you to move, your too late"". So the game becomes a resource management game, trying to save every drop of water in your truck for that pesky leaf fire in the middle of nothing that is endangering all the roaches in the area, you'd have thought the 1600 gallon tank would be more then enough, but the first one took 85% of your water. you would think there would be more 'don't use this type of extinguisher on this type of fire' going into a game based around fighting fires, but apparently education was last on there mind (unless you feel like reading all the info panels in the menu that tell you the history of fire fighting/rescue). The game died for me when i came to a fire that was down a set of stairs (you know surrounded by concrete, scaring all the ants?) and i told my 'guy' to walk down there with the attack hose and he dumbed around in a few circles then went upstairs, then apparently he ran out of hose, perhaps it was around his neck, cutting off the oxygen to his brain, and couldn't seem to figure out what a Z coordinate was. After that i promptly uninstalled and made its own heading in my steam games as 'crapgames'. it is currently the only resident of that title so far.			"

												I enjoy the game, worth the cost to me. Spend more than that on 12 pk. and it doesn't last as long. It's not gonna win game of the year or anything but it makes for a fun time killer. I play 30+ mins. and either play something else or get back to that dreaded MMO called real life. Only issue I've had is the pathing issues of the fire trucks and firemen but nothing that ruins the game for me. The developers have already talked about addressing these issues a.s.a.p. Over all I'd give it 6/10 (7/10 once the patch) Cheers!			"

												Where to start.This is released as a standlone game, even though this should have been a patch for version 1.0.The same problems are there in this one as it was in 1.0 , infact it is exactly the same game all that appears to have changed is they have added a handful of new maps, even the managment station is exactly the same as before, now how cheap is that?They did not patch or fix 1.0 so do not expect them too with this one.This is probably the biggest cheap way of dealing with customers i have seen for awhile but the game can be fun in parts, it will just be ovber in a nights play.

												I recommend this game because it is different and it has a fun concept. The modeling and graphics are fit the game nicely. There are a few drawbacks though. The controls and (not sure what its called) the going through clicking buttons whatever is hard. It is not very easy to command a unit to do something, this is not good when in an emergency. The map is very limited, which makes the missions feel repetitve. There are also some minor glitches, like firemen getting stuck in firetrucks, ambulance doesn't want to got to the hospital, etc. If you think it looks interesting, buy it, I still find it very fun.ALSO: Although I do recommend this game, Emergency: Fire Response is better. I highly recommend that game, if you can get your hands on one. (Ask me for details)			"

												7 hours and I've had enough. Too clicky, too tedious. In short. Get call out. Put out fires. Open broken cars. Send peeps to hospital. Build up station, get promoted and buy new trucks. It WILL hold interest for awhile simply because of the ""what will I get next"" and you get to play with some new trucks. But ahhhhhh!!!!!Some of the pathing is stupid. Truck hooked up. Traffic stopping access. Guys caught under truck when you connect up. Can't move truck because guys is connected but can't disconnect guy because he's under the truck! One incapped truck.Out of water? I have to bring fireys #1 and #2 back to the truck from the seat of the fire, disconnect their hoses before firey #3 can disconnect main hose. Why can't we just drop the damn main connector from truck!!And what? ONE fire extinguiser per truck?  Really?Ambos? Attend to patient with ambo #1 while ambo #2 get's stretcher. Ambo #1 has to go back to the ambulance to put the first aid kit away before he can help with the stretcher!! Unless ofc, you have a firey doing nothing while he waits for the truck to come back with more water. Except, he's holding the damn hose isn't he!?!?I found at least 1 faulty mission. Objective: Extricate victim. So  I sent heavy rescue and hey, guess what, car is empty. Mission even said victim was thrown clear!!!Also no idea if fire scene has hydrants or not so have to take water tankers everytime anyway!..oo00oo..SUMMARYMost of the game logic is very, very ordinary. Shows a complete lack of bothering to test or even consider the scenarios. This COULD be interesting if actually doing the missions wasn't so flawed and tedious.Don't. Just don't.2/10			"

												Well, as I spent long hours with 911: First Responders and other Emergency series games, I am not shocked by this micromanagement in Rescue - Everyday Heroes game. TBH it is not surprising, BUT - one moment - when firefighter connect his attack hose to split, he needs additional command to put the flames. Damn. That`s a bit too much for me - micromanagement in all it`s glory. Other thing or things: impossible to connect attack hose directly to fire engine, split must be connected first. That`s nonsense - maybe I am enough only one hose connected to one engine. pathfinding problems already are mentioned by other people. And after some hours playing it becomes very repeating - the maps, the objectives, the fire itself, and extinguishing itself - arrive, connect, connect more, water ended, get more, finished. And put the equipment there, where you took it from. Impossible to put in on ground, need run here and there, what wastes time. Training personnel in gym, doesn`t seem any advantage or disadvantage - everyone works like one. Well, training in lecture room awards new traits, what, again aren`t useful in field.My summary can be this - I feel like I playing some demo version and vasted money. Pitty I can not get them back.			"

												This game is sort of like Emergency with some kind of sim component where you can buy people sofas, or desks, even showers.  None of this sim mechanics seem utilized at all.  The game is pretty short about 20 missions, maybe 9-10 vehicles, and no police vehicles.  The missions repeat in the campaign after completing them and freeplay is sorta meh.  Since there are only fires, alot of missions have to do with a barbecue catching fire, or a tree.  Just go there point truck at fire and the fire goes out.  It is a simple game, I got bored of it in the few clocked hours I have playing this.  This game could be awesome though if the Sim features are ever utilized.  Oddly there is a helipad, what its for I have no idea since there are no air vehicles in the game that I found.Rating:  2/10  Value:  $2.99			"

												For a dollar in a bundle, not a bad game. It's mainly about micromanaging fire fighters and paramedics. Unfortunately, few interior fires that seem exciting, and the paramedic missions are bog standard and rather boring. Towards the end of the game, you get tanker trucks that allow your firefighters to fight fires without ever leaving their trucks. It's easy, but makes the game less fun. The last new firefighting truck I'd get is the Water Carrier, as some missions are simply too far to not have water on hand. The later trucks simply make it too easy, plus the trucks are autonomous in this game, so you don't have to send a single firefighter to win. Overall, took me about 4 hours start to finish, and it was enjoyable. Maybe not worth whatever full cost is, but as part of a bundle, worth redeeming the key.			"

I think that they should add unform options like the suppor firefighters wear brown gear and a yellow helmet and I wouldve liked to have my men wearing that gear not a game breaker at all, More truck color combinations would be good as well, also make the sirens sound better they just sound odd. Other then that I really enjoyed the game and recomend it deffinately worth the money.			"

												If like me, you like management and strategy games, this game might offer you something different - especially if you've not played any of these Emergency/Rescue style games before. I still haven't tried the Emergency series, which I believe to the be the natural competition to this title, so my review is based on this game, as a stand-alone entity (from the perspective of being new to this genre). The reason I chose this title over one of the others, was simply because I felt intrigued to play a rescue game with the prospect of a station management side. Between every mission you return to your station, where you can hire paramedics and firefighters, buy new vehicles, and spruce up your station with new furniture and technology. Truthfully, I love buying new vehicles and hiring new staff, but still can't understand what importance they play when assigned to certain jobs in the station... I guess I need to do more digging around to answer that one. It's also nice to have a specific budget allowance in the game, that prevents you from going crazy and buying everything too early.When you're happy with your vehicles and staff, then you hit the little mission light (a button in the bottom right corner), and now the game enters a phase where your staff occasionally open a dialogue with you, and where you receive incoming missions. These missions range from fairly easy house fires to massive highway pile-ups that require Heavy Rescue vehicles, Fire Engines, Paramedics and more. Even if you don't have the right vehicle, you can spend money mid-mission to call in doctors etc.The pathfinding of your units, once you assign them a task, isn't always perfect, and several times I've had issues with Paramedics struggling to take the other end of a stretcher, when in a confined space. I've figured out a work-around for this, so it doesn't bother me so much, nor detract from the sense of urgency, nor the element of fun that playing the game provides. So far I've played this game for about 8 hours, and I'm still very much enjoying the feel and challenge of this title. With no frame of reference to other, similar titles, I can't say how well it stacks up against the competition, however, I'm very happy with this game and would strongly recommend it to anyone that has an interest in the genre, or enjoys management and strategy games. I give it 8/10 - only revoking those extra points for the occasionally tricky path-finding.			"

												This is a nice game, it looks good and the game engine runs smooth. The game is full of action and easy to play, it is too bad there is no multiplayer mode or a option to create custom missions, but, you can play in freemode. However, there is a lack of missions and realism. After you turned level 6 (after 24 missions) no new missions will appear, nor you will level up or gain more vehicles or other perks. So the game is played out within 8 hours and is not very interesting to keep playing.			"

												This game is not worth $20. The game is fun and everything, but I beat the campaign in around 15 hours of gameplay. Also the freeplay mode is just too fast. I would suggest waiting on buying the game until there are new campaigns or the price drops to around $10. I also belive this game should have multiplayer, something where whoever gets to the emergency first gets it. I reccomend this game but it is too expensive for what you get. The game is also lacking more off road forrest fires, without those levels, the off road fire fighting vehicle seemed like a waste. A Fire Crew truck would also be useful in general, I only kept my actual Fire Trucks to carry people after I got the water tenders because if it was an indoor fire I would have needed to send my Rescue Trucks. Also during the campaign there was a helicoptor pad next to the station causing me to think that I would be able to purchase a helicoptor in the later game.

												Its a good game alright, its just not worth the money it asks for, as of yet. i love these type games but it is not really re-playable. the 'campaign' mode is a GREAT idea, where you can hire personal and train them between emergency calls, its just that the calls are all scripted and do not vary at all. the game has a list it'll run you through, and when you finish all the calls, thats it. you win and now have a option to replay any of the previous calls. as with the free-play mode, its about the same as emergency 2014 and such. you have a (small) map where random medical emergencies, fires, and accidents occur while you play and does not seem to change pace or get harder. the firestation is consierable smaller and from what i gathered you can only use the units you buy in the career mode.  also NO SAVINGgame play is fantastic, for what there is. the firetrucks run out of water, and need to be sent off map to fill up (i really wished i could do it from a hydrant of water tanker, which is included in game) graphics are really great and you know whats up. lots of micro management with speed and mouse skills.bugs - firefighters just... gaggle in one spot (looks like a single guy) when disembarked off the trucks, or are put under the truck. minimap disappeared on me during campaign mode and game had to be restarted. and if the truck is beside a unmovable object and a firefighter spawns in a hose-based tool, he could be stuck from putting it back, thus breaking the free-mode gamerecommend for developers if you read this...multiplayer?TLC for sure.If you like the genre, the game will leave a hole in both your wallet and yourself that it will not satisfy. try emergency 2014. I will as soon as it goes on sale			"

												At first I would've recommended this game, but it's got too many annoying bugs.Firstly, I was impressed with the game, giving me a chance to play something I enjoy ; a rescue style game.  With the added management parts, it was quite good...at first.It slows right down when getting over a fire, although not every time.  Making the game unplayable.Firefighters get stuck under the trucks, and wont move, and you cannot move the trucks either.  This tends to happen more often than not, near the end of a rescue...adding to the annoyance.I've just gotten to the train derailment mission...and the amount of smoke made the game slow to an almost crawl...and firefighters kept getting stuck under the engine...right at the end of the mission.  And then the ambulances, although just emptied, wouldn't accept anymore patients.The amount of clicking you have to do, because it doesn't always register that you've clicked on a unit, is a joke.I like how you have to set up everything...but that can get tedious and dangerous, especially if you have multiple firetrucks.  So, best way around that, don't use firetrucks for a fire, use the water tenders or foam tenders, and just send them to reload when empty.  Saves a lot of time, clicking and messing about with reloading the mission because the firefighters are stuck.Example : I had a mission, with lots of fire.  By the time I got 1 Fire engine set up, my water tender had finished putting out all the fires.Also...I think that some kind of menu bar would've been useful.  Where it listed the units you had in the mission, so you could easily select them, instead of constantly selecting a unit you didn't want.Great idea, but too many annoying features and bugs for me to recommend it.

SummaryMy Rating: 35/100This game has a potential to be a great game, however far too much micro-management is involved for the game to be enjoyable. A lot of missions are available in the Campaign mode, but they are all very similar and get quite boring after a while. The 'Station Management' mode of the Campaign mode should rather be called 'Furniture Placement Simulator'.Positive- This game has some good management aspects.- This game is enjoyable for a while.- A variety of management options are available.- There are plenty of different vehicles available.Negative- This game has FAR too much micromanagement. You can't co-ordinate a large operation succesfully when you need to tell each person 'Ok, get out of the vehicle. Open the compartment. Get the hose. Attach it to a hydrant. Move towards the fire. Extinguish the fire. Now move on to the next fire.'- This game is not very realistic. Vehicles can drive away with nobody in them.			"

												Before I purchased Rescue - Everyday Heroes I had read reviews complaining that this game was boring or not worth the money. Like all reviews, I take them with a grain of salt as they are personal opinions. And, as such, that is exactly what I am offering with my review.Admittedly, the ""Campaign"" is fairly short. I spent a few hours on a single night and pretty much ran through all of the missions that the game presented in this mode. However, I found that I enjoyed the overall game play that it offered.Pros:* Wide selection of vehicles (as you progress you unlock new ones)*  Base management adds an interesting aspect of game play* While managing your base you're not rushed into an emergency situation as the game pauses time while you manage your base.* The ability to train and ""level up"" your team of firefighters and paramedics is quite nice.* Different situations arise due to differing personalities amongst your staff (a nice touch).* Some missions offer a slight challenge for those seeking it. You can always abandon the mission and repeat if you chose the wrong or inadequate equipment.Cons:* Campaign is short (haven't tried Freeplay mode yet, will update my thoughts when I do)* For those seeking an incredible challenge, this game really isn't for you.* Some flakey physics (driving through objects, pushing guys out of the way, etc) but nothing that was a deal-breaker for me.This game is a casual simulation game that is a decent mix of a business management (firehouse management) and strategy wrapped into what I call a well done shell. This game isn't meant to force you to spend hours upon hours trying to beat a single mission (I think the most times I restarted a mission was twice but that was because I was herp derping on my mouse clicks lol). I think that those who are looking for something casual to spend a few hours a night doing, this might be worth it.  Don't like the price? Wait for it to go on sale because you know Steam has tons of sales :-)* Update 4/25/2014* After trying Freeplay mode, my overall view of this game hasn't changed. Freeplay really doesn't offer a whole lot other than a way to play missions on an open map. It can be challenging at times when you get multiple missions at the same time. You are limited to 4 vehicles at any given time and you can swap them out by sending them back to base and removing them. There is no money aspect or base management aspect in freeplay mode. Just a simple choose your vehicles, choose your staff, and go do missions. I was a bit disappointed that there was no save feature for freeplay mode. You simply play till you have had enough and you get a score. Still, this game is very nice if you catch it on sale.			"

												Quick ReviewI give this game a solid 8/10.  I really enjoy it and can spend hours at a time playing it.  My advice is to play the game for at least a couple of days since it only begins to shine when you've built up a substantial force of vehicles and personnel.			"

												It's a great game, which is similar to the Emergency 4 series. Now here are the problems:1. Sometimes it can lag when there are multiple vehicles on the scene, even on my high end rig. 2. The story-line is quite short, but this shouldn't put people off as there is a freeplay mode. The conclusion is that this game is promising and if they fix the lag issues, this would improve the experience.			"

												This game was fun.It had some negative flaws, but it still has a positive look for me. The hitboxes were way too small, sometimes you had to drag a selection box to make sure your character would be selected. The AI and pathfinding was a bit dumb, you have to manually do some things like putting the main coupler on the ground, getting every hose with a single character selected, those disturbed the game's flow a bit, specially for me as I'm bad at multitasking. The story mode was good but too short, and the quickplay mode wasn't that interesting after I had done all the missions in story anyway.Despite all of this, I had fun when playing this game. It had an interesting gameplay and mechanics, trying to get better at multitasking and improving my crew members kept me playing until the end, and it made me wish the game was longer.			"

												This is a very enjoyable title, but it's not worth the full cost of $19.99. If you were to buy it, wait until you can get it for less then $10.00 as I did. The game is enjoyable, with both the simulation and the RTS aspects of the game working very well. You should be able to get at least 10-12 hours out of it, depening on how long it takes you to do the missions. But after that the game just ends with there being no more new missions, only the option to replay the old ones. I didn't play with the timed missions on, so maybe that changes the game signifcantly, but without a timer all the missions are extremely easy and managing the firehouse is too easy as well, with hardly any issues maintaining morale and keeping yourself in the green financially. Bottom line, if you can get it cheap, then get it. If not, then wait for a sale.			"

I personally found this game to be challenging, but a ball of fun and entertainment. If you're into strategy games, or games to do with emergency simulations then this is the game for you. The game includes a variety of missions/situations and vehicles. The game can get boring although once you complete the, ""mission"" mode. Overall this is a pretty good game.			"

												As an emergency Fire and Medical responder, I am familiar with everything the game puts forth. It does so with very few bugs, and with a graphical, audible, and gameplay quality that allows me to check ""yes"" to recommend this game. I can say It would also be a reasonably cheap basic training tool for probie or novice firefighters.Albeit I enjoyed the game, and don't feel I was ripped off having purchased it at 75% off, here is a list of different things that may help you determine if it will be a viable investment for you:   -Pros-Realistic strategy, and general activity feel.Smooth graphics.Clear audio.Enjoyable gameplay, overall.Decent price (75% off).Pretty easy to figure out controls.Ability to call in outside support.Station management and upgrade capabilities.   -Cons-Obcene amounts of micro-management.Bugs that have to be adjusted for (ie. cannot click on loaded stretcher due to placement and must push into a dif position with another char or vehicle).Short campaign length.Inability to hook into a hydrant or draft from a natural water source.Some missions took less than 40 seconds to complete (with correct vehicles).Looping soundtrack.No special graphical effects.Skills do not progress in station management mode.No flying or water crafts.Can't make employees run the Tower :POverall it has its problems, as does the Emergency series, but if you enjoy emergency response games, get it cheap, play it through, remember it fondly once you uninstall cause there is little more you can do with it atm since there is no DLC currently.AMD Phenom II X6 1100T 3.3Ghz.6GB DDR22.5TB 7200RPM, 64MB, SATA II16MB/s Cable/N300 WifiXFX 2GB Radeon 6950Vizio 42"" 1080P 3D LED "

The fire house does not seem like it does too much other than making it look nice by adding different items that do not get used if you assign your people to tasks.

												This game is sorely incomplete, still riddled with bugs, flaws, incomplete content(and/or limited selection of such). The base campaign is really lacking in any sort of challenge, its basically a 2 generations old version of The Sims all decked out in firefighter. While the missions are interesting, fun, but basic and usually short and repetitive, I found that portion of the game play rather unique, I still cant help feel as if I made a poor choice buying this game.Additionally it appears as if the devs have either written this game off as a wash(not likely considering they're pumping out their sequel which looks quite the same) or actually feel this is a complete title(really hope not) It is quite clear this game is not going anywhere fast given the last news on this title is only 6 months into development, and just over 2 years old, I am going to sit on this title and hope they are updating and just not posting, but thats unlikely as it turns out the sequel to this game is already on the shelves.I'm quite disappointed with the devs lack of follow through on this title, and are really hopeful the sequel is having much more work and development put into it, but as is I cant recommend at full price, just based on principle even at $0.01 I'd not recommend, however with that said, I do like the game, just wish it had more to it.Pros: * Unique game play within missions* nice detail work on vehiclesCons:* Incomplete* Bugs: including one game ending* Poorly designed city scapes seriously lacking in both depth and detail * annoying as hell ""pathfinding"" or lack there of* Bad behavior on Devs part (i.e. I really hate seeing sequels to abandoned games, especially when sequels look remarkably alike the last).Again, I hope I'm wrong about this one, cause this game did have great possibility, Really hope the sequel is much better off.

												Everyday Heroes (a great game with a massive amount of potential) Buying this game is a good idea, that is if you want to be entertained for 7 hours. The story is fun, but it is unfinished, has small bugs and glitches; some mission ending. Such as the 9th Company Game this has the same feel to it but instead of fighting the Mujis', you're fighting fires with in a simulated environment. Like 9th Company they have the same glitch with vehicles , they have clipping and no clipping moments when the vehicle you are sending in get stuck half way in the ground, leaving you to stand around with your thumb up your Bum trying to figure out just how you can put out a fire without the truck. Another mission breaking glitch is the Ambulance, when you tell it to return to base or transport a patient to the hospital, it won't go through to the return point. This includes movement of multiple vehicles at once if you select more than 2 they wont move the operation system seems to get confused. Lastly the game is unfinished, you may notice this; it is the absence of the training area, and the fact there is no helicopter on the landing pad or helicopter to purchase. I believe there is a lot to add to this game to make it better or ""fixed"" new missions , new vehicles & Aircarft (Rescue) & (MedVAC), maybe even a possible fire rescue boat for harbor fire missions. Lastly, the new missions should include the following, multiple floor fire, victims in the fire, loss of fire fighters, Ladder trucks, more highway/ open area missions that require MedVAV helicopters. That would make the Rescue- Everyday Heroes a completed game. We could also always wish on, collasping buildings, search and rescue missions with helicopters: due to the fact the game has both a country setting as well as a harbor, in which fire fighters are required to have a boat crew and or helicopter rescue/ divers.  I rate the game 4/10 for ""completeness"", 6/10 for entertainment, 8/10 all around if it ever recieves, patches and DLC. Although it was a fun game $19.99 is asking a little much for an uncompleted game , in which it has the same effort put forth as a game that costs $4.99 through Steam. Otherwise, its a great game and fun; but needs improvement.- Good luck!			"

How come no one ever wears an SCBA in this game then i get advice like always make sure your firefighters are wearing SCBAs when fighting fires?3. Who in the name of God's green earth put a hose carrier in here. .4. I'm a city firedepartment that oddly drives out to the middle of no where to fight a hay bale on fire? I mean come on guys... Jesus the police department could even do that....5. How come there is no rope rescue, or an type of technical rescue  besides using hydraulic splitters in this game...6. There is no Incident command system what so ever.7. Pasta, this game needs more pasta. "

												This game is really neat, Rescue: Everyday Heroes, was a fun game for me, i am enjoying it. I noticed that the Developer replied to a comment on here addressing some issues, that alone helped me make my choice to buy this. Like any game there are Bugs, bugs that need sorting out! its up to us to help the dev's find them! and have fun while doing it!As for a bug i encountered, there was one mission where a car hit a gas sign and the passenger was flung out, My minimap didn't work, it also requried a Light/Heavy Rescue Unit which i didn't need, just some EMT's. I Also was unable to Select all characters on screen (Click and Drag to choose all just left the box floating in the air and wouldnt select anything) So I had to move the units 1 by 1 (after i had to scout the map to find the wreck again Minimap didn't work.) But that didn't take away from playing the game at all :) I'm very Happy with my Purchase((Possible Spolier))(To Dev) there was a Mission that had a Bus and Cargo Truck crashed, The map shows that the Cargo Truck skidded into the wrong lane and collided with the bus. At the end of the mission it was Deteremined that the Bus was speeding and collided with the Cargo Truck.. Now i'm no Expert but Judging by the map itself it clearly shows the Cargo Truck on the wrong side of the road! :-P Just a heads up!			"

												Rescue - Everyday Heroes is basically a firefighting/paramedic game mashed up with a bit of Sims. There are a few bugs that keep it from being a great game, but if you don't mind them, go ahead and pick it up. It's fun despite the annoying bugs.Graphics:Not bad. Not great. Just average. The one thing that did bug me was that if your mission occured during the night, it was near impossible to see your guys. Also if there was a lot of smoke, same issue. At least for the smoke the devs could have done the blue outline they used for the same guys and vehicles when they were behind a tree. Oversall, passable.Audio:First up is the background music. All I have to say is that it didn't catch my attention, which means that it wasn't bad, but it also wasn't great. Sound effects were okay. Nothing really detracting, but the sfx of the fires crackling and the water running was nice. The vocals in the game are similar to what you would hear in an RTS. Click on a character and they respond with a 'Ready!'.Gameplay:The game basically has two modes. The first is the prep mode. This is where you buy stuff for your firestation, hire units, buy vehicles, assign tasks, etc. Your units have traits, moods, and skills. Only thing is, nowhere does it say what the different things you buy do to affect your units mood. The traits are random and the skills can be leveled up to make your units stronger. I didn't really notice any difference betweena  one chevron vs a three chevron unit.The second part of the games consists of doing missions. These basically boil down to either stop a fire or save people. Sometimes missions require you to do both. The first few missions do a very good job of teaching you how to do these. By the final mission, you'll know exactly what you are doing and what you want your units to do.Here lies the problem. It get be a pain getting your units to do what you want. Frist off is the pathfinding. Sometimes it's good. But most of the time you'll be wondering why your paramedic is going around the tree that's not in the way. Second is selecting your units. It can be a pain trying to click them. Especially when they are crowded together. You end up clicking the paramedic that's treating the victim and canceling the treatment instead of clicking the free paramedic that you want to go get the stretcher. There have also be times where I can't see my guys because when you put stuff away in the vechiles, they end up hiding behind the vehicle and you have to turn the camera which wastes time. Which brings about a couple more problems. Camera and time. The camera can only pan, rotate, and zoom. No tilt. Which means that if you are in the city, it might take you awhile to find a good vantage point between all the highrise towers. Also time. There's no way to slow down time so you can find your guys. Lose track of your paramedic or firefighter holding the special tool you need, and you're gonna waste time while the victim in the cars slowly dies. The devs should have added a feature to slow down time so you can give commands, or made it so you can still view the game while paused.So in conclusion, the game is fun. There are bugs and poor design choices. However, if you are willing to overlook those, go ahead and get the game. It's short, about 4-5 hours of you time. I recommend getting it on sale.			"

												To put it bluntly, the worst game of it's kind.The menus are badly placed, it takes a long time to do a simple action dealing with the bad menus, the graphics are actually worse than Emergency 4's (Released in 2006!), your vehicles will drive through and ignore other road traffic, firefighting is dull and doesn't even pose a threat to firefighters, the game is generally too easy, missions are very short even after awhile of playing, when loading into a new mission there's a 50/50 chance it'll lag for a good 20 seconds which is pretty bad, firefighters/emts will go straight through vehicles, lights and sirens are very bad and generic (would have been nice to be able to customize these!) and last but not least, holds no ground whatsoever against Emergency 4. I even liked Emergency 2012 better, and that was utter crap. Don't waste 15 quid on this game, go buy Emergency 4. Emergency 4 has a heavy modding community and has been active for years with many great mods to choose from. The missions are better and the freeplay is generally much more thought out than this games version. Not only that but Emergency 4 allows you to control technical and police services aswell as EMT/FD. The only thing I like about this game OVER Emergency 4 would be the way the 'campaign' worked, running a fire department rather than just having a menu and going into a mission.I think the game has real potential, but the way it was executed was just bad. I would pass up on the graphics if the rest of the above problems were sorted.I'm sorry, but after clocking atleast a 100 hours on Emergency 4, I just can't stand to play this. It's hard to play and theres no joy. Emergency 4 gives a wider range of events and is generally more fun.			"

The op mode is highly irrelevant and money is no object 10 missions in, most of the time is spent waiting for things to happen to spend maybe 2 - 4 minutes dealing with it.  With some more time spent in development this game has potential to blow the Emergency series out of the water, but not in the condition it's in at the moment.  2/10			"

												Fun game but incredibly short, and nothing to do once you finish the short campaign but repeat the same missions over and over. There is no police integration also. Feels like a beta release but somehow is a full game. They REALLY should be continuing to work on it as it just doesn't feel complete whatsoever. Disappointing, especially for the price.			"

												I bought this game on a whim thinking that I was probably going to get bored with it - and the reverse happened.  While the game has it's share of glitches, I was plesantly surprised by the gameplay that I've continued to return to it.Those glitches, though, are my biggest beef with this game.  As was stated previously, the collision detection on the objects is severly lacking (some maps the trucks unload the firefighters underneath them instead of next to the vehicle).  Trucks drive almost through each other (it seems like the collision web is literally the center of the truck).Despite this, the selection of vehicles and the variety of missions can keep you going for a while.  Perhaps the developers will continue to add content such as aerial ladder trucks or helos (maybe they've done the helos and I just haven't gotten there yet...would still be a nice support option if too complex to add to the actual game).The fire station play is similar to other management simulations that I've played, and balancing your crews between different tasks while getting their skills up keeps the gameplay going in between missions.  Being able to add props to the fire house allow for a decent level of customization.Overall, I'd recommend this game to those who aren't overly bothered by some glitches in a game and enjoy a relaxing bit of fun running a fire department.

												The game is pretty fun. Most games of this sort are either basically puzzle games (see the Emergency series) or overly scripted such that your actions don't really matter (Fire Department series). This game doesn't fall into either the trap of becoming a puzzle or having missions that are just interactive cutscenes. There are some minor frustrations with the UI. It is tedious to deploy fire fighters and hoses, there is no easy way to do it without a ton of clicks. There are also some points where it isn't clear what you need to do, especially with extractions from car crashes. More of an issue however is a lack of replayablity. The missions themselves are pretty nice, I really liked that they included interior structure fires. However, after an hour or two of game time, you feel like you have seen it all. There are a lot of different callups but they all seem to play very similiar. Its basically simple medical or simple fire or simple rescue. There isn't a lot of depth to any given callup and after playing 10 or so, you aren't really interested in seeing the next one. The price is about right for this scope but anything more then I would be unhappy with the depth.			"

												Well my first impression of the game was it looked very interesting. And I was right. I really like the game. I do have one problem with it and would like to know if maybe it can be fixed for those of us who have laptops. I installed it on my laptop with no problems....then I tried to play it. The game wont load saying Failed to Initialize Steam. Please start the game via Steam. I am 100% sure it is not my installation of Steam on my laptop as I am able to play other games that will work with my laptop. My laptop meets the requirments for the game. If any info for this solution would be greatfully appreciated.  I really love the game and keep up the great work. Thank You.			"

												I liked this game, it hits home with me being a volunteer fireman. However , perhaps the designers could possibly add some ladder trucks to the mix. It's true that the main purpose of firefighting is putting the wet stuff on the hot stuff, but truck work goes hand to hand with engine work. Perhaps add a flashover timer or backdraft timer , it'll add some depth and more tension to the game. Along with the egines, addding the hydrant to fire drop would be nice. ( engine drops off a firefighter at a hydrant  and drop supply line up to house.) Forgive me, I might be getting too technical. However the fire to hydrant drop is the only drop you can do. Some stuff to think about , and perhaps more customization as well, I.E. naming your fire department, some more color schemes and unit numbers, (instead of just calling it engine one, maybe a player wants to designate it Unit 456.) Online play too, instead of calling on mutual aid via a simple press of a button, why not have another player that is also playing take part in a call that may require more than one engine. Think about it , the possibilites are endless !!!! "

												I was real excited when I got this game but there are some things about it that just drive me crazy. The way they organize the workers makes it so tedious to see how they are doing and if they are in the correct job. Another thing is all the glitches. Save often because it is not unusual to have to start a mission over bacause a fire truck is stuck in a mountain, a person you are trying to save disappears or a truck won't move. Its a really fun game, I just wish they would have spent a little more time in the debugging stage.			"

												Controls aren't the smoothest ever, and it would be nice to see modding capabilities, but its pretty good. It is a different way to take a break from the status quo of gaming. In this game you not only respond to emergencies, but you also control the fire station and assign duties to your crew. Interesting concept, I would say 7.5/10, mainly due to buggy controls and repetative missions on repetative maps.			"

But instead having to drive back to the station to refill on water, every time.It's a Great strategy game, but the logic behind it is a little off.

												Very nicely done. The only thing this game lacks is the object collision. Your units will run/drive right through object/people. It's not very realistic, but not that big of a turn off. The station customization needs to have the ability to add on to your garage as your vehicles are limited. These are not major issues but overall I still say the game needs work. But it's still a very fun thing to experience.			"

												Rescue - Everyday Heroes is a decent game, and the concept of it is quite interesting. The problem is that the game itself isn't very compelling. Allow me to explain.Every mission you are called in to either has to deal with a fire, hurt individuals that require medical attention, or both. Occasionally, the game with throw in other scenarios such as if the player has the proper vehicles/equipment. For instance, upon getting a vehicle optimized for dealing with car crashes, severe car crash missions become available to you. That's pretty interesting, I must say! But after a while, the game becomes boring as you begin to complete every mission by simply putting out fires or aiding harmed people. It just becomes a grind of sorts to get new vehicles to unlock new missions that, at their core, are fundamentally the same.It would be interesting if this game introduced really varied and interesting missions. Such as a gas station set ablaze by an arsonist, and you have limited time to put out fires and rescue people. Time limits could be a very interesting and challenging addition to this game! Point blank, this game could have quite a few things done to it to make it more interesting and compelling to play.Lastly, and perhaps they've fixed this since the last time I've played, but it appears the AI isn't the best at times. You move your crew around by selecting the vehicle or the 'hero' if you will, and then clicking on where you want them to go, or clicking and selecting what you want them to do. Whenever you want them to move to put out a fire, for example, they will do as they're told and get out a hose. But, when they try to go to the fire, they get stuck on a simple object because their pathfinding isn't really the best in the world. So this is, of course, something else that should be improved on.In all, I'd rate this game at a 4/10. The idea is interesting and could be quite fun to play, but there's flaws in the game design and the AI code that could be vastly improved to make it an overall better game. Honestly, I would not recommend this game to anyone who is buying it, if it is indeed in its final state, without many updates in the future.			"

												As a real life volunteer fire fighter and EMT, This game lacks alot of the basics. I was expecting alot more emersion, tools, apparatuses and command abilties based off of RL firefighting. How can a you build a FF game and not have the following:1) A ladder (truck). - enough said. Trucks Co. are just as vitial as engine Co.2) Basic hand tools for forcable entry/rescue. Engine Co. do a lot more than just pour water on fire; all that is available is a short supply line with a portable hydrant which you can connect attack lines too. Does not work that way in RL. 99% of the time, one FF jumps off the engine, grabs the 5 inch hose off the back so the driver can lay in. Then the hydrant gets connected the engine in turn the other FFs grab the attack lines which are already preconnected to the engine. BTW Engines also have master stream or AKA a deck gun.The game play gripes are as follows:1) FF do not lose health or get injurred. 2) The scenarios are way too predictable and arcadish.3) Limited to only 4 apparatus in any scenario.4) No ability to call for Mutual aid if needed.5) Interacting with individual firefighters in scenario is very tetitous - hate having to click 5 times per FF to give orders. Each resource should have command options to direct the Co. actions upon arrival. Clicking and ordering each individual FF is way to tetitous and annoying.6) While in management mode - The game feels too much like SIMS.Other notes - I give an ""E"" for effort on this one - I do not know what the budget was for this game, but I think the devs could have added alot more. I personally think watching some FF training, RL videos, or taking a FF one course could have helped susbstancially in crafting a very intutative FF game.			"

												Love this game, just not long enough. Finished the 'campaign' in 9hrs. No serious issues with this game.Our Current Computer SpecsWindows 7 Home Premium using ""SERCIVE PACK 1"" (Auto update disabled)Hewlett-Packard HP Pavilion g7 Notebook PCAMD Processor A6-3420M APU with Radeon HD Graphics 1.50 GHzRAM 8.00 GB (3.48 usable)64-bit Operating SystemWe did however have to decrease the video settings to ""Low"". When we had big fires to contend with and you had the fire centered in the middle of the screen, the computer started lagging if the video settings where set on Medium or High. The game itself was really quite easy once you got your water tenders(roof cannon). You could send 2 of them to fight fires and replace your crew tactics, as long as it was an outside fire. We had no issues training staff or keeping them happy, just keep moving them around to different assignments and give them 'stand-by' breaks occassionally. Once your station has all the stalls filled with vehicles, you pretty much need to keep 5 mechanics on at one time to keep your equipment in top shape. Train your people often and they will excell to the top, remember though that with their promotion comes pay increases.From a rating of a 10 scale, we rate this game an 8. The lagging of our computer with the fires and not having a difficulty setting where the issues.We bought this game while it was on sale, under $4.00. To us it was well worth it. As the price stands now at $9.99, we would tell you to wait until another price drop.Enjoy!			"

												Do not buy this yet, still needs work, wait for more updates.It's not a horrible game but definitely needs some work. I read the recent patch updates and thought it had solved some of the complaints. I was surprised that I experienced some of the issues that were claimed to have been fixed.Bugs I experienced:- I still had emergency units driving through other cars and static scenery.- Fire engines parking on top of fires- Paramedics running into their stretcher and bumping it into obstacles preventing them from picking it up, example.(Crash scene vehicles, concrete highway median).- Unable to send hired employees into the gym or lecture room after promotion said it was available. I have had several promotions and still unable to use these rooms.All of the clicking it takes to complete simple tasks is a bit much. It makes it more of a memory match game for instance to respond with multiple emergency vehicles you have to remember which unit you removed the medical kit from because it has to be returned to the same unit it was removed from. Your paramedic will just stand there unless you remember. It would be nice and more realistic to be able to drop it to help load the victim instead having to walk back to each vehicle every time you want to complete a simple task. No traffic control ability is ridiculous, vehicles sometimes drive through your accident scene while you're responding with no way to really stop them. I tried using my fire engines to block the traffic which does works but then your fire fighters get stuck trying to get to their equipment. You should be able to send police for traffic control in a one click fashion instead of everything having to be done by tediously clicking one thing at a time.I will keep playing hoping for higher levels to get much better, so far it's not that exciting.

												Not worth it, bought it at 4$ and still think that it's bad deal. I was expecting some sort of challenge (as was some old version emergency I played about 10 years ago), but no I played this game for about 3 hours and it's over, most of staff at highest lvl, me at lvl cap, everything bought, 100k in cash and no new missions available. There are basicly 3 things you do in this game, extinguish fire, transport injured people to hospital and extracting people from wrecks. I was expecting increase of dificulty and more sofisticated missions to become available as the new vehicles unlockes, but no. For example there are 3 types of tenders which should be used for different types of fire, but there is absolutely no difference between them. What's the point of offroad FD vehicle when the regular one can get anywhere?! And perks of your firefighters seems like important part of gameplay.... well again no effect on gameplay.If you really, really (I mean REALLY) love firetrucks, go for it. Otherwise stay away, not worth it. It's just 3 hours of false expectation.			"

												Well, this could be a good game but it has some issues that you can forgive (like the vehicles going through other vehicles making it dumb going from the start point to the objective point since it doesn't require your attention) but it has a major one where in some pc's the framerate drops way too much making it unplayable and since the developers haven't even acknowledge the problem i don't think there will be a fix.If they had more content with a deeper system i would definitely recommend it, if they fixed the framerate i would say that it's an ok game that probably should be bought in a sale but at the present state that game is, no, i don't recommend it unless you want to try your luck and see if the game runs without any problem.

												This is probably first game I haven't finished. Not sure if you even can. It was fun at the start but slowly became repetetive and even though the basic system is nice it just doesn't push you to keep playing more and more. Leveling is very slow but you can just feel it, you can't check how much you need for next level (at least I didn't find it). Maybe in the future I give it another try.Rating: 6/10			"

The on scene micro managing is a bit teedious at times and not quite as detailed as the Emergency style, however there are still some nice touches. The station managent side of this game is very nice and refreshing from other similar games. Overall good, paid about £12 for this, which seems about right.

												I got this 75% off and it was still a waste of my time.It is a good concept, but it lacks a decent interaction system.  The units are incredbily difficult to select.  Getting their equipment is a long drawn out process.  There are two options to play, freeplay, and game.  I finished the ""game"" within 2 hours.  It then cycles through missions you have already completed while you twiddle your thumbs doing nothing new at your station.The freeplay is silly.  You are only given 4 units at one time.  Since it is so hard to control your units, half the battle is getting them there and selecting the right unit to move.  Most of the time when you send your units back to the station, they just sit outside and don't refresh their supplies.  The only way to send your ambulance to the hospital is to have it do a return trip back to the scene of the accident.  So, even if you are done at a scene, you have to wait for your ambulance to return or try to catch it in route to send back to your station.I wouldn't recommend it even for the $5 they are selling it for.  I would find more enjoyment with a bargin bin deal from the local Office Max than play this game again!			"

												I liked the idea of this game but, on the third mission the attack hose seemed to get stuck at a point on the ground and my firefighter was unable to move. More specifically, he could move but tethered to the point where the hose was stuck. Couldn't disconnect the hose and couldn't reach the fire, but I WAS able to exit to the desktop. It's a good idea for a game but terribly executed. Animations are sloppy, interface is clunky, actual firefighting has more hose connecting interaction than actual fire dousing. It's mostly left-click/right-click busy work. And, the station house stuff is just low-rent Sims tedium.Can't recommend it.			"

												This game is just way too easy. I don't know how am I supposed to spend several hours playing it, when there is no challange at all. Not during the missions, not financially, not even in the management area. Several of the first missions are ""basic"", and they stay that way. There is no gradual increase in difficulty, and after slightly over an hour of playing it does not motivate me to continue at all. Same is with money - I've already got plenty of it. Actually I could buy several new vehicles, as my genius maintenance guy always tells me to do (chill man, these are ALREADY NEW ones!). And base upgrading and crew training? Why? I don't see the point, they perform quite well already, and the base has the most basic equipment (like a microwave oven) from the start.Sorry, but no. Get the old Emergency and try to get it running on a modern OS. Way more challenging than this (both, the gameplay and trying to launch it). And way more maps, then just the handful you get here.

												There is a GAME BREAKING glitch in which sometimes the yellow and white hoses ""snag"" on something due to poor pathfinding.  When this happens, your firefighters can't take the hose to where it needs to go, nor can they disconnect the hose so you can arrange things in a way that works.  All that you can do is watch as buildings and civilians burn to ashes or reset the game to the very beginning.  I would recommend this game once this glitch gets patched.			"

												I've played similar games to this many years ago, so thought I'd try this game out, being brand new and all, I was expecting big things - certainly better than their competitors go and such games from years back.One word describes my thoughts about this game; disappointing.Reasons:1. No ability to pan camera around - HUGE defect!Here's some examples;a) if there's a fire next to a large building - your view of the building is obscured, thus, in some circumstances, making it impossible to achieve the goal, of for example, putting the fire out!b) also, on occasions, a firefighter goes behind the fire truck and partially out of view - making in impossible to click on the firefighter (because mouse click will always select truck instead)!2. Awful controls.So many clicks to achieve such small actions, such as... take out hose, couple to truck, extend, add more hose.... and the faffing factor of clicking on (or lost of times clicking near by accident) causes some serious stress. And the whole way of how you have to select personell and match up to vehicle is also confusion because on the despatch page, staff are not categorised.Seriously, if only I knew about point 1 in my list above, that would of been enough to put me off as it's not a matter of if it happens, but when. And that's a truly awful gaming experience as you have to restart sooner or later. :(			"

												Despite the yelling at my crew for getting stuck in odd places and having to restart missions because of it, I couldn't stop playing this. Obviously I came up with a different excuse for dinner being 2 hours behind schedule. Missions are varied, but spread around on a limited set of locations. The anticipation of what could be the next call was partially the reason I had to keep playing. Just one more alarm. Repeatedly.It has issues with AI path finding, and micromanaging can be a challenge without enough zoom or having icons of all units displayed on screen rather than the ones you just selected. I had a good time with this game, even though it could be frustrating, and will likely be getting the sequel hoping I can have just as good a time with the issues from this version being taken care of.The issues might be a game breaker for some, and the genre itself might not be for everyone. But from my perspective the game is alright for what it tries to do, and I enjoyed it.			"

												This game is similar to 911: First Responders. You assume the role of a manager of a firestation. You are responsible for hiring firefighters and paramedics, buying and mantaining emergency vehicles, and dispatching vehicles and personel to the scene of a disaster. The game is very enjoyable to play, but there are plenty of downsides. The pathing AI of your vehicles and staff are just terrible. My ambulances constantly come running in and run over my firemen and victims. Another problem is at the beginning of each scenario, if you dispatch over 4 vehicles, you have a chance of losing additional vehicles because they stop and are stuck in the void of the map border. On just one level, I had the problem where half of my screen would go black, but I haven't seen it arise again. In conclusion, there are still bugs to squash, but it is a fun game to play when you look past that.			"

												The concept for the game was really good, but like many games today it failed to deliver the desired experience. Apart from some bugs (mostly related to object volume and positioning - characters bumping each other into obstacles they can't get out of or vehicles driving through vehicles and such...). The micromanagement isn't really a fault as many people seem to think it is and it's also not something new - as I recall all the previous rescue themed sims had that same mechanics.The major faults here are:- lack of challenges - having beaten the game only once before I can now complete almost any mission under 2 minutes. - lack of content - campaign is very short and super easy to complete- free-play mode does not include station management - it's a cliche arcade-style game for points- BUGS - I have to restart on average 1 in 3 missions because a character got stuck in an object with a victim- optimization - having a powerful rig with 6 physical cores and top of the line GPU won't help you here (speaking from experience) - the longer the mission goes the slower and more choppy the gameplay will get (something to do with fire)I still recommend this game but only if you can get it on a major discount like well below 5€.

There is no police in this game no helicopters of any types.  most fire units such as rescue trucks have 4 to 6 personal in real life. there is no Hazmat units and no real differnces in missions. To much micro-managing you can't even hook the engine up to the hydrants. Also Main lines do not extend long enough along no Command Units.			"

												It's ok; get it on a sale if you like busy work games. Basically you manage a fire station that does some mission scenarios putting out fires. The rest, you spend on your station like air conditioners which makes no sense to me. Very bad game in my opinion, but others beg to differ.			"

												I am done with these god awful Firefighter games. I tried to enjoy playing this game but the fauls are so massive they wipes out everything it does right so here I go Pros -     they gave a good amount of work to the fire station and it cool to play in    The trucks look good  Cons -   aka everything eles   Tankers are jacked up there job is to supply the engines with water or dump there water in a dump tank so the engine can draft from it. In this game there just engine with more water.  The runs are dull and stupid  MVA Fire Medical over and over and over. Mix it up thats what being a firefighter is all about not knowing what you are going to have to do. The lights staying on is good allthough they need more. The siren is stupid one tone for ALL the trucks really is this the best you people can come up with? were is the airhorn and the Ferdel Q you know The Best Part Of The Truck! so Much Micro its to much  Interor Firefighting in this game is a joke. You look inside find the fire pick the fireman to go in BUT he wants to go all the way to the top and get stuck. >.< really!!!!!!!!!!!!   1/10 a big fat joke     "

												This is an enjoyable game, but I have recently found that it subtracted money from my bank account for every mission I completed.  This is a game breaking bug because the game is no longer playable after this bug activates.			"

												The concept for the game was really good, but like many games today it failed to deliver the desired experience. Apart from some bugs (mostly related to object volume and positioning - characters bumping each other into obstacles they can't get out of or vehicles driving through vehicles and such...). The micromanagement isn't really a fault as many people seem to think it is and it's also not something new - as I recall all the previous rescue themed sims had that same mechanics.The major faults here are:- lack of challenges - having beaten the game only once before I can now complete almost any mission under 2 minutes. - lack of content - campaign is very short and super easy to complete- free-play mode does not include station management - it's a cliche arcade-style game for points- BUGS - I have to restart on average 1 in 3 missions because a character got stuck in an object with a victim- optimization - having a powerful rig with 6 physical cores and top of the line GPU won't help you here (speaking from experience) - the longer the mission goes the slower and more choppy the gameplay will get (something to do with fire)I still recommend this game but only if you can get it on a major discount like well below 5€.

												Rarely do I ever play these kinds of games, mostly because I can't run them on my laptop, but this game ran fantastically. There really is no story to the game, just missions. As you progress you unlock new vehicles and events. It's actually a pretty fun game.It would be nice if there was some more replayability to the game. In it's current state, once the game ends you can keep going, but it only lets you play old missions over. Regardless, this game is on fire!			"

												I really wanted to like this game and it's not horrible, but the gameplay mechanics aren't very good. From the 3 hours (10 months ingame I think) I played, there's just no challenge to the game. Perhaps if the devs spent a few more months polishing and fixing the mechanics, it would have been really good.If you want a good strategy firefighting game, look for ""Fire Department"" (""Emergency Fire Response"" in the US). It's an older game and it's linear (the campaign consists of scripted missions), but the mechanics make much more sense. Altough I'm not sure if it works on Win7/8.Some pointers:- Fire is harmless. It cannot kill anyone. Your firefighters can stand in the middle of the fire and nothing happens to them. From what I've seen, the missions where you just extinguish fire (no victims) don't have any failure conditions. The fire can spread to an extent, but it seems to do only visual damage. Property damage doesn't seem to matter and you're not penalised for it in any way.- The vehicles don't behave like vehicles. They can turn on spot and pass through each other.- The managment aspect looks promising at first, but it's pretty shallow. Money is not really a problem, since you gain more than you really need.- Too much micromanaging. Especially when it comes to deploying hoses. The hose mechanic isn't a bad idea, but it get old pretty fast and requires too many clicks.- Hoses generally behave like hoses, which is good. They can bug out sometimes though.- The camera is kind of weird. I can't really put my finger on it, but when you zoom in the perspective seems wrong.- Most missions I played took like 1-4 minutes. Most time is spent on micromanaging the hoses.			"

												A very fun and simple game, can become repetitive. Can upgrade your fire station, hire staff, purchase numerous vehicles, and run missions. Overall I would give this game a 7/10. With the $9.99 price tag it's got numerous hours of fun for the chilled back and hardcore sim player!			"

												Worth the price, it feels like sim hospital in ways but the RTS and game progression is as fast as you wish.Main issue i found was the steep learning curve, getting thrown into a burning building level or figuring out how to use the hoses correctly is hard. The game gives you heaps of time to learn during the missions so it'll work out as long as you have the right gear on you.One thing i've found is that reading the text tends to tell you what to bring...

												I think this game is on the right track. It has a good idea, but the implementation was wrong. Firstly, let me just say the hose line mechanics are plainly wrong. It's not even that hard to get it right. The game focused heavily on tanks, but completely ignored pumps. There's a reason a fire engine is called a pumper. It's because it takes water from a water supply and pumps it into the attack lines. You can't fight fire off of a fire hydrant because a hydrant doesn't have a pump. You similarly can't fight fire off a water tanker truck because it has a very small pump (only used for refilling the tank at a hydrant). The correct way of doing the mechanics would have been to connect a hydrant or a tanker to a pumper using a supply line, and then connecting attack lines to a pumper to fight fire. Many fire departments preconnect attack lines to pumpers so that the engine can pull up, one person grabs a preconnected attack line and goes to fight fire, the other person engages the pump. The game already has the mechanic for that in the High Pressure Hose on the Terrain Fire Engine.All in all, close, but the realism suffered because the game designer didn't understand how what he was seeing actually operates.

												This game is similar to 911: First Responders. You assume the role of a manager of a firestation. You are responsible for hiring firefighters and paramedics, buying and mantaining emergency vehicles, and dispatching vehicles and personel to the scene of a disaster. The game is very enjoyable to play, but there are plenty of downsides. The pathing AI of your vehicles and staff are just terrible. My ambulances constantly come running in and run over my firemen and victims. Another problem is at the beginning of each scenario, if you dispatch over 4 vehicles, you have a chance of losing additional vehicles because they stop and are stuck in the void of the map border. On just one level, I had the problem where half of my screen would go black, but I haven't seen it arise again. In conclusion, there are still bugs to squash, but it is a fun game to play when you look past that.			"

												very good game well made. its a lot of fun to play pretty neat to try a different style game than what i play. how ever it really needs to be expanded quite a bit more trucks and content. make missions more complex for the players even break the game down to being able to fit each truck with w.e gear you want it to have. other than super fun game worth the 20$ to buy hope everyone enjoys and willl continue to play in the future. i give this game a 5 star rating over all			"

												Upon my experience of playing this game. Very positive. As this is the only other Emergency based game I own since I played Emergency 4 in 2010. Although this game is similar to EM4, there is a lot of differences. The first thing you have to do is earn your fire station money by completing missions and you start off with just one fire truck and two firefighters. You can buy more at the start but its not necessary at the beginning as the first mission is simple. But as you progress through the game. You will need more units and vehicles for the tougher missions. However you can unlock more vehicles and units as you progress through the game. Also you can upgrade your headquarters with amenties as well as teach your crew new traits and skills that will be helpful in the harder missions. However there is a downside to this game compared to Emergency 4 with the LA mod. The let down is the AI because unlike in EM4 where if you unload the EMT medics to treat a casualty with one. The other one doesn't seem to detect any victims and treat them automatically which is a shame because if the AI was more optimised for this. Fewer critical injuries would occur. Also the AI is a bit erractic with the firefighters as sometimes with the water and foam tender vehicles. They drive through the blaze before putting it out if lift to their own devices. But other than those issues. This is a very nice game to play and I would like to see some DLC come out for this game in the future :). Especially some official licenced vehicles like Pierce, E-ONE, Seagrave etc.But to be honest if you like these sort of games like I do. Then buy it as its quite addictive and very fun to play. I have completed the storyline missions. So now I am going to see if there is anything else left to unlock. The UK price of £6.99 that I paid is a bargain. Overall Rating: 9/10.			"

												Rescue - Everday Heros is entertaining enough as an emergency management simulator however it has some serious issues. The most glaring problem is there is pretty much zero automation; you have to micromanage every aspect of every token on screen. If you want your firefighters to grab and connect firehoses while your paramedics start triaging the injured, you'll have to control all of them through every step (including exiting/entering vehicles). This is really annoying considering you may have 12 tokens that you have to micro manage. The only automation they offer is that you can send the ambulance to the hospital (so long as you remembered to assign a driver) and it will return. Pathfinding is sometimes difficult for your tokens. They may have difficulty finding their way indoors, attaching a firehose, picking up a stretcher, driving vehicles, triaging, putting an injured person in an ambulance and generally finding their way to any area you assign them to. This is not a constant problem however it is noticable throughout the game.This is a very short game with a low variety of missions/mission structure. There are traffic collisions, fires, medical aids and one or two different crisis missions (not mentioned for spolier control). After you respond to a few different calls the missions generally start to feel the same even though they may or may not take place on a different map.Even with the issues I found this game fun though I cannot recommend it for everyone. If you are looking for an emergency management simulator that allows you to put out fires, save lives, command a fleet of emergency vehicles and are willing to look past/work with the issues, this game is for you. If poor RTS mechanics drive you insane, avoid it.			"
