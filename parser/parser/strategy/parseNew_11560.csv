												Great concept and amazing game, but replay value is limited. The story is good, the mechanics are great, but it lacks replay value... It's worth at least playing once though.			"

												Good game. Has few flaws, but it is certainly not bad. All 3 races are different, but also look familiar to the zerg-protoss-terran stuff. Still game feels unique. You can also control the commander in 3rd person!And last thing. Steam says it is SP only. But there is LAN (online service was shut down ages ago) still have'nt tested it, but it should work well. It's a good game if you like RTS, and is worth the money especially on sale.			"

												Good:very unique, fun gameplay that I havent seen in an RTS before.AI can build your base for you while you focus on the combat.the three races are suprisingly different from one-another.The terrian is dynamic, and can be manipulated to build walls, ditches, and foxholes.Bad:Some players need to use a glitch just to get to the main menu.Everyone in the game moves at half the speed of smell.One of the races (ascension) has a completely broken AI.Ascension takes forever to get the cool units.The direct control ability, where you take direct control of a hero unit as a third-person shooter is god-aweful.The most important resource, water, takes forever to get despite most of the battles taking place near the ocean.Conclusion: an interesting game with too many flaws to make it ""good""  Definitely worth picking up if you can find it for cheap.  Anything over $5 is too much. "

												this is one of those games you want to like but can't.it was released in 2007 and that might be part of its issues running.it runs on something called vista run time. this is something i have never seen before so maybe thats part off it.i have never seen a game where you give the a.i. orders and it just does what it wants to.you tell the group to go west it goes east. the group doesnt even stay together each one just wonders around on its own.in this case you couldnt even have a fight that you want cause part of them will fight and the rest walk away.the game will hang at cut videos. you will lose sound and i had to go to task manager to even get it to shut down.i really wanted a good turn based game but this isnt it.

												The introduction and presentation of the story suckered me in to try this game, but then I realized that this is one of those old games that aged bad and you can only find enjoyment if you approach it with the nostalgia goggles on.

												This game reminds me of some of the old school RTS games. A few probles with pathfinding, a few problems with building spacing, nice story line.I recommend this game in spite of its flaws as it is fun to play, You just need to be willing to put up with old school quirks.			"

												For some reason steam time is not correct on steamMaelstrom had great potential to be a strong strategy game, but the bugs make it far too frustrating. The developers should have programmed a fourth faction, the Earth itself, to swallow up the Remnants, Ascension and Hai-Genti, because none of them have the brains to inherit this world.			"

												Pretty unique game with terra forming as part of the strategy.It's fun with a challenging campaign and three very different armies to play. The only negative is I had to play in windowed mode to get around a bug that happens on start up, do that and you're set with a really well balanced RTS that's not a clone copy of a better game.			"

												I'm surprised Steam managed to get this working.SummaryMaelstrom: The Battle for Earth Begins is a Real-Time Strategy/Third-Person Shooter hybrid developed by KD-Vision Games in Russia, published by Codemasters, and released in 2007.The game takes place in 2057 where corporations rose to power and caused a nuclear war.The resulting climate change has rendered much of the planet inhospitable to human life.Within this chaos, three forces battle out for control of the Earth.The Remnants are the rebel forces of those who still fight for freedom and justice.The Ascension are an imperialistic collective of corporations ruled by Arlan Khan.The Hai-Genti are an alien race that seeks to conquer Earth after destroying their homeworld.ProsThe game features two unique mechanics known as terraforming and weather control, which allow players to transform entire maps at will, provided they have enough resources.The voice acting is fairly decent, although the unit voices are rather annoying.It has an original story and all of the characters are quite memorable.ConsAs one might expect from a game made in 2007, its graphics are significantly outdated and the CD version is incompatible with any operating systems made after Windows 95/XP/Vista.The Steam version is merely a bypass to this incompatibility, but there are consequences.There are two crippling bugs that cause the game to crash consistently.These bugs occur at random and there's no autosave, so if you get this game, SAVE OFTEN.The first bug occurs between transitions such as loading screens and cutscenes.The game will freeze and any audio playing at that moment will skip like a broken record.The second bug occurs during gameplay, especially when using the Third-Person mechanic.The game will suddenly stop and exit automatically without any notification.ConclusionThere's not much to say about this game, it's really fun but time has left it on life support.KDV Games is defunct and Codemasters disowned the game by taking it off their website.Because of this, this game is abandonware, which means anyone has the opportunity to remaster it and breathe life back into the series, especially since its ending suggests a sequel.

												While this game does have some interesting things they tried to do, I feel that it has lost in some of the most basic elements of an RTS.  Whether this is a result of lack of polish or overemphasis on a few key features, the result is a game that just feels weak.  Leaving aside cinematics, vocals and dialog, from the very beginning, the command UI feels frustrating.  There is no feeling of control over an engagement; your infantry will wander around and do whatever they want.  They'll watch complacently while a teammate is mowed down five feet away, and one guy will take a jog around three sides of a building to rejoin the squad after you moved them to an adjacent corner.  Any attempt at strategy is pointless, and blobbing soldiers is really the only thing you can do.  The game's age isn't an excuse; there are many games much older than this one that have better playability.  The Ground Control series comes to mind.			"

												Maelstorm have a nice plot, nice units and gameplay mixing rts and a short of tps. But there is too many bugs, the moviments are bad and the units move for themselvs.So, i don't recommend this game if you don't have a lot of patience with bugs and bad moviments.			"

												Run,.... Run as far away from this game as possible. The game is buggy (for me the game got stuck each time there was some kind cutscene or longer speech from npc or ""narrator"". then i had to alt-tab out and back for the sound to continue). The gameplay is not very good. The controle of your units is not very good. All in all a waste of money - Thank the powers that be that i got the game on a sale and didn't pay full price.			"

												It's like the developers have never seen a classical strategy game in their life before.This is a very basic game, feels like it was developed by a group of bored friends with only a little time/knowledge on their hands.UI doesn't spread to wide screen but stays where it would be on 4:3, ""A"" hotkey doesn't exist, commanding the teams feels unnatural... This just isn't what I expected and got bored too soon...			"

												Yea i dont recommend this game because two things1. its not very intristing and is very difficult to catch on to, even for a person who has been playing strategy games there whole life...2. You can not play on multiplayer for some dumb reason which i hope they fix than i may change my review...			"
