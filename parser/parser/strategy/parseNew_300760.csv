								okey, somethings.1- DEVS, PLEASE dont let this game die.2- IMPROVE AI , too easy to kill them, maybe a bit more challenging (more accuracy or something like that)3- MORE AI, feels a bit lonely =/4- Much more maps5- Random generated missions (and spawn zones too)6- more equipment. AKA customization of u and ur team7- More movement of your team (they can go to A or B or whatever place, maybe not in straight line all the time). AKA, improve AI in general8- REALLY REALLY well done so far.(extremely cool graphics btw, really really polished)If you can improve this little things this could be an amazing game.A really really good one srsly.

								Promising: its bare  bones, i really can't stand the iron sights/red dot.I'm not convinced i like the sci fi look of your and enemy  troops. Much prefer realistic modern uniforms, vest and other current tactical  gear.But a few times, i do get flash backs from raven shield!So currently  promisingUpdate:After 2ish hours of playing I can update the game to VERY promising. I just did a whole mission only killing 2 tangos my self, with ordering my team to do the rest, and they following my plan. This is a great thing! I got a serous SWAT/R6 feel.			"

								Reviewing the game in Pre-Alpha, version 1.07. As far as Early Access games go, this one is pretty solid. I also own Takedown: Red Sabre. Epsilon has very well kept some of the best qualities of Takedown and removed the worst qualities.I like the futuristic setting and design work for Epsilon, it's just a bit futuristic but not to the point that you're using rayguns and fighting martians. It works really well with the new Unreal Engine 4 graphics, which look great, as always. Epsilon has working squad commands! Your squad feels much more useful in Epsilon than in Takedown because of it. Enemy AI seems to be improved, as I haven't seen the glaring pathing issues that you would sometimes see in Takedown. The sniper and the planning phase mechanics are really fun! Overall: Good replay value, nice graphics, plenty challenging. I definitely recommend picking this one up! It's currently got 2 completed maps, no co-op yet, ragdolls, squad commands, It's worth the 8 bucks they're asking for now, and the price will only go up as they keep adding content. But yeah, it's a very fun pre-alpha that on its own, is already better than Takedown minus less maps currently available.			"

								This game (even in such an early build) really shows great promise.  It appears to be headed in the direction of a classic Rainbow Six or SWAT style game but with a unique look.  If this is just 30% of the final game, then we have a lot to look forward to.  If you are tired of run'n'gun and killstreaks and want to be more strategic and realistic, this may be the game for you.The developers have a proven track record of taking fan feedback seriously, so get on board now and help shape this game.

								What can I say about Epsilon? I'm not one for words and don't think I've left a review on a Steam Store Page so far but I want to show my support for this title.I know some of you will have come here maybe to bash on the game since Takedown has Mostly Negative reviews but anyone who kept track the Dev Team got stuck in a bad situation with support from the Publisher dropping out soon after the game launched, The team still managed to put out updates to fix issues with the game despite the lack of money but it wasn't quite enough to save the game and with the publisher owning the title they had to stop working on it.Enough about Takedown, just wanted to bring it up to talk about Serellan themselves, they are very active within the community taking feedback to heart and replying daily to users, I'm sure the team didn't want to leave Takedown but had no other choice, now with them being indie they don't have to worry about all that red tape that comes with a Publisher.Sure, Epsilon has its problems but the moment you boot up the game you can already see how many things have been fixed with each build and within the same day the game had come out feedback was already being put into the game ready for the next build, you can't ask for more then that from a team of 5 devs.Some of you have come looking at this title for the next SWAT/Rainbow Six game and while the game does have those elements with the Planning Map, Commanding Squads and such you have to remember its been 10 years since we had those games, nostalgia is a b***h and its easy to be more forgiving of say AI from then, then it is now.Epsilon has to work on being unique while at the same time trying to cater to what the fans want, sure some are not big on the near future Sci-Fi stuff but you need to think about it, we have so many games that are already trying to cover the now, we don't need the market over saturated like with World War 2 games at one point in time.I feel like I've already spent my fair share of time with the 1 mission, 7 weapons, 2 gamemodes and I can safely say this is already a solid foundation for the future of what Hardcore Tactical Gamers want and you should be keeping an eye on it! you can choose to jump on the Early Access bandwagon and give the team feedback and help shape the game while getting it at a low price before the bigger features hit like co-op/pvp and it starts costing more or you can wait and see how it goes.Don't forget, Steam has a refund program, jump in now give the game a shot see if you see the same potential others are and keep playing with each new update, not happy? take the refund and with any luck come back in the future when it has had more time to grow.... Feel like I didn't really talk about the games features itself but you can find others reviews for that and hit up the Videos section on the Community Hub if you want to see some gameplay.TL;DR: I can recommend this game to anyone who wants to see the Hardcore Tactical Genre make a come back, sure it has its issues but you will get some fun out of it and remember its in PRE-ALPHA, just the fact Serellan is still around after the failure of Takedown? I enjoyed it... anyway, they deserve the chance to make the game they want and hopefully the game you want.Mainly wrote this to give my Thumbs Up...			"

Early Access Review
								This is in a ""proof of concept"" quality level, with updates being pretty rare (almost 5 months). There are some indications that it might pick up (from the developer's Twitter conversation with some other developers ""we gotta reboot Epsilon"" and ""Finally admitting I can't do this all on my own""). Until then, it's not enough to play like a normal game. I played for 25 minutes and felt like that was enough for me to get a taste of everything. That being said, it does seem to have promise, there are a few things I'm not a huge fan of, but overal, it uniqely fills a void left by Rainbow Six 3 and its predecessors. I understand this games vision and I love that vision. Whether that vision is actualized remains to be seen. So, if you want to throw in some money on the hopes that that might help this project move forward, go for it. But right now, it's definitely uncertain whether this will get finished or not, so otherwise, you might want to add it to your watch list and come back in a year or two.			"

								You broke my heart with Takedown, the only reason I tried this was because it was your way of saying you're sorry..  I'm so pleased with what I found in my time in this game so far, all of the things that made the classic tactical games great, looks and plays great.   AI is still a bit inconsistent (at least when it comes to enemies, I'm having a gunfight with a guy and another 3 feet from him is just watching like nothing is happening, it's rare but it happened a time or two).   it's early and I can tell you're not holding back with this game, it's fantastic..

Early Access Review
Disclaimer - I have received a copy of this game free of charge for review purposes, note that this will not detract from the quality of this review.EPSILON ReviewEpsilon is a very early access game.  Having been released in October 2015, Epsilon still shows a lot of promise, though in its current state it still has a long way to go.This review will be based on what I actually expect from a game which has been released as an early access title.  Scoring represents the current build of the game as of July 27th 2016 and may not apply to future patches.Gameplay 4.5/10, undercooked.Epsilon is heavily focused on tactics and planning.  So far, the player has been given the abillity to plot out routes to the objective on the map.  Before the player and the team hops into the the fps action, the area can be surveyed with the security cameras installed around the building.  Sadly this function is completely useless.  For me, tagged enemies did not appear through the walls, and the cameras were too poorly placed for the NPCs to be spotted.  For some reason, the developers felt that it would be more important to place cameras around the empty sparesely-patrolled hallway, instead of ones in the rooms of the building, where the majority of the hostile NPCs are spawned in.  In the game's current state, the map design is sub-par as the game seems to have taken visuals over practical map design, like what EA did with BF4.  Speaking of AI, the AI is primitive.  They fail to properly alert themselves from a nearby gunshot, yet seem to be able to instantly spot the player from a mile away through blurred glass, something that I wish to be improved on, especially since this game is focused on tactics.  In its current state, Epislon's AI is too dumb for its own good but over the course of a year, I can see a lot of improvements which can be done to fix everything and turn this game around.In its current state, the game has two modes: Elimination and Story.  Strangely enough, neither of these modes have their objectives properly displayed to the player.  I believe story usually consists of the player freeing hostages which the player must scour every room on every floor to find, a very tedious task without the help of proper security camera placement.Among the many things that fps games must get right, the guns are the most important.  Epsilon approaches this subject with its tiptoes, so to speak.  The player is provided with a variety of weapons, and even more to come, but there is a lack of proper visual feedback when firing shots and I'm sure the community would very much appreciate the application of a better soundscape and visual feedback from shooting and getting shot over new weapons.  Speaking of guns, the pistol is so inaccurate, it's ridiculous.  I emptied a full magazine on someone across the hallway with a pistol and not a single bullet hit.  Why are the pistols more inaccurate than my shotgun?Personally, I believe the game shows so much potential, but I'm worried that the developers will forget about these major issues with the game.  Here are the following gameplay aspects which should be improved on:AI intelligenceSurveillance camera positionsOverall map design (especially the office map)Gun balancingUI and HUD, the blue circuit board-like wires across the screen take up far too much space.  More information can be desplayed in a less intrusive way.In its current build, Epsilon puts a lot of food on the table.  The command options available for the player to control the team are varied and teases a lot of future features which I hope will be implemented.  Sadly, this content is still unreleased and it'd be unfair for me to review said unreleased content purely based on my predicitions.A good thing that the game has already done is the self-promotion of its own mechanics.  What I mean by this is that the game silently encourages the player to play this game the way it's meant to be played.  Players who charge into rooms will find themselves easily gunned down.  A tactical approach must be used and it definitely shows that this fps is meant to be played slowly and strategically.  A nice start for a Pre-Alpha Early Access title.Story/Lore N/AIt's in Pre-Alpha, don't expect a fleshed-out story this early.Visuals/Stlye 7/10 Surprisingly high-quality, but inconsistent.Epsilon is a breath of fresh air for the indie genre in terms of its visuals.  The game is powered by Unreal Engine 4 (as advertised in the main menu) and at times I found myself wanting to become a staff member of some of the offices thanks to the sleep colour scheme and design of some of the maps.  The game's maps are reminiscent of the Mirror's Edge franchise, which uses white as a base and recurring bright colours as highlights.  Epsilon's maps have a stunning similarity and for the developers to design such a good looking map in such a short time is impressive to say the least, though improvements to gameplay and other more important aspects in the game are due.The game's current UI is just offensive.  It takes up about a quarter of the entire screen.  This UI doesn't display a minimap or other important information, just teammate health and an endless well of ammunition.  I'd like to see significant improvements to the UI and HUD of the game.ConclusionPros+Immense amounts of potential+Nice, slow gameplay+Stunning visuals +Non-linear gameplay, players can choose their own approachCons-Very barebones and primitive-Counter-intuitive UI-Dumb AI-Confusing map designRating: 11.5/20, a game with the potential to become top-quality hamstrung by its poor first impression with me.  This review doesn't do a game with so much potential any justice.  If everything that the game teases is done right, with a little polish and shine, Eplison has what it takes to be a top-notch tactical fps.I recommend trying out this game if you don't mind spending a bit of your money, it's not that expensive, after all.  Just be warned that the game is still VERY barebones and has none of its mechnics properly fleshed out yet.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

								I recommend this game because if you have been waiting for a spiritual successor to the original rainbow six titles, it absolutely needs your money. It looks like Serellan learned from their mistakes with Takedown: Red Sabre and have made a legit, OG Rainbow Six-esque tactical shooter, complete with pre-mission planning and squad commands, which is all stuff they should've put in Red Sabre imo. BE WARNED, the game itself is a bit glitchy; they are really stressing the fact that it's still early access and only about 30% done according to the front page, but this game has great promise. With time, a good amount of time, and a community willing to give constructive (keyword!) feedback, it could actually be the game many of us have been looking and waiting so long very, very for.			"

								As a pre-alpha it is obviously rough around the edges, so you should not buy it if you expect content rich polished title out of the box. But it already is very promissing, including trueFPS view, preplanning, squad commands, surveillence, early nonlethal mechanics and other things we loved in Rainbow Six and SWAT series. The developers are active and react to the feedback, so if you are fine with buying incomplete game and want to see/help to shape it into something great, feel free to buy it. It's just few bucks and the potential is there.You can track the development on their trello page:https://trello.com/b/VdkamYlj/epsilon-roadmap "

								Attempts to be a return to the classic tactical shooters (Rainbow Six up to 3, SWAT 3 and 4, etc) but fails to remember why those were actually fun. Movement and aiming is incredibly clunky, ""story mode"" is obnoxious, enemy meshes don't at all fit with the world (generic South American militia in super futuristic cyber land), guns also don't really fit the setting. There are a bunch of parts, but all of them are rough (early access, but read on) and none of them fit well togetherBecause therein lies the big issue: The devs just don't seem to care. They looked at a checklist of what people have been complaining about since R6 Vegas and they add it: - Optiwand to mirror under doors? Check, but it moves incredibly slowly and has awkward controls (you move the camera with WASD...). Also, this will switch you back to your primary instantly- Useful secondary equipment and not just pistols? Sort of. There is a grenade launcher of some form that seems to fire high explosive rounds... that make the terrorists surrender.- Modern military weapons: Sort of. It looks like they found a generic asset pack of a few FN guns and added that in... which is strange when this is set in a cyber-future land... full of what look like Fidel Castro's dopplegangers- Squad commands: Surprisingly yes, but it depends on a circular menu (think powers in Mass Effect, but clunkier). And becuase this is an attempt at emulating the games of olde, it involves multiple levels, none of which flows well together.- Open doors with mousewheel: I have been missing this for years, but it is pointless as two rapid swipes of my wheel opened the door about halfway. So unless I am peaking (which is what the optiwand is for), I don't know why this is hereAnd that is the thing. Yes, this is early access and most of this can be fixed (better controls and new asset packs). But why is this here in the first place? Why is there a fundamentally flawed command menu? Why would things that worked, and what are clearly inspirations, be changed to not work? There is a fundamental difference between pushing an incomplete game (awkward animations, lack of content, funky AI, all the sound issues I neglected to mention) and pushing one where the mechanics just don't work. Even basic playtesting should have revealed most of those.A huge step up from this studio's previous (abandoned) game, but still a long way to go.If you want the gunplay of olde, look into Insurgency. If you want the spirit, consider one of the more recent Rainbow Sixes (Vegas lacks tactics but definitely has the spirit of an R6 game). And if what you miss is the planning, consider Doorkickers or Breach and Clear... or just buy one of the first three Rainbow Sixes.			"

								Epsilon is not bad for what is being charged at the moment. Epsilon in it's current state (pre-alpha) performs surprisingly well on lower end systems and looks half decent aswell. Epsilon features a few of the game mechanics that made the old Tom Clancy games great such as being able to pre-plan your mission (Rainbow Six 3), the fiber optic camera to scout underneath doors (Splinter Cell and eventually Rainbow Six) and the ability to open doors incrementally to provide much more cover when scouting a room for enemies and making entry kills (Rainbow Six 3). Serellan LLC are known for the subpar game Takedown: Red Sabre but it appears that the devs have taken into consideration what was wrong with the game as a tactical shooter and fixes a few of the problems in Epsilon, however it does carry some of the problems over like the somewhat sluggish movement system and the insanely fast reaction times of the enemy AI at times. Epsilon for what it is worth at the moment is not bad but you may want to hold off buying the game until some of the bugs and gameplay features are ironed out. All in all I like where this game is heading and it is great to see tactical shooters like this and Ground Branch coming back into the gaming world.Also a message to the devs if they end up reading this: Don't be afraid to ask the community for suggestions on how to improve the game as we all want to see this become an amazing game and we are happy to help to make this game become better than it already is.TL:DR Version:Pros: Follows old style of tactical shooters such as Rainbow Six 3 and SWAT 4Runs decently on older systems as far as I knowCons:AI isn't that great (to be expected in a pre-alpha game)Game has bugs (to be expected)			"

								The game is a pre alph so unfished..But it is totally playabale and when you understood the functions it is quite nice.Awesome is that you are able to get even more then 1080p out of it :) looks great.The enemy is a bit to lazy and a bit to inactive in my eyes.Also the pistol handling is ridiclious the movements of the pistol are totally unrealistic and by way to harsh.I would also fix that the ctrl left can be used a aim button.I noticed when you use the right mouse button then you are constantly pushing on the mouse which slows your reaction response time down.The sights are quite good and love the iron sight :).The reaponse of the soldier feels a bit slowed down that can be a bit more responsive.Given to the pre alpha status i  give it a 7/10 .Resume:With a bit of work done these game can be awesome :)			"

								so far so good, the game is running pretty good the command menu works it does glitch abit making it hard to select at times but it works and the team ai do what ever you tell them to from the menu or from the quick keys. i noticed a bug if you have a team mate secure any hostage in unipol mission it breaks the game making the mission not complete right but it works fine if you secure them yourself with key f. the team ai character models are abit gltchy as  the weopons are not in there hands correctly at the moment, i would like a toggle option for aiming down sights and crouching, some time the sights dont respond if team ai are close behind you but if you sprint forward abit the work again fine, i have completed both missions and do like them very much, the game feels tactical and intense and the game randomises there locations so there  not always going to be in the same place which makes the game even harder sometimes the game will kill you with one shot and other time it takes more but the one shot glitch happens every so often, i like that the enemies do surrender and they can be secured, i would like to se some gadgets like grenades, stun, gas,smoke,or and shock grenade or something, the weopns are good and i would like to see more maps when the game comes out fully il be looking forward to the coop.

								*If you're experiencing crashes update your drivers*Game is pretty cool, it's got a great foundation to build upon, and mostly all of the important feature are already implemented in the game.Things I'd like to see:1. Vertical Movements, like rapelling and such.2. Futuristic guns3. More special equipment, like a remote controlled camera, sledgehammer, ie.4. Better animations and more animations (animations for things like breaching and opening locked doors)5. Customization.It's too early to make a clear yes/no recommendation, if you think it looks cool, you should buy it, it's only $7 and has a mass amount of potential, if not, keep your eye on it, and see how things develop. This could potentially be a great return to form for the tactical genre.			"

								This is something that has a lot of potential to become a really fun game. It reminds me of Rainbox Six Vegas 2, one of my all time favourite shooters. I think the major thing the developer needs to focus on is polishing some nice, clean base mechanics and then really pushing for content. The worry with this game could be overdoing it. If executed right, this game could have that simple charm that games like Rainbow Six vegas had. The thing the vegas had and this game didn't is smoothness to the movement. Obviously, this game is very early in its development so I could possibly be too critical in that respect, but it is definitely something that needs to be done right early on.The planning phase of this game is a really nice feature, but it is hindered a lot (and honestly quite frustrating) by how clunky it is. I think the cameras need a high sensitivity and should controlled with WASD. A and D should look left and right, and W and S should cycle between them. It's nice and quick and can be done without needing to use the mouse for everything. There are like 20 cameras per level and people are going to replay levels a lot so it needs to be fast and convenient in order to avoid it being really frustrating. The last thing you want is a nice quirky feature being ruined by how long it takes to use.Movement and aiming is something that needs a lot of attention. I feel the base speed should be slightly quicker in general, creeping around everywhere where not much goes on does get a little boring. The aiming is very hard to use due to the glitchyness of it. Couldn't imagine why it is happening but it is very jittery, and I would focus on having cleaner recoil, that was the thing that bugged me about Rainbow six, but you could counter it by going up against the wall. This game (I guess) isn't going in that direction, so clean recoil is a must.The bots are a little too fast to act. They need to dumbed down a bit by having a delay from when they hear shooting.Again, It's something I'm sure will be sorted out, but finding out where you are being shot from is a big issue. I can never see the muzzle flare from any guns being fired and there are no damage indicators that I can see.Story isn't something I expect to get from this game, I really wouldn't care if it is there or not. I think the focus should lie in getting some really good mechanics down and working on fun PvE levels. Because that is where I feel the real value could lie in this game.Perhaps consider a replay button when you die to go back to the start of the level with your plans already in place with the option to go back and alter the plans instead of wiping them every time.In short, this could be a game with a lot of playtime value if the Mechanics are cleaned up as soon as possible. It doesn't really need any more features that I can see, just a nice big pollish and then a push for content. I will follow its progress because I really want to see sucess in this title.			"

								PLAYED ON - Intel core 2 duo, 4 gb, sli 260mfps out of the box= 22-30fps average I have officially played an hour, and I am convinced that this is money well spent! This is extremely early. but its very playable.Fun? YES!My only personal qualms: -I love my modern weapons, the blacklight look takes a bit of getting used to-Comic book art is so far removed from the actual gameplay art....-gun doesnt feel ""attatched"" like my arms are not pulliing the rifle butt to my chest, like its too far away.... hard to explain...-scope zoom is excellent... but we dont need futuristic crosshairs...-scope zoom needs to be completely blacked out on the outer edes, to simulate complete focus of the eye through the scope.My personal loves;everything else. the presentation, music, and universe is very interesting. I really feel like there is a ""raven shield"" vibe that lends seriousness to the high stakes iction in place.Wishlist:-Solo mode, is fine. Multiplayer, let us rename our guys.-A few more modern weaponsthe levels are laid out awesome, and deaths dont feel cheap like the other game 505 is pushing.so happy wit this. I will try on my other rig and add to this soon.peace guys.			"

								Sorry I can´t recommend it yet... the AI is just too dumb and the one level existing so far looks too squaky-clean... also there is no real challenge and the squad AI and command interface is REALY bad... I will update once it gets better... for a alpha I guess its ok but this is about ""should I buy it or not"" and on that front it´s still a ""no"" unless you want to support the developer.			"

Got an Epsilon key for free, because I've kickstarted TakedownUpdate: 28.05.16Well, surprise! It's Takedown all over again T.T:http://steamcommunity.com/app/300760/discussions/0/364040961437907349/Update: 12.04.16:Let's be honest: the game has been in early access for over half a year (!) now and I could not say that they have updated the game in any significant way. If it still was in (pre-)alpha, then we should have been seeing major changes happening by now!The last updates were just some minor bug squishes 2 months ago and you know what they say, you can't polish a turd...I'm sorry for everyone involved in developing the game and I'm sure you are doing your best, but it seems it isn't working out.Update: 06.03.16:Another month gone by with just some small fixes to show for... Update: 05.02.16: They've recently updated the game, but it's just minor things: They've added a new weapon, partial controller support, bug fixes etc. 4 months since release and the big update that will overhaul the AI and some major gameplay elements is not in sight.So I've started the game again to see what they've changed, made some waypoints through the first level for my AI partners and just consecutively pressed ""Move out"". The three ducklings ran through the entire level shooting every enemy in a heartbeat, without taking any damage! Great...Alt+F4Update 20.01.16:No updates in two months. I have a bad feeling about this...Update 25.11.15: Nearly two months later all the critical points stay valid, they just added a map, achievements (of all things...) and some other minor changesOriginal Review:Pros:+ Nice, simple but functional graphics+ Planing phase+ Comic-style mission introductionCons:- Very poor A.I., reminded me very much of Takedown. Could solo rambo through, leaving my team behind and kill 10 enemies without a problem. Enemies don't take cover, they either patrol or stand still. Friendly AI walks in single file, not taking cover or anything, like ducklings behind the mother duck (you)Also the enemies don't care if there is gunfire in the nearby rooms, they'll walk chilled as ever.- Animation quality is very basic at best- Ugly character models- No object physics, no breakable windows, etc.- Visus not moving when running/walking, just the hands. It doesnt feel like running/walking- Weapons got no punsh behind them- etc.I am well aware that this is a pre-alpha version, but I want people to know that there is no enjoyment to be had here, YET and the framework is not the best to build upon.- will change the review according to the games progress.

								Epsilon shows so much promise, but it also needs so much workPositives:1. Its a sci-fi tacticool shooter!2. Its got some unique asthetics3. It has an awesome planning mode and commandingNegatives:1. Its not done, in fact its super unfinished (which is totally fine with early access)2. The weapon handling needs serious improvementheres a list of complaints with weapon handlingThe gun needs to pivot from the shoulder when in ads right now it moves almost like a 2d image(not good)The gun bobs unrealistically when starting and stoping to moveThe animations need way more polish, the gun also clips through your feet which isn't goodLook at the tweaks arma 3 has made to their weapon handling like weapon inertia and stuffIts worth a purchase if you want to support a potentialy great game			"

								This game is the true definition of ""Potential""I love the idea of a indie tactial shooter that is singleplayer/co-op focused. Here lately I've been more interested in the singleplayer experience. This game has preplanning stages, stealth mechanics, breaches and other Swat/another tactical unit style of play.Getting this game at this state is a gamble, it will progress to become an awesome Rainbow 6 like shooter....or fail like another Serrellan LLC game *cough* Takedown *cough* Red Sabre *cough cough*This review will be updated as I play, I wrote this review super late at night.I will be filming this for my YouTube channel, as soon as that is done I will add it to this reviewfor now, my channel is: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBZB_OoENyGUBPjA5_tuH3Q "

								Early access on this game is going to be a gamble for anyone. There doesn't appear that there is much going on with communication here from the dev to the forums. I'm speculating that this isn't going anywhere further at this point. I could be wrong. It's been a while since the company has posted in the forums and has pushed new content. If you don't want to potentially lose your money, walk away. As is, it is buggy and AI is either too good or in a down right vegetative state. Levels don't have any gritty realism and look to much like a game show set (shiny and bright EVERYTHING) than an actual building.			"

Early Access Review
								Epsilon is a team-based tactical shooter currently in the early access stages being developed by Serellan. The game is in a fairly barebones state at present but with a decent foundation already in place; this could potentially grow into a very impressive game down the line. At such a generous pricepoint too; it is most definitely worth a punt even now.Firstly; the game looks absolutely remarkable, with a unique visual style of colours, outstanding lighting effects and stunning reflections. This aspect alone is very encouraging and makes this one of the most visually impressive early access titles to date. If each environment maintains this standard; Epsilon could stand against many top-end AAA games in graphical terms. This being in the very early stages though; many aspects are yet to be completed or are even absent at present. The developers have listed a wealth of features and improvements on the horizon which demonstrates they have a clear understanding of their product moving forward. The core of Epsilon is still very playable so far as you get to grips with the concept and mechanics. There are a few bugs and some rough parts but overall; it's a solid platform for the developers to build upon. The developers Serellan have certainly come under fire previously after the somewhat mediocre Takedown: Red Sabre but this title houses enormous potential and with lessons hopefully learned; I hope they don't make the same mistakes again. With 30% completed and another 12 months projected until the game is ready for a full release; it is certainly one to watch. There is still a considerable amount of work to be done in regards to developing and improving but with such a strong foundation already in place; this could be a very exciting title to follow.  "

								Buggy AI - Dont move once theyve seen you - Sometimes dont even shoot - Detect you sneaking 3 rooms overYou can see 100% of the gun (clips through camera, doors and makes any FOV under 110 unbearable)Teammates either ignore you completely or walk so closely behind you that you can feel their breath on your neck.Teammates dont move, they can trap you in a corner and you have to just reload the level or try to tell them to move to a location behind them, which they usually just end up walking into you.Not very optimised (but fair enough)A lot wrong with this game, in its current stage it should still be in developer testing or private prototyping. Id say dont waste your money on this game at the moment, give it a few months. As long as they dont do a Red Sabre again it should be good.			"
