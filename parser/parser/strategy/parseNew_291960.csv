												Wizardry is a pretty influential game isn't it? Nearly every major RPG franchise owes something to this classic series. Despite its Western roots, Wizardry has become very successful in Japan, with innumerable ports, sequels, and clones. Unfortunately we've seen maybe a fraction of Japanese Wizardry-likes here in the US.Off the top of my head there has been:-Wizardry: Tale of the Forsaken Land (hugely recommended)-Wizardry: Labryinth of Lost Souls (ehh..it's ok I guess)-Class of Heroes 1 & 2 (second game is decent)-The Dark Spire (didn't get very far, I should give it another go)-Elminage Original and Gothic (I'm supposed to be reviewing one of these games huh?)There are a number of other D-RPGs out there like the Etrian Odyssey series, a handful of the Shin Megami Tensei games, Demon Gaze, and so on. The point is, there are hardly any of these games available in this side of the world. By comparison, the number of Wizardry-likes available in Japan can no longer be considered a real number. Elminage Gothic is one of the few very rare Wizardry-likes available in the U.S. That should be more than enough reason to get a recommendation...right? Eh...well sure why not? But that doesn't mean I can't give the game a good hard look.The story of this game involves great evils, increasing numbers of monsters, sealed demon gods, etc. It's not really a story, more of an excuse to explore dungeons and kill (or be killed). Elminage Original has a similarly vacant plot but I think it had one or two interesting villains. Well, I think they had conversations with the player-character that couldn't be summed up as ""I'm gonna kill youuuuuu RAWR!"" Point is, this game has a non-existent story. There are 13* dungeons, most of which are optional, but you'll want to explore them all for better gear, and because it's fun.As with all Wizardry-likes (WizLs), the first step is building that perfect party. There are several races and classes available and finding the right setup takes patience & hard work. Old standbys like the three fighters, thief, cleric, and mage are possible, but most players will want to go with the advanced classes. Valkyrie and Samurai are able fighters as well as serviceable spell-casters, summoners can get almost any monster to serve them, and alchemists are proficient in numerous utility spells . Also unlike most J-RPGs, even powerful monsters tend to be weak towards status effects. WizLs are rarely known for sensible mechanics. Expect the first couple hours of this game to be a little confusing. Yes it's normal to gain 1 HP or even lose stats when leveling up. While you can (and should...at least early on) re-roll for better HP boosts, the system is designed to work itself out. Elminage Gothic is a very offensive-oriented game. Oh sure having a low AC is nice, but the monsters in this game are designed to kill, not hurt. As soon as you arrive in the second dungeon you'll be welcomed by ninjas. Getting beheaded is the most common cause of death in this game. Granted, that's not to say you won't be seeing your squishy mages nuked constantly by lightning bolts, nor will devastating status effects such as stone be a rare occurence. That's just how often death occurs in this game. If you've entered a new area that's out of your league (gear isn't good enough or lacking experience), this game will let you know in the hardest way possible. Elminage Gothic isn't what I'd call balanced. In fact a lot of battles in this game are going to be one-sided. I'm not expecting fairness when I play D-RPGs. On average the difficulty of these games is higher than normal. Besides, this game offers everything from 99 save slots to an easy teleport spell, so you never really lose progress. Sometimes though, the average enemy encounter can be absolutely ridiculous. Take for example the Master Ninja. Imagine if a ninja started the battle invisible. They could attack (and behead) you, but you couldn't do anything about it for at least one round. These guys attack twice, that's potentially two dead party members. Master Ninjas can attack in groups of three or more. For maximum effect let's say you get ambushed by a group of these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.Are you freaking kidding me?It can go deeper than that. Picture a group of werewolf archers. They have a skill called lightning attack. Basically it's a first-strike move. Before you ask, yes these guys behead. That wasn't enough so the archers are paired with enemies that can cause party-wide status effects. These effects can include sleep, paralysis, whatever. So by the end of the battle every in your party is suffering from some kind of ailment. These archers have a pursuit sweep ability, where at the end of the round they automatically strike all ailing party members. Your sleepy, scared, poisoned, or otherwise indisposed party is going to suffer through potentially SIX waves of behead-capable arrows.It's almost pornographic. How could one game hold so much contempt for a person that they'd invent all these twisted scenarios? Even Elminage Original wasn't quite this nightmarish. Some of the other changes Gothic brings to the table involve exploration. Previous Elminage titles had easily available mini-maps. Gothic however expects the player to use magic maps. These items are one-use compasses essentially. They show what you've explored and where you're currently located. It's mostly a nuisance. Early on an easily repairable map can be found, and apparently somebody has already figured out how to hack the game to make infinite magic maps. The dungeons are for the most part really good. Some involve numerous treks between different floors(Hastrana), others require switches to be flipped, and still others(Royal Tomb) are just there to confuse and frustrate. I can see why Starfish went with the magic map system, since a number of dungeon puzzles rely on the player not having a mini-map. Genre-veterans won't find a lot of new ideas in these dungeons, but they'll welcome them all the same.Delivering punishment to those enemies that held you down for so long is extremely rewarding. Still, it's nothing that I can consider balanced. Instead of simply getting destroyed in battle after battle, your party is stomping formerly insurmountable odds like so many insects. Even fights are few and far between in this game. In some cases the boss encounters can involve round to round strategies, some can even require a stout defense. However, all of the bosses automatically recover HP every round. Essentially the boss-battles -- normally the culmination of all your knowledge and abilities -- boil down to two things 1) damage race and 2) equipment check. Again, this speaks to how offense-oriented this game is. All that said, I don't really consider this a knock against the game. That's simply the way it's designed. Everyone has their own preferences, but I enjoy the short and to the point battles, even if they can be annoyingly unfair in how they're put together at times. Unfortunately this style of game-design probably won't gel with ""Iron-man"" players. Some will have foresight to know when they're in over their heads, but that doesn't mean their complaints are invalid (especially when their well put-together party is undone by a ludicrous ambush). Holy smokes Steam reviews have character limits? Better cut this short then.The game is addictive as hell. It's also rewarding.  It's $10 and pretty awesome if you can accept its idiosyncrasies.But that's just my opinion.*There are three post-game bonus dungeons.			"

												RECOMMENDED for any hardcore RPGer or dungeon crawler enthusiastI have always loved Wizardry-style dungeon crawlers, and Elminage Gothic succeeds in being my 2nd favorite dungeon crawler of all time (Behind Wizardry 8). It is not without some flaws, though.First, the great things:+ It's Wizardry. Grid-based maps, 6 party members, 9 different races, 16 different classes (You can recruit monsters too!). You can change classes, too, with some restrictions.+ 75+ floors across 16 different dungeons to explore, all with a unique environment and music. Lots of variety. Yes, rotating floors, teleporters, pitch black rooms, shoots, pits, traps, ie what you would expect in a Wizardry game.+ 400+ GORGEOUS hand-crafted monster models. Detailed in-game bestiary as you find more monsters+ 500+ different items/weapons/armor+ 65 quests, fairly non-linear+ Weapon/armor crafting. Endless customization to fit your needs.+ Great music, especially the 8 battle themes. Soundtrack included!+ Random encounters are rare. 90% of battles are from preset monster locations that respawn if you leave the dungeonNow the bad things:- Pretty bad menus. You get used to them after awhile though and quickly learn how to navigate them efficiently- Limited inventory space (Warehouse eventually gets expanded to 99 which is fantastic!)- Maps are consumable, but early in the game you get a reusable map item, and there are magic spells that let you view the ENTIRE dungeon on all floors.- Leveling up system is confusing for new players. HP gains are based on your vitality and level so don't worry about how much HP you are gaining per level, because it will balance out. If you want to min/max your stats, you have the freedom to.If you are looking for a huge game that rewards you with exploration and experimentation, Elminage Gothic fits the bill. Having finally done everything possible in the game, I must say that it was some of the best 300+ hours I've spent.9/10 as there are some things that could be improved. Can't complain though because games like this are pretty rare.			"

												In ""Elminage Gothic"" you take control of up to 6 adventurers in an attempt to vanquish the rumored darkness in the caves of Tsun-Kurn. Story:It starts with an interesting introduction but the rest of the game is pretty straightforward and lacks any real depth (same with the dialogues). Gameplay:  There are several places to visit in the city, where besides getting quests, you can: rest, recover HP, perform alchemy and smithing, view  items and defeated monsters data, among other things. These places comprise of a tavern, an inn, a temple, a shop, the castle and lastly a Training school. This last one, it's where you can you choose from a list of already created adventurers to be your companions or perform ""adventurer registration"" (i.e, create new characters to be your companions). You can also change the classes of already existing characters or simply delete them.Character creation goes further than most RPGs: besides the common options in these games, like gender and name choice, it also includes 8 different races to choose from (including some very uncommon ones like dragonewt, werebeast, fairy, gnome and hotleat); ""alignment choice"" (Good, Neutral or Evil) that limit the choice of the 18 classes at your disposal (by choosing one of the alignments, there will be a couple of classes unavailable to you). You will also get bonus attribute points that also determine what class you can be: to get a certain class you need a determined number of points. You can re-roll the points you get until you can choose the class you are interested in but, fair warning, it is very hard to get more than 20 points (the best I got was 28 after many tries). To be able to pick the ""Lord"" class you need 30. You can also select the character's age (it affects slightly the bonus attribute points) and one Extra Skill. Note: Created characters will have lower level than the ones that are on the list to pick from.  Besides the variety of traps, treasures and items there are also hundreds of different monsters that require different tactics to defeat. Traps can also be tricky to deal with. All this requires a very fine tuning between the skills and classes of your party members when in combat and dungeon crawling.  There is a large variety of dungeon levels too (so far, all dungeon levels I encountered are different).Soundtrack: Beautiful but lacks variety.The game also has a few flaws:  One thing, among a few other, that this game lacks is a tutorial but you get the hang of it pretty quickly.   Trying to return to a dungeon level after navigating through so many already makes dungeon crawling a bit dull and repetitive.  So far I encountered a couple of bugs and glitches that aren't fixed.  Controlling your character through the dungeons is harder than it should be.  The dungeons have very low resolution.Despite all these flaws, this game is actually very good. In my opinion, the best part of this game is (micro-)managing your adventurers/companions to face the many obstacules (enemies and traps) thrown your way. "

												Thac0(To hit a armor class of 0), vast maze like dungeons, deadly traps, deep charecter and party customization, level and stat drains, possible permadeath, large mobs of monsters, anti magic zones, zones of darkness, and all that. If those words start making your mouth water or makes you start thinking back to the old school Wizardry games and fond memories of late nights being glued to the warm glow of a computer screen with a caffinated soda in one hand and a pile of graph paper in the other savouring the fustrastion and the joys of trying to solve a vast deadly monster filled maze. Then this game is for you. This game is a Wizardry clone and one that isn't afraid to really hold anything back but rather embraces the old school nature of those games. Monsters that can drain your stats or levels, it's got that. Possible one hit deaths it's got that. Vast maze like dungeons made to get you lost? oh yeah it's got that and in spades(over 94 floors to explore spread out over  16 dungeons), varied monsters it's got that too, it's even has for better or worse the old school Wizardry 1-5 level up system(you know the one where you have to rest at a inn and your stats can not only increase but decrease every level up but it is balanced out), charecters that can age yup, if it was a part of the old Wizardy rule system it's probley in this game.  Now this game isn't for everyone, if you are the easily fustrated type or a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ this game will be a major turn off as this game is unapologeticlly hard and is not only emulates old school Wizardry games in the rules but also in the games graphics(though admitedly it's better then the early PC versions which were just wire frames for the dungeons) which take a cue from the japan only PS1 remakes of Wizardry's 1-5 which used 3d graphics for the dungeons and static hi-res portrates for the monsters and the town(which was still a basic menu like the orginal versions). But if that doesn't bother you and your looking for something that captures the old school Wizardry era dungeon crawler then this is for you. Just keep in mind while there is a automap feature it is a limited one as you can only access it via use of the consumable one use magic map item(though you can buy as many of them as you can carry and there is a multiple use one that can be found in the second dungeon but it can break but is repairable) and a level 1 mage spell so you may want to rely on it only when you are lost which probley will be very often since many passages and rooms are built in a way to confuse and trick you.

												I've got about 4hrs of this game under my belt at the time of writing. Why I'm I telling you this is because its my first impressions of Elminage Gothic (EG) I'm not a big RPG gamer with the exception of FF titiles and Dragon Quest. If you're thinking of buying this due to the 1st person RPG style from a yesteryear I can't think this will disappoint many. I rather have been enjoying EG however a few niggles which seem to stand out! It doesn't explain very much. This can be a + or - depending on preference. The biggest wall you will hit is getting lost and a party wipeout due to how the game has consumable maps!? Thats right single use maps, run out and its hit and miss if you'll see light again. Once this is understood and you buy lots of magic maps and remember to manage items and know when to head back its not bad. Although I could see this putting more casual gamers off. Overall this has the ability to become a favourite of mine.			"

												If i have to describe Elminage Gothic(EG) in one word it would be: Tedious. I have grown up with Wizardry and Might&Magic and i played the heck out of Wiz6-8 and MM3-6. I love these types of dungeon crawlers and while EG resembles those games superficially it lacks a soul. The closest match is probably Wiz6 gameplay wise, but it adds much more tedium to it. - Massivly limited Inventory while bombarding you with junk- No resting in dungeons, so if your spellcasters run out of their exteremely limited spell pool you have to track back all the way through those  Dungeons with Map layouts that make no sense other than to annoy the player and are too hard to navigate without a map which is a consumable item. And i consider that Underground Map to be a consumable too, because it breaks all the time (see next point)- Crap breaks all the time and due to limited inventory carrying spares restricts the limited inventory even further.- Losing attributes randomly and wide range of hp gains during levelup forces save scumming early levels (which based on ingame clock and steam play time so far is several hours and im lev 15 ...)- No difficulty indicator for Traps/Doors (just gonna avoid Magic Drain like the plague)I wanted to like this, i was craving for a new turn based dungeon crawler (sorry Grimrock), but this one falls flat so far.

												Elminage Gothic is very good, yet very hard jrpg which drawn much from the Wizardry series (in fact most of its mechanics are very like, to be fair, Wizardry was major inspiration for jrpgs, and Elminage is sure good homage)It offer much of the classic things you would expect from early rpgs, complex character creation, higher difficult (how much? let me tell you, I expend almost two hours in creating my party only to be defeated by talking to training npc), vast dungeons (but unlikely old rpgs, instead of a single dungeon you do have more places to go as the game unfold),  a town hub to sell stuff, heal the party and other things. Ability to change class to acess some harder to achive classes such Samurai, Lord, Ninja or Valkyrie.But also it dos have very interessing ideas, for having multiple parties, some new classes like Shaman (in fact the wiki says its a Kannagi and does look like more shinto priest), Servant (more like Maid/Butler), Summoner.The music is good fell very like a higher quality (or more modern) thing you would hear while playing a older rpg, however might fell a bit repetitive, but its amazing game to play while listening to podcast. The artwork is good, fell like the exact mix between old school art in western rpgs and what you would expect in jrpgs.If you like old Wizardry games and JRPGs, this game is must.			"

												While playing Etrian Odyssey has spoiled me quite a bit, comparing the two is like comparing apples to oranges. While I would reccomend the former to anyone, Elminage has a few issues that give me a little hesitation.  Some of the sound choices put me off. The music isn't that bad, fortunately, yet the menu confirmation sound is a bit over-loud.  The art direction is very very top notch and the ability to go into an art gallery mode to appreciate the beasties you fight is a welcome decision. What is NOT a welcome decision was that this port removed the capability to insert artwork from outside sources for your own characters! Some of us like to draw our own characters and thrust them into the character grinder that is the Wizardry series.  This was a missed feature and Starfish really dropped the ball on this.Gripes aside, the real meat and bones is the wizardry gameplay and from the get-go the game does not pull its punches. If you decide to generate your own characters ( And you should! ) the starter dungeon goes from a challenge for the pregenerated level 5s to a nightmare for your level ones.  Every level you get, even if it's one HP point,  you will savor and each victory comes that much sweeter, especially since party members can now cover each other!  Having a tank character is actually a huge asset and lets your dual-wielders or two-handers take a breather if they get picked on, since he or she can defend them.  It's a nice little touch of teamwork from the usual fight/fight/fight/parry/parry/parry.Speaking of, the dreaded fight/fight/fight/parry/parry/parry is something that no longer happens nearly as often.  Furthermore, you can also screw monsters over by putting thieves in the front line.  If monsters can't detect them, they can't target them, nor can they aim at the back line, unless they have a longer range weapon. Oh that's right, kids. Long range weapons are no longer just for your characters. From the second dungeon on, your back row can be exposed to heat from spear wielders and ninja weapons that can behead on a lucky shot. Still, back line members are nowhere near as likely to get pinged off as your front line is, so there is that going for them. Oh, and on the subject of being hidden? Enemies can hide too and screw over your chances at getting at the mages in the back line. If you happen to encounter a group of mages with fighters in the back row, the fighters will gladly advance on you to keep their casters out of the line of fire.There are also classes that are nonstandard from the classic wizardry series, and in a decision that made me smile, there are also genders that are nonstandard from normal nomenclature. I got a chuckle when I rolled an effeminate ""?"" gender mage, only to find out later that they also qualify for a valkyrie class change when they get the stats for it, their indeterminate gender qualifying them for the normally female-only class.There really is a lot to like here, and the ups far outweigh the downs. I just wish that they would have included the ability for us to import our own drawings so we could play as characters we truly make. Alas, it is a fly in the ointment, but if you've ever played, and liked the Wizardry series, this is Wizardry, 110% so.  Fans of the RPG Genre should find enough here to greatly enjoy and I would gladly reccomend it to them, especially at the $10 price tag.  It's a crime not to enjoy another entry in the wizardry series.			"

												The purpose of this review is to let people know whether or not this port is acceptable.This is a publication by Ghostlight, which has its sister company, Laughing Jackal, handle ports to PC. I have played another Ghostlight pub before, Agarest, and I felt that the port was acceptable, but not great.In the case of Elminage, I do see a great improvement. The cutscenes are still a little choppy, though I think this may be a problem with .wmv running inside the game engine. Other than that, the gameplay is flawlessly implemented to PC. You can play with controller or keyboard and mouse and they both work equally well, though I could do with an option for mouse sensitivity because I play on such a small surface.I will cover briefly some other topics about the game:A lot of elements of gameplay were not covered in the manual, though by now it has been diseminated onto the internet being that this is a port of a game that is a few years old. While this is a JRPG it has deeper roots than Dragon Warrior/Quest, most notably Wizardry. If you are not familiar with Wizardry and you are wondering if you would like this game, I encourage you to do some research. This game is THAC0 based and a lot of people dislike that system, but having been acquainted with this system long ago I do like it.The artwork is pretty good. It reminds me of Atlus games pre-Persona 3, but with better resolution.Finally, the music works well with the atmosphere the game is trying to convey and is properly implemented. Previously, Agarest had some issues with improper looping of music, but I detect none of those issues here.This game is complex, so I do encourage you to do your research before purchasing, but if this game turns out to be up your alley then it's money well spent.

												If you are not a masochist that loves  turn based dungeon crawlers, you will hate this.If you ARE, then this is a delightful romp. Be warned, it is based more on Wizardry 1-3 than anything else. Dungeons are 20 by 20, and the game will take every possible advantage against you.You can turn the tables though. It lacks some modern features, the interface is clunky, and the sound effects are VERY annoying, but it is still a fantastic experience if you can handle interface issues. I hope this indicates that more games of the type are coming to steam, because I really can't get enough grid based, turn based dungeon crawlers.			"

												So the interface of this game is a bit difficult, the controls aren't perfect, but having played Elminage Original on my vita, this was a no-brainer to pick up. It /is/ a hard game. And I would be lying if I said that some of the negative reviews didn't have valid reasoning here and there. And, like Elminage Original, the translation job really isn't doing us westerners any favors. But when it comes down to it, party-based dungeon-crawlers are my favorite genre of video games. On top of that, I really like the art in this game. So in summation if you like Wizardry, Class of Heroes, or other games in the genre, this should be a no-brainer. If you're like me, it'll be worth the downsides.			"

												Great game.   I'm in the Uhlm Zahr hall.   Have invested about 100 hours in game play to date and have enjoyed every minute.  100% chance I'll finish the game.    100% chance I'll play it again with different character classes.  Every battle comes with anxiety and that is what makes it great.  So many people complain about the maps.  Non issue.  A couple of dungeons in you get the Goblin map which has unlimited uses but can break.    I found myself traveling back to town often enough anyway that it was complete non-issue.  Complaints about  early access reward not showing up in time .  Who cares.  Do you buy a game for early access reward or do you buy it for gaming experience?There are complaints about needing to grind in the early stages.  Not actually true.  You'll die more often and it's a touch harder to play dungeons after the 1st one without having done at least some grinding but is that really a negative?   Knowing you have to approach every battle like it's the last battle your party will ever have.  Is that truly a negative ?  I found it positive.   And if you find it a nuissance, you can choose to do the grinding.  At one juncture I did a couple of levels, is an hour or two.  The game becomes more ""approachable"" once you get the Mage Diomente spell.  Allows you to teleport wherever you want.   Without it, it can get tediuos.  But given it's accessible for a Mage quite early, I don't see this as a negative either. Just plan your party reasonably and you'll be fine.  My party which has died a very limited number of times:Innocent Characters:  Brawler, Samurai, Valkyrie, Mage.        Between them I have 18 Diomente spells allowing me to complete dungeons without complaining about maps.  I quite literally bounce all over the maps as I like to do every square.  The other two characters:    Alchemist and Lord.    The Lord started as a Cleric.   Is a pretty lame character at this juncture.  Wish I had done something different - Cleric to Summoner comes to mind.   The Alchemist started as a Thief.   I don't miss the Thieving abilities.  I can open chests and my char investory is usually full before I use up all the High Portal spells.  I like the Alchemist Forging skill. I didn't bother with a Bishop for Identify and the dual spell casting - too much EXP needed to level up and money is plentiful.  Overall - great game.  Thoroughly enjoyable gaming experince "

												One of the greatest appeals of the Elminage series is being able to use your own portraits and music and such in the game. Elminage Gothic of course keeps up with this tradition. EXCEPT THAT THEY DECIDED TO REMOVE ALL OF IT FOR NO REASON IN THE PC VERSION. Do note that since the original version of the game was made with the ability to add your own stuff in mind, it comes with very few options by default. Well, you're stuck with those limited default options. Enjoy.The PC port is badly-done too (this was originally a PSP game), with everything looking hilarious oversized, and the localisation work is shoddy with a lot of falling back to NES era ""we can't fit all the text in so let's just make it all acronyms"". It's also odd how the nickname field doesn't have as many characters as the name fields which means you might want to have a character's nickname the same thing as their real name and straight up not be able to.I only got this because it was on sale at 294 yen, just a little over a tenth of what the lunatics are asking for on PSN (2571 yen), but the the near to 90% discount just simply doesn't outweigh the problems with this version.Very, VERY disappointing.That being said, you can run it in a small window if you like that sort of thing (watch videos on Youtube while dungeon crawling? Why not?) and the requirements are low enough that it runs fine on laptops so if you're looking for something to play on a flight or something this may be worth considering.The game itself is an alright Wizardry clone, except that Elminage 3 was better in literally every conceivable way (possibly because the series director who handled pretty much everything was fired halfway through 3's development process). Also the whole aging thing is weird.			"

												Крайне противоречивая игра. Скажу сразу: если в первые полчаса не понравилось, можно выбрасывать, потому что дальше только хуже. В этой игре всё сделано максимально неудобным игроку способом. После пары часов игры я стал подозревать, что это сделано специально, после пары десятков - решил было, что создатели просто затачивались на игру высокоуровневыми персонажами, не обращая внимания на трудности низкоуровневых  и игнорируя грубость интерфейса, но последний донжон (съевший у меня не одну сотню часов) всё расставил на свои места: это таки сделано специально.В остальном перед нами игра, сделанная по канонам первой трилогии Wizardry - ну, только что цветная и более разнообразная. Более того, один из бонусных донжонов прямо является трибьютом оригиналу - он чёрно-белый и без текстур. Игра - Dungeon Crawler в чистом виде: ходишь по лабиринтам толпой из 6 человек в два ряда, от первого лица, походово, уничтожаешь монстров, собираешь лут, повторить до бесконечности. Да, монстры и ловушки невидимы, пока на них не наступишь. Да, они возрождаются после любого Save/Load. И да, разумеется, случайные монстры тоже есть! (Я уже говорил, что игра к игроку недружелюбна?)Классы здесь украдены из Wizardry же, но ролевая система далеко не такая щедрая: здесь точно так же есть ""базовые"" классы (боец, вор, маг, клирик, алхимик), которые заточены под одну задачу и быстро прокачиваются, есть и ""продвинутые"" классы, сочетающие свойства пары базовых, и есть ""премиум"", которые обладают особыми свойствами и сочетают несколько классов сразу. Но, в отличие от оригинала, смена класса вызвает полное забвение всех навыков, уровней и параметров. Сохраняются только очки жизни и по три заклинания каждого уровня.Система оборудования крайне идиотская: складывается только Armor Class и бонусы для оружия. Все параметры, относящиеся к магии, не суммируются - берётся наибольший бонус, что означает, что 90% вещей в игре не нужны совершенно ни для чего. Кроме того, все вещи с заклинаниями имеют примерно 30-50% шанс сломаться после использования заклинания. А восстановить их можно только в городе или специальным заклинанием. И да, довольно скоро начинают встречаться монстры, которые ломают и ту экипировку, которая не ломается сама.Монстры здесь крайне злобные. Очень скоро начинают попадаться враги со спецатаками, среди которых есть и обезглавливание, убивающее любого, независимо от параметров - и нет, 100% защиты от обезглавливания в игре у игрока нет (у монстров - есть). И такие монстры есть уже с четвёртого донжона.Впрочем, жить с этим можно, если подобрать экипировку... пока проходишь сюжетную кампанию. Бонусные донжоны - особенно последняя башня - имеют монстров, которые безоговорочно убивают часть партии или вообще всех, как ты их не экипируй.Ах, да, убитых персонажей можно воскресить. Примерно с 80%-ным шансом на успех. В остальных 20% персонаж умирает совсем, и воскресить его можно только в городе. Я упоминал, что игра нас не любит?Ну, и донжоны. Они хороши и разнообразны. Полный джентльменский набор: есть многоуровневые лабиринты, подводные, есть ямы, ловушки, телепорты, односторонние стены, скрытые двери... здесь есть всё. Включая совершенно пустые сегменты лабиринта, где есть только монстры. Потратьте час-другой, чтобы это выяснить. У высокоуровневых магов, правда, есть заклинание телепортации, которое позволяет попасть в любую точку карты, где вы уже были. Но есть и антимагические зоны, которые блокируют всю магию, отключают все зачарования, и телепортироваться из них нельзя. И блокированные зоны есть, куда телепортироваться не выйдет - в стратегических местах, поближе к боссам. А последняя бонусная башня имеет 25 уровней и при этом блокирует телепортацию совсем. Я уже... ах, да, говорил.В общем, вот так оно всё и идёт. Если вам нравится бродить по лабиринтам и зарисовывать их руками (автокарта, правда, есть. И это предмет. И он ломается, естественно), если вам нравится убивать бесчисленные толпы монстров, всё усиливая персонажей, если вы согласны ради этого терпеть почти полное отсутствие сюжета и уродский интерфейс а-ля 80-е - игра рекомендуется. Если же всё это вызывает у вас скорее недоумение - лучше не надо.P.S. После прохождения последней башни убийство Главного Босса дало мне три артефакта (аналогичные тем, что я получал в конце сюжета)... и всё. Ни ролика, ни завершения сюжета, ни-че-го. Достойный конец игры. Можно играть дальше - только зачем?..			"

												==> Evaluation based on few hours of play. I'll modify it when I'll be more experienced <==Thx to all who gave me tips to play better Elminage.Elminage Gothic isn't bad game but its far to be good game.+ Nice looking graphics : artwork is fine even if sprite suffer of lack of good animations+ Nice musics+ Easy battle system+ Ex skills system : you can choose 1 on creation (some very helpful or exclusive)+ Nice alchemy system : if you create alchemist, you'll be able to transform ores in AP (Alchemy Points) to modify item to avoid gender restriction, add protections or elemental effects...+ Moddind allowed : its possible to modify files in game directory to create your own Elminage with rules modification (you need software to unpack/repack Elminage files)+ Alignement change : there is a way to set at opposite alignement Good & Evil- Bad menus system : UI suck. You have to find how & when to save, too many sub-menus (its possible to create better UI that require less surfing with more efficiency. No drag & drop system when managing items..- Random bonus system at character creation never allow easily to choose your class (Ninja, Lord, are very difficult to create at start because class require too much bonus points to create).- HP/SP recovery sucking system : even if you can camp, i never found resting option button to recover all HP/SP  from team. That mean long travel to dungeons->cities to rest in inn.- Too few portraits by class- Some Ex Skills are exclusive : Sacrifice exist only for cleric pre-generated character level 4, you can't create more characters with such exclusive skills.- Steam version seem to be port from PSP version, controversial version because Elminage Gothic is sequel from previous one Elminage that was better for fan to play in many ways (more classes, more advantages for some classes, more options to play...).- Classes problem : less classes to play than previous Elminage, some like Lord are weakness in protection now. Changing classes must be done as soon as stats match because only some spells can be passed to next class, all others will vanish (Ex Skills, stats above class requirement, class skills)- Level up system : you can't level up outside inn. I guess you need to rest to level up Grrrr.Elminage isn't bad game but if you already played previous version you'll be disapointed because new rules/options not better. In all case you need to balance your team to kill hard (i think its better to kill hard & fast (aoe) than to be better in protections only).You can buy Elminage Gothic but i don't recommend until game will allow me to rest anytime in dungeons. Elminage Gothic concept ruins my experience to play for these reason. When you start level 1 team you NEED to rest.By luck, with community modding, Elminage Gothic can become great game or for those who master how to modify rules.			"

												From time to time I’ll have a disagreement between my evaluation of the game and what the Steam store’s evaluation of a game is. Games that I feel are deserving of a positive review score will have mixed or even a negative vote while there are some games where I feel the opposite. As I write this reflection a year and a half following the release of Elminage Gothic I see that the review count stands at mixed. However, it is close to a positive (62/34). So while I cannot be too disappointed I must admit that I thought that there was no doubt that the game would have a positive review score.The biggest problem with the game from my perspective is the overall presentation. The basic things from the appearance of the UI and the menu system appear to be ripped from a game developed a decade prior to that. Given the level of modern luxuries that we gamers enjoy I can appreciate that many modern players wouldn’t find the game appealing from this perspective. This certainly appears to be the case when reading through the well written negative critiques of the game. In fact many of the positive reviews state the same thing. It’s a fair call. But it doesn’t break the game as far as I’m concerned. While you may feel that it negatively impacts your overall experience I find that it’s not one of the most important things for me. I suppose I just have different priorities.  Another issue that players have had is that they have claimed that the game has been ported directly from the PSP version of the game. I never did get around to play that version of the game but if it is it would explain pretty much everything about the presentation quality. Then there is the fact that the game, sadly, hasn’t been Steamified aside from trading cards.That means no achievements and of course no multiplayer (not that the game needs it).So now that we’ve identified what is bad about the game we need to delve into what its strong points are. Chief among these is that it possesses varying levels of the dungeon and the different atmospheric settings of each such as semi underwater levels, It makes for a genuine dungeon crawling fanatics dream. The depth of the game systems, in loot, in actions and in spells, in specialist skills and abilities (alchemists are important in this game) and the amount of things that you can do could quite easily lead you to spending a couple of hundred hours exploring the game if you wanted to experience absolutely everything.This is a game where you need to dig deep below the surface. Those who haven’t tend to be the ones who don’t enjoy the game.“In my day son…. Elminage Gothic be considered one of the king of all the games… Now… All that gold done gone and ruined that poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.”Visit Steamified[www.steamified.com] for more reviews and our epic giveaways			"

												I absolutely recommend this game. At my current hour count (10) I've barely scratched the surface and only haven't continued lately because life has kept me busy:Highlights:Hardcore dungeon crawling with 92 or so different dungeon levels. These are not the superficial, ""skin"" like differences you see in pretenders, but are things like levels that are partially underwater and your party will drown if you don't move quickly, or levels full of wind tunnels that impede navigation.Difficult, tactics oriented combat in which you cannot solve every combat the same way. While the game starts off simple, it slowly escalates the level of threat it throws at you until you need counter several different game changing abilities so that you stand a chance at all.Complex character building system in which creative multiclassing will get you far, while at the same time un class changed characters (innocents) get powerful equipment only they can use.A large base of loot, of which many items have a unique niche instead of being exactly like x, but better or worse.A complex crafting system in which the bonuses provided by your items can be enhanced or customized.One of the classes (Summoner) can bind and contract monsters and then use them as seventh party members. This system alone has far more depth than many entire games.There are people with hundreds of hours on this game still learning new things about it. I only regret that I haven't had the uninterrupted time for a proper runthrough myself.With all that having been said, if you are a casual gamer or a hardcore pretender you should absolutely stay away. This is not one of those fake hardcore games where you just grind through trivial content, Elminage will not validate you. If you're looking for a grand story... you'll find a alright one, but not for free. This is not one of those visual novel, on rail experiences falsely described as an ""RPG"". This is classic, old school dungeon crawling fun. About the only legitimate problem I'd say is the interface, it's really poorly designed and could definitely do with better placement of options and keybindings but I recommend it in spite of that relatively minor problem.

												I'm a huge fan of the older Wizardry games so when I saw this game I got my hopes up and... it hasn't disappointed. Elminage takes the oldschool grid dungeon crawl experience and adds a lot to it. There's a lot of variety in the dungeons and puzzles offered, the monster art, while sometimes peculiar, is gorgeous and really interesting to look at. I love the variety in classes and races you can play. Admittedly things were a little tedious before I got access to the mage's teleportation spell, but after that things went great.If you like what the oldschool sort of Wizardry games had to offer, this may very well be up your alley.

												The gameplay mechanics and artwork is great, once the consumable maps gets out of the way once the game's modded. There's a deeper plot than meets the eye and dark undertones, which I wouldn't spoil for you. The technique to last in the game is to have a balanced team with two mage spell casters as the last tier has the option of teleporting to a specific part of the map, and two cleric spell casters to be able to revive characters. It takes time to know the ins and outs of the classes, but once you do the game would be enjoyable as there's an option of having multiple parties on the same (or different) dungeon. There's wonderful battle sprites and the thrill that keeps you on your toes as you wouldn't know when you'll be killed - thankfully there's multiple save files and loading anywhere within the dungeon, so to revive characters you can save and reload until you luck out at reviving the character.Overall, this game is one of the few on Steam that lasted me hours of gameplay and I'll recommend it to everyone.ProsPuzzles: Time-consuming puzzles and intricate dungeons, each having their own theme. Lots of wall-checking, unless if your hunter can pick up hidden walls.High level-cap: I'm currently on level 400 at the Ibag Tower, and I still get pawned by enemies if I let my guard down.Variety of classes, alignment, skills and class-changing: If you class-change to an unrelated class, you retain 3 of each spell that you reached. Imagine the customizability of your perfect team. Some alignments have party retrictions which would be easily circumvented by dropping them at the dungeon and coming back to pick them up.Various races to create and monsters as party members.Classic design and pseudo-apocalypstic theme.Crafting items and strengthening weapons: Weapon restrictions can be lifted with an alchemist, along with crafting items to aid you with your journey.Boumit in every dungeon, save for the last two dungeons.Option to customize character busts and faces with monsters at a certain point.ConsInventory is too small. It can pile up if you're fully equipped.Grinding can get repetitiveHigh probability of being beheaded and killedOC wall-checkingServant is actually a herbalist.Some dialogue are in Japanese.If you flee after running into a fiend, you can't recruit it.Aging and permadeathCustomization is limited, unless if you mod the game and reach the end of the game.TLDRIt's a game for hardcore RPG fans that love creating their own parties, exploring dungeons, crafting and forging weapons and puzzles.

												First person dungeon crawler, very much like old school wizardry games. With random stat gain and loss on lv. this game is more gear based to determine difficulty instead of being reliant on natural power from levels. With many classes to try and roll for upon creation of a party memeber and the ability to change classes you can be very flexible. Be warned however this game absolutely does not hold your hand and with a brand new lv 1 party the creatures on even the first dungeon can pound you into dust and it doesn't get easier. There is also perma death, revival can fail and a memeber can be lost forever oh and insta death is a thing later on also memebers can grow old and die. The difficulty of it might seem a turn off but managing your six party memebers well and planning ahead can make a massive difference. Can you overcome the challenge?

												Elminage Gothic is basically Wizardry on steroids.For those who don't know Wizardry, it's basically a first person, party based dungeon crawler. You set up a party of 6 characters of varying classes and venture forth, while trying to avoid a terrible death. And it will come, since this particular Elminage game is pretty brutal and the hardest in the series. Recommended for hardcore or veteran players of the genre.Weak points include the archaic interface, lack of information regarding some mechanics and questionable design decisions, such as maps being consumable items and inventory management being a pain. Though I have to say that those things are very faithful to the old Wizardry games and are clearly by design. I also strongly recommend playing this with a controller.Everything else is stellar. The art is of high quality. The soundtrack is surprisingly good and fitting of the theme and mood of the game. Gameplay is decently balanced and all classes feel very useful, with strong and weak points. Combat is interesting, with multiple ways to approach battles. Dungeon design ramps up pretty quickly and can get crazy later on. And there's a ton of content, with 70+ (!) dungeon floors to explore.Considering the price, it's a steal. Fans of DRPGs should definitely check this game out.			"

												A faithful wizardry clone, but not actually a good game.I really badly wanted to like this game, it does a lot of things well, and it's really hard to find modern updates to the Wizardry formula. But it's just not good.The first big problem is that this is an intensely, intensely mechanics-driven game that is awful at explaining those mechanics. The entire game is translated from Japanese, and done so poorly. The in-game explanations for mechanics are usually vague or misleading, in a tiny scrolling 1-line box. The manual explains some things, but not nearly enough. At the same time, the game itself is wildly unbalanced. This is normally fine for this type of game, discovering abusive combinations and tricks is half the fun, but you basically can only figure things out through trial and error or going online for guides. A 'blind' playthrough, even for someone with huge amounts of RPG experience, would be practically unplayable. You can't just 'go with sounds good' because the game is intensely punishing for mistakes.That translation, combined with the natural vagueness of a wizardry clone, also makes questing an enormous pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ The interactions with the story and NPC's are incredibly vague: characters stand alone in dungeons and bark a short paragraph of vague, badly translated info at you, and then you're supposed to put 2 and 2 together and figure out what they need. If you forget what they said, you're kind of screwed. Again, this sort of stuff would be tolerable if the game was well made, well translated, with a good UI, but it's just not.Finally, this just isn't a well designed game. The dungeons are tedious, samey loops designed to be as drawn out as possible. The map system is really ill-considered, I'm actually fine with limiting map access, but this is like a weird worst of both worlds that just winds up being annoying. Character building is FILLED with lots of obscure mechanics that are impossible to know ahead of time without a guide and that can have a big impact. The game is incredibly random, literally in the sense of using random numbers, and forces the player to cope with that without giving them the knowledge to actually plan ahead and do so. The game relies immensely on grinding and repitition, but then has an absolutely awful UI to make that experience as lame as possible.It's just not a good game. I got this for $3 on a sale. For that price, it's fun and worth it if you like the genre. For the 10 dollar list price though, even at that cheap price, it's just not worth it. The only way you will like this game is if you really love intensely mechanics driven RPG's, know how to play Wizardries, and are willing to put up with a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Even then, it's just not a good example of the genre.			"

												Having played some of the older Wizardry titles (namely: Wizardry 6: Bane of the Cosmic Forge, Wizardry 7: Crusaders of the Dark Savant, and Wizardry 8), I immediately became interested in this game when it appeared on Steam. I bought in on the impulse and so far I'm not disappointed.It is a solid dungeon crawler in the olden style, entertaining and supplying a lot of strategic possibilities. There are many classes, with synergies between them, and a system that allows multi-classing, similar to that in Wizardry titles. The difficulty is nice, making every success a real accomplishment of skill and perseverence. Plus there are some little (or not so little...) things like alchemy, which allows for gear modification, summoning system, or item mixing. The ability to freely switch between companions in the city is also a great boon.All in all, I find this game simply fun to play.			"

												At this point this game is worth 8 us dollars.   I couldn't find where all of the keyboard commands are (not all are listed in the keyboard remap in options).  I had to learn many by trial an error.   Something is still wrong but at least I now move fluidly through the combat interface.  If you own a controller it must be so much easier but I don't own one and I wouldn't want to buy one just for one game - it would be like adding to the price of the game.This is a complete wizardry clone and that is a good thing.  It has probably over 100 hours of content because I have not finished the first dungeon at 19 hours of playtime.   I like a challenge and my game hours on my steam profile show this.I have decided to stop playing for now.Currently I can only recommend this for those who like wizardry AND have a console controller OR buy it on a sale.   Since most people on steam have controllers it is enough to change my recommend to positive.			"

												This game will take you back to the era of WIZARDRY and old Forgotten Tales games, where you move around a dungeon in 1st person view. The game also appears to be quite challenging as i have been killed on many monsters even in the 1st dungeon. There is some strategy with this game to play it correctly too, like having the correct classes in your party. The different races is also refreshing too, and not just the default human, dwarf, elf, etc D@D old style classes. They also have dragon newt and wereperson race, which is refreshing..even a fairy class. Quite fun and time consuming game, with lots of rpg classic aspects makes this game quite fun!			"

												A very good old-school dungeon crawler in the classic Wizardry style.  This game may not be for everyone as it does not hold your hand through different aspects of gameplay.  There is a lot of challenge in discovering how to progress forward which is something that some gamers may not be used to considering how today's games usually are.  If you fondly look back on games from the old days where you used graph paper to map a dungeon and a total party kill was always just a bad encounter away, then this game is for you.			"

												For those of you who remember Wizardry 5: Heart of the Maelstrom, Elminage Gothic is it's identical twin. I played all of the wizard games over the years and always thought that 1-5 was the best, everything after it just had too many issues to play. I found Elminage Gothic while searching for something similar to W5 and instantly fell in love. Right off the bat you see things that are familar like the ""hub town"", how you create a character, rerolling the character for better stats, and even a room right at the beginning that reminded me of where you find the orb of llylgamyn.Not only is the game familiar, it is modernized. The controls are exactly what they should be. I can use WADS or arrows to move, escape closes windows, there is even a button to speed up text. Truly a great game that I look forward to continuing to polay!			"

												So, this is just a pre-warning; in a bit, I’m going to start talking about stat rolls and class perks and, at some point, I’m probably going to complain about THAC0. Because why is that still a thing? There will also be race bonuses, counterproductive weapon accuracy ratings, job classes that depend on good/evil alignment and the inability to mix the two in a party. Maybe a bit of cross-class training and the need for hours upon hours of patient exploration and grinding that, should you overdo it, your character might just permanently die of old age, anyway. Does this all sound like hell to you? Then Elminage Gothic almost certainly isn’t the game you’re looking for.Full Review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12370/pc/elminage-gothic/review.html "

												Wow! What a game we have here. If you are a fan of challenging, punishing, brutal games like Dark Souls, and enjoy dungeon-crawling through beautiful dungeons with lots of interesting encounters, gorgeous artwork and enemies to encounter, and much, much more, then you simply have to check this game out!You create a party of 6 adventurers from a variety of classes, races and stats, and head out into the world to explore why monsters have returned from a nearby cave. Well, things start to spiral down from there, and you're dragged into an epic adventure, however, the main draw here is the immersive, first-person dungeon-crawling.You will be crawling through all sorts of crazy locations, from maze-like labyrinths, to dungeons with hidden traps around every corner. To find some of the secret locations in the game, you really have to search, and the game does NOT hold your hand for one minute!If you love challenging games and want to endure the gauntlet while having a grand adventure in this party-based RPG, just buy the game now. For $9.99 it's an absolute steal since it features over 80+ hours of dungeon-crawling gameplay! And it never gets old because you are never quite sure what's around the next corner, and when you will get brutally murdered next! =)Try this game now if you're into dungeon-crawling, old-school RPGs. You will not regret it. 10/10!			"

												4/5Seriously... am I playing Wizardry?Elminage is in every way a full on Wizardry clone.  EVERYTHING is the same except the maps.  Even the artwork looks like it was taken from the Wizardy: Proving Grounds booklet from the late 80s.Just because it is a clone game doesn't mean you should pass Elminage by.  If you are into RPGs, you will have a blast with this game.  If you'r not familiar with Wizardry, I'll explain.  Wizardy was one of the first RPGs to revolutionize the videogame industry.  Many of the RPGs that were produced for the NES, were inspired by the Wizardy games.  The game starts by forming a party of 6 characters.  You can browse a few places in town such as the Inn and Shop; but most of the game takes place inside an underground maze.  The maze gets harder as you descend, forcing you to make frequent trips to the surface to heal and level up.  The character creation is very in-depth and mimics D&D rules some-what.  Lots of dungoen mapping and slaying :)			"

												Absolutely awful game. No real story and what there is is badly translated, a lot of items you can equip that make very little difference to how you play, you level up your characters in random dungeons that you will never even care about getting to the end of. The things you fight attack in basically the same way...some have quirks such as they multiply themselves or whatever but you wont care..its just clicking buttons till they die either way. There are silhouettes of things that you run into disguised as encounters but really only work as map markers that you will very quickly come to hate seeing.Your characters hit harder as they level up and dont die easilly - the point is - you probably wont care even if they do die and after as little as an hour playing this you will likely decide that the contents of the inside of your nose have suddenly become wonderously entertaining by comparison. Do not make the mistake of thinking this is anything like Wizardry where you at least feel you are doing things for a reason. If you are even looking at this and you don't have Might and Magic X then do yourself a favour and go buy it instead.Why so harsh?Because a game where you have to stock up on ""magic maps"" that are used up every time you look at your map, that throws you in at the deep end with a big dungeon that you will run in circles around before you realise what you are doing, that CAN throw nasty random creatures at you and kill hard built characters just while you try to get the hell out, that has a confusing menu system which will take you hours just to get used to finding how to save and quit; is a game that very few people are going to stick with long enough to see anything more than the first area of the game. And this is BAD DESIGN.			"

												Very dissapointing.  Looks great, but virtually unplayable.  After 60 tedious minutes of play... still at level one.  Mostly because of the constant dying and the fact that while your characters swing and miss for most of the combat (meanwhile, you are killed by a single hit from the enemies).  You can't even access a menu to just re-load.  I had to alt-tab and close the game and come back in.  About 1/20 attacks actually landed.  And my three mage and thief charcacters of course can only have 2-3 magic points, which makes them useless since they cast one spell while in a dungeon and then never again - oh, and they can't melee attack, either, so half my team is literally doing NOTHING during combat.  complete rubbish.Then when I finally re-load the game I had saved, all of my characters where removed from my party, I was back in town (I'd saved in the dungeon) and I had to PAY to put my characters back in my party!  ♥♥♥♥ THAT!  Complete waste of time...  Avoid.			"

Ghostlight will not see another penny from me until they learn how to properly utilize the resources they are given.Wasted potential.			"

												Found out this was actually a port. I bought it on a sale because I wanted an old school dungeon crawler RPG. This is a little dated though. Everything looks the same and there's little variation. The UI is a clunky nightmare. The art isn't bad but you get tired of seeing the same stuff over and over floor after floor after floor. I didn't play a lot so maybe it gets better. I like how you can place members on seperate rows and how weapons reach certain rows etc.Perhaps itemization gets better later on when you have more gp and items. Maybe more items and gp helps even out the flow of progression. Early game is a lot of running back and forth to the healing area and it just burnt me out quick.			"

Looking past the complaints in the other reviews and the blasted MAGIC MAP, its really fun and I dont think I'd play it over again after this playthrough. As my first playthrough I had to learn most of the game's mechanics the hard way, I got really far into the first floor without MAGIC MAPS and got really lost on the way out. Then farther into the first floor I used a magic map and BAM ITS ONE USE ONLY. You might wanna look up a lil more on the game's system or ask a friend. 11/10 will identify orbs again ;;			"

												Don't buy this.  It's bad.  In many ways.  And I want to like it, I just can't.  And don't.Here are just a few since I don't have all day to sit here and write about everything this one did wrong.To start with the game has a poor interface with huge, scrolling descriptive text where smaller text would have fit on the screen and still been large enough to read.  Easily.Buying, selling, moving and equipping is tedious.  Searching chests and disarming is also tedious.  Combat... you guessed it, feels tedious.  Really, any game that has a ""repeat last set of orders"" button for all SIX of your characters (so push one button and repeat all six actoins) is doing something wrong.  I shouldn't want to do the same thing every single turn.  All of my (fairly few) fights have been pretty much like this: 3 melee attack, 3 support defend.  That only changes if someone gets hurt, then I heal with one of the support characters or occasionally have an attack spell tossed out there.  Otherwise support just sits there doing sweet fudge all because I don't have ranged weapons for them.  Yup, classic front row/back row crap.  That's all well and good if you can pick up rocks to throw, or buy a sling right away so characters aren't just sitting there cowering, but from what I've seen you can't.It also has my least favourite thing in any game - that Wolfenstein 3d style vomit-inducing movement (literally makes me nauseous within 5 minutes) and overall the game has mediocre graphics.  And I didn't expect much.So, one semi-good point -  I think the game's mechanics could be good but I can't devote enough time in 2 minute sessions, since anything longer makes me start to feel ill, to get into it enough to find out.So, while I like the concept I don't like the game.  I wish I had three hands so I could give it three thumbs down.			"

												This game had some cool things going for it, but ultimately if I could do it over, I would not buy the game. I don't mind a game being difficult, but I felt it was mostly artificial difficulty, what with the random stat gains (and losses) and the map issue. Maps are my biggest gripe by far, as I would end up using all 9 of the magic maps they allow you to buy rather quickly. The only times ive ever had people die, was when I had been low on resources, and gotten lost...because i ran out of magic maps. I ended up deleting the game, because the map crap frustrated the heck out of me.  I usually ended up resorting to stick to one wall and try to make it back, but died anyway because how lengthy tht made the route. Screenshotting helped...but not enough.			"

It has some untranslated things which is annoying, and horrible, horrible, horrible tool-tips.Having a lot of fun with it. Couldn't recommend it to anyone who doesnt understand what it is so will thumbs down.			"

												Only buy this if you want a very basic dungeon crawler. Basic in the form of graphics, sound, story and interface. Gameplay feels deep enough. Lot's of character customization and item crafting. That said, I cannot really recommend this game. It's the sort of game you already know you would enjoy, a very niche genre and this is a very basic presentation of that.			"

												The game is a callback to the old days of games like Wizardry and the like, and sets out to do more of that.So does it work out? Not so muchhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=329886710 "

												*EDITED OK so I was expecting old skool. I tried to like this.... I REALLY TRIED!  but its exact same hallway over and over....exact same door, exact same crappy animation. Even by 1992 standards this is a bad looking game. I realize there is a depth to the gameplay,and most of you that are reading this are wizardy fan boys or you wouldnt have even clicked on this title...fine but nostalgia is no excuse to not take this type game and elevate it and make it ""current."" If you LOVE wizardry you will love this. ---- FACTI however, think that it is unforutnate that the devs didnt try and make this a more modern feeling/playing game. I am sorry but this is NOT WORTH 10 bucks.I  wouldnt recommended paying more than 1 dollar for this antiquated RELIC... it plays old , feels old. I wasnt expecting Grimrock, but this is sad.PS dont hate my review becuase you are a wizardy fanboy.			"

												Do not buy this game, for any reason, even if it's simply curiosity.This game is broken, and it will take you far too many hours of investment of your valuable time before you realize this.Do not buy this game. Don't do it.If I could get a full refund, I would.			"
