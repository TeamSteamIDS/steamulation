												I've played for half and hour and I already feel like I never want to touch this again. The tutorial itself teaches you how to spend money.Basically the game is designed around making the building as tedious as possible to entice the player to spend real money to skip absurd waiting times. I thought the '8 hours to collect wheat' must have been an exagguration but it's not. It's literally wait 8 hours or spend money.The game isn't designed to be fun, it's designed to be tedious unless you spend money.The battles are incredibly shallow. Three lanes of units move towards eachother without your control and you 'tap' them to 'charge' when prompted. You can tell archers to shoot (through a very cumbersome system that is clearly designed for your phone), and 'taunt' which is really the only way you can move between 'lanes'. It's utterly woeful.Not to mention you can again, pay real money to buy better units and buff said units. You also need to spend money to heal units. And spend money to avoid more ridiculous waiting times to build more units.Even on mobile phone, this game seems terrible. It's basically an excercise in tedium unless you pay money. They didn't want to make the game fun, rather they tried to make it as dull as possible unless you cough up money.Avoid like the plague. This is an abomination of a game. Sega and Creative Assembly should be ashamed of themselves.			"

												It was fun in the beggining. You start with a small amount of gold. Then after awhile everything started taking very long, and you start using your gold. Then combat became to hard and you don't have any gold left. It's a phone game not made for pc and it's close to impossible to have fun without paying microtransactions.This is a disgrace to the Total War franchise and I woulnd't recomend it to anyone.It's a ""pay to win"" game as you can get everything by simply paying.

												I have to admit, for the time being CA seems to be focused on casual enjoyment.You'd think this was your total war game in small scale, instead you have a game that teaches your mom how to terraform.This game isn't ''Bad'', It's fine if you're sitting in a waiting room with a tablet PC.For a PC game, though, i have to say collecting wheat and watching timers count down is not a sufficient total war experience. I can't recommend playing this for any serious entertainment quality.Edit: Also, all customization and speedups, do, as expected, cost a currency that you must buy with real money. (Or farm in-game for a geological amount of time)http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/717537613784190996/5A68B5BFB5C8D876D505FEE5FBFA850937A25158/P.S. When your English christian soldiers win they sometimes shout ''Praise be to the gods''They all use the recycled Roman/Barbarian voices from Rome 2, and it's random, so Picts can have posh roman voices.P.S.S. The militia spear unit is literally peasants with pitchforks, you can slay mailed knights with them, you can also charge and kill half a unit with archers if you get the perfect timing.			"

												About as ""pay to win' as you can get.  Shame on CA for stooping to a level I associate with doing the video gamer equivilant of running a casnio directy targeting gambling addicts.  A certain type of player will blow god awful amounts of money on this.  The more rational gamers willl be annoyed that those who spent a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of money have such an advantage.This game had a lot of potential, all soured by a revenue strategy that is ethically questionable, at best.  Play if you want (I might for a bit) but DON'T be the fool who spends hard earned real world money on a game like this.  Dev's will keep making pay to win games so long as people out there are willing to support them.   CA--I have purchased about every Total War game you have ever made.  This game here...bothers me.  You have lost a great deal of goodwill from me.			"

												The graphics are impressive for a free to play game, but as many other have mentioned you will need to pay or wait days to progress - typical of the genre. The ""battles"" are nonsense. You have no real control over your units, making the tactics a joke. It might look similar to a total war battle in a screen shot, but the mechanics are not even remotely similar. The city building aspect wears thin after a few hours when you have to spend ages waiting around to build things. Ultimately it's not a total war game, and pointless if you're not willing to continually spend money on it.			"

												Get your blades sharpened, you arrow knocked and you pitchforks ready to go to war with the marketing team of Total War Battles: Kingdom! Like, seriously, wtf?!?This game is terrible in how they are trying to market and profit from it. It is disgraceful to the Total War franchise and I have only played one other Total War game and that was Total War Battles: Shogun and that game was terrible but way better than this! The entire game is based off of micro-transactions as you CANNOT do much without buying in-game platinum currency of Gold! Also, 8 hours to cut wood?!?!? I am here to play games, not be like, “I want to open my game, click on button, then close it and come back in 8 hours! :D” NO! Just no... *cry*Don’t even think about this game. It is awesome that they are making a free-to-play Total War game and I appreciate it where the game itself is interesting and has the concepts of what I might enjoy like building and managing your own kingdom and the battle style system that I was kind of hoping for (and enjoyed to some extent in this game which I guess is a plus), but this was not what I was expecting nor want. Nice try though :/			"

												I gave this game a good shot. Got to level 26 and was starting to gather materials for crafting units you have to normally pay gold for which you buy with real money. It was fun up until that point. The AI after awhile suddenly becomes nearly impossible to beat since they can have several elite units of the same type while you can only have one. And they will be higher rank than you can possibly achieve without throwing tons of money at the game specially with how fast you can level just trying to gather supplies that the missions will be beyond your troops capability of winning without you paying for buffs and gear and super troops bought from the store.This unfortunately is too much pay to win for me to recommend.  I thought when I got to crafting that maybe hey I could just put some time into it and get the same items but with more time required. I gathered the materials for an item, hit craft, and saw that it said stage 1. Stage 1...So I have to gather the supplies FIVE times in order to build anything and if you don't use mastercraft you could end up making a pile of scrap metal instead of what you aimed to make. Mastercraft costs nearly triple the resources of basic craft.Not to mention it takes 12-18 hours to craft one stage. And it takes 12 hours per sheep to get one hide or cows which will take 6 days to recover their land before you can butcher them again and you only get 2 after 20 hours of waiting for them to grow. So with three sheep farms you get 18 resources a day..And the most basic sword/armor/shield takes 25 to start stage one and thats using basic craft not master.This is a disappointing game that I am sad I wasted even a couple days playing after seeing how much of a cash grab it really is. You disappoint me CA...You made my favorite games of my childhood and then you spit out this piece of crap and insult your fans like this. Definite hands down, don't waste your time or your money. Find something far better than this on your phone than a crap mobile game shoved into the pc world.Damn.. "

												To clarify, Total War Battles: KINGDOM, has nothing to do with Total War series. It is a well known brand, and that is the only reason why that name is being used here. Lets think about it, they could have released a game called Battles: KINGDOM, but everyone knows that by adding Total War in the name, it will get much more attention, and that will lead to much more people trying it. As for me, Battles: KINGDOM, as that is how I will call this game, because it is a disgusting cheap trick to call it Total War, as was explained before by me, is nearly a copy of Stronghold: KINGDOMs. I do not think it is a coincidence. We start in England, oh wow, so cool and unexpected. Whole world is made out of hexes, that can be edited. Build a building or change them into something else, such as terrain modification. Buildings have their roles, which takes time to complete. If You Ain't Talkin' Money I Don't Wanna Talk! I think that pretty much sums it all up, whole game concept. If you do not want to wait, pay! That is what the game is all about.Once I saw how the battle looks, I made a quadruple facepalm, with botfh of my hands, and feet, touching my forehead. There are three fixed lines, that unit is move on vertically, meaning they only move forward, like zombies. They ca not even be controlled, they can swap position with other unit though, at the horizontal level. Burn it with fire! I do not recommend.			"

												Disadvantages:1. The game seems to be purposely slow paced  (especially when it comes to equiping troops and leveling to 2nd rank), it's very likely for most to lose their patience and either buy gold or quit the game. 2. Nonsense restrictions, such as on crafting, which can be carried out only by one blacksmith at a time.3. Gold buttons are everywhere, thus making it very likely to 'accidentally' spend even that little gold bars you got available from in-game leveling and battle quests.4. Enemy AI on challenging and 'brutal' difficulty,  has often additional soldiers which do not appear on pre-battle info. In general it feels the AI is 'cheating' on certain battles.5. The game is quite unbalanced when it comes to the gathering of resources. Insanely long cooldowns. As an example: gathering 20pcs of stone takes 2:30 hours... Upgrading structures consume an imposible amount of resources. 6. Crafting gear is expensive and exaustingly slow, it takes 5 crafting 'stages' and takes about 4 days to craft a simple bracelet.7. There is no way to tell about the water level and flooding likeliness.8. When I reached winter season, I found it so terribly boring, no crops and no forests. Trees yield way too little wood, by chopping 1500 pcs (first castle upgrade) you end up clearing everything around making the map desolate and cold, like Isenguard... Furthermore 'tracking beasts' on winter removes all the last (if any remained) forrest left on the now depressing looking map. In retrospective, I think I mismanaged awfully the resources, however it is actually not hard to do so and go off track.9. The game fails to inform the player early on about building bonuses (forcing you around level 25-35 to demolish, rebuild and spent additional time and resources restructiring your cities). For example, I found out later in the game that you must build producers next to military buildings, it is rather vague how many residences you need to sustain a city and I had to count hexes to make out wood cutters range (tracking and wood cutting range is about 4-5 hexes).10. Has some minor bugs and disconnects from server 2-3 times (on average) during a 6h period.Advantages:1. The game has very well polished graphics for a game of it's kind.2. Battle and map zooms in, up to a great detail, very pleasant to the eye.3. Terraforming (changing the flow of rivers etc) and the changing of seasons is quite nice.4. Great variety of troops, however I'd like more detail on weaknesses and strengths of certain units.5. I believe the game most probably might be much more playable on my tablet.Conclusion:There is lack of vital information about how things work and -alas- you got to discover them by yourself. It's very difficult to enjoy properly this game, you either must have got lots of time and patience or  spend a good deal of real cash. I'd prefer just paying a one time amount for it as a complete game, without the long resource 'cooldwns' and any other cash-involved transactions.Suggestions :Reduce the cost of construction and cooldowns, amplify the benefits of gamer commitment to the game. Alternatively give the posibility of a one time purchase into a 'premium' status (global reduced cooldowns, reduced crafting costs) with the guarantee of no more gold transactions.Epilogue:We choose to play a game in order to get entertained, enjoy some challenge and overall feel better at the end of the day. This game fails delivering such.			"

												The most interesting and worthwhile part of this game is the kingdom building, but it falls flat on its face.  In the short time that I played KINGDOM I have already asked myself ""what's the point to playing this?""Building different buildings and designing your own kingdom is a fantastic idea, backing it up with a total war style battle system makes it even sweeter, but KINGDOM, as others have stated, is basically a tablet game.  The battle system is too simple to be any fun, your guys just automatically walk toward the enemy and there is little you can do besides move a unit to try and trick your enemy (lol) or use a dopey powerup.  As others stated, doing anything in the KINGDOM building mode is ridiculous, with the game trying its hardest to get you to buy premium currency to speed up every resource gathering task.  If i wanted to play a game where I just check in for 2 minutes and then log out and not play for 8 hours I'll go break into peoples houses and water their house plants.Also, building the kingdom feels very empty and pointless, the world does not feel alive at all, (no little medieval people using the roads or bustling about, or harvesting the resources) and since the ultimate purpose of the kingdom is to support the army for the dopey battles, there really is no point.Unless its some kind of end of the road/ high level feature, the building part of the game does not intertwine with the battle part.  Yes you build certain buildings to actually get your units for battle, but besides that there is no direct interaction between kingdom and battle.My opinion to fix this would be to pull it off the marketplace, and bury the code with the E.T. Atari cartridges in a landfill.No but seriously, what I would do is actually pour some depth into KINGDOM to make it almost more like a medieval sim city, then combine a fun addicting city/region builder with a battle system that plays more like an actual total war game like Rome II or Atilla, and your kindgom supports your army in way more depth.  They could even make it so your army invades other peoples realm and they try to plunder the castle and sack the village.If you want to make a free-to-play game with microtransactions that's fine with me, but if the game itself is pointless/unfun, I will not play it long enough to even consider buying premium anything.I love the actual Total War games, but please either fix this or kill it with fire.Now if you excuse me my neighbors hibiscus needs watering.

												First of all we need to establish the premise that this game is not a total war game, nor will it ever be strictly a total war game. This game does have total war features but it reminds me of a cross between age of empires and game of war. Positives of this game include its terraforming system which you can change the hieght of land and change directions of water intuiteively. Customisation was also a nice feature being able to make your character but I would like there to be alot more. Battles were fun and I like the inclusion of missions, duels and soon to be a campaign. Graphics and animations are quite good for a mobile game and excelled from what I thought they would be like. I can imagine this game progressing and more features being added to make an already decent game a good game. Now for the negative... I feel like alot of reviews expect this game to be like most Total Wars and if you have that outlook this game will disapoint you. This game is in beta and does not have all the features, it also lacks some polish and the game even crashed once for me and I noticed some bugs in the tutorial, but nothing major. This game also takes time to unlock things so dedication is needed to tend to crops, resources, buildings and missions. You can purchase gold (guys gotta make money somehow) but I don't like P2W, although this game does not seem like anything is unachievable by normal means, just takes a bit longer.My Main gripe with this game is there is hardly any tactical depth compared to Total War, this was disapointing. This game is in BETA and it will get better, but if you do not like it now there is no point in getting it later. p.s narrator was annoying...			"

Now, well... not so much. The game itself is a lot like a mix between civilization and clash of clans with the battles being much like the total war battles: shogun except without all the buildings you can build in battle. So as a sequel to total war battles: shogun, it is ok. As a Total War game, I do not recommend it.Positives:Graphics and terraforming are pretty coolThe simple strategies may appeal to less serious strategy gamersI enjoy building my townThe tutorial is helpfulAlthough they are simple, microbattles are pretty cool to see because each unit is fighting against individual enemiesOrders are cool as well as they give different bonuses to units and orders are attainable from churchesNot everything is pay to win as some things you cannot use gold to getLogin is good and not buggy (which tends to happen in many beta games)I like the medieval feel of the gameThere seems to be an unlimited amount of ""workers"" or ""builders"" which is great!The peasant and craftsman systems (your workers) seems useful.I enjoy having to build multiple barracks and stables that each field one unit as this makes the town bigger and cooler-looking.Negatives:Fighting is too simple (see above positives)Not at all what I expected from a total war gameMore or less pay to win (strong units cost ""gold"", aka money) You can of course earn gold but it takes a very long time (I guess it makes sense because the game will be free so they need a way to make money)Some buildings are not available until much later in the gameUpgrading buildings seems to take a lot of grinding and upgrading castles (main building) seems to require having multiple castles and towns and having a certain amount of buildings in your town.I personally think that the lord (basically, you) should be more customizable as right now there are only a few different options for hair color, bacjground of profile, etc.So overall this is a fun game although not at all what I expected or wanted to play from Total War,I RECOMMEND IT TO JUST PLAY A CLASH OF CLANS/CIV MIX BUT NOT AS A TOTAL WAR GAME!and because of the pay-to-win aspect of this game, I will not recommend it overall.

												Sadly this game is a complete cash grab for the mobile market. The battles and town building aspect are completely Pay to Win, with being able to complete buildings/gathering and improving your army by paying with real money. This game doesnt deserve to be part of the Total War franchise and I hope this is the last we see of such games from Creative Assembly.			"

												I play World of Tanks, so I am familiar with free to play games. There are plenty of games that use free-to-play models well and are developed with a PC gaming audience in mind; LoL, DOTA, TF2, WoT. Generally the obstacle to progress in these games is an experience system locking out hightier or desirable items which you can unlock by playing the game, or alternatively they simply offer a cash shop with funny hats that people buy for reasons?!?!This game is free to play of the mobile variety, so rather than making gameplay and ""fun"" (insofar as world of tanks could be described as ""fun"") the route to unlocking things it instead uses your precious time, or your money. Or both. While time lockouts might make a bit of sense for games you'll play occasionally through the day on facebook or your phone/tablet, they make no damn sense in a PC port. There are also shameless paywalls for powerful units and unit upgrades.Also the UI is a straight mobile port so it's got chunky, mobile optimised UI elements.tl;dr I have no idea why this even ended up on steam. As a casual game, the underlying mechanics are alright, but the implentation as a PC title seems poorly matched to the platform.EDIT: I have now played long enough to exhaust my gold and can't really do much other than wait or 'play' the battles.

												I played the game in beta 2.0 and again in 3.0 (it reset the entire game so I had to build everything back up again).  It has terrible resource balance which forces constant market exchanges that are costly.  In battle, it is a classic 'pay to succeed' game.  You almost can't win some battles without buying specialized units.  You can craft these special units at the blacksmith but it is very costly and time consuming and at the end of it there is still a possibility 'you workers manage to make a pile of metal scraps' and you lose all the resources you put into and still don't get the unit (pretty much forcing you to buy the units if you want them).  The objectives are trying to encourage duels against live opponents but there are seldom live opponents to play against. The list of frustrations could go on and on with this game.  Bottom line is, if you want to succeed at this game be prepared to spend the $$$$$.			"

												Total Waste and Boring: KINGDOMI have never written a review for a game, but this one deserves oneI was part of the beta testing and really tried to play the game and expandAfter 53.4 hrs and 5 regions with level3 Castles, game turned out to be a major battle grinder to level up my units so they don't suck. After a battle i had to wait for an average of 15 minutes for them to recover in order to reuse them again .... (or pay gold to insta-revive them). I decided enough is enough and uninstalled. Will never touch this game again.The ammount of time you need to spend to actually do something in this game can be compared to smoking. Every 10-15 minutes you need to launch game to play a battle or harvest something and repeat that forever...You need to calculate the 2-3 or 8 hour periods so you login and click stuff to collect because they need to be clicked....So either you have no life and no other games to play, or you are rich and have cash to spend to play the game without wasting your time.I don't even wanna talk about the combat system because i will spend 2 hours writing my complaints about how much it sucks.1/10 It can fool you for some hours until you realize that it isn't worth your time			"

												Yet  another cow clicker.  The entire design behind this game is to get you to buy ""gold""(with real money) which significantly speeds the game up. Instead of waiting 8 real hours to harvest f.uc.k.i.n.g. wheat you can pay gold (real money) to get it instantly! No thank you. yet more  respect lost for CA. As if that were possible.Makes me want to play Civ V or Endless Legend or some other actually worth while 4X... ffs.			"

												What's the difference between Total War: Kingdom and Goat Simulator?One is a complete and utter joke, the other is a game about goats.TW:K Sucks so much. Firstly, I give it a go, a good go - I put in many hours to get a complete look at the game.First of all - The resource system doesnt even work properly - you wait for several hours to collect wood, for instance, but you have to actually be online to collect it. It's not like its a proper streaming economy - this would be so much better. You buy a woodcutter - all your work should be done.Secondly - The balance is ♥♥♥♥ing horrible - It's so obviously pay-to-win its excrutiatingly painful to play against other people. I muster the best units I can, with all the upgrades. I didn't purchase any gold so I couldnt recruit the most advanced units (which would cost 200 gold OR approximately 300 hours playtime to get 200 gold for free).Moreover, No more rock-paper-scissors style Total War. Archers now beat cavalry in melee, spearmen beat swordsmen etc.Thirdly - The battles are so damn boring. I mean, who thought this could be fun at all? There's also a lot of UI lag, which makes it hard for you to get 'Good' or 'Perfect' charges to any level of consistency. At times it runs like a jet-ski on gravel despite it being played on a high-end PC. I know this is a seperate team of people from Creative Assembly and they may or may not have worked on previous titles, but I suggest that anyone in CA who has an ounce of goodwill in his body, kick these devs out of CA. But I guess I wait to wait 8 years for that to happen (or get it NOW for 500 gold!).			"

												Understanding that it's in Beta, there is just so much wrong with the game. Why would I want to play a game that feels like Game of War on my pc? I log on, collect resources, find out it's not enough to build anything, and then just log off. Lather, rinse, repeat the next day. The battles take no straregy, besides clicking at the right time to get the charge down. As mentioned before, the archer mechanics are also very lacking. I can understand the length it takes for resources, as it does reflect real life. How long does it take for a tree to grow to become usful timber, as an example of scale. But it still just doesn't feel like a TW game. Please CA, just stop this nonsense. Or at least stop trying to pouch our pockets			"

												Total War? ... Total Rubbish. Casual. Pay to win. Battles lacking any strategy at all. Even the tutorial makes you use gold instead of waiting hours to harvest wheat or mine stone. Utterly stupid. But you can build a barracks in 8 seconds.  Right.  Uninstalled. Back to Attila I go.Edit: ""if you can earn gold, how is this a pay to win game?""Im sorry, but starting with gold and being able to earn gold by playing the game does not mean it isn't Pay to Win. I think a lot of the backlash is because this is being released firstly as a PC game (not Andriod or iOS) and thereofre Total War fans expect a deeper gameplay experience. I have no inherant hate for pay to win as a category. Pay to win just should not be in the same category as Total War. For example, I spent over 100 hours on an android game called Real Racing 3. Similar mechanics, you can wait for your car to repair through a timer or pay gold to do it instantly.  you could earn gold by playing, or buy it at the store. Later, there were also restrictions on what you could buy based on completing the lower level races. The fundamental difference between the two was that RR3 was fun, and this is not.Especially when you compare it to the other full total war gaming experiences available on Steam			"

												STATEMENT:""Total War Battles: KINGDOM is very enjoyable, but has too many pay-to-win apsects""RATING :6 / 10INTRODUCTION:Very enjoyable and I just played the first 7.8 hours without a brake. However, there are quiet a few cons to it as well.PROS : - Easy to learn (tutorials are great)- Free- Has multiplayer and a friend system- Has many types of buildings; the developers have thought about balancing these buildings prices and their purposes- Mining is especially fun, when finding out what resource you will discoverCONS:- Gold is extremely overpowerful as a resource, and is able to be bought- Gold can be exhanged for every other material- Inabilities can sometimes make the game boringRECCOMENDATION TO CUSTOMER:I reccomend this game as it is very enjoyable and can keep you hooked hours on end. But, be wary of this pay-to-play system (although it's exaggerated by the reviewers), and think about if your wasting Gold.FEEDBACK TO THE DEVELOPERS & PRODUCERS:Look, you may be looking at all of those negative reviews and feel like you get no feedback; and say ""Whats the point.""But, if you make some changes (examples listed below), people may feel more optimistic about this game.- Make Gold not able to be exhanged for other materials- Lower the hours it takes to build things, to minutes- Keep the use of Gold as a 'catalyst' for building- Keep the use of Gold for changing 'Profile' and 'Coat of Arms' aesthetics- Take away the use of Gold to get high level troops, make it possible with upgrading barracks and such- Add the use of Gold to be able to customise what your troops look like (without affecting their battle attributes e.g: Damage, Defence etc)- If you want to not have any more bad reviews about pay-to-win; I say put a price on the game, and refund anyone that payed money into itFEEDBACK SUMMARY:Thanks for reading, and just making a few of these needed changes would make the player base alot less toxic.

												Do you like getting kicked out of a battle and told you were defeated? Or how about constantly getting kicked off the server because, oops you lost connection... for the 5000th time. If you enjoy that, then this is the game for you. The game play is fine, it is not a bad game really. It can be extremely difficult if you do not purchase anything, but not impossible. Some of the changes they have made have improved the game, others, like not being able to expand via combat, have not. So to recap the server connectivety will drive you to the brink of insanity, the game is cool, but as it is in it's test phases still, it has a lot of work to be done on it. Due to the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor server issues I have to ""thumbs down"" this game. If it is fixed it would be a lot of fun. CA and Sega usually put together some excellent games, so this one is a bit of a let down when it comes to technical errors.			"

												I am so, so very dissapointed with this. Not because this game is totally♥♥♥♥♥♥( though it mostly is) but because it's a game that is really just a slap in the face to any total war series vet or fan. Sega has highjacked the respected and adored name of Total War and slapped on a hastily made IOS game designed solely to extract the most amount of money out of players with the least amount of effort put towards game development.  In reality the game isn't all bad and it actually looks and functions pretty well on the surface. In my opinion though, it is painfully p2p (pay to progress), everything you need to do takes way too long and it leaves the player sitting there with nothing to do. No matter what you think about this game, you probably aren't really having much fun anyways as this is a passable IOS game at best. PS. ♥♥♥♥ you Sega "

												I gave it a chance but there isn't anything in the game to grab my interest. The combat is plodding and has no depth, a severe limit to army size and variety, global cooldown when you tell a group of archers to shoot(must be a bug) so you have to wait to even give the order to attack, and limited maneuverablility when in combat which is frustrating. The city building is decent if simple but trying to build where you want in the geography is needlessly complicated-roads and bridges can only be built on certain elevations. Excavating on land next to a body of water flooded stone I managed to find, building dams and trying to release the water somehow to get the stone didn't work so I gave up.Buildings and missions are gated behind a honor system which you gain by doing small quests(mostly just building up your city and battles) the early game is very slow and tedious. Building actions like gathering resources or earning money can take hours of time but can be expedited by using purchasable currency, also certain combat buffs can be purchased. Rather than have different outfits for your avatar or skins for units as their money maker his is where the developers chose to setup the gameshop, a clear pay-to-win formula.As it stands the game does not offer anything of value worth the effort of installing and hours of waiting involved to get anywhere.

												As someone who plays a lot of mobile games with timers and freemium transactions, this game is poor even by those standards.The amount of pay to win is abhorrent - more than I've ever seen before. I found a gold deposit (the game's premium currency) and, after 10 minutes of ""mining"", acquired 1 gold. It costs 150 gold to purchase a single premium unit. Some upgrades to those units cost over a thousand. As someone who has played almost every Total War game - and was sorely disappointed by the broken excuse of a  game TW:R2 was released as - I've lost any modicum of respect for the TW series. This type of freemium game that was clearly intended for markets such as Google Play, iTunes, and Facebook need to be banished from Steam. I've seen more of them show up over time, and I fear that one day Steam will be inundated with these garbage shovelware games despite the fact that they receive almost unanimous criticism by their customers.

 Most humble and greatest review for a game, which is the result of miscarriage Remember those browser games, where you build stuff, farm stuff, destroy other people's stuff and steal all their resources so you can repeat this again? Generally they are all the same. You can pay some extra bucks there to get extra income of in-game resources, finish construction of virtually same buildings instantly with a level number increasing next to their name somewhere, so you can spend another 10 minutes of your pathetic life playing a game that's not fun but you can at least ruin other people's fun?This game tries to be something like that. I'm thinking so the very least, in a way when that awkward guy you have as an acquaintance does something strange, you try to be polite and not make fun of him. Which I'm not trying to be, as this game is not my ♥♥♥♥ing acquaintance and it sucks major♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Almost literally.Okay, so here we have it. A F2P game with Total War in its name. A major AAA title you don't even have to pay for. Let's get to the gameplay!You are the lord of some Britbong duchy/county whatever, turns out something happened to your daddy and some old regent dude is giving you a tutorial of doing things, which he was too wasted to do. You build a dam, which is the coolest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ part of the game, because there are water physics (!) then you get praised for clicking on something. Surely increased my self-worth.Oh, and about clicking: you only need to use the left mouse button. Right click does nothing, it would be too hardcore for the game. It's obvious this was made with touchscreen in the mind.Anyway, from first glance it looks fairly average but it gets worse: you need two hours to saturate a resource tile which gives you 20 wood/food/something or you can click on harvest all button, which does it for all the tiles eight hours and nets you half that much per tile. And the best part is: you need to manually collect all collected things by clicking on them. Then wait for it to grow out again. Which won't start until you collect the resources. Then once it grew out, you need to order them to start saturating it again. So much fun to be had! But wait, it gets even better: if you pay money, you don't even need to wait for all this fun, it happens instantly! And you should pay, because getting 10 resources is not even nearly enough, you need about 100 to build the silliest of buildings. Then upgrading it, of course, which costs even more.That's about the management part, but worry not, there is  COMBAT  like in every proper game! And it even gets you resources, so you can have more fun faster! But not so fast. First the concept: there are different units, which is the gathering of soldiers. A battlefield can hold 9 units on each side. To create a unit, you need to build a corresponding building, which gives you one unit of the type you want. There are barracks, archery ranges and stables, for starters. When a building is finished, you are asked to pick one of 4 possible units to be linked to the building. Too bad, two of them are more powerful and you can only buy them for real money, so get your wallet ready! More advanced barracks housing knights are avalaible later in the game but I don't think a living human being played this game long enough to get that far. One unit consists about 16-18 men, so that's about 150 dudes fighting against 150 other, assuming there are no siege engines shooting an army, because they are substracted from the lineup and are shooting offscreen. This is the Originally posted by Store Page: Large scale battles  I was promised, but it's okay, gotta give some suspension on disbelief. In Fall of the Samurai more people died in a single battle than in the entire war, historically.The battle system is having the 9 units forming 3 rows and 3 columns, practically making a square. The first 3 lines charge each other and... you watch them fight. In the charging period you need to click once to get a charge bonus. Once a unit is beaten, the one behind them takes its place and starts fighting. There is no flanking if you have taken one of the columns, you just watch units 1v1 each other until one of them drops dead. Archers are worthless because there is a global cooldown on the fire order and at best they can kill 4 dudes from an idle unit before the frontline collapses. And you can never expect an archer unit to excel in melee.For winning battles you get some resources, then you will wait 10-20 minutes for your injured units to heal. But fear not tovarich, you just need to pay and they are healed instantly.Oh, and these are game-generated opponents of course. I have not met a way to play against other players besides inviting a friend to a duel, which is a waste of time. Basically: this is a f2p  single player  game which expects you to pay money for its incompetent gameplay. I'm sure they have plans for multiplayer and whatnot, but I honestly feel sorry for programmers who have to work on this pile of unfun♥♥♥♥♥♥tl;dr: The design is irredeemable♥♥♥♥♥♥ so do yourself a favour and don't install it. Even better; forget it ever existed Pros: -Water physics on the map are cool! You can grow crops and trees faster, if you make it flow next to them! Cons: -This ""game"" exists			"

												After putting some more time into this, I retract my thumbs up. I dont recommend it at all anymore. Even as an Idle game. The combat is simple and fun, like rock-paper-scissors fun, and the game has a few cool features like terraforming the land...but thats about it.The reward for actively playing is extra silver or resorces for winning in combat. You spend that to build up your kingdom. The only reason to build up your kindom is to build barracks to build your army. Everything else like farming, mining, and tree harvesting, is just too cumbersome to even bother. What they do in hours, your army can do in moments all on its own. Most idle games continue their task whether you are on or not. This game, when assigned to harvest, it does it, but once its done with the task, it stops until you tell it to go again. Now doing this for every farm, mine, blacksmith, tavern, peasant house, and tree farm, It gets cumbersom and annoying. Their timers dont end at similiar times, and the amount of resorces you get for it is minimal. Not to mention, you are out those resorces if you log in late.If the pace on resource gathering was a bit faster, and resource buildings were automatic, this wouldnt be a bad game. But since thats combersome, and there is no need for it anyway...there is no point. Taking the fun out of both sides of the game. I would play a game with a map like that if everything about it was more along the lines of the normal Total War franchise. With scaleable armies, resource management, and rewards you for your time.			"

												Runs better than Rome II and Attila combined.  10/10-----THIS IS NOT A TRADITIONAL TOTAL WAR GAME.  There.  You’re warned.Of the handful of free-to-play, castle-style games I’ve tried, they have been a handful too many.  Stronghold Kingdoms was either too lonely or filled with inter-House drama.  Sparta: War of Empires was too deceptive with its trailers and required zero micro.  Kingdom Wars had too many bugs and performed too poorly.  Upon reading several negative reviews, I convinced myself internally that this game would prove no better.Total War Battles: KINGDOM is none of any of those bad things.KINGDOM, firstly, plays very, very smoothly and quickly.  Controls are responsive and the game doesn’t waste your time.  “But stuff takes forever to grow and collect!!”  Not my point.  When you are in-game and interacting with the world, you don’t encounter slowdowns, or annoyingly-long cutscenes, or needless exposition.  The engine is a well-oiled machine, undoubtedly.  The music is also really good, complementing the game without getting in the way.KINGDOM’s depth really sells it, mind you.  The Realm overworld map is hex-based in style, with each space viable for manipulation: elevation, irrigation, terrain type, etc.  Building placement encourages wise structure layout.  During battles, your formation and tactics matter in equal measure. (a qualm I have is that the archers’ ranged attack acts like an ability and does not auto-fire on enemies; I assume this is done to encourage micro, but it’s more tedious than tactical)  Warfare requires very simple, but constant, micro.  It’s not too overwhelming, but also not ""set and forget.""And judging by the speed at which units gain experience and upgrade, there is so, so much more to do.“But Gold makes it pay-to-win!!”Accept it.  There is no way around that.  The amount of PvE and personal kingdom development, and strictly optional PvP (there's almost always a PvE option to quests), however, mean there’s more than enough to do without interacting with another human online.  And the prices for most things is extremely minimal in cost.  Need a boost this battle?  Sac 3 Gold.  Desperately need that bit of Wood absolutely right now?  1 Gold for your troubles.  The costs do not murder the player’s treasury, and a variety of in-game methods offer the chance to accumulate Gold independent of any real money you spend on the game.The game does not persistently badger you to share with your Facebook friends with annoying pop-ups every time you successfully gather grain, or pester you to buy Gold every 3 minutes.  The option is up there, quietly sitting on its own, not bugging you.  Mad props for not beating the player over their head with it.TL;DR: Total War Battles: KINGDOM is not your average free-to-play, castle-style title.  It is indeed better than the simplistic tripe that passes on most on mobile devices or sits in the back tab of web browsers.  I would recommend people try it simply because it runs so blasted smoothly, but the profundity to the grand strategy of it all may arguably keep you hooked.			"

												Hello steam subscribers I am here to write a review for this game. Before I get into the fighting♥♥♥♥♥♥spirit with this review I should tell you I am a long time Total War player and started with Shogun 1 when my balls first dropped and have played everything after that and enjoyed them thoroughly (although some more than others). Since the series has been around so long players have come to expect a certain type of game when they see the total war logo with the tiny samurai horseman logo next to the letter, you know the one I'm talking aboot ;)WHAT IS DIFFERENT?This game for all intents and purposes is NOT a total war game, there is no turn based campaign map instead it is real time much like a command&conquer where buildings need time to finish contructing. While there are real time tactical battles, the open ended and diverse battle maps known from the other total war titles are gone as well. This means there are no terrain advantages or disadvantages (at least I have found) during battles and the battlefield is made up of 3 lanes.+WHAT IS BATTLE?+Each lane has 3 slots for units, and I will illustrate how you may distribute your units among these slots by making a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ diagram with text and little symbols herefront<- [ Infantry, Cavalry, and Ranged ] [ Infantry, Cavalry, and Ranged ] [ Infantry, Cavalry, Ranged, and Siege Weapon ]front<- [ Infantry, Cavalry, and Ranged ] [ Infantry, Cavalry, and Ranged ] [ Siege Weapon ]front<- [ Infantry, Cavalry, and Ranged ] [ Infantry, Cavalry, and Ranged ] [ Infantry, Cavalry, Ranged, and Siege Weapon ]As you can maybe see there is SOME depth to battles, but the meat of battles and how they are decided is military orders and unit abilities and the traditional rock paper scissors gameplay of other TW tittles. And yes, I spelled titles that way on purpose. After your units gain enough experience they can unlock special abilities with a variety of effects depending ont he unit type. Each unti has 2 choices for ability. Military orders are like general abilities but you are able to use them throughout the whole battle but they have a timer cooldown between each use, unliek unit abilities which can only be used once. So troop choice is extremely important in battles and the right combination of orders and abilities.+WHAT IS CAMPAIGN?+The campaign map is layed out before you like a giant deep dish pizza pie on hexagonal tiles. You can build buildings, gather the resources which are silver, stone, food, and wood *INSERT STRONGHOLD ""Wood Needed"" VOICE CLIP HERE*. I'm pretty sick of writing this review already so I'm going to wrap it up with the big important thign about this game.+WHAT IS LOVE?+This game screams IPHONE WINDOWS TABLET TIME SINK. And like most other tablet time sink the pace of this game  is extremely slowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww. BUT: and this is where the magic happens; you can purchase a 5th resource known as gold and with this gold you can speed up harvesting, building, and purchase unique battlefield buffs such as flaming arrows and saxon mercenaries. But to be fair and ubjective you can acquire these things without payign gold, but much much slower. So slow that if you go in expecting this game to be as fast as traditional TW games you will be angry and write angry reviews containing 1 sentence referencing pop culture memes.+BABY DONT HURT ME+All in all I WOULD reccomend this as a game you can hop into and SLOWELY develop your realm and then exit and do other stuff, that is assuming you are not plannign on purchasing gold. If you are hopping for a cool medieval total war game you will not find it here. But if you just want a game to pass the time with, and kick some♥♥♥♥♥in some hokey battles than go ahead, I am enjoying it but its definetly not a game I can spend hours at a time playing like other TW games.You can add me in the game or on steam to duel me and let me farm your troops for xp, I will sure be willign to return the reach around/ favor. my lords name is Hershey and he is a grizzled peasant badass.

												I was able to play this game in the BETA and liked it in the first place. With the new beta update from February however they completely managed to outbalance the game. Whilst this game is marketed as something you could play across all devices from time to time you cannot even stop playing really without loosing something. The costs are insanely high and make it impossible for me to enjoy TWBK.Granted it is still a BETA and I hope for a though rebalancing. If this happens I will be willing to test this game through its paces again, and enjoy it. Currently it consists of grinding galore, non intuitive and often unexplained constraints. There is lack of tooltips and explaining, despite there is a short tutorial. TWBK begins easy peasy but it starts to get very hard if you played it a longer time than just 20 hours, as most of the reviewers did. TWBK, traditionally to Total War games has a great concept and fresh ideas, and it could get somewhere. If this small CA works hard to aim this game also for casual players, instead of tailoring it to people with no life, or a big wallet for getting ingame currency, it will be fine. Currently it is disencouraging for me.Sad enough some blame me I play it ""wrong"" because I don't have conquered 3 regions in a couple of hours, just because I too have a real life somehow.Review Update regarding patch 0.3: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/rometotalwarworldplayers#announcements/detail/743449876219265586 "

												I've been on Steam several years and this is the first time I've felt like I need to write a review.What is the point of this game?  It reminds me of Paradise Life with castles.  Quite simply no reason to continue playing.  Last month of gameplay for me was logging in for 2 minutes to gather resources and restart constructions, then exit and go play something fun.City building, terrain altering, and water mechanics were fun.Crafting system is terrible and very grindy, in addition to relying on RNG.  This is your alternative to the gold shop if you want the better available combat units and equipment; and not much of one at that.Battles are pay to win.  You will see people say that it is not pay to win because you can get all the same things if you grind enough.  That is technically true; but it takes so long to grind for those things that you are at a severe disadvantage for a really long time.  You can pay to win now, or grind to win a long time from now.In addition, I had first installed this game on my PC and played for a while.  Once it was released, I installed it on my phone and logged into my (same) account.  My Kingdom on PC and on my Phone were completely separate despite being on the same account.  Not cross-compatible.I do not recommend this game.  Do not waste your time like I did.  Go play something else.			"

												This Game has had mostly negative reviews, but I believe that is due to the miscomprehension of what this game actually is supposed to be. People compare this to other total war titles and, of course, it falls short of expectations. The truth is this really is something different. The only reasons it has the total war stamp is for publicity and because it also has a historical backdrop. However, this is not a bad game.1st - it is multi-dimensional: There is the aspect of building your land, yes, but there is also the aspect of battles. 2nd - there is change: water rises and lowers; there are floods and droughts, and there are seasons which significantly change the way you play the game, so it stays fresh. Also, there are a lot of combinations of units you can use in battle, and even more unplayable units, for example danes and picts. 3rd - waiting is not crippling: Remember this is a mobile game. Things take time to build, and people have lives. If there was no waiting, a dedicated idiot who played 16h a day would win the game easily. Instead, everyone has a chance if they can actually fight, which brings us to battles. if your units don't lose too many people, you don't have to wait. Waiting is a punishment for losing battles, or a necessary thing for building and collecting resources. Also, people keep saying this game has 8h waiting periods, but most times the waiting is 20 mins or so. It is like that with units and most collecting resources. If you decide to fell a whole forest, yeah, it is gonna take 8h, but that is dumb to begin with. Forests don't just grow back, certainly not when you wipe the whole thing out at the same time.4th - though gold can help you win, you cannot pay to win after the first few weeks. Once people actually have time to craft some special units, it becomes impossible to pay to win. The only ways you can help yourself with gold is by not waiting (which helps very little) and by getting special units (which you can also craft, though that takes longer), and special bonuses (which, again, you can craft). It is a known fact that, if you spend too much money on a game, you get bored easily and stop playing - too much money, too little reward. So after the first few weeks, older players who stick with it will be mopping the floor with younger players with lots of money. 5th - Again, this is not a proper total war title. This is for waiting rooms, for work breaks, for commuting, etc. If you want a past time for that, this is a good choice. If you want a game to play at home, do yourself a favor and buy rome and/or attila. That's what steam sales are for.6th - comparison with other mobile games: this game is so much better than any other mobile games i've seen, it is not even fair. Candy crush, farmville, and the like are basically the same thing over and over again. There is very little difference. Also, here at least you get a (very tiny albeit existant) bit of history. You at least learn that there were picts and danes in england. To be honest, there should be more information about that, as well as about the game mechanics. But this is a beta, so I expect that will eventually show up - I HOPE. And you can just enjoy a casual game. If you want something else, something more encompassing, get another game.Still, not bad. For what it is.			"

												As an early starter and being quite active I had an advantage over other non pay to win players so I would win a majority of PvP battles, that was quite fun and the win money helps build up the kingdom, however there's a % of players that pay to win and befriending them you get free gold on their gold purchases. I was amazed at the amount of money they were pouring into the game.Over a few days the gulf between me an non pay to win against a pay to win was evident and very frustrating as it is almost a guarentee that they win the PvP. I would get the same pay to win person over and over. Other non payers must be loosing interest, also being frustrated.On the other hand you don't need to play PvP and can do quest/mission battles instead. However at 20 mins wait for a lvl 2 unit to heal if NOT PAYING means I waste too much time looking and waiting for things to click....So the micro management, A lot of the time you do things and then find out you can't get what you need, ie you build a 2nd knights quaters to recruit more knights only to find you are restricted to only one knight. The reasource collecting is not bad at first but becomes painful as you progress with high costs and too many things you need to improve to increase your reasource pool, with things having different producer times you can spend hours on the game looking and waiting 5 mins between doing something and really when you look back you haven't actually achieved much.It's a nice looking addictive game and the battles can be fun and frustrating, the tactics are quict simple and rely more on differences in army units and how quick you can click but over all there is little strategy to the game. The strategy is basically what to build where, how to maximim and prioritise reasources. "

												Terrible direction that the Total War series has taken, it has gone to a pay to win style of play and after the atrocious release of Atilla, I would think that things are not going to get any better and Creative Assembly are going to continue milking money from people.			"

												I played it for a while then deleted it. I redownloaded, played it again then deleted it. But now I redownload it again. For a F2P game, it's not a bad game. If you just want to hang around and kill a little bit of time (once or two times per day for 10 minutes as I did) it's not a bad game. You won't be king and you will lack most of the resources (stone) but it could be fun. It depends on the player. I like the map, I like the gameplay, I even like the battles. I don't like the part where you can pay to win but it's not a big advantage.. if you just simply want to.. play.			"

												Dear Makers of this game, I am a experenced gamer and have played the Total War Series since my childhood and every single of these game I believe has been a great joy for me but this.... crap of mircotransactions and dlc has intervined my game play of RTW 2 and now this game is a money leak. I hope that the next Total War Game Realesed is not plagued by mircotransaction and dlc.But now back to the game I have played this game for 19 minutes, it is not much but all I have done is click a few button and waited for 8 second most of the time and the bandit battle was click and wait. This game is not worth hours of effort for a minimal boost of enjoyment. Im am not trying to offend the makers of this game but I give it as constructive criticisim and pathway for other games. All I have to sum this up is Clash Of Clans (Computer Version. Dont do this again please.			"

												First, ignore any review that mentions this not being like other Total War games as a negative. It is not meant to be. It is also not pay to win, because there is no winning, and the wait times for things like growing crops and such are a few hours, perfectly reasonable for this type of game. Now for my review. To put it briefly, good idea but needs work. The game essentially tries to combine elements of Total War, Civilization, and farmville-style games into one. The problems?1. the Total War element, the battles, are terrible. Wayy to basic and repetetive, battle maps are too small. Not fun. Also the rewards are so minimal there is little incentive to do them.2. There is no purpose, drive to the game. No reason to push forward and in that sense the farmville-style element of it is a little too strong.For the above two reasons, I would not recommend this game. As I play this, I really just get the urge to play Total War or Civilizations, it does not do what it should to mesh these game types together in a way that can stand alone.			"

												I'm extremely conflicted about recommending this game.  So let me say that overall I'd recommend it as a single player game, but the multi-player mode is just as most reviews here say.  Multi-player is pay to win.There are enough reviews that talk about just how pay to win the multi-player part of the game is and that's the part I would not recommend, so I'm just going to skip talking about that.  Let's just say those people are absolutely correct and there are plenty of reviews that talk about it if you want to read about it.What I do recommend is playing the game as a single player game.  It's a pretty okay simulation if you avoid playing against people who have paid to build themselves up.Alone you have this season changing strategy game where the elements can work against you.  Most people will be warned about Flooding early on, semi ignore the warning, and then be wrecked when that first flood comes in.  You can build dams but they can break depending on how much pressure is on them. Every season brings changes to the game and some things you have to do over a number of seasons.  For instance, you can semi recover from some flooding issues and get land back if you build temporary dams and then make a channel that leads the water to the sea - but there will be some places that the water can still be stuck depending on how you dug things out.  If you try to deal with it during most seasons the water is too deep to do much and you can't build it up.  If you wait until winter when the water freezes, you can chip out the ice and then bend the landscape to however you want it - considering of course that the high waters will return sometime along.As you play more functions open up that are somewhat interesting.  And while the game may not be super deep at the moment (there's a Campaign that supposedly is coming but it isn't in the game yet) it's pretty decent for a free to play game if you just do the single player stuff.You can take as much time as you want building up and such before doing things in the single player version, you see exactly who and what you're going against before you take them on, etc.The novelty of what happens during the season changes will probably wear off over time and all I'm sure.  But for a while if you stick to the single player version of the game it's actually pretty cool and recommended.Fighting others is completely voluntary, so if you want to try this game out you can do so without fear of being destroyed by overpowered pay to win players.There are always options in expanding your realm so far so that you can avoid ever having to do the multi-player part of the game if you don't want to.  It definitely can be more costly than just doing some multi-player battles but at least there still is a way to avoid them if you want here (although that's only a good thing because the multi-player game is pay to win, if it was more fair there wouldn't be a lot of reason to avoid it).I know there will be people that are upset the multi-player portion is pay to win and they won't play the game at all, they will keep far away from it because of that.  That is fine and great if you want to do that.  For me I'd rather just play the single player portion and let the Devs see I'm happy with that part of the game but not the multi-player part.  It's totally up to you what to do with your time but if you want to test it out you can get in with a quick download and test the waters (so to speak - you'll see what I mean :P) in the single player portion without worrying about dealing with the Wallet Warrior Whales that may dominate the multi-player game.

												if it looks like a mobile game, feels like a mobile game and has the micro transaction system of a mobile game, chances are it is a mobile game.This however did not stop me from trying and I found it to be quite enjoyable to be honest.Although it does carry the name Total war the battle system is rather simplistic compared to the actual series.But to its more simple nature I found it easy to play in between other activities.The micro transaction system is worth a special mention, as unlike my expectations you are not forced to use it.As major part of this game is technically single player you have plenty of options available without using gold.Overall a decent game to fill smaller time gaps between activities.

First resources should be auto, I shouldn't have to go through and click for no real reason. The battles need to be more interactive and the quests where very generic. If this played more like a tradional stratergy game and less like a facebook game it might be a great game. As it is, this game is pretty weak.			"

This game does have alot of potential if they rework the army, time it takes to do anything and lower the cost of many different upgrade. If this was pay on time to own and you are able to get every aspect of the game, I would glady buy the game.			"

												This game's only redeeming value is that it was a beta, so it was free to play, but that's quite marginal considering how time consuming it was with little payoff in the end. In summary, it's just another one of those app games riddled with cheap ""pay-to-win"" antics and micro transactions. It doesn't even feel like a Total War game. Yeah, when you get that feeling from one of the most popular strategy game franchises of all time, you know that they've done screwed something up. I will leave it up to another reviewer to go into details, but from my perspective, it's not worth it.			"

												Unlike many negative reviewers, I played the game for several days now, almost non-stop, and I am getting sick of this 'buy to win' system. Sorry 'Total War' makers, you just lost a customer for this one. It would take about 1 year of everyday playing to build-up your kingdom and a powerful military to be able to reach level 14 or better WITHOUT paying. Or you can just spend 200 bucks and buy everything instantly, build up an army instantly. It is not just about 'pay to win', it is also about lack of strategy in fighting (older Total War games had a much better system). Now you just click on orders, on 'charge' and keep clicking.....And the balance is terrible. I cut down all the forests on the map JUST to upgrade my STABLES to LEVEL 2. Seriously? Around 50,000 trees at least just to upgrade a building? You might have as well made it that you need about 100 sheep to feed one soldier. That's how disproportional the game is. I don't recommend it.			"

												Reached an unwinnable battle (enemy AI had all the ""pay to win"" units) Gives me an option: pay money for extra unitsNice idea. You start with some currency, I'll use it now. Causes game to freeze at the taunt screen, sit there for 10 minutes watching the same animations, eventually takes me not to the battle but to the main screen ""thanks for the gold purchase, you lost the battle and we won't give you that extra reward we told you we'd give you for buying battle support (even though the ""buy support"" mission has been ticked off your to-do list)"" I was going to write a positive review, talk about how as part of an ""easy game"" genre it was quite good, but bugs like the example below kept cropping up not daily, not hourly, but every minute. For a pc that could run Rome 2 easily from launch with very few bugs or crashes it's dissapointing this game is so poorly made (there's not even an option for graphics at this point of writing, the upgrades and most of the buildings and units don't have explanations for specific ablilites, forcing you to spend on them to find out what they do - you can see descriptions for soldiers only when you first recruit them, so grab a pen and write them down, especially the pay to win ones wityh bonuses against certain units because the AI uses them a lot to make it harder).Tl:dr, its free, and for something free its more fun than most free to play I see, but it'll stop being fun after about 2 days when the bugs start getting to you. Install it if you want, but don't put any money into it, it's not worth it (also when the game asks you to sign up, just exit the pop up, you don't need to unless you want to be able to play that save on another pc or have multiple saves)			"

												Honestly before the 0.3 Update it was fine. Now, no. Firstly, they shrank the size of the map, not just overall but also the individual territories, this makes no sense whatsoever. Yeah sure they said it was too ""allow for easier management of towns"" but that is Bull because it was easy enough as it was. Now it's just too small and everything is increadibly cramped. Secondly, the water is completely screwed to hell. Seriously, I like the fertile land idea, where tiles within 2 of water are considered fertile, that makes complete sense for wheat field, but not for forests. Thanks to the shrunken map I can't even find a ""large"" forest to use the tracking on. Which is also increadibly broken now. FLOODING is out of control, even when a dam is built on a ""Very High"" tile (which is the highest elevation in the game) I have dams breaking left and right and flooding entire territories now. Thirdly, Quarrying. This mechanic was not broken whatsoever in 0.2 but now it is beyond okay. Sure the prospect mechanic was a nice idea but the follow through looks like one guy in a dark room put it together in 2 hours. It's completely worthless. Why? Because it will put it say, next to the water (where you wouldn't dig ever anyways) or in the middle of land that can't be dug because of surrounding terrain. We need to control this not hte AI, give us control of where we dig for things and it will be fine, but as it is, this mechanic is broken beyond all hell.Overall this update (which reset all accounts costing everyone everything) is worthless in reality. The follow through is terrible, the shrunken map is terrible, and the quarrying is terrible. Honestly the update is much like a massive step backwards and I would seriously wait to play this until they either patch these horrible things (the map being too small now, the prospect mechanic being illogical and the flooding) or just waiting for the 0.4 update. This game was a ton of fun to drop in for some time and collect resources, do a few battles and then go off and do something back. It's not fun anymore, thanks for the worst update ever.			"

												Firstly let's talk about the positives:- I love the period, really nice choise, due to the fact that there were a lot of small kingdoms in Britain since the Saxon Invasion;- The art style is amazing, even in the lowest graphics, the game still looks nice and the medium graphics don't consume a lot. The soldiers look amazing and historically accurate, the buildings are cool to gaze at;- I really enjoy the feature of having an ever increasing map where you can build your kingdom the way you like it, aswell as being able to manipulate water, props for that one;- As a Medieval fan, I do enjoy how you start as a small lord commanding only levies and slowly growing your army to more professional units, according to your kingdom development, the idea is there however it's dampered by the ever present and obligatory need to pay. (Point will be developed in the negative aspects);- Finally, I enjoy the battles. They are very simple yet once you get to command a decent size force, you'll be able to see that one wrong move and it could be devastating, making it a more realistic and intense game of chess.Now onto the negative aspects:- I do know this is a Beta, but never have I seen a game forcing you so much to pay-to-win. After the tutorial (which is quite fast due to the bountyful gold you have at your disposal) you start to realize that the game isn't all it's cracked up to be;- I do enjoy the battles as I've previously mentioned but they aren't as large scale as the advert promisses. Allbeit, the game is not ment to be a fully fledged Total War game, however, you are very limited to the quantities of units you can have at your disposal, this could be fixed if a fourth line could engange instead of only three, but looking at the tendency of the game I'm sure if this feature is implemented it'll require for you to pay;- I don't like how you have to wait almost and entire day to do anything productive. Like I said, after the tutorial, the game slows down due to pay-to-win restrictions, however there are some features that can't even be bi-pased with money such as gathering resources through the facilities. I also have to mention that once you are able to withstand the patience of waiting 8h or more to harvest a resource, you only get a tiny tickle of that resource, making the waiting so insufferable;- Once again, the pay-to-win is definatly a must in this game, due to the fact that players tend to have the most fun battling other players, but this game has a hug disadvantage for players that don't really wish to waste that much money or no money at all. If you are like me, who doesn't risk real-life money on games like this, then don't bother playing the Duel feature. Every player I have met had dozens of pay-to-win units. I don't even like how all you can do is just battle the players, you can't even influence or destroy their kingdom or even sack it. All you do is click on search play and one will be provided and you have to hope to the GODS, that you don't face a rich player.- Finally, it seems that the game still needs to be balanced. I noticed a huge difficulty spike when I upgraded the rank of one of my levies to 2. The NPC battles just became mostly unbeatable, maybe I'm just bad but when those Viking 3 ranked units appeared agaisn't my ranked 1 swordmen and rank 2 levies, there was no need to even bet on who would win, so I just stook to Normal and Easy battles just to get a bit of fun out of the game.Veredict:As it stands, Total War Battles: KINGDOM, is a game full of potential for growth and could become a very enjoyable browser game and could attrack casual gamers for a more military historical style game and maybe even convince them and a few others to join the amazing Total War Community. The game is fun at first, but the huge need to pay for gold really makes the player feel bored and outraged with how it shoves in your face how you really need to pay your hard earned cash to build that tavern!If it wasn't for this huge need to pay-to-win and a bit more variety of gameplay instead of just battling the same army over and over again until you level up a few decent levels, then, the game would actually be good, but right now it's still bare-bones, and that is visible in the Multiplayer aspect. Let's hope CA manages to fix all these problems.I give it 4.5/10			"

												""1 friend wants this game:"" ...lol, no, no you don't.   Being 'Free' does not make something immune from criticism. So here we go.   I am a pretty easy person to please and this is actually my first negative review amongst all the other positive reviews i've gone over, so I hope in knowing that this adds just a little more gravity onto how I disliked this ""Game"".   I don't think it is as harsh as some make it out to be but it sure isn't anything special, far from it. Compared to the other Total War Games, this feels even inferior to Medieval Total war 1 which at the time I had a hell of a time playing. If the combat at all is even the slightest related to the other total war games then it is an extremely bland and boring version of it. If my Horsemen are at all in trouble of spearmen why can't I dog pile the rest of my men to help aid the in trouble horsemen from the spearmen? But whats that? I can volley arrows at them and hit my own horsemen too? As realistic as it is my other men standing around with nothing to do either behind the horsemen or next to them can also not engage for a sheer number pile up.   I guess it's entertaining for a few minutes but just gets bland. There isn't any real mechanic or system that makes it fun yet. It's pretty mild through and through and it does an annoying job at giving you offers to spend gold on....probably anything and everything in this game which of course makes it PTW. This is definitely more the speed of IOS. Yes, IOS. It feels more ment for IOS then PC and if you want my honest opinion i'm seriously sick of these PTW long time wait and manangment games which dangle offers of temptation to caress your thigh while they ever so seductively slip their other hand into your pocket and take out your time and wallet.   ""I don't wait for games, Games wait for me."" -It is a known fact video gamers hate waiting to play a game, probably the #1 most annoying things in video games....did you guess it? Loading screens and any means that breaks the player away from the game for amounts of time. If anybody ever says they like waiting on games be it loading screen or timer, it will probably be because between that time they can have a moment to grab a few more potato chips.			"

												First there are invisible(pay) walls everywhere. You need 2 towns to upgrade your first( there is a limit on number of buildings in town). Healing weak units take 10-15min, but for better units this may be a lot more. Best units are only for real money. For a day you can make around 1k coins grinding the battles. Mine or farm need 700 for level 2. Town setup is just for show. Noone is going to atack you, so there is no point in walls or some trategy in using the rivers.Battles are fun at start, but become repetitive super fast, still you will need to grind more and more to upgrade the units you have.  Also AI ( if you can call it that) make stupid mistakes, like sending archers on front line.On mobile (and all wait times lowered by 70-80%) this will be great game, but here is like a good looking shameless money grab.

												I wish it wasent so pay 2 win :/ the game is great in it self and i wouldent mind paying 20$ ish for it. If you invest alot of money in this game youll steamroll everyone in the battlefield. Yes you can get gold but it takes forever to gain just a little gold. You can buy 12000 gold in a instant... getting you special troops , top upgraded armor parts/weapon upgrade, Special perks , and i can continiue....  All the gold i collected so far will only give me 1 of those upgrade to ONE of my normal units.Anyway the game is nice in it self if they removed the buy gold option because... it's WAY over the line even for a f2p game.

												So Total War Battles: KINGDOM is a mobile game that you CAN play on PC.And the mobile game design is integral to this game. Basically this is an incremental base builder.Gather resources, build and upgrade buildings, recruit units and play missions/battles. This gameplay happens over the course of days. Time walls and cooldowns take a lot of time, and the reason for it is...A. To reinforce habitual gaming (rather than binge gaming), so the player keeps coming backB. And to play against the player's patience and need for immediacy, so that they pay real money to get 'gold' and speed up progress.It's important to know games like this aren't made to be games and have fun, they're made to take your money. It's market researched and psychologically tested to get you to spend money.And the game REALLY wants your money, like all games of this type. I quickly hit a wall in which to progress I had to spend perhaps another week gathering the resources in order to upgrade buildings over the courses of more hours so that I can get units that aren't trash and can continue fighting battles fairly.The sad fact is that the game is so close to being fun and interesting, but it's just stuck in a mobile time-sink design.----------Who cares past this line the review is basically over----------I have a theory for as to why Total War is in the title... And that (theory) is that the SEGA publisher is interested in expanding the brand name recognition of Total War which could make the real games sell better.Consider how the Fallout Shelter mobile game is played more than the actual game series of Fallout. ( http://www.ubergizmo.com/2016/02/fallout-shelter-game-sessions-more-than-fallout/ ) mobile games are free, and fun ones will be played by anyone... Like my dad.			"

												Single Player:pay wall, multiplayer: pay to win... is CA just despreat for money or what? the games over view map and all the bulding you can do is pretty good, with changing sessions to mix it up a bit to fell more real, but it is lifeless as in you dont see peasants or merchants traviling on the road or doing work you just log in click a few things and your done but unless you wanna start letting them♥♥♥♥♥♥your wallet you wont get far in both the kingdom bulidng and the battleing both against the AI and against human controlled players unless you pay $15 or $20 but if you go the free 2 play route will your looking at weeks before you can start having fun (if your even still playing). Matchmaking for pvp is abosulty horrible ill be matched against pay to win players who are very high ranked since they payed money. lag and connectiong issues is god awful nothing like spending ""gold"" (the games currency) to heal troops than have connection issues and all your troops are dead ,and the ""charging"" mehcnainc if you do it in pvp  it never atcivates when you tell it too. im very dissapotied to even call this game a total war game becasue it is not a total war game its nothing but a cash grab and i except to see this game die within half a year. Am i against free 2 play games having microtransactions? No, because i know they need to make money but the way their doing in this game is horrible. im not aginst players paying to have ""boosts"" as in they collect more resources faster or gain more XP but being able to pay and have god units or to collect one barrle of wheat for 8 hrs is just so dang stupid, and for all you who are defeanding this game (who are most liekly the pay to win players ofcourse their enjoying this) why put that much money into it when you can just go buy Attlia or SHogun 2 and have waaaay more fun? CA how about you acctually put money into a game that will work and be fun again for every one? instead of putting out this crap trying to take advantage of your fans. CA has one more free to play game coming out that iv been looking foward to for 2 years and thats ARENA, but after seeing how this game turned out im very sacred for arena now :(. I highly recommend no one to play this game its filled with nothing but pay walls and pay to win. As we true total war fans would say, this game is nothing but a...... ""SHAMEFULL DISPLAY""!!!!!!

												If I have the right to give points to this game, I'd give it 5,5/10. I know it is the first day of release and it is possible that a lot of content are going to come in the future, but this phase of development are still filled things that deeply dissatisfies me. Some of the reasons are listed below:1. Too much freemium. 1.a 50% of the units you can train ingame can only be bought (at this moment) by gold, which is the real world currency translation ingame. Albeit these units are beatable, it would took a lot of effort to beat one, especially the cavalry units.1.b To upgrade your units with armors and weapons, you need gold. Sure the first upgrades are purchasable: +2 damage or +2 defense for 18 golds. But +4 damage for 3 times the price? And +6 damage for 8 times the price of the 1st item? Personally I'm not going to think its worth my while.1.c Costumization ain't costumzation at all. First, the original costumization is very, very limited. And guess what could you do to get another color or pattern scheme? 45 golds at minimal. If I'm to unlock all costumization possible, I'd probably able to spare for a meal in a restaurant.1.d Speeding up times; unless you are very patient on your woodcutter and farm, you might want to check this game once every 20 minutes, since it is usually the interval between starting things and things get done. 20 Stones for 1 hour is long enough, 20 silver for 4 hours and you have to collect workers and send them to work in the smith? The quicker way to get money is really just being a problem solver: fighting picts, rebels, and vikings.1.e Your army is too weak to beat up vikings? Don't worry, just with 2 or 3 golds per battle, you can gain support from mercenaries, or buy flaming arrow for the duration of the battle, or hire an old man as your short-time military advisor.2. Landscaping system: your enemy and your friend. With thelandscaping system in place, players are faced with new challenges in city building: floods and height control. Some buildings require landscaping which albeit payable with ingame resources, are quite fussy. There are some restrictions on landscaping which might forces you to destroy and rebuilt buildings quite often. I just visited the forum and found a thread about flooding. If this is true, then you would want to keep watch on the game for flooding, since flooding literally disrupts your army and silver income.3. Complicated building system. As said, you don't only need reaources to build buildings, you need other things you want to consider before building things: leaving enough space for other buildings to connect indirectly to your castle being one example. The other one is how much space would your farms take to maximize your food output or the reach of your woodcutter to maximize your wood output. Or how many houses or slums or mansions you have to build if you want to keep your blacksmiths running smoothly.4. Quests that are ""too demanding"" SPOILER ALERT: DO NOT HUNT ANY DEERS, COLLECT ANY BOULDERS, OR GATHER ANY DEADWOODS YET IF YOU ARE NOT YET LEVEL 10 (or about that level). The quests might look easy, but if you're a type that plays expansively (gather all the resources as soon as possible, etc) this might be quests that are unfinishable, since respawn of such resources took quite a long time if they respawn at all.5. Time. Yes, this has probable been the major complains of everyone: the game time. The battles are too short, the resource gathering took ages. If you've wasted all your resources on a building, getting it back might took hours and the games' pace would be significantly getting slower. A quite difficult battle might last for 3 minutes, while gathering resource took 20. The damage sustained by your units are healable between 18 to 5 minutes, so if you lost a unit in combat, you have to wait for a couple of minutes until it reaches full health, or pay gold. Although the healing are automatic and all units are heals itself directly after an engagement, the time between would leave a gaping hole of doing nothing.6. XP system: The XP system are probably the real reason you want to set throught those 17 minutes of healing your cavalry to get it readey for the next battle, since the more XPs you got, the more you can spend them on your units stats, which makes fights easier and more managable. If you're a military genius who can keep all your units alive at the end of the battle, it might not present as much difficulty, but if you're just a casual player, be careful since the drill is real. Although the enemies catch up to you (so the difficulty keeps increasing) the XP does not. After beating an easy battle with all your units surviving, you might get at most 9 XP points. In chalenging battles you might get 12 or more. If you want to add 3 more soldiers into your unit, you need 250 XP. which means getting more than 20 chalenging battles done with all units intact. Add waiting time to the equation and you get about half a day of grinding before you can add 3 more soldiers into your unit. I guess that's all of my complaints for now at this game. Besides the almost unbearably slow speed of this definitely freemium game, I feared that if the development team keeps up with this kind of freemium-style gameplay, things would crumble pretty quickly, and I would personally avoid PVP since playing PVP in this game would seem to be a long stretch for your regular ol'gamer. Yes the design and how the battle works are actually quite good, but with the system currently in place, I'd say you'd rather save your money for other games instead of putting it in this game, maybe on rome or shogun II, or other titles you might like, and generally, stay away from this game for the time being.

												I wanna write this review because the game seems to have been deeply misunderstood, mainly due to the fact that mobile gamers are a different breed than pc/console gamers.TOWN BUILDING:For what it is (a mobile strategy game) it does an excellent job. The town management part gives more freedom than any other mobile strategy game i have ever seen. Instead of building the same pre defined slot-based setup town, you have a hex map on which you can do whatver you want and get any sort of layout you want. As you play you unlock more build space and get to build more towns and you can do stuff like dedicate a certain town to a certain type of production or unit etc.COMBAT:Combat is a Total war-ized version of a deck building game, in which armies advance toward each other, time during which you get to fire away some skills and some slight maneouvering. The more you advance in the game, the more control you get over the army. Again, for a mobile game, the quality is amazing. Animations are top notch (i would even go as far as to say that at times they are more fluid than actual TW games) and I find the mechanics to be exactly what the mobile platform supports.It's a mobile game. Commanding actual TW armies in the way TW games work would be a mess. Scrolling, flanking, skills, all that would be a mess in the classic sense, I feel what they got here is the best streamlined version they could think of and for me it feels great.OVERALL FEEL / UIThe game feels good, it feels like a quality product. You're not bombarded by ads, you're not bombarded by notifications and it doesn't feel like a chore. Compare this to Clash of clans which ends up feeling like a chore and a stress factor (is my village ok? have I been sieged? I need to collect my resources!). This is not like that. Animations are great, artwork is great, textures are great, UI looks great. No glossy bs, no flashing buttons, no ""SPECIAL OFFER!!!! CLICK HERE!!!!"" anywhere"". The real currency tab is called ""Trade"". That's itMICROTRANSACTIONS:Yes, they exist, they're in the game, but since you did not pay for the game, it's normal. Whoever is distraught by microtransactions clearly hasn't played a mobile game before. They're common place. IT'S A MOBILE GAME!Yes, for the last time, it's not a PC game. It's a PC edition of a mobile game. These games are persistent. When you close them, they still run on a server, so the PC version provides another client from which you can access the game. It's not supposed to be the next Total War, it's not supposed to be Medieval TW portable. It's a spin-off. Enjoy it for what it is, look around the app stores for strategy games and you'll clearly realize it's one of the best mobile gaming has to offer as far as strategy games go.If you're looking for a TW spin-off or a solid mobile strategy game, go for it, it's one of the best. If you're looking for a portable classic TW game look away, it's not this, not yet.NOTE: Ignore my steam game time, i've been playing on iOS			"

												For a free to play game its not too bad, the real downside of it is how slow progression is without using its pay to play features, and as pointed out you dont have to pay to play, but as an example I have been playing for over 6 days now, and still have not been able to gain enough stone/silver to upgrade the castle to its second level.Perhaps reading some build guides might have helped, but it is just such a slow moving game and because of that there is very little enjoyment when you consider you can buy some excellent games in the total war series for around £5/$7overall opinion decent freebie but far to slow moving, id recommend other enjoyable games like Grepolis which although very time consuming offer far more involvement and enjoyment but that was ruined too by premium focus and pay to win features which ruined the original Grepo.1 builds.This game is fine if you just want to log into it once or twice a day for a few mins to collect your resources, but as far as entertaining its just too slow going, unless once your kingdom is capable of producing the resource counts on a faster scale at higher levels it wont hold anybodys attention for the long haul. in my opinion.

												(THIS REVIEW WAS WRITTEN AT THE TIME OF BETA TESTING)Someone else put it perfectly; ""Why would I play a mobile game on my PC?""I'm not entirely sure what I expected from this to begin with, but man it's disappointing. Coming from the rich gameplay of Medieval II, Empire, Napoleon, Shogun 2 and more recently the phenominal Rome II to this is just.......... sad.It wouldn't be fair of me to say that it's terrible without say that there are people who enjoy this type of hexagon play. But I find it childish. Right down to the battles. I feel like I'm playing some free web browser game with minimal funding. This isn't Total War, and to call it so is an insult to a great franchise.Leave this garbage to civilization. Go back to the quality of previous Total War games.And to those leaving ""Good reviews"", come on. A 3 year old can make an awesome stick figure, and yeah, you'll tell him it's good because you want to be nice, right? This is♥♥♥♥♥♥ and if you appease them in your fanboy style they'll continue to make♥♥♥♥♥♥ -_-			"

												I like idea of terraforming and building your kingdom, and changing of seasons , but that waiting on all so long spoils all fun, or you must pay to get past waiting. It would be great game, but if you are not ready to spend fortune on it, it can be played only once or twice per day. You just log in, gather resources, do what you can and log out and that way it falls to level of some farming facebook game. It becomes boring after some time.			"

												Ok... today is  the last straw on this game. Laggy battle-commands (playing on a PC), increments so slight for such high experience costs making improving units entirely too much of a chore for practically no reward, ridiculous increase in difficulty as soon as you upgrade a single unit, making the easy/challenging/insane identifiers pointless (and making the expenditure of gold during combat a necessity rather than a perk), inability to dismiss workers without demolishing the entire building, inability to retain workers if you need to move a building, inability to log on to the server for entire days without so much as an acknowledgement, let alone explanation or apology and finally, this little gem of a bug today, where my entire map loses water because it wont flow from the sources, cutting off all my wheat fields hours before winter is supposed to hit.I seriously expected better from a Total War title. DONT spend money on this... I wholeheartedly regret spending what little I did.			"

												PLAY NOW FOR FREE... BULL$HIT! Pay to play/win/progress waste of time. Build a farm, no problem, wait 4 hours for the fields to come in or spend 1 gold (for each field) to speed it along.  Running low on food and you need to harvest everything at once? Wait 8 hours or spend 5 gold to speed it along! The resource cost to build something is so inflated in comparison to how much you can collect per node of resource it will take you hours if not days to collect enough to build anything. This forces you to spend/purchase gold to move the game along. Only play this if you have a lot of time to waste or money to burn.			"

Although not as large it is a more  flexible game it is there when you need it and can be left untouched for months on end.			"

												First of all : this is not a Total War game ! This is a medieval city-builder with some battles elements, designed for phones. If you're looking for a total war skip this and go play total war arena instead.Does it make it a bad game ? No. Well. Depends what you're looking for.Pros- Nice atmosphere. Immersive and relaxing.- Fun city and terrain management. Nothing complicated.- Batte system is great once you understand how it works.- Not P2W, but....Cons- Takes forever to get gold by playing. If you are duelling other players you'll be at a disadvantage until you get a good economy.- If you want things done fast... don't play.- If you want a deep total war battle system or campaign, don't- if you want deep city management, don'tTo sum it up : if you want a relaxing little game where you build cities and battle, then it's good.

												Played this 30 minutes, just long enough to do 4 battles and confirm my thoughts on the game.Normally I would spend more time before reviewing a game, but unless this game is secretly frog fractions later on(spoiler: its not) then I have no more content I need to know how I feel about this game.It is like a clash of clansy game where it has a building your city bit and a battles bit. I did not even get far enough to see if it is pay to win, looking at it, doesn't look pay to win but heck even if it was- its like saying Daikatana is pay to win. Oh nooooooo!!Cities:Honestly I don't care how good this is. Maybe it is good I don't know.What this game has to hold it up would be good battles.Battles:Really game? '3 lanes' with nearly turn based combat that is clearly made to be played on a tablet/phone? You put your little dudes in the right lane setups and then use rock paper scissors style combat with minimal input(click on your dudes at the right time to charge! Use a taunt on those archers!).Maybe if you like timegated games with turn based combat this could be fun. As someone who likes total war games this is not for me.

 < go play some actual total warSure this could be a decent game for your phone. I don't know that. As it is on my pc as a 1.6GB download, I get to compare it to things like:-League of legends-Cities Skylines/any other total war game-World of Tanks-Age of Empires Online-Any facebook game-Cookie ClickerAs such this game focuses on being lite strategy and a little building expansion game. If i want lite strategy there are a bunch of strategy lite F2P games on steam that do not feel the need to cripple the player behind timewalls.This is the steam store page not the apple store page.

+  easy to learn but rewarding battle system  season cycle that strongly affects your actions  no 'lead by the hand' tutorial - good UI/UX is enough!  great graphics (comparing to similar - but browser - games like Anno Online or Settlers Online)  terraforming  will be perfect on tablets  PTW? - amount of gold you can earn in game is OK, you can craft things you cannot afford to buy. If you are patient, gold is not needed. :)-  small interaction with other players  naming this game like ones from tactical(!) total war serie brings much negative reviews ;)  hard to find opponent at higher levels  a bit monotonous if you have big kingdomThings to fix/improve/balance  dam fulfilling too hard (not needed feature) - it's easier to wait for winter  actual ridings tab in bottom-right menu needed  beasts should be placed in tracking range  cattle farms not so useful as sheeps (not needed feature)  better UI for trading needed (add f.e. 10, 100, 1000 unit buttons)  training peasants (not needed feature) - it's easy to have enough craftsmen  too small rewards from tracking  stupid experience (crown) rewards at 60 lvl  it will be great to see your buildings slowly rises like in old Settlers or Knights and Merchants  crafting should be more explained "

												TL;DR: Some game breaking bugs and too much P2W advantage kills any good things this game has.Not as bad as some reviews said if you are used to play those web games to fill up fragmented time. But ther is too much P2W feeling since the game is designed to force you to either spend some money or wait for days for somewhat higher end stuff. I can see CA put in some good efforts in the game, like having seasonal changes and stuff. However, the gameplay just falls short of expectation due to the p2w factors being too stronk.For a F2P game like this, it is much better not to be so blunt about microtransactions while providing some gameplay with more depth and fun factors. I would rather spend 100 bucks on Kancolle than this thing.Also, BUGS! I constantly getting d/c when trying to do a battle quest. and when I logged back, it just locks my army saying that it is in a duel for hours. WTF?!!!1			"

												This game started out fun, but it's bogging down for me.  There isn't enough instruction in the tutorial on how to play, e.g., where to set up quarries.  There seems to be no way to determine where to build them.  It's not like setting up lumber camps (next to trees, of course), or farms (near fertile land).  But quarries?  Do I build them on high, medium, or low terrain?  I've tried them all and it's a crap shoot on finding stone.  It's frustrating to build a quarry, prospect, and dig only to find nothing and be told ""the area isn't suitable for prospecting!""  So then, where?    With the battles and my troops, I've reached the point where I almost HAVE to spend my gold to win battles and progress.  Either that or get defeated over and over again, only to get a few experience points and gradually upgrade my troops over an eternity.  I play games to relax and have fun, and take my mind off problems.  It's not fun to have my patience tested to the limit.  I don't mind paying for my fun, but having to choose between buying gold and endless work and waiting on a game just discourages me from continuing.  I'm just about done with this game.			"

												A good concept, but hampered by its Free-to-Play model. The Good:I love the art style, and the music is passable. The hexagon-based simple city building has promise. I like the variation of the seasons, and that they actually have gameplay effects. I like how terrain, especially access to water, affects resource gathering. I like how terrain will change—grass will spread, trees will regrow. Combat is simple, but fun. A good mix of units, and there is room for effective tactics (and not just spamming orders buttons) to change the outcome of a battle.The Bad:I do not like the running-clock mechanism; it makes the game feel like FarmVille or other FtP “FaceBook games.” Construction takes no appreciable time at all, but gathering resources hours or even days without forking over cash for in-game currency. Some of these times work (e.g. about 20 minutes to fully refresh an army after a defeat or pyric victory), others don’t (hours of quarrying for a measly 20 stone). So, really, what I don’t like is that it is free-to-play.The Ugly:I think if they had kept the core of the game (the map, the combat model, terrain modification, hex-based town construction, seasonal variation), but instead reworked it as a stand-a-lone game WITHOUT the FtP model and constantly running clock, this could have been a solid “midrange” or “light” game. If seasons were “turns,” and certain things (planting, harvesting, etc.) could only be done during particular seasons, the game would be much more enjoyable to just sit an play—instead play for about an hour or less then log out and come back in 12 hours or so. Such a game would necessitate a complete reworking of the way resources were handled, but a price-point of $30-40 would have made such a game a must-buy for me. As it is, I’ll fiddle until I get bored of the grind, then shelve it—and they likely won’t have made any money off of me.			"

												Before I start I just want to say that I grew up on Total War games starting at Shogun. Being a diehard strategy fan, the series rubbed me in all the right spots. Unfortunately this one is a blemish on CA and the series. I understand that it may get better and that it’s still in development but oi vay. Anyway on to my review, the good points are that this game has a fun geo terrain aspect to it in which you can alter terrain to move water and rivers around. This can be fun and challenging at times as during flooding season your whole city can be flooded if you don’t know what you’re doing. I also enjoyed the tile aspect of buildings in which you can get different bonuses depending on how you pair up buildings and where you place them. The battles are scaled down obviously as this is aimed for tablet and phone platform. This kills strategy completely as battles come down to how upgraded your troops are and what gear you have purchased or smithed for them. Early on the only way to get good gear is to spend real cash on it, this gear will open up and be possible to craft later on in the game but you have to make it far to be able to do that. This makes the early phases very pay 2 win as you will struggle against even AI w/o gear. And dont get me started on other players, I didnt even mess with PvP after a few tries as the 5 people I tried fighting completly demolished me because all their troops were high end and fully maxed on gear where as I did not spend money and decided to get ther gear the hard way. The other aspect of battles is the charge mechanic in which you dictate when your squad charges the enemy. Your troops slowly start moving toward one another and if you time it right and click on the squad at the right time to charge you can get a damage bonus. This is very basic and has no strategy to it, to me the total war series was all about the battle mechanics. Now I know you can’t make a massive battle game work for touch screen but I feel they could have put more effort into it and included other detail. I do still want to see how it plays on my touch device though. The other downside is the ridiculous wait times to gather resources such as 8 hours for some (which has been mentioned before). I feel as though this game is aimed to take your money and nothing more, hopefully they improve it as it stand now this game was made to take your green paper with little to none fun compensation. For now, I am giving this one a thumbs down.			"

												I've seen a lot of bad reviews of this game from people approaching it as a pc game, This is not a pc game, it is a mobile game you can play on your pc. Taken from this perspective, I find it to be a very enjoyable game. I started playing it on my phone for a week before downloading it and it only improved the experience. I can't tell if there is more detail or I can just see more detail but it adds to the enjoyment, and battles are easier to manage. I found this game while looking for something new to try on my phone for free. I ended up downloading it on my pc because it was so enjoyable.Despite what others say, it is not a pay to win game. Duels are the only competative aspect and while your opponent may choose to spend money in order to gain special troops, the advantage this conveys is countered by proper troop placement or some extra xp upgrades. There is always a chance to be outmatched in a duel but they aren't crucial to progress in the game. If duels seem unfair, winning a few single player battles will bring up the level, quality, and number of your own troops to give you better chances in multiplayer battles.  The other big complaint I've seen is the timed construction aspect. Once again, this is a mobile game you can play on your pc, not a pc game. The appeal to this is that you can play on your phone or tablet when you are away from home and play the same game from the same point at home. TLDR : It's a mobile game you can play on your pc; set your expectations accordingly and you won't be disappointed.			"

												I have been a big fan of the TW series for many years now and I can say for sure that this game has very little to do with the other games.It’s a very standard “browser” type game, that you can’t play in a browser, it’s similar to the Stronghold online game but a bit worse.Possitive: interesting fighting mechanicsNeggative: you can’t enjoy this game if you don’t invest a lot of money, examples:-either you pay 4 gold or wait 8 hours for 10 food from a crop (now consider you need 150 food a barrack)-people who will pay get acces to much better units, sure you can get a free unit but you will loose your duels no matter the strategy-everything in this game screams give us money I don’t think that CA understood how the the free games market works, and I am sorry for that. I would be willing to make purchases in game, but everything should be the same in terms of chances for everyone.1/10			"

												Though the game may seem decent at first with it's ok sort of graphics, the result of this thing comes out as an aborted child left to roam the earth. The game has about 1 million timers with things such as ""8 hours to harvest wheat"", and ""8 hours to chop down forest"" followed by ""5 hours to mine"". The paywalls in this game are insane and they happen WITHING THE FIRST 10-15 MINUTES OF THE GAME. The game's ""battles"" from ""Total War"" BATTLES is laughable. You can BARELY control any of the units for♥♥♥♥♥♥ This ""game"" is made only for the purpose of milking the total war franchise EVEN MORE than what it's already being milked for. SEGA, I'm telling this straight to your face and I hope you get a chance to read this. Please, stop abusing this franchise that we know and love			"

Challenges for rewards are way underrated, (in terms of XP payout), benefits don't justify the means, (in terms of what upgrades cost), the AI cheats during battle, and the game dynamics are skewed just in the right places to get you to spend money.

												I have played this game just for few hours and haven´t even tried all the features, but I would like to share my opinion anyway. In general, the game could be cool, but from my point of view it needs a lot of polishing and maybe some mechanisms should be changed completely.Let´s start with concept of time. Personally I hate when you are gathering resources by clicking on them and these are not flowing automatically into your storage over time. Different resources people included have various time of ""spawn"", so you are forced to enter the game relatively often. The same thing is with battles. You fight, you win BUT when your units get hurt, you must wait until they will be allright, which can take some time and since you have nothing to do in between, you switch off and then on again to fight another battle. Once I was entering the game every 15 minutes just to fight. You can have more units and switch the healthy ones with the hurt ones but this is just a lot of senseless clicking for me. So you must be online a lot. I suppose people have life and who would like to check his online kingdom fifty times a day, right.Of course this all is so annoying in order to make people use the gold and make the game profitable for the creators. I understand making game is not a cheap adventure but this microtransaction thing should have been made differently. Instead of pushing people into using gold a lot, some real added value related to the game should be offered like special statistics, real bonus features (these what we see now should be mostly free to have things, I was badly surprised when I saw some units may be only purchased by gold!!!) and other stuff. Players could gain increase of production or whatever, but none of it should leave the impression of pathetic need for player´s money. The gold is present like EVERYWHERE which doesn´t make a good impression.I would still not call the game Pay to win, but Pay to make it playable.And the last thing I wanted to talk about, the battles. When you realize it is only rock paper scissors concept, it takes all the fun out of it. Not even two units of pikemen defeated one unit of swordsmen. Also you really can not swith unit´s places, just at the beginning of the batlle, after that, no chance. I know I know, there are these abilities and everything but I still have a feeling that you either win easily or lose ""easily"" depending only on what the deployment of armies at the beginning was.I was really looking forward to this game, try to give it more time so that I would see all the things, but honestly some things should be changed. So I am giving NO recommendation for now.Btw If anyone knows how to make forest grow or whatever, I would be gratefull, maybe level 2 woodcutter plants them? Slowly all the forests are disappearing from my country and I dont know what to do with it. :D			"

												If you like Total War games do not even bother with this. This is a phone still pay to win game in the same style as clash of clans except much longer wait times for resources and a terrible battle system where your units are killed by their clone enemies like wheat before a scythe.Might be worth the uselessness when on the phone but unless you want to spend money on a ""Free to Play"" game then youre gonna be stuck with the most basic units just scratching to get by			"

												Pff plays way too much of ""pay to actually play the game"" ... I wouldn't have mind playing a pay2win game, but this is pay2play. It takes forever to actually ""play"" the game. It seems this game can be good, it just need to tweak its gameplay. As there isn't a lot of gameplay... Unless you can wait. for a few days. (to think, most games usually have an ""easy"" beginning) I rather pay for a subscription, than this whatever this is. Fans of the total war series should stay away from this game. You do not want to mess up your experience with Total war. They need to change the gameplay if they want paying customers...			"

												As with most other Total War Battle games, everything takes 3 years to get done. By 3 years I mean, if you actually want to enjoy the game it will take you several months to actually enjoy it. Good luck doing anything without spending actual money on it. While there are ways to unlock and play the game without spending money, you are forced into dueling with other players, the problem being, you are completely over matched by anyone who has spent money on extra gold. TL;DR Would not recommend to anyone who doesn't have a TON of time to devote solely to waiting on ridiculously long cooldowns.			"

												**This is a global a launch review**Whoever planned this game, stop, return money to people who lost it, stick this deep into greenlight and let it root there. Then play about just one year of this game, across all titles, and really think about a new name. Total War: Heaxgon Grind Madness Campaign Pack Ever Moneythirst DLC.It's wrong in every damn way. I don't care the game is p2w, thats not the problem, it's just CA testing how much can they abuse on this name in the name of profit. The big challenge here, it's to fit hexagonal buildings that they get the most of proximity bonus, in a map flooding with water. Battle mechanic's isn even worth mentioning.U will see urself not even able to create a flag if u dont get into it some good amount of money, for a color, and it feels so grindy, DAMN CA! im playing X-COM:EW and other good games really smooth on my tablet, its not a bad ideia, but it's so messed up.  Sad seeing a big company, with a big feedback do this. 2/10 for clean interface, but would give it a 3 if it was called CLASH OF TYRANTS, or EMPIRE WARS at App Store.thisthisthisthis.... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!Check this:-FEATURES1-Build and expand your Kingdom, with farms, quarries, blacksmiths and more. Nope. understand it more like, 1 unit = 1 building, chain it right, grind it a lot. Building and planning a kingdom it's not about that as i will say in the last FEATURE you are announcing. 2-Alter the land by creating rivers, lakes and mountains.Spam blockades, with a really messed up sistem, just to try to make your farm safe, and watch a strange mechanic block you everywhere until you build more.3-Command your army in large-scale battles.Hav nothing to say about this, u just set up ur army and click to charge making the time right. But if you buy a reinforcement, like more infantary damage, there may be no army to balance you. Didn't got it to multiplayer, but really would kill myself trying to build farms, blacksmiths and more. 4-Battle other players in real-time.Not a big deal, really dont wanna see 9x9 battles about who spent the most on his units and click on charge, and you may find urself just rolling spear and horse in a 3 man line.5-Cross-Platform - Play on Phones, Tablet and PC, whenever you want, wherever you want.This is positive, crossing plataforms it's a good ideia, but there are big AAA games on Steam, that migrated smoothly to Tablet's, and look amazing, they kick♥♥♥♥♥ cause App Store it's harrasing youth with this feeding money sistem. Show that it is possible, to make a good game that it's more fun than the expectation of being good some day, but they never stop uptading and time get's bigger. 6-Actions in your Kingdom will carry over onto any device you play on.Nice, dont think that's what i'm reaally looking on a game presented by.............. 7-From the creators of the award-winning Total War™ games.And this single sentence gave me shame on read, i hav almost all games from this AAA, even bought some twice. Just bought the first Rome, because it is a good game! No matter how old, people are still playing big masterpieces there, about WAR, not cities, when you say this are large scale army battles, kingdom's (MTW2:K it's the franchise biggest, work, with only 4 DLC's, it's still more playable and even more enjoyable than Rome 2) and there's is potential when you say.. from the creator's of this franchise..Don't believe it anymore, not buying this talk once again, won't buy TW: Warhammer in a pre order, to be waiting on MOD's that fix little issues that you receive a feedback. PLEASE, don't turn your games the way award winning franchises are. Lot's of money, lot's of graphic's, no game immersion. Only problems, that I can fix doing research on forums (who the ♥♥♥♥ need to fix his TCP entry to play a MP award winning franchise, common..  and please  change the concept of this game or it's name!Put 200 hours of gameplay into ARENA, some money as well, and saw a good concept. That's a good concept, and a good presentation, on an Alpha stage, i had an amazing time, can't wait to see with all u collected from the feedback. Expectation's with your company it's always good, and when something reeeeally good as AoC make you look serious, i'm just really happy that you called that a DLC and showed what is a good DLC. Then you should really name it as an expansion.************************************************************************************************************************************			"

												It's free and nice to do during study. Ofcourse it is pay to win as in you can pay to get a headstart or you need to throw hundreds of bucks at this game and then you are really paying to win. The majority won't do that so its fine. You can create your own city and change the landscape which is really cool. You can battle other players with a matchmaking system that is pretty fast. Do single player, chain battles or a campaign. It keeps me entertained which is pretty much what I want from a game. However that you can battle every 5 min indefinetely tends to favour the active person vs the login once, twice a day people which i think is a mistake. The health of the unit card should drop x from a lost fight and less from winning and this enables you fight 5 to 15 fights depending on if you win or lose and by how much.			"

												A fun, easily understandable game format.The strategic part is about developing your land. You place buildings in hexes.The tricky part is that some knowledge of river dams and river bank management is needed to avoid catastrophic land management decisions. Flooding can be such a pain as everything is destroyed and it takes ages to restore.The combat part is arcade like with units moving in 3 lanes and with a maximum of 3 stacks. The fun is hitting the unit to make it charge just at the right moment.Warning: Rome isn't built in one day and in this game, certain things take a day to complete so be prepared to do something, shut down and come back to it the next day.

												Ok now first. This is NOT your typical TW game. It's a time managment game. I repeat TIME MANAGMENT.It takes around 5-10 days before you can do anything concrete. DAYS. I have spent gold, but i did not buy it. I've played the game now for around 40 hours all together and maybe 30min at one time. This is a game you come in, do so clicks go away play something else and then come back when you remeber you have it. The problem is, this is basicaly a mobile to pc port. Mobile gamers are used to this kind of play and once you accept the game as a mobile game / browser game it does make sense and it's far deeper than you would think since water and terraforming are much more important than it first apears. Example. A farm crop tile next to water growth time is around 5 hours. The same tile 2 hexagones away from water 22hours growth time... See what I mean. Time managment. It's a very slow game with much deeeper mechanics than they appear.READ THE GUIDES and you will have a nice time with this game. Don't do that and you will get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and throw it way...			"

UPDATE 0.33 BROKE THE GAME SO IT IS NOW UNPLAYABLEThis isn't the Total War I know and love! Downvoted! Rawr, rawr, rawr!I never played the Total War games so I don't have to contend with the usual ""I love this franchaise, lets watch it get disemboweled"", but having played this game I would like to play more TW games. This game is almost the usual free to play fare in that you have a city to build and it has timers. If you have played ANY free to play game then you know the deal.What I like about TWB:K is that, get this, you don't recruit peasants and then turn them into soldiers! You build a barracks and BAM you get troops. Troops also don't die?! Is this even a free-to-play game!? Instead they go on a cooldown/respawn timer.This means you can fight and fight as much as you want. Yes you read that correctly, no stamina system! This game does so many things right compared to its competitors thats its almost a full fledged game in its own right. If the town didn't have cooldown timers for building things, you would be forgiven for thinking it was a full free game like Relic Hunters.The downvotes and negative reviews this game has do make sense however because had this game been called, Flower Patch Kingdoms it would probably have had a lot of good reviews, but as it stands, it is not a Total War game in almost any sense of the word so for people who play Total War games you really want to avoid this game.For everyone else, this game is fun, I recommend it. With, however, a huge 'Cavet Emptor'.This game is balanced, very balanced infact oddly too balanced infact. You can't pay for an advantage, which I like, always a fan of that but what makes this game so 'oddly balanced' is that each troop has about 3 counters to it so their is no 'best unit'. This is fine for PvP and tough skirmishes, but when you are grinding mooks for resources you can't take a break and just hammer out fights for resources. Every fight demands your full attention because one wrong move, wrong match up, wrong ability used at the wrong time, failure to charge, you get the idea. The battles are busy so grinding in itself becomes something you need to mentally take a break from. A real life stamina system as it were.That doesn't mean the game is bad, but who is the target audience? People like me who are new to TW? Or casual gamers, whom this free2play market is usually targetted at?If you ever wanted to get into the Total War series then this is the game for you. If you are a casual gamer, give it a try as it costs you nothing anyway and you might enjoy it. If you are a Total War veteran, download it so you can downvote it You know you want too.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												So Total War Battles: KINGDOM is finaly here but what does this really mean. In the last year or so we have seen so many of these games, mine resources and anothers base. However never have we seen something like this on this scale, on PC. This mix of continuous world strategy and good old real time strategy battles seems to work quite well, however some of those battles can get a little confusing. Issues such as markability and platform prefrencing are big issuse CA is going to have to think about. One of my biggest issues with this game is the realism scenario, does CA really expect me to sit at my computer for 30-60 mins playing a game like this, its not the sort of game you do that with. I dont know about you but I dont really feel like sitting at my PC waiting 30 mins for something to be collected.Now dont get me wrong there are a lot of good features about this game and I thought battles would be one of them, I wouldnt say I was wrong they do have some fun parts to them, like seeing those little guys dance for victory or the dead corpses for lose. But one of the battles most basic mechanics have been totaly screwed up, 'charges' more like a nice walk in the park unless the person controling you is sliding his mouse across his desk back and forth like a maniac. Look I seriously think that this could work on an iPad or Tablet but seriously a PC?I think there are large chunks of this game that are really purpose built for iPad's and or Tablets. Overall I wouldnt say its a bad game, because its not but there is still a lot of improvements to be done before I will consider calling it a polished game. I know lots of you die hard fans will disagree with me but that the point of a review, me giving my opinion. And there it is!TheMooseConqueror (Aiden)			"

												At first I thought it was a Total War game similar to Rome, Medieval, Empire and Shogun just to name a few in the series and the title of the game was responsible for that.  (Quite misleading) The game was very different and quite intriguing at first and was entertaining. I liked the little battles and the style that was used. I also very much liked the land management and kingdom building side to it. Overall and after quite a considerable time playing it I have found it to be full of a wide range of bugs and also the battle mechanics although I will say after some updates it has been improved. But not vastly. I found it really monotonous and repetitive which was quite dulling on the allure of the game and experience. From my personal view and opinion I would not recommend this game and for that reason and many others it gets a thumbs down. I will say that if problems are addressed and resolved with a lot of improvements then it has the potential to be a entertaining game. However there was enough reasons to put me off this game and therefore I won't be continuing it for the forseeable future.			"

												This game has nothing in common with the TotalWar series, except the name. It's just a typical PayToWin game. In this ""game"" you must wait few hours to get some resources or pay with gold to get them immediately. On a PC it's completely unacceptable.Do not even download this. It's not worth your time.			"

												I have to say, this is something I thought I would never have to say about a Total War game. There is only one word I can say to truly describe this game; disappointment,  I have bought and played nearly every Total War game and loved each one. This is just ridicuous. Basically a ""pay-to-win"" app store game. For instance the one review, that I personally liked, described how to build a farm takes 8 seconds. Then to grow wheat it takes 8 hours. But all you have to do is use gold to finish instantly. Do not get this game. And to Creative Assembly; Do not ruin your legacy. If you do this, you will without a doubt lose everything great that you have worked on for so many years.			"

												this game is free so no matter what you should try it out but here is some stuff on why it's badTotal War Battles: KINGDOM is not a total war game and if you like a kingdom builder with some ok combat then it's an ok game. no matter what people tell you though its pay to win 100%. yes you can craft late game units but 1. it is so expensive that until super late game it is not worth spending 10s of thousands on 1 unit 2. by the time its super late game probably you don""t want to play anymore. you can use GOLD the in-game money grabber to buy these units, you can use GOLD to buy special power ups in battles and you can use gold to speed processes like mining chopping farming with gold. If you have Hearthstone its a lot like that. you can still have fun buy without spending money to buy cards it's absolutely gives you an unfair setting with the people who pay.oh yeah dont mess with your kingdom as you CANNOT restart			"

												I have played many total war games. I think that this is a good game in its own right, however I don't see it fitting in with the total war  series. I think it should have been it's own ip, however it is still fun. I understand it is pay to win but I enjoy a game to go play every few hours for like 15 minutes and have mindless fun doing things like missions. I think is ok overall, and if you try to not spend money then you don't have to.			"

												Honest review from a PC and Moblie gamer. I often have to work late and have long periods of time where I have to kill free time. Since acquring the Iphone 6 Plus, I've started playing games like Clash of Clans, COD heros and other forms of mobile games. Games that you can have quick action, such as couple of battles... then attend to resources and or upgrade buildings if need too. Saying that takes 10 minutes, then you are done, recieved a fix and move one. That's what a standard mobile game has become, that's what people do with mobile games. Play with it until something else comes up, and you come back to it in 15 minutes or 10 hours. Which total war kingdom follows that same pattern. The PC master race me, wants the climb to the tallest building AND SCREAM LIKE F*CKING INSANE PERSON at everybody! This is simply not a pc game, NOBODY WANTS TO WAIT for construction for 8 hours, PC games aren't a pick up and stop games like mobile games. This game has no right to be called a pc game and should have never launched for the pc. When I play total war on the pc, I want hard throbbing, none stop action like a chick in a gangbang. This pc version, fall quite short of that. Then again, I am looking forward to it on my Iphone 6 plus though.			"

												The Total War series is epic and then......poo.  I think that Sega ate something bad in order to produce this pile.  From the washed out colors to the lane based fighting,  the game really just rains all over the Total War series.  Instea of sweet flanking moves your stuck with lane based fighting.  Instead of huge expansive fighting maps, your stuck with tiny maps that just barely fill a 1080p screen.  Oh the graphics btw, their washed out.  Really really washed out. I mean they took the most awful pastels they could find and used those for this game.  Also, where the hell are the options?  OH, I see, the game was designed for mobile apps and then uploaded on steam. Hmm, where does it say that it's a mobile app, oh thats right it doesn't.  Also, wtf is up with these time based buildings. Want some wheat? Want some ore? Yup mine it, and uh oh, it's going to take 18 minutes for that to happen.  Ofcourse you can spend gold to speed that process up.  Hmm sounds like some other cash grab games.  Oh those resources you just sped up, you gotta manually pick them up.  What a complete pile of poo. Sega should have given us a good version of Total War.  Hell I love the series and would have paid premium  prices for it. Instead we are left with........bleh....			"

												FirFirst off it is not a bad game it just needs to change somethings. It started off fun for the first few hours as I was learning how to play and changing the landscape to maximize the best outcome for my resources. They did a really good job on that and there are some pretty cool late/end game builds for maximizing resource outcome (if only you’ll make it that far). The line battling has nothing that isn’t already in other games like this so if that’s all you’re here for then move along. Now I’ll talk about some of the things that need to change are the use of gold (real money) to progress your army. When you build your second barracks, archery range, stable, knight manor, etc you will be able to choose a new unit and this is where the game becomes frustrating. The game offers you the ability to buy the unit with gold which isn’t a problem all f2p games do stuff like this the problem is the need for those troops in order to progress in the campaign and regular missions. You are also able to acquire them from crafting them at level 21 but the resources to craft them takes days to get and all you will get is one unit for what is a weeks plus of work IF you are constantly checking up and gathering you resources. Also the PvP battles are unbalanced because of the gold (p2p) system. At the start of each battle you are offered the choice to spend a little gold to buff yourself in one way or another. You are also able to craft one of those one time buffs but if you do you are going in a negative direction of getting new troops that you will need. But aside from that I found I was being matched with players who clearly had paid for their troops because of the level they were at. I understand there will be people who do that but the problem is the fights had not been balanced and I was somehow expected to defeat an opponent who had better versions of my entire army. At the end of the day it has fun city builder/land transformation tools but the battles and PvP need to be reworked.			"

												This is a definite NO. I have been playing TW since the beginning. I downloaded and tested this game, and also bought a basic pack of gold to see, how far can I get with that. It is ridiculous. It is not only, that its a pay2win game, but it is almost impossible to do any advance (unless you spend hours every day for several months). In addition it is a terribly balanced game even with some gold. - The more effective units (knights, trebuchets etc.) can be only ""crafted"" with horrendous amount of resources or large pack of gold. - For example: a kinght with batlle axe costs 410 gold. At the merchant guild you can get 500 gold for 5 EUROS (REAL MONEY). So, practically even with playing the PAY version, the exchanges are RIDICULOUS. One knight with battle axe for 5 euros in a virtual game? COME ON!!!  The TW guys really went insane.- Unfortunately lots of people tries and pays until they realize that to complete the game would require so much time and money that no game would deserve that, especially not this one.- This is just the business part. I could write more about that the battles are jokes compared to previous TWs, nothing close to that. It is a pitty, because the game as a tap-and-play tablet game would be ok in terms of graphics and idea. This game is nothing more than a resource draining venture of the evil cigarette smoking Grey Gentlemen from MOMO, COMPLETE waste of time and money.  "

												For a free game I think its fun, I was having a great time playing. I was getting ready to build my 3rd castle when the game lost my progress i would say on a scale of 1-10 I give it a 7. I would have said 9 but like I said, they lost my preogress which for a gamer really is unforgivible. I wish steam had a star system. So I recomend this game mostly because its free and its fun. so its not like I spent any $ on it so the pros outway the cons. I hope they fix this issue because I dont think I will keep playing if I lose my progress again.			"

												I stupidly decided to play for 3 hours yesterday.  Went to bed, woke up, and realized how stupid I was.All I can really focus on are the negatives...1. Pay to win- The better units require gold (which is purchased, with a very small amount coming from random events and such).  For example, a barracks allows you to recruit swordsmen, spearmen, macemen, and axemen.  The macement and axemen require gold.- the game is about gathering resources based on timers, but the timers can be instantly finished by spending gold.  Want tons of resources?  You can pay to get them!2. Complete utter timesink- Assuming you're masochistic enough to decide to play, all the timers are ♥♥♥♥ed up:Some are 4hours, some are 6, some are 8.  So if you want to maximize your income, you better log in all the time- There are battle missions which you can constantly do for more resources.But heavily damaged units require time to heal (or, of course, spend more gold!  PAY TO WIN!).  These timers take around 5-30 minutes.  So again, the more you play, the more resources you get...  better check into the game all the time, or else you won't get those resources!			"

It's a ported mobile game that has even better graphics on the PC, just because it has micro-transactions doesn't make it a bad game as it's similar to a lot of mobile games. Also there are a couple of things you cannot speed up with gold as other ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mobile games give you the option to literally COMPLETELY buy your way through them, yes the game is pay to win but it's limited compaired to other mobile games, you cannot buy more than one of the same unit that costs gold is just one example. If this is the first review you've seen on the game just give it a try and make your own opinion of the game and don't let the micro-transactions stop you from playing.			"

												Great game. A bit slow at times but very addictive (Currently my most played game). Can't wait for the campaign to drop. Would be nice if more colors were added to the heraldry system. We should also be allowed to have more than one sigil. One thing that bothers me is the trading console. You have to click once for every little bit of resource you wish to trade. There was a quest to trade 2,000 units in one transaction. Due to my 50% trade rate (the highest I can get) I had to click the LMB 1,000 times to trade 2,000 units. The hard part wasn't gathering the resources but the clicking. Hopefully they can change it to a slider or simply a box for us to type the amount we wish to trade.All in all it's a game that keeps me coming back to it constantly and I would love it if there was more content added.

												Pay2Win of the worst kind. Yes, it has all the mechanics to be a fun game, but in the end it turns into ""Who bought more gold"" competition. Gold buys you better units from the get-go, when you could only obtain them with ""free"" currency after many, many days of farming the necessary matherials. Whatever you do, they offer you to do it better and faster with gold, you can buy immensely powerful battle bonuses with gold, giving you power-ups and free units, etc... In short, do not play, unless you are very very patient, or have a lot of money you want to spend.			"

												I reall like this game it has very simple layout and i like the hexagon style map, i also really like the battles and i think they have just the right level of difficulty. Howeverthere are two points i would like to address:1. when collecting materials e.g. 20 wood  takes 10 min how ever when collecting 20 stone it takes 1 and a 1/2 hour, which is just too long, nothing else takes this long, this time needs to be shortened especially as stone it the most useful matterial.2. I have'nt got a gaming PC/ a decent computer, i have a laptop, but i can play Total War: Rome (1) on max graphics with 120 as a unit size with maxed out 3 v 3 ai battle so why cant i play a 9v9units battle in this game on the lowest quality at 8 fps?!?!? Apart from that i do like this game and i like the choise of units, the way you can change the landscape, make your own castle, battle other player, battle Ai, have multiple castles and much more.WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS GAME, YES! (but only if your pc/laptop and handle the battles/fighting part of the game.			"

												Well yeah, it's mostly a mobile game as there's so much Microtransactions AND THEY DONT EVEN USE IT PROPERLY.For a free to play title that has mixed ratings I say this is a great game. I play the game like a true man or woman and don't turn into them Pay to Win people who likes to spend money on 50 Gold. Quite Addictive to be honest, BUT I want to see more community listening not ignoring the community. Devs need to listen to the community, see their opinions on how to change games like these. It can help a bunch.And If possible, maybe have these Realms styled a bit more differently compared to other player's Realms.*GREAT GAME KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AND KEEP THIS GAME HAPPY AND ALIVE!*Also, I really hope this game will get future Updates. Especially updates like adding a Chat to talk to other people, or even, specific Units. or at least customizable.			"

												This game is awesome . People dont recommend this because they dont understand how the game works and they think its pay to win . Its not , everything (exept some cosmetic stuff) is free . You just need time to get it . For example if you want longsword knights , you can buy them for 400 gold (real money) or craft it what takes some time . Battle system is pretty interesting though not that good but it has good concept . The economic and building system is really unique. You need to find places for your farms , sheeps , cattle , woodcutters and quarry . Once you understand how it works , , its easy and interesting .  For example , farms in order to plant and harvest need to have water/river near by . BUT if you do one mistake , river can go crazy and flood that farm and everything that will stand in its way . At that point you can try fixing it with lots of dams or just restart .Or you can accidentally cut down whole forest and you will be without wood.  People just need to understand how it works . Production is pretty much just taking when its ready , you can have tavern and blacksmiths who will produce money but you need workers to that building so you need houses to have workers. Productions is slow , but you can get some resources by completing missions . OVERVIEW : Game is very good , good concept , soundtrack is good , battle system is interesting and challenging , production and building is also challenging and sometimes very risky . I totally reccomend this game to everyone , its not like any other Total War game , but it is unique . Try it , see yourself .			"

												Nothing to see here, move along. It's a mobile pay-to-win-or wait game in total wars clothing. It's tedious, bland and belongs on a highschoolers mobile phone, it could hold the despire of public transport at bay.Serious, if you're on a steam using PC don't waste your time with this.Now, that all said, for a facebook game (even one not on facebook) it's made than the average. The combat system, army progression and terraforming alone cut it a notch above.Total war costuming points- It's supposedly set in the dark ages but none of the lads have long hair styles.- You play as the Saxons but do not have an arm ring in sight, let alone any subtler touches- No tension between the only recently risen to dominance church and the older germanic paganism of the Saxons that was still kicking along at that point.- O hi longbows! What are you doing here? I wasn't expecting you to contribue anything for at least another three centuries, no seriously mate, you're not supposed to be at this party.- Mmm, this is awkward, hey Heavy Cav, I know your feeling pretty useful here, but could you follow longbows out and come back in a few hundred years when you're actually relevant to this party?etc			"

												So, to start, I loved this game, even if the combat system isn't very great, I loved the economy.But do you remember, in the tutorial, when they say to you ""Oh dud raise this terrain, so your dam won't collapse"".Guess what ? I can name my city Atlantis, because IT DOESN'T MATTER. BECAUSE WATER GO ON HIGHER GROUND IF YOU BLOCK IT.So, now, I have 3/4 of my map flooded, a city to destroy if you want to ""get it back"", and some areas that are too deep to get rid of the water. But now I am the master of the ocean, waiting for my mermaids, so I've that going for me, which is nice.Your water is so wrong, SEGA ... I followed the instructions, and now I can't play anymore ...What is a this game ? A ""once-you-have-discovered-water-flood-everything-you-have-only-one-thing-to-do-quit-the-game"" ?!So , I quit. I'm sad, but I quit. I won't start over, and I can't get back what I've done... thanks for the lost of time			"

												This could be a decent game, but the greed of the creators is destroying my interest. The entire crafting process, taking completely too long and producing poor results (seven consecutive master craft sessions produced six blue and only one green), is designed to frustrate you and have you give up and spend money to get the item instead. The battle function is basic and depends much more on the strength of the army than any strategies of the commander. The AI battles quickly become repetitive.  After spending many enjoyable hours playing Medieval Total War, this is a real disappointment.			"

												They reseted everyone's progression, just so they could make it harder for everyone to unlock regions. That way its impossible to get the 3rd part of the map without paying real money or being extremely lucky getting easy duels against new players.Basically you now need to win about 10 duals in a row without losing any just so you unlock a region. But the game will make you fight against players with higher levels, who have more units in their army, better units with more upgrades, more powers... So ♥♥♥♥ this game and its way of forcing players to pay real money so they can progress			"

												I'll recomend it after the fix duels and the other crazy thing -> they could understand live without facebook. Steam has privacy of everything or everyday. But that baffles me when you play a game which has complex stragedy almost like online risk. That game was more fun this one there you could go and conqueror live players this one your stuck in limbo doing what tutorial asks you do never leveling up your castle to rank 2. Which baffles me, there no opt out of tutorial from steam, seems to gold spending game, as everyone puts it spend to win. I tried to figure it out why. labeled this stragedy maybe they should relabel it money making scheme sort of game.  Eventually you do if you don't spend anything on free time you earn 35 gold it doesn't really help try to use it get silver that way. 8 hours to up rank your castle  and then bandits and like assault you while your away seems kind of fishy. Dueling is never fixed, if they fix it they could alert the players say hey we fixed dueling so no need to leave our game.No update on that means they either abandoned it or left us to wander and play viking outposts seems be where people at, save your gold for that. Don't spend it on changing the seaons which 35 gold and 5,10, 15 for advisor he helpful yes but still spending time with him means you have to have him for battles so you don't loose. I do believe there aren't achievements in this game that is missing, so you not gain anything playing it not even cards. Which would been cool..but that just me putting it out there. Game overall experience 75%  wish it was better Graphics really cool, sound too, It kind of reminded me of  Game of thrones without crazy aspect of it.			"

												Mixed Views: I love it, but as with all these ""free-to-play"" games you'll only get a few hours before those nasty micro-transactions not only rear their heads, but become necessary if you want to progress. Battle controls also very limited, strategy seems to mean less than who's spent the most on upgrades... Disappointing really. Charge me a tenner and let me play the game and advance based on merit please.			"

												I have to say, this game has no relation to a series of games total war. On a wave of the success of games-farms Sega decided to grab a piece of the pie, but that Sega did not the best way. This is yet another clone of clash of clans with a slightly modified concept. The main drawback of the game is that after a certain time, you will encounter the impossibility of further development without investing real money, with these funds, which you can buy a whole series of games total war.

												In short:I like the game, it has lots of potential .. but it's an ill conceived cash cow that will milk you dry.Things that ruin this game:* Increadibly long periods of time to do even the most menial tasks. This is a game where you click and then walk away for a day, a week .. half a month (Yes, chop down and tree and it will take half a month real time to grow back).* No auto activity feature .. forcing you to micro manage even the most basic resource collection (see previous point).* Huge reliance on gold to speed things up (purchased with real coin) to make this game even playable (see previous point).* Increadible difficulting in raising gold through the actual game (see previous point). So unless you fork out huge amounts of real cash, be prepared to wait until retirement before anything exciting happens. "

												I give up on sega games with the total war series everything.  The shoguns never work, the rome is always the one they pay the most attentions to and if something ever goes wrong SEGA will never refund anything, regardless of a right or wrong scenario.  Used to be a dedicated Total war player since day 1 beta; no more.  This was a last attempt and ended in failure.  Game fails probably because they were making this while spending 99.99% of their time tweeking Total War ROME III...! Don't be fooled by the screenshots, you have very limited control and are limited so a small box frame to fit around your very few preset formatiomations (ON RAILS & BOXED IN) and can only attack to front+back or archers diagonal+front. It's trying to be SEGA's version of stronghold with the worst combination possible of the total war series. and fails horribly. Everything is expected and nothing shines bright here in any real unique way at all. Comment what you like and rate what you like; regardless I won't see any of the comments or even attempt to read them or come back to this crap...Not sure why it states 0.8 hours, I played 1.5-2 hours...Game rating = 2.5/10...don't waste the seconds to download...

												Combat is boring, involves QTEs, and makes completely no sense (You'd think that if you kill everyone in a certain lane, you could now flank the enemy with your freed-up troops, but no, you have to wait or taunt, hoping that somebody is stupid enough to saunter into that specific column to fight your idling soldiers.)Why does it take seven centuries or paying in-game currency to harvest/mine anything in this game. During the tutorial, I found out that harvesting wheat would take either 20 min or 1 gold. So I decided to wait a bit and save up what I could in terms of currency. I come back 10 minutes later and find out that the game has crapped out on itself and needs me to sign back in so it can re-update. Not that bad in and of itself, but it completely canceled my harvesting process, sending the process back to square one, all twenty minutes of it. Let me repeat, this game traps you into paying Gold on what should just be a mouseclick and a bit of a waiting game, because the game cannot support itself long enough to farm the normal, non-idiotic way.I also learned that if you press a mouse right, your useless looking pitchfork wielders can utterly obliterate the front rank of trained cavalrymen mid-charge. Apparently SEGA didn't remember that this doesn't work ANYWHERE ELSE in the Total War series. Seriously, let's line some peasants up against cavalry and rush them head on in Rome I, Rome II, Shogun II, anything. See if that works.10/10, would uninstall again.			"

												As a diehard fan of the Total War series I was rather interested in the concept of an mmo variation of the game. This game is not at all what I thought it would be and does great injustice to the series as a whole. It doesn't feel at all like a Total War game, in fact it's closer to Stronghold or Settlers. Those games might have their merits but this game does not deserved to part of the Total War Series. If you love the series don't download this, it will only disappoint you.l			"

												This game is only for those w<ho can spend 20/24 hours a day on it, and set the alarm all the hours to grind some ressources. Or for those we call ""rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s"" who can basically your 3 weeks game time in 1 hour (more or less)Think about clash of clan, because this is the same, but way more time consuming. the building idea is good, but the time!!!!! basically you can build in 8 secs, but demolishing the building will take 8 minutes, grinding ressources can take 8 hours (only for crops).I just fought a duel against another player, his longbow squad just ripped appart my knight, by using fire arrows wich you have to pay for. Destroying my infantry with macemens (money) and heavy cavalery (more money). if you want to play free, stick to the PvE. i hope they will do something about it, because it is clearly unplayable...

												I have to sadly say that as many others have pointed out this is a pay to win Facebook game with a total war facelift. The resources required to expand the map are far too high, by the time any player who doesn’t drop money gets access to the higher quality units not to mention higher tier quality a player who drops money is so far ahead there is no way to keep up and be competitive on the PvP section of this game.The art is great, the combat system is fun and challenging [which is good] the map can be changed to a slight degree lowering and raising the land which is nifty. However the drawback of in some cases not being able to tell how many enemies you may be facing because they are off the battle field waiting to enter, the obviously pay to win model, and the lack of content long term, I would have to say pass on this game even if it’s free.Any total war fan will be left wanting more content and more quality, any Facebook fan will be put off by the combat and both parties will not like the pay to win model. Creative assembly get out of the facebook game and back into making AAA full release games.			"

												OK, this game is not the typical Total War game, and yes, its absolutely design with mobile devices in mind. But if you compare it with other games in the genre it is one of the best. Maybe Steam is not the best place for this game but it is a really enjoyable game, people say that things take a lot of time to get done, that is the point of this games and I am really sure is not that long if you compare to other games in the genre (like 10 to 20 mins to gather resources and most building take like 7 seconds to build, others take like 2 to 24 hours). Well the game has microtransactions, but nothing new, you can adquire everything in the game with actual in game resources without spending a single cent of real money, except some cosmetics, but you need to be patient and manage your resources. Yes, some units are clearly pay2win but not to make it only a P2W experience, and you can still ""craft"" them with in game resources.The game overall is pretty good, but you need to judge it by what it actually is, a mobile resource gathering game. I seriously think that it is going to be a great succes when it hits android and iOS devices. So for me solid 7-8 out of 10. Fun combats, castle and town ""building"" on hexes, and interesting water mechanics plus really fun weather-season system.			"

It is a key point that a game has good community interaction especially when it first starts off and it is paramount to the sucess of a game that such a presence is there at the alpha/beta release stages.This game started off decent, but after 3-4 days of playing it become dull, dry, and nonsensical.The utter agrivation that this game is PAY TO WIN, chops it up to another MONEY GRABB.You are forced to spend 50-100$ To get any advanced units which means after some point of a few days of playing YOU CANNOT PROGRESS.

												Great game, this.  It's in the same genre as games like Travian, Clash of Clans, and Tribal Wars with the major difference being that the kingdom building aspect is 100% safe from attack and being conquered by others.Combat reminds me of the boardgame Oishi if any are familiar.  it is an eastern tactical combat style boardgarme.  games are quick and easy though sometimes a huge fight will boil down to a few hearty troops which is always dramatic.  the combat feels 'jousty' where you have a little clash and then are on your way.Graphics are great.  The feel of the most recent rome total war is brought forward and refined in this newest total war game.  in the most recent rome total war the iconography felt like cheap clipart, but in total war battles, the iconography has been given the love it needs to become a beautiful part of the rest of the game which is already beautiful.One of the things that I like most about this game is that I feel like it's the BEST of it's genre because your kingdom will NEVER be destroyed or taken over by another player.  It is your kingdom.  you get 1 life, in that when you start the game you get your character name which is undeletable and tied to your total war account, so if you like your name, no restarts!  I digress though, since what you have is safe and yours, then you can develop your kingdom at your own pace.   I believe the missions scale to how much xp you've got in your army roster but I could be wrong.  Early missions are easy cakewalks and the easy ones can be done without the aid of the relics kept in churches so if you want to do a low religion level game (like for a long time in the beginning of the game, I destroyed almost everything and rebuilt, so my kingdom only had the holy grail providing a special 'order' power for my army for a good long time and I got by just fine).A last note about the spirit of this game, which I feel is important to talk about.  in other games in this genre, you're left feeling stressed like you could get attacked and lose your stuff at any moment, and the timers were like chains, binding you whether you liked it or not to the game.  In Total War Battles: Kingdom, since your kingdom is safe, the feel is totally different.  You can pick it up whenever you want, put it down whenever you want, take a break for a week who cares?  you can still come back to it and field your army and have fun battles at just your level and enjoy a stress free super beautiful castle builder on the side.Enjoy!It's free :)			"

												Despite what everyone else appears to be saying this game is a great RTS. Its much like stronghold kingdoms in the building but has more options such as dams to stop the flow of water or to flood a area. Combat can be challenging and requires the user to make decisions. The only downside I have found is collecting resources ranges from 10 minuetes to 7 hours.			"

												THIS FREE TO PLAY GAME CAN BE AN EXPENSIVE RIP OFF!!!The two most serious problems I ran into are like boom - a gambling addiction I didn't know I had, and bugs like this one below that COST A PLAY REAL MONEY - boo-hiss.I had to send this into Tech Support, hope I don't have to pay $$$ to get a quick resolution and action like in the game. USE RENOWN TO ACCESS WEDGEFORD NOT WORKING!As I understand the criteria, to rule Wedgeford a player can either buy the territory which is IMPOSSIBLE unless one pays TOO MUCH real money for it OR proves right to rule by becoming a renowned duelist.Lady Evelyn defines renowned duelist as “OBTAIN DUELING RANK 18 OR BETTER.”After achieving a dueling rank of 20 for several days, I am still now able to USE RENOWN to obtain Wedgeford.Hopefully, this is a game bug that needs attention, or this game is really the PAY TO PLAY RIP OFF noted by far too many reviewers.I’m at the point where I must compare this game to getting addicted to on line gambling – slot machines.Is the game different from most other Total War games? Most definitely.However, the biggest difference is the FREE TO PLAY label is most misleading, thus far I’ve spent $55.00 bucks to play this so called free game. I have about $9.00 left in my game account, so when I (admittedly) foolishly get that ripped off, I’m uninstalling this game from STEAM.In fact the negative review I found to be my favorite is: About as ""pay to win' as you can get. Shame on CA for stooping to a level I associate with doing the video gamer equivalent of running a casino direct targeting gambling addicts. A certain type of player will blow god awful amounts of money on this. The more rational gamers will be annoyed that those who spent a ton of money have such an advantage.There are definitely a few positives to this game, but the negatives far outweigh the misleading FREE TO PLAY BETA.Sincce this is a Beta, and SEGA desires feedback from those (PAYING TO) play this FREE GAME, I strongly suggest that instead of getting more folks addicted to gambling (like me), that SEGA put this much time, effort, and talent into turning this into a real traditional Total War platform and simply charge an up front price for the game. Here are a few other comments I found most useful.     - The tutorial itself teaches you how to spend money – REAL MONEY from your Steam Account.     - It's a ""pay to win"" game as you can get everything by simply paying.     - All customization and speedups, do, as expected, cost a currency that you must buy with real money.     - This game is terrible in how they are trying to market and profit from it. It is disgraceful to the Total War franchise "

												A totally different take on the Total War franchise. This is a much limited game suitable to be played on a mobile device. Do not expect to play a full Total War classic game, those games need beefier computers. So taking this game for what it is, a mobile game, it is surprisingly good, beatiful graphics and quite some Kingdom management options plus the combat aspect where the composition of your army, its positioning, upgrades and orders are all important. It is meant to be played esporadically, for 10 minutes at a time, loging a few times a day to manage your Kingdom. It is also a free game with no ads and a non intrusive gold for money shop. Money gives you gold which allows you to speed up everything (buying units instead of slowly gathering resources to slowly craft them; instant construction of buildings, instant gathering of resources or instant healing your troops after the battle instead of waiting the rrequired time). So the impatient will spend money to buy gold to progress faster... and that is good, because the rest of us get to play for free at our own pace.Every unit or improvement that can be bought with gold can be crafted in game, provided you manage your kingdom properly and take your time. Heck, I have got more gold in game than I need too.So enjoy the game for what it is, a beautiful, well done, FREE mobile game.---------------------------------------Note: Some personal advice, the game does not detail every aspect of how everything works. the way I see it, I find it more fun to play the game WITHOUT looking in internet for detailed notes about how the buildings work or how the seasons affect your economy. Play the game and discover it yourself without any external hints. It is supposed to be a challenge where setbacks leads to learning. Note that you CANNOT restart the game, but nothing you'll do would break it. You can always recover from everything that the game throws at you, so if a season drought or an invasion wreak havoc with your budding Kingdom, take it as a challenge and raise again without ♥♥♥♥♥ing at how unfair the game is.

												this game is rubbish! if I wanted to play a crappy facebook-style game set in the 10th century I'd go look for it on facebook. This is just barely a TW game, pretty graphics don't make up for  being utterly confused with everything and being pestered at every point to play ""freemium"" style- pay to complete buildings or get more resources. This is awful and I don't think there is a rating low enough for it. Battles are what you'd expect from any TW game at least.			"

The time it takes to gather resources and heal units is pretty bad. I don't mind waiting in mobile game, but there is nothign to while waiting. Most other mobile games that are decent have something to do in the meantime while  you wait.Eh. I am uninstalling it.			"

If I don't like a game I usually just delete it and move on to another one, but this game angried me enough to write a review.I ignored the reviews for this game and decided to try it, big mistake. You can advance pretty far without dropping a penny on this game, but at certain points the game will place a huge wall where you will need to either put out money to overcome it or spend days/weeks on farming it yourself to pass it.Another thing that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off is that the game information is lacking, such as what army unit is best/weak against X unit, how to do X, and so on and so on.

												What might have been an interesting terrain-manipulation puzzle game is being dragged down by being tied to a mediocre PVP dueller.The compromises they've made in order to turn this into a mobile-style click-the-resource-fest means that while this might look like a decent offering on the App Store, it's very out of place on Steam where there are much better games to be had. Even at this price.The fact that this is being marketed as a 'Total War' game makes me a little bit queasy. This game is going to do real damage to a valuable brand. There are definitely some marketing pony-tails in the decision making chain that need to be downsized, and quick. IMHO, of course. It's their brand to ruin as they see fit.			"

												Wonderfull kingdom building and planning  with military strategy elements game.I have been looking for anything that would come close to a browser game I once played. The game was called Knightsdivine (only some pictures remained if you google), and was for reasons unknown taken down. The mentioned game was free at first, my guess to why the game went down, cause of bad payment options - as I was to young to get a credit card, other payment options were pretty much inaccessible for me back then (no prepaid option or mobile).I have been trying different tiles whatever I could find and nothing came remotely close. Well, this is not same obvious, while it has at same point gave me some satisfaction it makes me even more lust for this game to develop further.What does it miss a multi-player regional camps, where lords fight for the ultimate title ""king of kings"". Instead of using today model of destroying a player it took just a proportion of lord's land and the rest claimed as vassal lord and thereby open up a political hierarchy within the kingdom. Truly revolutionary. I have not seen this here yet, but I hope that once you claimed sectors something like that will be possible or implemented later.Games thrive to use renown, as progress upon unlocking better and new buildings (where in Knightsdiveine you had to spend learning points). This game is slow paced, but the renown and battle options can keep you occupied during  your waiting times. And it seems, the more regions you have, the more you'll have to do.I am excited about how this will develop on. Definitely has nice potential, and is a nice game already. It is real slow, but it pauses when you don't play (except seasons, the continue to move onward, that is great however).			"

												so stupid how people put ""not recommended"" simply becouse its FTP. its fricken free and your complaining that they try to make money like EVERY game? oh spend 40$ per game and its a fun ""real"" game. but have it trying to make 1-5$ off you and all of a sudden its a crime. i hate you FTP Haters, and i know you are going to say ""not helpful"" becouse alot of you are arrogant Nerd-Trolls. to sum it up, the FTP haters is the ""Gaming version of Racism"".Edit: i didnt really mention much about the actual gameplay, so i will now for people who dont blindly hate a FTP label. Pros:Good Graphics. considering this is FTP which usually dont go over-the-top for many things the graphics are good.Battles: i dont own Total War. so i cant say about wether this is good or not compared to the rest of the series. however compared to all other FTP strategy games this combat system tops it off. not only can you actually see the battles occuring but you can make tactical descisions. like it should be.Terraforming: this is a unique feature which i find nice. itd be even cooler if there was a map editor.Speed: the speed of the game moves along pretty fast. you can build building for only a couple seconds. however the things taking hours to make can give headaches.Cons:unit Depth: compared to alot of other games there isnt alot of variety of units. basically, Pikes Archers Calvery and Swords, and Siege weapondry.multiplayer: as far as i can tell its more Singleplayer, with some MP added in. nothing like some games with entire empires controlled by a single player, or ""Houses"" with many factions with 10 people minimum.Sounds: this isnt a con, i just had no where to put it. i alway have mute on so i can tell you wether the sounds used are good or not.

												Well it’s been a while since this came out and now I will write what I have to say on it. Like its real time predecessor total war battles shogun the game is different in nature to other total war titles. However for this version the gameplay was split. In battles shogun you had to build buildings and train troops during the battles which behaved in a similar format. Your troops would mindlessly march across the hex based map and the only thing you could do to them was switch lanes. At this point not counting the pay to accelerate system in place there are a lot of gameplay problems with the game. unlike total war battles shogun the management and battles are split up. In this version  you have a hex based grid where you build villages that take forever to gather resources and also require player interaction to do so. The battles are summed up with your troops mindlessly go towards the enemy with a few player interactions in charging and ability’s to break up the boring aspect of battles. Now the part that really pisses me off and arguably breaks the game is the difficulty system. The game scales difficulty based on how powerful your army is and the game was designed with the logic “hey let’s make the AI more powerful than you all the time to make the game challenging.” The problem with that logic is that you get to a point where the AI is so powerful it takes any fun that’s left out of the game. Worse is that when the AI is weaker than you there is no reward for winning. The ridiculous difficulty is seen with the raiders that attack your villages every so often. Now for some reason raiders are not scaled with your army for difficulty. Instead they are scaled with the number of regions under your control. So I have 4 regions and am facing armies that have troops that are so powerful that I can only get through one line of troops with all 3 lines of my troops filled.(there are 3 lines in total for both sides and apparently the AI can get reinforcements) Raiders steal your resources and destroy your buildings so you have to get rid of them. If you can’t defeat them in battle you have to pay them silver (one of the resources in the game) the problem there is that the raiders demand ludicrous amounts of silver in the last case they demanded over 4000 silver which drained days (and I mean real world days) worth of resource gathering. That’s not mentioning the yearly droughts that dry up the rivers over halfway up the map, and the pay to accelerate system that is in place. It’s worth noting that this is a beta and I do hope that many of these problems get fixed but until they do I cannot recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Since I started playing this with the expectations most of the reviews had given me I find this game quite enjoyable. One can't expect the ordinary Total War game, because it isn't. It is an online rts game and that's why I don't find it strange or annoying with long building times.I would say this game is a mix between Total War, Civilization and Stronghold Kingdoms. Sure there are some bugs but it's still in beta and it's running better than I though it would on my laptop. So far I haven't felt that it's a pay-2-win game and that is also positive, since there are games like this out there that you can't progress in if you aren't paying a ton of money.All in all I think it's a good game, and since it's free you should at least try it out for yourself and make your own opinion!

												There were days when I thought of Creative Assembly as developers who not only value, but also love their client-base, us Total War gamers. When they released awesome games and supported them throughout and then even improved them further through add-on such as Medieval 2 Total War Kingdoms and Napoleon TW. Those were good days when I bought the games without a second thought being certain that it will be a quality product made with love and respect. Sentimental so far hey? But then there was the biggest ever beta test of Rome 2, it lasted a year. Then there were DLC for playable factions and blood and gore, and now this... this is the final nail in the coffin where I buried my respect to CA and SEGA (I don't know who to blame) as this is the most greedy TW project that does not even deserve the TW badge.... 8 hours to spawn a peasant 4 hours to harvest etc... It is as if they took Godus and though ""hmmm, how can we make this even worse and still earn money""....Shame on you CA and/or SEGAFor more reviews join - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ogrreview/ "

												This game seems pretty fun. Altough it should not carry the Total War title + logo since there is almost no aspect from a Total War game in. Kingdom Wars - Dawn of Fantasy had more in common that this.There are some things that bothering me. #1. First of all the Drought. The tides in the game seems to be really annoying and weird. I am dealing with a severe drought problem, half my farms are dried out and the lakes are empty. this is going on for 4 days in a row now and only got worser.#2. The combat is a bit odd. I get it that it is a freemium game but paying for a 1 time fight upgrade (like flaming arrows or an extra mercenary unit) is really stupid and unneccesary. I know you can craft bracelets to use them too but that take ages so no one would waste their time on that.#3. Construction speed is odd. You don't build a whole city in one minute and demolish it in 10 minutes.#4. As last I want to compliment the Mods on the Forum and support. They are really active and helpfull.			"

												The game has potential, but in current form it is useless and unplayable. You start of building your first castletown, conquer you neighbor for more land, expand your resource income, fight missions for coin and resources. Then the fun ends. After playing one day. Waiting time is ridiculous, Cost of gold to speed everything up. Limitations in recruting troops. I manage to upgrade my first castle to level 2 and hoped to unlock some new features. I did and they to cost an ridiculous amout of resourses. Game is way to slow. And the way you can speed things upp with money just is not worth it.			"

												Normally whenever I play one of the Total War games I usually have a plesent time playing them and when I heard that an online version was coming out i was excited.  But then the game actually came out and I was thourougly dissapointed.  The tutorial is long and you cant really do much afterwards besides play some missions and wait for your taxes or wheat or buildings to come up (unless you spend gold)  And the facts that while gold sppeds up everything it cost so much makes me not want to play at all since this is basically pay to win.  You need gold to complete buildings that take either 9 minutes to an hour and even changing your character looks cost gold besides the few free things.  All in all this game is simply another money pull to get us to play and spend our money on practically nothing.			"

												mostly this game is just to slow unless u are willing to pay for the speed . Normaly i have a lot of paitient for these games  but 2  major things are stopping me to play constantly . I know play for about 10-20 minutes and then stop playing , then maybey 30-40 came back IF it is needed otherwise i put the game at hold for a couple of hours .In this case it is imposible to play to play this (unless u like  builder-browser games) 1. this is a pay to win game  - negative play fun for players like me who don`t have the money for it.2.  Unbalenced armies - while the AI has 3 buffed 3 star knights against my 2 levies 1 star and 2 hunters 1 star (bufed up) i do not have a change even tho i have the same level as the AI ( and this was normal battle .on pvp the also armies are not balanced randomly giving me an opponent from the same level but no change to PREPARE for what he has in his army so if i had 2 levies and 2 hunters it gives me 2 levies 3star and 2 hunter 3star against me . yeah thats fear a money spending player against a non money spending player that got his levels thru building and research doesn`t have a big armie when challanged or invaded .found another on RESTRICTED UNIts , SAY WHAT and the AI can have more then one uhmmmm......... i`m speechlessso it needs a lot of change for change because the game is not THAT bad nice relax building game white some battles for the assentinals oke that not bad .finaly is this a TOTAL WAR game NO absolutly NOT there pase of the game is more based on building and epansion of your kingdom then the EPIC war battles that can be found in TW.

												Let me start off and say this game should NOT be on PC at all. This game was desgined for Mobile in mind. Everything about it, its stright up pay to win. Sure they give you some gold in the begining but that will only get you so far. They simplified the game witch isnt bad but isnt good. The part that got me was the boreing combat and the pay to win aspects. If you run out of gold it takes 8 hours to farm!!!! are you kidding me idk how anything thinks thats ok at all let alone on PC. If they got rid of that it wouldnt be so bad. But all in all dont waste your time i wanted to try it for myself and judge it and see if it was all that bad, and the answer is yes yes it is.			"

This review stays negative until the game is recommendable.

												It's not really Total War, but it passes the time. The recent patch made combat much harder - almost impossible without spending gold. It's also harder to collect resources like wood, so plan on playing other games in between growing seasons.You can play without constantly buying things, but it requires a lot of hours like I said.For die-hard fans it will be disappointing...All that aside, I don't see much happening based on player feedback. There might be things in the background, but very little seems to make it on the forums to indicate there is intent to listen to players.			"

												Well how can i put this Its very much like a mobile game but is very enjoyablebut really i am going to write about something that noone wants to touch on and thats wether or not this game is pay to win like 90% of  reviews here on steam say it is1st saying a game is pay to win implies you are paying for an advantage that no other F2P player cannot achieve without putting money into the game This is falsesure you can put 100 bucks in and have an army that has all the upgrades (best possible melee and ranged upgrades and armor bonus'sbut can somone who is playing the game for free (liek me) achieve all these things without money?yes i can have axemen greataxes and crossbows and better artillery without paying a dime it just times TIME and EFFORT like most F2P games with mircrotransactiosn would force you to do though CA i would prefer that you guys allow at least 1 blacksmith PER castle be allowed to craft it still takes time to craft and limiting to 1 blacksmith overall is just toooooo slowbut anyways this game has alot of fun elements........ i have almost 100 hours on it and after really wiht all this experience i am gonna say the game is NOT pay to win it just takes time to get to where you need to be rather than where you want to beCA i understand the Limit on the Greatsword Knights but cmon there has to be a line drawn somewhere with all the limiting on the stronger Troops becuase your AI has multiples of these Troops and i have no problem beating them at all really so my opinion is Drop the Limit on Greatswords/axes but keep the limit on crossbows if there is one becuase they are just silly Strong			"

												Firstly this is not the traditional Total War game so do not go in expecting that; it never claimed to be the full blown experience that you get with the latest masterpiece. It does however have something else to offer and that is a mobile or quick game when a long campaign on the latest Total War is just not possible. The essence of Total War is there but made more accessible in a number of ways. Being cross platform is just a start but I do believe the actual mechanics of the game are easier to understand for those who do not have the time to invest in or concentration span for the main series. This game is a pick up and play kingdom building experience with combat, level progression and upgrades.Would I recommend the game; well yeah it is Free to Play, playable, nice enough graphics which any hardware could probably handle, audio is good but not sure about the speech at the beginning. Don't get me wrong there are still a few issues that need to be addressed but nothing major anymore.Great game for having Total War on the go which is good for when you don't have too much time to play or just want to give yourself a break from more demanding games of the franchise.

You guys be careful what nickname you choose and if you want a reset in case you want to start the game from beginning cuz from what I'm seeing so far that's not possible.Anyway considering its in beta I thing its great and there aren't many games out there where you can have a direct impact of the battle.

Until you start wondering why you playing a Total War game that have only 1 faction, less than 15 differents units and that is F2P with an omnipresent cash shop (cuz everything is soooo slow in the game... unless you pay real cash :))) ) I really enjoyed building my little kingdom and terraforming, crushing some vikings and celts but damnit, this game is wasted potential... If only you had all units available for FREE and that the only thing you had to pay for is the game itself. I hate F2P.			"

												A nice stripped down version of Total War. I'm enjoying this a lot and I'm looking forward to the campaign. No issues so far and developers appear to have acted on the complaints put forward by those involved in the beta. I've read the negative reviews and the responses from those who enjoy the game. I'm afraid that the critics over emphasise the effect of gold. 1 It really doesn't give you that big an advantage. 2 You don't need to pay money to get it. If you want to spend money on it go for it. The developers need to make money and I think they've done a great job. I haven't spent a cent and I'm loving it. It's free - give it go.			"

												It's a city builder with timers. Like... clash of clans or any other typical mobile city builder of sorts. If you are looking for a Total War game similar to your Shogun, Rome or Medieval, look elsewhere. It gives off a Civilization vibe, however, this is more of a dumb down version of the big Total War and Civilization titles.Would I recommend this? Sure, if you had a ton of time to kill and absolutely nothing else to do with your life.			"

												I found this actually really motivating as a mid-core strategy game, certainly not as deep and intricate as the bigger Total War titles, but tailored for shorter (10 - 30 minutes) sessions of town management, resource collecting and nicely animated battles. One of the few F2P games I actually returned to. Recommended for those who don't have enough time to play hardcore all the way, but still want their fair share of strategy.			"

												Even though this does not feel like Total War (Since I never feel like I am at war) it is actually pretty nice, I hear so much about pay to win yet you can get gold in various ways and for free. I did at one point think that you needed to use gold for advanced units but after nearly ten levels I can make those units for free (By the looks of it, havn't done that yet) It is time consuming since it takes hours for some things, pretty much just the Fell/Harvest all and building. But I enjoy it and nobody can really complain about leveling up being too slow, they give you way too many stuff to do. So really I find it a fair game (Have not tryed dueling yet)			"

The developers HAVE to make something to make money and that was the only thing they came up with. I really do recommend this game but it's a little pay to win. Play this game it's super realistic and interesting but i do not recommend buying gold because it's a waste of money since you can get gold in other ways too.			"

												Its an OK to average kingdom building game but its very limiting and aggravating doing battles because the button cooldowns are so insanely slow, and the constantly having to readjust the ground levels to dig some things and then only be able to place certain buildings at certain heights of ground and having your kingdom flooded when it doesnt work out right.  Would be a great game if you could manipulate your troops in real time and not have some standing doing nothing and cant use them yet because of formations, and for the love of God reduce the cooldown on how fast you can select targets for the archers, the 5sec cooldowns makes me not even want to use them at all, and the constant releveling of the ground is overkill, a waste of resources, and stupid.  So in short its a great game with great potential for fun but is killed and made annoying to play by too many rules and limitations taking it from thumbs up to down and 5 stars to 1 star			"

												The game has very good intentions as well as a fantastic concept! It falls short largely due to monetization and the ridiculous amount of time it takes to gather a fairly small amount of ressources.I enjoy what they were trying to do... The concept of the game is solid, and shines brightly despite heavy monetization. The servers are pretty bad, the wait is bad and it's hardly worth what you're waiting for! I do hope they balance waits and gains in such a way that a free-to-play player can make proper headway like Creative Assembly claims they can.For now, I can't recommend this game. Blatant money-grabs with poor servers and rewards makes for a frustrating experience. The qualms are fairly easy to fix, but will they bother?			"

												This game is quite alright. It reminds of those old Facebook games that required a lot of clicking and no skill, but this game requires a good amount of skill and not as much clicking. The battle scenes though not up to par with Total War, are fun in their own right. The town/city building aspect is intriguing enough to keep you from being bored but the upgrade requirements for buildings and the like are very steep. It'll take a good long while to get a good foundation, but if you take about 10 minutes of your day in the morning and night its a good bit of fun .			"

I was fine with the 20 minute collection times, but the 4 hour wheat field growing times seemed to put me on the edge. Furthermore, I was shocked when I realized that it takes 20 days for the trees to regrow. 20 days! real time! This game is definitely not recommended to anyone by me, and if you want a decent game that's fun to play, I would never suggest this game. The wait times are insane, for any gamers out there. Stay away from this game folks, there's plenty real ones our there that won't take 20 years to do anything :)			"

												I've not played any of the Total War franchise before. However I can do compare this as a minor version of the Total War series in a simplifed version, mainly for the mobile gaming. You can compare this as a better version of the Stronghold Kingdoms. Well for one thing, Total War lives up to the name of complex management of battlefields. But don't expect too much management here, as it's still meant to be mobile gaming. You get to assign your flanking and foward platoons, cast a few Order skills. The city planning management is easy, but needs in depth planning on how your placement of structures in order to fully benefit its ultilisation. It's still based on the traditional hexagonal warfield gameplay. So strategising your placement is important here, as they will influences other subsiding hexagons as well. You won't be placed together with other human players, just other NPC controlled regions. So it may seems like ""YOBA"" gaming. But human players are still out there, during Duels.Ignore about the reviews, saying it's a P2W game. All mobile games needs cash credits to survive. That's their marketing. However I'm very sure this game doesn't really needs those Gold in order to play. In fact the usage of Gold, is only to unlock those cosmetics stuffs for your flags or appearance of your king/queen. Yet in fact, all these cosmestics will still be unlocked as you level up. So Gold doesn't really matter here. No point spending your gold on rushing the buildings as well, since they get built very fast. Compared to Stronghold Kingdoms; where you can get to days just to build finish a building. And if you login daily, Gold will also be awarded to you. Quests also awards you with Gold.Within two hours you can easily unlocked till Level 14. That's qutie substantial for a developed castle. Well maybe not on the resources side. For resource wised, the game has been spilt into four resources, Silvers, Food, Stone, Wood. Silvers and Wood are plenty of them in the game, and should generally earn you quite fast. Whereas for Food really depends on the seasons you are in. There will be times where the Winter has come and you have no plantation for the farm to grow on, so you have have to survive with the icy cold fishes hidden below the ice, or killing some cows and sheeps. The hard part will be getting the Stone, since getting a Stones are pretty hard; comparable that it just generates 10 Stones per 20 minutes. Therefore there are Missions for you to fight for, to earn some pretty good stash of Stones.Generally this game would not be leaving you there hanging, waiting for buildings to get done or waiting for resources to be collected. The cooldown of the soldiers, after going through a battle is very fast. By the time you finish a battle, you are ready to collect your resources. So it's just a cycle. There are unlimited Missions, Battle Quests for you. Campaign is the next upcoming update. Each Missions has it's own difficulty as well, resulting in different payout.For networking wise, Total War has done a good job in having the seamless synchronisation of the account. You get to play the game at home on your Steam, and on the go as you use your mobile to play the game. It maybe hard for those first time, as there seems to be no way to sign up for a Total War account. But fraid not, after you have completed your tutorial. You will actually be asked to create a Total War account. At first I was also clueless on how to create them, as I didn't want to have two accounts separately. For Duels (Humans), the networking really depends on the time of day. So far the matchmaking are mostly two levels higher/lower than your current duel level.			"

												Whoever thought of this did not think about the longtime fans of the TW series at all! They made the amazing large scale RTS game and turned into a crappy, mobile, pay to build this dumb structure, cash grab. I feel bad for the devs that have been working  on the TW series and are seeing it degrade into♥♥♥♥♥♥right in front of them. -The graphics are absolute garbage -You're going to have to spend money on this BS-Combat has taken 1 million steps in the opposite direction-Insane building times-Opposite of what a Total War game should beCompared to other cash grabbing mobile ""games"", this ""game"" is revolutionary, but it is just a pile of dung that came out of TW. This game has some potential though. Take out all the filth, make it kind of like Civ, and you have a decent snack. Whoever thought of this game, go back and reevaluate your decision, most of TW fans are probably somewhere in there 20s or 30s. We aren't going to tolerate stuff like this, we are done with this BS.

This game was not fun, in any capacity, which is extremely disappointing as I am a big fan of Creative Assembly's other titles and have been since CA's inception. I would definitely not recommend this game, as it is primarily designed to function on a touch screen device. If you're planning on playing this on a touch screen device as a time killer on the train, plane or long bus journey, it's not TERRIBLE for this function, however it's not breaking records by any stretch of the imagination. It's main saving grace is that it's free, at least that was something they got right!The interface is clunky and unintuitive, the combat is pretty dull. I would not recommend you play this game.			"

												Actually not a bad game. Long wait timers so easy and relaxing game to check on once or twice a day. It's not pay to win, everyone is open to the same stuff. It's a mmorts with a twist separating it from thousands of Clash of Clans rip-offs. You can customize the terrain around you to maximize profits on your resources, water management is key as it can flood your land if you're not careful. Battles are fun and you best be ready to focus and time your unit's abilities just right. I personally can't wait for Campaign Mode which allows conquering of other players. It has surprising detail within its basic graphics, I would encourage anyone to at least try it, and not let the negative Steam review turn you away, anything with microtransactions(no matter how small or justified) tends to send the community into a flaming rage.

												Havent played alot but I think enough to understand all the game aspects.Veni Vidi Vici. well if you dont know who said this is totally pathetic you should do something with your life...Now.Well things aside this is a very good game nice features entertaining and good to pass the time..(WARNING HATETRAIN INCOMING) But its a shme to the TW franchise so my old gaming PC git burned directly to hell and i forgot my password so i made a new avatar with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer so for now no other TW games. ♥♥♥♥ my Life. To the point this is a shame and the perfect example of a pay-to-win game and the downfall we were all expecting would come for CA as ""good things never stay good"" just as if you want a deatiled long list off al Good V.S Bad things in the game with the all information for a non-opinion neutral point critisism.Soo final point: Good cellphone level game, horrible TW and a insult to its name.And Remember stay in the Shadows..the Void..And have a good night.

												After playing this for some time, and ignoring all other reviews so that I can play the game thoroughly enough to form my own opinion, I can say that the game is not just pay2win / progress.. it's also grow-old2win / progress.PvP review:-Do you want a chance to get to the top without putting in any money at all? you won't get it here.. why you ask? well for pvp you can call in ""extras"" like fire arrows or better melee power to even calling in another unit to help you out.. the catch is that it costs gold OR using up a bracelet which can be crafted... the downside is that the crafting takes 80 hours to produce and you're not guaranteed to get any bracelets at all.Take for example an average outcome with ""master crafting"" (which is more expensive than normal crafting) you may get 5 bracelets in 80 hours, your top pvp opponent does not need this as he just pays 3 gold for his advantage each and every time.. that puts you in one of three camps.1) pay2win the same as your opponent for an equal chance of winning (if you don't take stats into account).2) use one of the bracelets it's taken you almost 4 days to make and get a win or two granting you a few places higher in the ranks.or3) save up a huge amount of bracelets so that you can get the advantage in pvp the same as the pay2win folk do 100% of the time.This leaves you be one of 2 players, either Pay2win or grow-old2win (by which time no one will be playing anymore / game will be shut down).You may enjoy this if you just want to attack AI and you only have about 5 - 10 minutes every 5 hours to play (as this game was very much aimed at the mobile market) or pay for everything, otherwise it's just frustrating, unfair and a complete grind.

												Its a free to play game like Farmville or whatever mobile game is big now where pschological programming and what amounts to mind control tries to make you pay stupid amounts of money just to speed up or to play the game even though your not actually having fun. The gameplay sucks, fighting battles is the sort of battle where you have 3 lines of units and they just walk forward. Its not even a Total War game, but after the disaster of Rome 2....what is a modern Total War game I guess.Dissappointing is all I really have to say about this. Your not even really playing the game. Theres no skills required, your essentially just walking down a hall in terms of gameplay.Its crap.			"

												This is not a Total War game, it is just a pay2win mobile game. By hearing the title Total War I expect three things, a campaign map, epic scale battles and extended use of strategy. Unfortunately,I saw none of those main features in this game. Instead, it is mainly a city building game. There are the main resources that you use for costructing buildings and recruiting units. However, some processes take hours to be finished and you have to use gold which can be collected by two ways, or by completing missions and objectives, (which are just to build a number of specific buildings ,fight battles or to conquer new parts of the map, ) or by spending real money. The only thing that I personally liked was the teraforming feature because lakes and rivers can affect both positively and negatively the production of some resources. The battles are just a huge dissapointment because they are not huge and they have no strategy at all. Furthermore, you have to deploy your units on three lines , with maximum three units per line, they march towards the enemy and you have to just order charge at the right moment to have some bonus and there are some special abilities that give advantage to your units for a short time. Except from that, your units cannot move on a horizontal axis to help their fellow soldiers, they can attack only on the units that are in front of them. And the worst part is that the battles last for a few seconds.The visuals are great for a mobile strategy game. The map and the battles are 3d and generally the game does not look ugly. Instead, it looks quite beautiful. The audio is decent except from one part, the voice acting of the soldiers is the same from Rome II and no matter the fact that the British used to be christians back then you may hear them say ""praise the gods"". That shows how much some people from CA probably cared for their game by throwing in it files without checking them.After years of playing Total War games and trusting CA for making one of the best strategy game series, I got dissapointed by the fact that they use the Total War title for games that have nothing to do with the specific series. This game claims that it is a TW game while it is not. Moreover, it has no strategy, nor epic scale battles, nor a campaign map (I personally don't consider the map of the game as equal to the ones of other TW games) or any other feature that could make this game a part of the famous strategy game series. To be honest, It is addicting and fun,I will download it immediately when it will be released on android devices. On the other hand, I would not play this game on my pc, I would prefer to play some REAL TW games. I like it as a mobile game, Irecommend you to download it on your mobile devices, but it is not meant to be played on pc, it just screams out that it is designed solely for mobile devices. Please CA, if you want to make some good mobile TW games, you could just release the first games of the series (Shogun ,Medieval) with some grafical improvements that mobile devices can handle and some gameplay features of the newer TW games implemented.

												The game has a very interesting and nice features. There are a lot of negative review about this game regarding a slow pace of the game but the pace is actually very much O.K. because the game will progress when You log off, so You can decide how much time You spend micro managing to do things faster or just ask a batch job complete while You are busy with other things in Your real life :)Also as I have been playing the game it is really free and while You can buy things that will boost Your game it is not required by any means because with patience You seem to be able to achieve everything by Yourself. So this is really a free and interesting game to play.And there are some very interesting features that stand this game out in a crowd.The most interesting is that You can alter a landscape very much and the game will react in very interesting ways, depending on Your changes.The rivers will change their direction. You will see animals spawn in Your forests if You let them grow, providing You with a hunting opportunities. Or traders will settle along Your roads and a lot of other interesting events will happen.The seasons will change. Rivers will freeze. You will build housing for Your people that will spawn workforce for Your smithies and other type of ""industries"". You will build barracks to house various types of troops.You will arrange and maintain a small army from different kinds of troops that will gain experience and level up.A recent ""project"" of mine was to design a larger river around my borders that would have a deep waters for fishing. This took a lot of patience and trial and error to learn how to do it the best way.The features that I have not yet tried out is crafting and equipping Your troops with different kind of equipment.The only drawback is that a battle minigame is kind of silly a bit. Your troops will advance like blocks in tetris game and You will have to manage where they ""land"" and time charges properly, cast boosts for the troops and try to win. So in the sense of military simulation this game is far from being something You might expect from total war game. But as a city builder game this is really, really nice game to play.In my opinion this is a much better game than all the latest big budget SEGA games because here You have actually an interesting strategy game with all good for free - all You need is patience and no need to pay for additional dlc to get an actual content.

												Even though this does not feel like Total War (Since I never feel like I am at war) it is actually pretty nice, I hear so much about pay to win yet you can get gold in various ways and for free. I did at one point think that you needed to use gold for advanced units but after nearly ten levels I can make those units for free (By the looks of it, havn't done that yet) It is time consuming since it takes hours for some things, pretty much just the Fell/Harvest all and building. But I enjoy it and nobody can really complain about leveling up being too slow, they give you way too many stuff to do. So really I find it a fair game (Have not tryed dueling yet)			"

You mess up once, for example, lowering the ground instead of higherng it, and you end up screwing up all the land and stuff built on those land and cause flooding all around you. And there is no way to fix it, like even raising the land won't fix get it back to how it was. And there is no way to start over. Thats just ONE of the bugs. I won't go into detail but this little free game was poorly poorly made.			"

Just go back to your FB account, atleast there, you have something else to do while you wast your life away.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is TW coming at you saying GIVE ME YOUR  MONEY FOOLS. I would say its like a FaceBook game but at least with FB you can log off and still get somewhere. This one you have to have your game up and running at all times if you want to get anywhere and the lenght of time WOW. If you want to spend loads of hard earn money away this is the game.

												Its an OK to average kingdom building game but its very limiting and aggravating doing battles because the button cooldowns are so insanely slow, and the constantly having to readjust the ground levels to dig some things and then only be able to place certain buildings at certain heights of ground and having your kingdom flooded when it doesnt work out right.  Would be a great game if you could manipulate your troops in real time and not have some standing doing nothing and cant use them yet because of formations, and for the love of God reduce the cooldown on how fast you can select targets for the archers, the 5sec cooldowns makes me not even want to use them at all, and the constant releveling of the ground is overkill, a waste of resources, and stupid.  So in short its a great game with great potential for fun but is killed and made annoying to play by too many rules and limitations taking it from thumbs up to down and 5 stars to 1 star			"

												this game is 10/11>The game holds up together too good>The seasons and functions are too realistic to be true>The battles are interesting when you match your foeAnd lots of more things i would say makes this game awesomeThe only and ONLY thing i don't like about this is that it's pay to win but yes, it's just like every free-to-play game. The developers HAVE to make something to make money and that was the only thing they came up with. I really do recommend this game but it's a little pay to win. Play this game it's super realistic and interesting but i do not recommend buying gold because it's a waste of money since you can get gold in other ways too.			"

												This game is quite alright. It reminds of those old Facebook games that required a lot of clicking and no skill, but this game requires a good amount of skill and not as much clicking. The battle scenes though not up to par with Total War, are fun in their own right. The town/city building aspect is intriguing enough to keep you from being bored but the upgrade requirements for buildings and the like are very steep. It'll take a good long while to get a good foundation, but if you take about 10 minutes of your day in the morning and night its a good bit of fun .			"

												Now, despite my rating of this game I actually really have enjoyed my time in it. And for what it is its not a bad playthrough. But just some disturbing trends in it almost completely turn me off of it. Needing to pay gold (the games cash to coin currency) in order to unlock better units, such as spearmen. Though there is alternative options, such as forging them, not only do they not work 100% of the time, but you also dont even unlock it till later in the game. I was also rather bothered by the resources system, resources collected drop tiles which you need to click on in order to collect said resource. Needing to click on the tiles in order to collect them means you need to play the game in order to advance at all, and for the game being what it is I think its a dumb feature that would be immensely improved on simply by removing it. Also stone is very difficult to collect in large quantities, while you will never have any problems with wood or food, spending stone will usually leave you scraping the bottom of the barrel at early levels. And the combat system, while not being bad, isn't nearly good enough to hold my attention for long enough to keep my constantly playing in order to collect resources so I can advance.			"

												Ive played this game for about 20 min and let me tell you as a total war fan whos been playing for 6 years,and has played everygame,i gotta admit this dissapointed me.I understand that because the game is going to be cross platform they had to take some features out and baby the game down a little.Thats eaxtly what i feel like when i play this game is a little baby.The battles witch are supposed to be a cool thing about these games ,completly suck the strategy of them has just been taken out,you cant even flank units..The grapics are okay for being a cross platform game..Its like Clash of clans and age of empires baked a burned cake and added a little total war frosting on it.If you like cheesey ios games then this is for you but if your looking for a real challenge or amazing experience stick to shogun2 or any PC titles.I have faith though that they will edit this beta and at least make a half way decent game,because I know im not the only annoyed♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of fan.

												Not terrible but certainly not good. Falls down on the use of the total war name most of all in my opinion (explained below). It's a tablet game and nothing more, if this were a play store or Itunes review the score would be very different. It's not a PC game, f2p or not, end of discussion. But if Sega insist on offering it as a PC game I shall review it as one. 5/10I did have to think quite a lot about whether I could recommend this game and while it’s not a bad game per se it certainly isn’t a good game at the moment ( I appreciate it’s still in beta and a lot could change) . In fact to be fair to this game as a free-2-play it’s not too bad and miles ahead of Stronghold: kingdoms in both art style and mechanics. On the positive side I thought that the building and settlement creation were quite well done though they are a little basic. Kudos to the team for pretty excellent terrain height, excavation and water mechanic programing, it really helps to create this felling that the world itself can be shaped to suit your needs. The time required for building and resource gathering was pretty good, not obscenely long as in most free-2-plays (read as free-2-wait). On top of this you can even find and mine premium currency allowing any player no matter how stingy to gain some of the advantages. In fact if the game was purely the build section then I would actually recommend it.There are however massive issues with the battle system. And by massive issues I mean JESUS CHRIST WHY DID YOU THINK THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA? Yeah that level of bad. I do have to admit that most of my issues with the combat are simply that it is difficult to accept calling this a total war game. I am a die-hard fan of the series (hell I even like empire) and like many total war fans I love the complexity of tactics one can to utilize to win. The battles of Battles: Kingdom seem to have stripped all this away to be replaced with clicking to charge at the right time….what?..... WHAT?.... HOW HAVE YOU TURNED YOUR COMBAT INTO QUICK TIME EVENTS? QTEs in total war now, along with day one dlc you’d be forgiven for thinking EA had bought CA. That said Sega aren’t much better look what they did to sonic. I have't played Shogun 2 Battles but i see that the combat in that is turn based, why didn't they keep that? sure its not total war but at least it's still tactical not ♥♥♥♥ING QTEs!!! But my issues with the battles don’t stop there. I have a few other problems with it as well like why is there a cool down for ordering archers to fire? One unit fires on one enemy unit and I have to wait a good few seconds before I can order an entirely separate unit of archers to fire on an entirely separate unit of archers. The orders system is a nice idea but I don’t think it is well realised. The unit special abilities and general abilities from Rome 2 would’ve been a better style of system and each ability has advantages and disadvantages meaning that they are a tactical choice. The orders on the others hand you just spam every time the cool down timer is over.How did they mess this up so badly?Not something that gets my personal recommendation but if you’re a looking for a well-balanced f2p and you don’t consider this an affront to the good name total war then it’s not all that bad under the surface.

												I""m having a good casual time learning and playing this game. The combat is tricky to learn and engaging enough to want another battle. Win or lose. Combat troops are rock, paper and sissor types, but if a mistake is made, the user can use sideline buffs to help regain control of the situation. The art style of Total War shows through in the battles.The building system is pretty straight-forward with a good starting tutorial. I love how you can manage the terrian. You can even flood out your peasent huts if they tick you off and you build it right. :DThings i'd like to have seen.~Tooltips! And they can be turned off in settings.~Pre-Battle, Side-by-Side Matchups for positioning of units. At this point, it seems, I have to look at the mission troops screen, then open up my troops screen, then re-open the mission screen again. Yes, I""m lazy.~ In-game technology screen to plan ahead.I can't wait to try this on my mobile and will probrobly spend some money on it. To me, it deserves a thumbs-up. :) "

												Not terrible but certainly not good. Falls down on the use of the total war name most of all in my opinion (explained below). It's a tablet game and nothing more, if this were a play store or Itunes review the score would be very different. It's not a PC game, f2p or not, end of discussion. But if Sega insist on offering it as a PC game I shall review it as one. 5/10I did have to think quite a lot about whether I could recommend this game and while it’s not a bad game per se it certainly isn’t a good game at the moment ( I appreciate it’s still in beta and a lot could change) . In fact to be fair to this game as a free-2-play it’s not too bad and miles ahead of Stronghold: kingdoms in both art style and mechanics. On the positive side I thought that the building and settlement creation were quite well done though they are a little basic. Kudos to the team for pretty excellent terrain height, excavation and water mechanic programing, it really helps to create this felling that the world itself can be shaped to suit your needs. The time required for building and resource gathering was pretty good, not obscenely long as in most free-2-plays (read as free-2-wait). On top of this you can even find and mine premium currency allowing any player no matter how stingy to gain some of the advantages. In fact if the game was purely the build section then I would actually recommend it.There are however massive issues with the battle system. And by massive issues I mean JESUS CHRIST WHY DID YOU THINK THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA? Yeah that level of bad. I do have to admit that most of my issues with the combat are simply that it is difficult to accept calling this a total war game. I am a die-hard fan of the series (hell I even like empire) and like many total war fans I love the complexity of tactics one can to utilize to win. The battles of Battles: Kingdom seem to have stripped all this away to be replaced with clicking to charge at the right time….what?..... WHAT?.... HOW HAVE YOU TURNED YOUR COMBAT INTO QUICK TIME EVENTS? QTEs in total war now, along with day one dlc you’d be forgiven for thinking EA had bought CA. That said Sega aren’t much better look what they did to sonic. I have't played Shogun 2 Battles but i see that the combat in that is turn based, why didn't they keep that? sure its not total war but at least it's still tactical not ♥♥♥♥ING QTEs!!! But my issues with the battles don’t stop there. I have a few other problems with it as well like why is there a cool down for ordering archers to fire? One unit fires on one enemy unit and I have to wait a good few seconds before I can order an entirely separate unit of archers to fire on an entirely separate unit of archers. The orders system is a nice idea but I don’t think it is well realised. The unit special abilities and general abilities from Rome 2 would’ve been a better style of system and each ability has advantages and disadvantages meaning that they are a tactical choice. The orders on the others hand you just spam every time the cool down timer is over.How did they mess this up so badly?Not something that gets my personal recommendation but if you’re a looking for a well-balanced f2p and you don’t consider this an affront to the good name total war then it’s not all that bad under the surface.

												I""m having a good casual time learning and playing this game. The combat is tricky to learn and engaging enough to want another battle. Win or lose. Combat troops are rock, paper and sissor types, but if a mistake is made, the user can use sideline buffs to help regain control of the situation. The art style of Total War shows through in the battles.The building system is pretty straight-forward with a good starting tutorial. I love how you can manage the terrian. You can even flood out your peasent huts if they tick you off and you build it right. :DThings i'd like to have seen.~Tooltips! And they can be turned off in settings.~Pre-Battle, Side-by-Side Matchups for positioning of units. At this point, it seems, I have to look at the mission troops screen, then open up my troops screen, then re-open the mission screen again. Yes, I""m lazy.~ In-game technology screen to plan ahead.I can't wait to try this on my mobile and will probrobly spend some money on it. To me, it deserves a thumbs-up. :) "

												I had heard great things about total war, and expected to see them here. I was hoping for massive scale battles of armies I could maneuver around a large map. Instead I got a ""gridlike"" combat system in a ridiculously small area and a town to build up. 2/10, wasted my 15 minutes. If you really like this style of game, maybe you can enjoy it. What did I expect from a free to play game designed for mobile... Well, Clash royale has a better combat system than this, and its not even that advanced for a mobile game.			"

												So when I read the reviews on this game the majority of complaints where about the paying to speed things up ect. Ok the gold thing I dont mind so much. you dont get anything for free in this world afterall. and its 2 cents per gold. My main problem with this game is it ripped me off. I spent about $30+ building my kingdom up. I had 4 castle towns lvl'ed to 2's and 3's max number of farms, ranchs, fishing docks, and the whole thing sculpted with rivers encircling the farms and deep lakes teaming with fish. Not to mention the Army I put togather, max lvl. max lvl armour and weapons for all!  Didint log on for a bit. Everything is gone. all the stuff i paid for gone. when logging into my account it starts me at the begining.  So I would like to thank the developer for stealing from me.  You lost a paying customer, and have ensured I will not be playing any future titles you produce.			"

												This game probably has the potential to be considered fun, but it certainly is not right now. The reason is that you are limited in every aspect of growth, required to spend Gold (pay currency) in order to complete tasks instantly. This becomes maddening very quickly once you realize you require gold for basically every aspect of growth that in other games you would unlock with time and experience. The best types of units require large sums of gold to hire, leaving player who do not pay incapable of feilding a force containing more than one of these kinds of units without playing for eternities or paying. The actual battle system has very little to do with total war, instead playing like an automated combat rpg in the style of Disciples, where units are on a grid and almost exclusively deal with the units directly in front of them. Thus almost the entire combat portion of the game is fighting pre designed layouts of enemy units, which are designed to cause trouble for players without any of the top shelf units. This over simplification of combat reduces Cavalry to a rock-paper-scissors role rather than a strategic weapon; artillary peices are outright removed from combat  and instead offers periodic direct fire. This bait and switch for combat would be tolerable if the system was not designed to make you wait up to an hour for your units to ""recover from wounds"" for each unit that takes noticable damage during a fight. After three hours, every part of the game is reduced to a painful crawl if you refuse to buy gold. Upgrading buildings costs several hundred of multiple resources, things you gather 20-40 at a time of. Combined with several pay mechanics like advisors and contracts there is just way too much content that is purposefully put in place to make you want to spend. I'm sick of the meritless ""well they got to make money somehow"" arguement that is perpetuated by these sorts of schemes. They could of just as easily made the pacing much easier by increasing the amount of gold given to you and reducing costs, etc. There are ways to make the game bearable, they just did not want to do it. If the game replicated the total war combat system in the small space the battles took place, reduced the arbitrary timers, and offered more in the ways of appearance items for those soldiers than I would of been interested. Sadly all we get is an off-brand Stronghold online game, which is doubly odd because most consider Stronghold the off-brand travian. All in all, a very shoddy attempt at turning Total Wars into a mobile phone experience. The combat is designed to limit strategy and only respect hard counters and luck mechanics and the buildings aspect is the equivilent of giving a painter this gigantic canvas and asking him to pay them for every mark made on the canvas, all the paints, the honor of being there working on the canvas, as well as the ""canvas using"" tax. There is very little ""Total War"" anything besides the presence of units that look like they are from Total War.  "

Yes some things can take a while, but so far I havn't felt it impact any gameplay. That is to say I havn't thought ""Oh man I really want to do [Whatever here] but have to wait ages"". Theres usually other things to do in the mean time. Battles aren't amazingly TW-like but they do require a bit of thinking and can be quite fun if you do the more challenging battles. Overall, for all the bad reviews, this was better than expected.			"

												Is it possible to play this on a kindle fire hd?? It has a ""play now"" button and an ""install steam"" button, even though I've already downloaded the steam kindle app. When I press the play button nothing happens.  Send me a message if you've figured out a way to launch this on a kindle please. Or if it's even possible for that matter. Thanks.			"

												It started as ininteresting game, it's understandable that they need to encourage some players to buy their stuff, but suddenly I started to be invaded dialy (right now I've 5 invading armies) with enemies ridiculously superior than my non-bought troops, so instead of motivating me to pay they discouraged me to keep playing the game. Don't lose your time with this, unless you're going to pay big bucksfor it.			"

												1) look, it's a mobile game, it wasn't built for your gaming PC, so don't judge it as if it had been. It's great as a casual game played on a tablet, a triple-A title it ain't.2) yes, it's pay-to-win, but who said you need to ""win"" a casual mobile game? Duelling mode is clearly full of people who did pay to win. Consider this a tax on stupidity which makes the game free to play for you, just enjoy it for what it is for a couple of hours and have the maturity to quit once the grind is setting in. conclusion: it's a cute little game, it's free to play, so take it or leave it, don't b*tch about it not being what it never tried to be.

												A review about Total War Battles: KINGDOM is simple as this... Is this a good PC game? No, not at all... Will it be good for mobile? Probably one of the best. These ""browser-like"" strategy games that we're all used to from way back in the early Facebook days, with games like Evony, Tribal Wars, Kingdom Age, Dawn of Fantasy, etc. don't work as a stand-alone PC game. Their models are pay-to-win, everything takes minutes to hours to harvest or build... These are the types of game you quickly jump on in your sparetime on your iPad or various other tablets. At this point, I'm only continuing to play the game to prep myself for the mobile release so I have a good basis to stand on when the switch to mobile comes. Basically, me doing what I can with this accurent account to transfer to my iPad and keep playing.You can definitely tell this game is meant for mobile as well. They way the battles and castle-town building functions just screams, ""MOBILE!""Final review? Don't bother while it's PC only. Wait until the mobile release to really find out for yourself if this game is worth it.			"

												This game really isn't for fans of previous Total War games but it's charming in it's own right. Even when you loose battles you'll progress which makes the game less discouraging and the quick play times means this game directly appeals to the mobile market. Unlike most MMO's out there TWB Kingdoms won't suck the soul out of your life once you start playing it.On the downside though, you'll find it difficult to obtain special weapons and troops without spending money or doing some serious soul sucking grinding. Overall it's OK, I enjoyed my around 12+ hours I spent playing it.

												Ive been playing for a few hours now. I see how the game is supposed to be, but they dont seem to be able to reach that, the gathering times are too long, the resource respawning is too long, and the AI in battles can be realy hard to beat when they have 3 units of mercs and i have mostly Levies.It could probably become one of the best games on the mobile market for this kind of game, if i didnt have to wait an hour to get my wood from a tree then wait for tree stumps to vanish, then grass to grow, then trees to grow, all this work will probably take a day or 3 and for what? 20 wood? i need around 500 wood to be able to UPGRADE that wood cutter. Then again. it is a good game, its nice to be able to freely expand my town/city while having to worry about rivers and hills to be able to build my town. the combat is 200x better than all the other bad/weird mobile games (except games like Clash of Clans wich have a pretty good combat system for Mobile games) I would not recomend this if your hoping for it to be a ""conquer the world with a massive army"" like in the other Total wars. Ofcourse i wouldnt call this a Total war game if i was CA though. I would recomend it thought to people that feel they want something to do while they are bored or have nothing better to do. Dont think that when you install this you will be met by being able to build hundreds of buildings in under a minute, its not, this is a time game, you will have to wait for your buildings, wait for your resources and wait for your army. I like that CA is expanding into new territories of gaming, but using the same name for some totaly other game is just not right. Even though i can see that calling it Total war would be able to make more ppl download it....smart move CA, smart move.			"

Product received for free
												Ok, so I know what some of these other comments are saying is true, no, it isn't a generic Total War game like all the others, it is a Kingdom (City) builder game with a slight more tactical battle system. At first there is alot of stuff to learn but after a while you get to know it a bit more (I have only been playonig for about half an hour and I'm starting to get the hang of it).Obviously there are downsides, but really, IT'S FREE, and only takes a few minutes to download, so why not just try it!

												Total War Battles: KINGDOM is extremely interesting free strategy game that I had recently started playing. The game itself has to offer a decent number of buildings to construct and three awesome game modes. One of the things that I really liked is that we can create our own character to rule with. We can also create our own flag that will represent our army in battles. Besides all of that there is one more thing that attracted me. In the game we can notice that from certain period of time seasons of the weather start changing.I would recommend this game to all strategy game lovers who are seeking for more territory to conquer.9/10			"

												basically, I've never played such a scam, it should be called total pay to win. only way to get the best units is to pay A LOT of money, then you spend 90% of your resources building dams to stop/divert flooding, which just ends up flooding again. The missions are a total fix, they state that they are easy/ challenging but seriously, they just put in loads of units at third tier, then if you raise your units stats slightly, the game thinks you're now a pro and jacks up the difficulty and lowers the chance of getting any bonuses from missions you might be able to do.

												Despite this game have the Battles-Part in the name I decided to give it a try. After all the game looked good this time around and the city-building seemed interesting. This sadly led to me wasting around 2 hours of my life.Now let's take a look at the good points first:-The graphics are great. From the landscape to the buildings and even the units (not that you will have a lot of time to   look at them)-You have the ability to build some truly impressive cities. it won't be easy and it sure as hell won't be anytime soon that  you have one, but in the end the player is (theoretically) able to do it.Sadly the downsides easily outweight those good sides:-The combat is lane based. I personally HATE those kinds anyway but I thought ""Hey, maybe CA actually made it good"",  but the answers was a loud all-encompassinge ""Nope"". It's just run-of.the-mill lane-combat. No flanking, barely any   control over the units/battlefield, a very limited amount of troops, both in numbers and in variation and in general all   the suckage that is lane-combat.-Upgrading your units takes a lot of time. And I mean a LOT of it. The first upgrade for any of the basic attributes costs   20 points, the next 40. Now I dont know if I'm just bad or what but I got around 7-12 per fight. That wouldn't be so bad   if the fight themselves would be fun (they are not) and if there were no freaking enforced break after every battle (if   they were harmed). You can of course skip it but that requires hard gold aka real money.-The game in general is just slow, by the way: did you know that grass grows faster than this games plays? Okay that   was exaggerated but the fact remains that the amount of time you spend waiting is ridiculous. Gathering ressources   from random spots takes 10 minutes which is okay, same goes for excevating stone but gathering wood and wood   takes days and this time I'm not even kidding. Wood and crops both take 8 hours to chop/gather and then another 10  hours for crops and up to 2 (or 1 and a half) to regrow. Now it wouldn't be so bad if you would at least get a decent  amount but you only get 10 per field... 10! Though you can once again skip all this waiting with gold... hooray.My verdict is:  BEST GAME OF ALL TIME 13/10!!! *shot*  Stay away from it, at least for now. It isn't the worst game of all time and maybe even not  bad game all together but it certainly if on the wrong platform. It might have been fun on a tablet or a smartphone (yeah sure) but for the PC?A easy way to improve the game would be to reduce the amount of time to do... well everything. I wont demand the removal because that will never happen (hell not even the reduce will happen). But if the taim for the ressources would be halved and the time for unit-recovery, unless they were annihilated, removed it would already be a way better game. Oh and add more strategic depth don't forget that... especially the flanking. "

												Total War Battles: KINGDOM is free to play game that is a kingdom builder with some battle.  It worked, looked good, sounded good, played ok.  Has a tutorial.  I guess this might be a mobile device port.Requires long amount of time (Real Time: Days to Hours) to complete everything production wise.  Store sell gold for money, but you don't earn gold by playing far as i seen.  Soldier units cost much gold and completing thing faster cost gold.  Take a lot of mouse presses to do stuff.This game Can trully be called Pay to Advance or Pay to Win.  Try it, but delete it if you have to pay real money.   For more info:

												I do recommend this game if you're looking for a strategic battlefield simulation game. It has everything you need, and an easy levelling system, easy resources, and a tough setup that will keep you on your toes. Water works well into the terrain, and the layout of the buildings are well-done. The only downside I could find to this game is the PvP. You can be a low level, and it will literally put you with someone 7 levels higher than you just because they have a rank close to yours. This is extremely unfair and should be fixed, but I'm sure they're MUCH too busy to do that. Otherwise, a good game. I do recommend it.			"

												Huge pay to win it takes forever to do anything and if you pvp you will always face someone who has spent a crap ton of money on the game and their army will always be stronger you get crap xp so very soon the easy ai will way over power you you get crap for resources so if you even want to stand any chance at all get ready to shell out hundreds of dollars of real money on this game			"

												Man, CA really wants money... unless you can wait for years, this game forces you to spend all your gold (real currency for special currency which you've seen a million times on mobile games) on producing materials to build more things. I love the idea but simple things like farming in a pain in the a**. The battles are cheap and very lame, whoever taps the charge button at the right time wins the battle. The beginning is great, you have so many resources and it seems like you can build a massive kingdom, but if you want to do anything you have to use all of your resources to do it. Roads are useless, buildings have to touch in order to build more and a bunch of other cr*p. I'm getting fed up with these mobile games ripping me off by using time against me, I just wanted a game where I could build my own kingdom the way I want to, without the restriction of having to spend all my real money on freaking farming and mining and getting silver (silver is impossible to produce, it takes forever just to get 20). Roads should count a connective material for buildings and I should be able to change the land without having to change 1000 things around it first (there is a height thing where the surrounding land has to be a height before you can change the height of the intended hexagon). You level quickly and gain a million things quickly but because castles can only build a few buildings you are fu*ked (you need a castle in order to build on a 15x15 land). To summarize, it's like a generic mobile game with a few interesting terrain features and a semi unique battling system used in previous total war mobile games. I have not played for long but I really want future players to know that the beginning rocks until you notice that you're sh*t out of materials. As well as I do not believe that other players may attack your kingdom and take all your resources, I do not know if that is a thing in this game but it seems unlikely (I really like that feature haha!).

												Ok I have played the game for some time now and have 3 regions and only one level 2 castle which took forever to grind  to get there. I tried to get the 4th region but the units they have are all level 2 and  3 units and they also have a onager that just flat out wipes your level 1 units off the map. So I figured yea this looks to be pay to win so what do I do I drop $20.00 to get some better units . Oh guess what you can only buy 1 of those units lol.... but your enemy has 3 of that unit and they are level 2 and 3 you lose. So next I figure I will just try level the one unit but guess what you need to level that building first!! OMG!!!.... yes for every unit you have you have to level that building up first to make it rank 2 unit and it costs 1800 of one resource and 1500 of some other resource to complete just one building.  Not sure what it will cost to go rank 3 but I can imagine a heck of alot more for sure!!....And you still have to grind to level up those units too. My concern is I noticed in the video it says that you protect your lands from other players. Though I have not been invaded by any players only AI so far.  But my concern is after all the time you spend on trying to level everything and spend real money just to lose everything to someone else who is Rich and wants your Land . your just SOL.. Not sure if thats just multiplyer version or not.  Single player version is all that is available atm.  But you can battle other players in what they call a Duel..  So my 2 cents is if you have alot of time and money this game is for you if not stay away.  I'm going to continue playing it since I have already donated to it and see what happens down the road when the campaign part opens up. I will then post another  review then.			"

												I screamed when I played my first battle in this game, wait, nevermind, I didnt play any battles, I just watched a one.This game has none of the features of a Total War game. There is no total war, the battles are disgusting in how they foul the image of previous titles, and there are no kingdoms, just glorified estates. This game could have been a quirky simple, mainstream version of total war for free, but all it is, is Clash of Clans with a respected name. This game screams for your money, and while i expected that a free to play gme would need it's way of earning money,this is just disgraceful. This game does not deserve the name it bears, and to watch this game explain its mechanics to me like I'm a brain damaged horse, is to see the horrible future for this franchise.I for one wanted a Total War game that had the same micro transactions as Team Fortress, or DOTA, a game that is simplified but still has an enjoyable, simple combat system, wih small armies, but soldiers that matter, that you'd care about. But unfortuntely, that sentence doesnt have enough $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$			"

TL;DR at the bottom.People need to realise that this is a game designed for tablet / mobile thus not a title between all the other Total War games but an offshot for a completely different platform. Imagine playing the latest Total War on tablet, not happening.How can you tell? Controls. Mouse only, no keybindings.Mobile games are coming to steam! So are console games! Deal with it! To start a hate train because a game seemed to come to the ""wrong neighbourhood"" is unsightly. They can do their part on steam too but you are not forced in any way to play them.This game is also ""F2P"" (Depending on your definition) which with most certainty includes microtransactions like most F2P titles (Big suprise there). Being F2P also creates paywalls which are either non scalable because the content behind it is exclusively for paying users or tough but not impossible to reach for players who do not want to spend real money. And in the end becomes a slowpaced game for everyone who decides not to spend money.First of all I'd like to dispel some of the false or lacking information on which most reviews are based creating a maelstrom of bad reviews from players fresh out of the tutorial.The most popular : Harvesting wheat / felling trees -> 8 hours waitingAfter building your farm wheat fields start to appear around it, depending on the distance to water the time until they are able to be harvested differs.After the wheat is finally harvestable you are given TWO CHOICES: 1. Harvest a single spot : 20 min. = 20 unitsor2. Harvest ALL spots : 8 hours = 10 units / spotAs you can see option no. 2 is the worst possible choice.If this is the reason you quit playing and gave the game a bad review then you should have paid more attention to what you are doing instead of causing a temper tantrum for no reason.It is quite a waiting game at the beginning, but every sane gamer would not stare at the monitor waiting for the counter to drop to zero, that's why this is more of an inbetween games game.The most concerning : Pay to win / Paywall (Paying users exclusive content)I think we all can agree that in a situation where you pit equally skilled players against one another, that the one who can pay real money to give him an edge in combat will most definetely win if the game is not heavily RNG-based.However the real question here is: Is the equally skilled player condemned to never overcome this hurdle even with zeal and competetive spirit? The answer to that is : He can, with time.Let me explain:There are NO paying users exclusive : Buildings / Units / Buffs / Equipment, every player has the same selection and arsenal. Unlike other mobile games where the best buildings and units are exclusively obtainable through real money.All players do not have acess to everything on the get go. You need to reach a certain level regardless wether you want to pay or not to have buildings (and their corresponding units) unlocked. Every military building comes with a selection of 3 to 4 different units depending on the building. Example : You build your first stable and it can house only one mounted unit. After building your stable you choose which one you want. (F2P ALERT) The first two of the three units you can choose without any hitch (100% free), however the third is behind a real money paywall (That shook you a little, right?). But against all odds you are able to ""craft"" the third unit and kick out the one currently stationed (no money paid).Those units are statwise superior than the other but not unobtainable for non paying users.As for Buffs and Equipment those can also be crafted like military units and given to those or used on the battlefield.As for the game itself. It is pretty slowpaced but steadily gains velocity as you progress. You start off with 1 of 6 regions and you have a restriction of how many buildings you can mantain within this region. This restriction gradually decreases the more regions you liberate and castles you upgrade within each region. Effectively increasing your playtime each session. I do not want to venture any further into the building system and the little tricks therein, because a little trial and error doesnt hurt.The tutorial is rather short and gives you the basics of the basics but not all the vital information you desperately need. In my opinion this is a bad choice of tutorial, instead of having tutorial pieces pop up when you need them, say changing seasons, new buildings, new units, new regions, small events etc. they leave you out to fend for yourself and figure it out on your own. Along with the tutorial the tooltips also lack information as well as numbers.Tooltips need a desperate overhaul and the tutorial needs to be more than just an introduction to the basics of basics. To counter a lack of information a compedium of such would have been a nice way to make wating somehow enjoyable. The combat is a squad based rock-paper-scissors system (if that makes any sense). Every unit consists of multiple soldiers and counter or is countered by another unit. Lance > Rider > Shield > Archer > Lance > and so on. Additionaly armor is a factor Mace > leather + chain , Axe > Plate.If that wasn't enough, in the beginning the two facing units charge each other to engage in close combat depending on your timing, you do heavy charge damage before the brawl begins or none at all (pre-emptive strike). But wait! There's more!Every unit can get one of two abilites purchased through experience acquired through battle. Making your units more diverse and useful in certain situation. For example switching your shield units with a your mounted units which are engaged with lance units (rock-paper-scissors, remember?) to avoid certain death for your horsemen.To top it all of you can have in your 9-squad army up to 3 and at least 1 siege unit. Ranging from ballistaes, trebuchets or mangonels. Ballistaes hit only enemy units for moderate damage, instantly killing weak armored targets. Trebuchets hit all units for a good amount of damage. Mangonels leave the area they hit burning and damaging any and all units that remain in this area. Every siege unit act as an ability with their own innate cooldown before you can use them again. But if you have 3 siege units and 6 fighting units and on the other hand your oppenent has 9 fighting units which disperse your 6 quite fast you have lost even with the siege units still intact und unscathed. (I don't think you can actually damage / destroy siege units)Quite the arsenal and not as simple a battlesystem I dare say.After every battle your units need time to recuperate depending on how wounded they are 10 to 20 min. or if unscathed not at all. However you cannot engage in another battle while a unit in your army is still recuperating. Yes, you can skip waiting with a little bit of moneyflow but if you are eager to fight battle after battle it can become very expensive and you should play another Total War game.The experience your units gain can be used to either upgrade the unit itself thus adding more soldiers to this unit, upgrade melee damage, range damage, armor rating or charge damage. Or as already mentioned purchase one of two abilites for this unit which may turn the tide of battle.TL;DR: It's a F2P inbetween-games-(tablet)game with no content locked behind a paywall (no paying user exclusives). Paying players cannot exceed the limits of a non-paying player. Slowpaced at the start with steadily increasing session lengths. Lack of information may result in uneffecient use of terrain, buildings or units. Not a game for the impatient.This will get downvoted to hell because those who do, are either those you didn't grasp the concept of the game or jumped on the hate train for the lulz.			"

												1.This is actually a sequel to the previous game which is Total War Battles : Shogun2.It is the first time Creative Assembly created an MMO for tbe TW series but that doesen't mean it's a bad thing though!3.If anyone ask me why i played TW,it's because i kinda like the idea of putting a historical setting such as Rome,Shogun,Attila,Kingdoms,Empire,Napoleon except for that last one which is a Fantasy setting.4.For fans of TW,i would recomended that you better play other TW games besides TW Warhammer because it is FICTION!5.For fans of WARHAMMER,TW WARHAMMER is a best choice for you but sadly CA hasn't made a lot of factions such my all time favorites which is Skaven,Tomb Kings,Lizardmen,Dark and High Elves,Arabia.6.The answer is either yes or no depending on the people who played it.

												I have been playing this game for some 17.6 hours over several weeks( whic is constantly upgrading and waiting), I think it is extremely difficult to understand alot of the game mechanics. the water fluidity mechanics for example can completely ruin your entire map if you try to excavate and change your terain to build over the winter. come spring everything can flood before you realize your mistake. the crafting system is absurd in the fact of the amount of resources per crafting stage..yes 5 crafting stages per item with more materials then could reasonably be put into a shield for example. Combat missions for begining players is at best a slaughter, which is designed to make you pay for gold to heal your units..pay to play..the map is not big enough to correctly build roads between the first new area you can win/pay tribute to gain. By the time you try to build roads adjusting the terrain to do so, you ruin the correct aspect of farming/herding/grazing mechanics, and oh yeah dont forget the flooding. It took me along time to build/rebuild buildings to locate them properly within the given terrain..its bearily possible because you place x amount of buildings before you level which unlocks the buildings you should have placed corectly the first time..woops wasted time and resouces again..then to realize the harbor once you can make one doesnt work right because the ships cant get up the river to the fish..lol..demolish.. rebuild terain..try to make a river to reach them..oops you cant lower terain uphill to the level of the fish..ugh..I hope the game has a wipe upon release because I really would do so much better now that I know what I should have done if the information would have been available to learn how beforehand!The game has great potential if some better information was available to new players before they make game ending mistakes..flood entire map for example..hard to recover from..with no option to delete and start anew.

												It's one of those facebook games where progression is based on how long you wait and gameplay consists of getting stuff ready to wait for. The combat consists of waiting for your ability cooldowns and wishing that you could order your archers to shoot something (but you can't because you have to wait on a cooldown since you already told some completely different archers to shoot something else). The objecive of the game is to gather resources so you can improve your infasructure so that you can raise an army that you can try using to keep yourself from getting bored while waiting to gather resources. Another great strategy is to play a different game to keep yourself from getting bored while waiting to gether resources, but then since you won't be needing those resources for anything since you won't be bored enough from playing this game to need an army to attempt to stave off that boredome, you might as well just not play this game to begin with.On the plus side, it's kinda pretty. You can watch the little knights pace back and forth, and the birds fly in circles, and the peasants walking down a long road that leads nowhere, and a tiny little fisherman sitting on the lake in his little boat as he waits for the fish to bite.

It's a buggy mess that will end up being a Farmville with soldiers. Total nope. I was actually looking forward to a fun, turn based game based on medieval England. And it's not.

												Constantly getting kicked out of the game.......and cant even log back in now......no fecking support......dont touch with a barge poleIts hard to believe but they have managed to make the battles even worse than before. Still reinforcing enemy armies to a ridiculous amount and bringing on troops designed to specifically defeat whatever troops you field. I.E spamming spearmen after spearmen against knights. Two lots of Trebuchets Catapults along with a full enemy army with reinforcements.......oh and in this particular case they also had the fear ability at 70% by the look of it as almost an entire unit ran away.The only reason I can think of that they have completely messed up the combat is to encourage people to buy gold to heal their troops.Frankly I lost interest in what could have been a very good little game a long while ago.This steaming turd has only one use now and thats keeping some programmers and designers and whoever the ♥♥♥♥ else is responsible for this being homeless at Christmas so for that I'm thankful but the game is garbage.

												Overall its one of the best free to play town building game. Has some great concepts such as game effecting seasons and terrain modifying. If you like a slight mixture of civ 5, past total war games, and stronghold then you may like this game.But I do think it would be a more popular game/ better to play if it was buy to play or if it leaned less on paying for gold to actually get/do stuff. It could focus more on advisors,perks,customization with the in game purchases rather than pay some gold to buy a unit or to get tons of resources to upgrade a building/ craft a unit. Also a sort of info panel on units, buildings, game concepts, etc. would help. Because sometimes I would find myself building in an area where it will not function or building something like the knights manor where you can only have one unit of that type.Pros:Casual (if you like that)Good ConceptsGood EnvironmentCustomization of units,town,environment, etc.Quest systemCons:Casual (if you dont like that)Some things cost rediculous amounts of silver/resources to upgrade, sort of forcing the player to grind for days or to use goldNo info panelSummary: You should give it a try, though depending on who you are you will probably uninstall it. It is in beta so you can't really hate on it because it is still being developed and does require info from the community to help out devs. To an extent you can play the game f2p but there will eventually be moments where you will end up spending gold to advance. It is built more for mobile device users who usually do spend $ for in game currency rather than pc gamers.I will probably continue to play it. But I do hope that it improves and leans more towards pc user gameplay rather than casual mobile players.			"

												I've played this game a few hours now and have mixed feelings.It playes like a browser multiplayer RTS, except that the city building is much better, everything has a timer.Pro:- Like the city building and resource management system- GFX is good for this kind of game- Like the easy, but strategic combatCons:- Miss seing other players on the map- Miss interacting with other players (other than duels)- Where's the alliance system?- Should be player controlled land and cities to conquer (Have not seen any yet)They have created a good plattform from which to expand with many features. It's war, so let us wage war agains other players too!I'm gonna keep playing and expanding my territory for many hours yet, but what happend when the six regions is mine? What's the end-game goal then? You should try this game out and let's hope they expand with more features tuned toward player interaction :)			"

												So both my friend and i have started playing, To put this to the test one of us bought £10 worth of Gold Bars, Turns out if you buy gold bars the cost for you to complete an action with it goes -UP- Not very subtle way of making more money out of people DEV-team, You should be ashamed of yourselves.When you do your server wipes will you be returning gold to players who have purchased it? Etc etc, You are more than happy to get your gold shop working perfectly but you cant seem to solve major issues in plenty of time given.Just a look through the STEAM-review of this game is pretty much all we need to know about this poor attempt at a cash grab on mobile data. This shouldnt even be on steam .. As a long term supporter and player of total-war games, I am very dissapointed that they would sink this low.			"

												Total War Battles series for mobile plattforms.Most people seem to confuse the Battle series which is a more casual approach towards mobile plattforms for the full blown Total War games. This is not the case. There are two games in the Battle series. The old Shogun and now this Kingodm. These are ment to compete with other mobile freemium strategy games out there on tablets etc.Kingdom is by far the best game Ive ever tried in this category and I look very much forward to have it on my iPad. The really neat thing this time around is that you can play the game on all plattforms. PC, Tablet etc. and that is a great feature for a mobile game.For its category it has great depth and immersion and Im totally hooked and played close to 40 hours of the Open Beta with 3 characters in parallell. Of course, being a Beta you must expect a lot of issues and be patient.Looking very much forward to having this on my iPad :).			"

												I really enjoy the terraforming, city planning,  and the battle. but the games really need a restart button.Should not try to rush the game, but play it in an interval of period of time.battle only takes around 2 minutes. As you progress, the battle become more difficult and you have to figure out ways to counter the enemy.Terraforming and building city is great. such as drying out an entire lake to redo irragation and fishing pond or forest land. takes forever, but the final outcome is supprising. The resource ouput increases without any battles.City planning is difficult, because the game is still in beta version and their are no tips or help wiki. You learn by mistake.At the start focus on controlling the first two regions by building up an army and a battle strategy. After that,  I went into complete domestic planning (farming, controlling river, quarry...) to increase resouce output like food, stones and woods.Silver can easily be earn by battle, so do not waste too much time on that resource.

												I didn't get this originally because of all the negative reviews.  If you go into this expecting ""total war farmville"" like most of the reviews make this game sound like, this is actually really well done.  You all but NEED a touchscreen computer or tablet though, because using a mouse is just inconvenient.  However for what you're paying (nothing) this game is really enjoyable, and if you don't mind a game you can only play for 20-40 minutes a few times a day the pace is actually pretty well done.  Yes, you can pay for things with gold to speed it up, and at the very start I would suggest doing that, but now that I've played for a while I have enough troops I can cycle through them and play for a comfortable amount of time before stopping to do something else.It's not a total war game, and if you thought you were going to get anything like a full total war game for free you're insane.  This is a large step above and beyond pay to win games right now.  Yes, if you want to be the best you have to pay, but if you don't care about how well you rank on leaderboards and just play the game at your own pace it's kind of zen.			"

												Game has many interesting concepts yet fails to deliver sustanable long term interest. This game is essentually a micropay journey through a sandbox that becomes smaller and smaller with every acomplishment. The further the player progresses in the game, the longer it takes to acomplish simple tasks such as upgrading troops and and buildings. While the game allows for multiple stradegies to ""farm"" resources, the cost of advancement is clearly designed to frustrait the player into buying gold. Unlike most micopay gamers, buying gold does little to quicken the play of the game. The gold component simply allows you to puchase better units that allow you to advance game play a little farther, prolonging the agony of farming for days to upgrade buildings or units. Oddly enough, after all of the time you spend saving and gathering, once you finally can upgrade a building, you have to wait a few hours more or spend some gold. One silver lining is that the games use of changing enviroments . While lost on this game, this feature could be very interesting in other more high profile turn based stradegy games...			"

												I dont see why everyone says its pay to win, you can get everything over a long period of time, Those who claim its pay to win are impatient. Go back to COD kids. Adult games take TIME to play. (Pay to Win is when you HAVE to pay money to get the best content)What ever its resorces or Gold (Cash Shop Currency). You are able to get Both over a long period of time, naturaly. This game is not meant to be played constaintly.  A Perfect game for when your at work, or need a quick distraction. Yes there is mini transactions that give you pointless cosmetics, but as you level you gain more cosmetics to use. At first glance it seems like a dull setup but it gets better as you level and open more land. "

												It's hard to get into the city building part because it's sooooooo slooooooow paced.  Wait ages to get a pittance from your resource supply nodes.  Battles are a joke.  Minimal control over your units once battle starts.  Global cooldowns* applied to multiple units makes any kind of on the fly deployment reorganization or [ranged] target change a huge hassle.  Unless you throw money at it, I can't see this as anything more than a minor distraction once or twice a day(like while you're on the can).  The four hours play time I have/[had at time of review], is about 10-12 sessions because there is so little to do.  * They don't seem to apply to AI though.  I had one enemy end unit move two times in a row, to the other end slot.  It was a cavalry unit so I had my spears lined up to them before the battle.  I started my move before their first move was over, but before my units were finished swapping, they were already starting their next swap.  Before my move cooldown was up, the fighting had begun.

												If you give it some time, this game is very satisfying to play. However, it does take patience to appreciate, especially in the beginning. Once you get rolling though you can craft everything availible in the cash shop and it won't take forever like many are saying. My cities are pulling in ample resources after day 3. A big tip here, read the official forums for helpful guids. Many of the ingame mechanics/functions are not self-explanatory. If you like city building/strategy this game is a gem. I love terraforming my kingdom to suit my needs and the battles are simple, but strategic.			"

												it a game that on first side is very bad but when it comes to the battles there very fun especial later on in the game resource gethering is taking long but it's made for being of line it's not a game where you just go sit and play for two houres the fact that it is on computter makes it for me alot easier to keep playing it for on the mobile things i do not play much  my advice is to just give it some time  and then say or you like it or not and do not focus on the economic side of the game but on the bbattle acpect cause that's were the game is made for.

												All the negative reviews for this game compare it to all the other total war games, such as Shogun, Rome, Medieval, etc. Compared to them, yes, this game IS not good. However, this is a MOBILE game (At least not at the moment). This game was made to be played on a tablet as well a computer. As a mobile game, this game is great. So before I say more, I will be treating this as a MOBILE game in this review.Battles: Pros:Great detailSimple and funStill requires the use of tactics and stretegyCan be very challenging at pointsMany different units to the game, from mercenaries to vikingsCons:Only 1 unit against 1 unit in close combatCannot destroy artilleryRecharging orders to shoot, move, or stop shooting- probably the worst part.No flankingCampaign/Empire buildingPros:Great detailExpanding your kingdom is really fun. You get to conquer territories and expand you empire usint tiles, which allow you to create your own cities.Cons:Wait times for building, gathering, etc can be a very long time (12 hours is the longest I have seen so far.) But compared to other free mobile games, wait times are really not that bad. *cough* CoC *cough*This game is definitly one of the best free to play strategy games I have played. If you like the genre, this is a game you should try out. The only thing I would change is to make some things not require currency (Gold) that requires ""micro-transactions"" (I qoute that because you CAN get gold without paying for it, fairly easily compared to other games) But other then that, Im having a great time with the game.

												Now I love(d) the Total War series, I've played everything from Rome I to Rome II, and I can say, that as a long time TW player, I don't think this is a good Total War game, infact I question if it should even be associated with TW. But, as a video game player in general, I think this a decent game. Sure they expect you to pay microtransactions, but I havent payed a single micro transaction and my game is going fairly smoothyl, this isn't a waiting game, this is a game that you should play for about 10-20 mins a day, go about your business and maybe check up on your Breton town with your electronic device. If you expect, a grand strategy, amazing, award winning, strategy game that can keep you entertained for hours on end, than you will be in for a sore dissappointment. But if you play it for what it is, than it will be a perfectly good game to spend some time playing.=======Pros=======-Battles-Graphics-City / Town management-Territory Conquest=======Cons=======-No Byzantines (Yea, I was kinda dissappointed we could only be Bretons. Can't even be Saxon or Norse, just Bretons... Hey I guess you could be King Arthur though)Now some of you might think that there has to be more problems to the game than 'No Byzantines.' Yea... not really, it's a free game and if you want you can put a few dollars into micropurchases, these micropurchases aren't actually needed to play the game though. Oh, and did I mention, IT'S FREE. There is nothing wrong with this game, people don't like it because it doesn't fit in the 'Grand Strategy' category that most TW games do. So, there is no reason, not to get this game. So get it, play it, hate it, love it, I don't care. This game gives me much more hope in the TW title than Attila (That over priced DLC that they call a game) ever will. Just because, this is a unique game that is fun and you can kill some time on. Comments are welcome. (Within reason)			"

												After 30 hours I can say that this game is not as bad as everynoe says. I think bad rewievs are caused by unrealistic expectations. This is supposed to be MOBILE game basicaly. Do no expect full scale Total war strategic madness. It is a game where you log on once or twice a day, harvest your resources and then you turn it off. So if you bear in mind that this is a Mobila game I would say the pay model is decent, no pay to win, you can achieve everything ba playing the game it just takes longer. 8/10.			"

												Due to the time it takes to build and perform certain actions - from a few hours to a day, in real time - it's the kind of game you'll probably jump into, make some adjustments and then come back to it in a few hours or the next day. The game is fun, although I'm not sure about the controversial ""gold"" situation yet; in some cases it will just take you longer without gold, but in other cases such as buying powerful units, you need gold. You start off with some gold, you can make gold yourself through gold mines, missions etc., but the amounts you get in that manner are quite limited - maybe 1-5 gold per mission, whilst some of the powerful units cost around 150 gold. I'm sure in the later parts of the game, these units bought for gold can be hard to get around. But then again, it's a free game. By the way, did I mention gold?			"

The combat is far more unique than most comparable games, and while some believe it's too simple, it actually takes some skill.			"

												Dear negatives peoples I have reached over 10 hours of playing this game and realised that this is not what all you negatives ppls think or see in this game, to say that this game is boring and take long if you don’t pay real money is truly false all you need is something call patience, I know that in the century we live in this virtue is ever so rare, but bear in mind that this is NOT an RTS harvesting resources take time   but meanwhile why don’t you test your army in a few battle that will not only make the time go quicker but also give you resourced, once you capture a third territory the game evolve a bit more where you can gather resources faster. No one ever said that you have to be on the game for hours and watch the gathering bar loading slowly alt+tab and watch a movie or play another game. in my humble opinion for a free to play game and considering the previous history of ttw this game is descent to play and so far have enjoyed most of it .

												Before i make the review, just gotta make the point that this IS NOT A TOTAL WAR MAIN INSTALLMENT, so one should not expect the main features of a Total War game. Now into the game: Pros:- * Epic City Building* Reasonable Battles* Banner  Customisation* Character Customisation Cons:-* Lots of Customisation options require Gold, a substance mainly obtained by buying it with real money * Wait times for crops to grow and mining stoneSo Overall, this game is a good free-to-play game i recomend, with only the Cons i mentioned above being the main downers for the game. It is not a full Total War, but it is great as its own game, with much potential being only in Open-Beta.  "

												Total War Battles: KINGDOM would have been a decent mobile game. However Calling it a Total War game and giving it to Total War fans on pc seem like very questionable choices at best. I will admit the game ""looks"" nice. And gameplay is there if you play sparingly and casually. I don't see how this game would be viable for a hardcore fan unless you Payed to speed things up. I feel waiting hours and hours at a time just to harvest resources is completely ridiculous.  This does not play like a Total War game. I wanted to give it a thumbs down, but I don't think it actually deserves it. I think all these thumbs down reviews are from people expecting a Total War game. Thats not what this is in anything but name.I don't know what I would call this really besides maybe, Casual empire building game? I don't know. I don't feel this deserves a thumbs up or a thumbs down, but there is no middle line, so play the game with your own expectations, and if you want, make a review of your own.			"

												Having played the game briefly and read quite a few of the reviews, I felt like I needed to point out that the game, while under the badge of a Total War game, is not what hardcore fans would expect of a game under this title. This is not a negative thing, and I quite enjoyed playing the game, due to the simplicity of it. It is on a level of Clash of Clans or the like, and appeals more to the casual gamer, then to that of a hardcore Total War fan. I found it enjoyable to play, as I'm a huge fan of most games in a Medieval period.			"

												Great addition to the Total War family. I love the mini version of the game. It will be great as a mobile game with the time frame of gaining resources. The idea that gold must be used to buy certain units is annoying. I would rather have to pay for more resources to speed the game versus restricting units from the game. A level rewuirement for more advanced units seemd more resonable. Other than that great game.			"

												I like this game.The way they used the water as ressource and force.Its far easier to turn your land into a wasteland then to develop a landscape wich let your kingdom grow. What feels uncomfortable first,the missing round based gameplay, turns into something different.The Insight that if you build a damm in a river drys him out  with some time is nice.Not all actions have instant effects some lead into events unseen and regretted. I flood a whole city by removing a hill in summer,only to see the autum rains flooding the river again and using the new riverbed alongside my second castle.i will play it a while because of the water :) "

												This is very much an adroid/ios mobile rts freemium game, the typical expectations of such include but are not limited to long wait times to build stuff and the further you go the faster you can expand because you will be making so much more income at a time than in the beginning.  You can do absolutely everything for free it will just take longer, which is typical of a mobile freemium game.The game is quite aesthetically pleasing and the little nuances of weather and what the different seasons do to the land scape are a very nice touch.  The combat is pretty straight forward with some tactic and foresight required, very rock paper scissors with some buffs and debuffs you can use but only up to 3 buffs/debuffs at a time that you can unlock as you go.All in all it makes for a great mobile game, something to check in on or play for a few minutes to an hour a day, but not a good PC game due to the amount of time it takes to do things and the style of play, I dont think it was ever originally intended to be a PC game and was the original design of it to be a mobile game, in which case I believe it excels very well.  As such I recommend this game and am patiently waiting for it to come to android, however if this had been originally designed for PC(which I know it is not) then i would be agreeing with the sea of negativity this game seems to have on steam.

I really had my doubts by reading the negative opinions here but after testing it and playing it by myself I'm enjoying it, maybe at start you will feel a bit lost, but like in any other challenging game, but after advancing and leveling up, a lot of new challenges and missions will appear, you will unlock new futures and new buildings. It is a really enjoyable game and it's not absolutely pay2win... most of the futures are available by advancing and leveling up.Thanks for reading my opinion and have fun!			"

												I love it . . . this is a fun and challenging game that has alot of things to do. you can become a farmer and build economy or just battle until you have enough power both ways win . . . .goes slow even if you pay to get gold you still have to work at it . . . . my review 8 out of 10 . .. its fast and gives you little time to prepare in battle sometimes this is good other times makes you angry, but challenges you to become stronger  . . . this is not a quick game so play with patience. and enjoy.

												                                           (I have spent no money on this game not even within it)           When i first decided to play Total war battles: KINGDOM i thought it would just be a waste of my time like all the reviews said it would be... I saw one review that said it was good... and it was. This isn't just any ordinary game you can do so much with it.You can...-Build multiple citys-Change the terrain-Arrange and edit armies-Fight with the armies-Take over other sectors-and so much more         Personnely my favorite of those is fighting with the armies. You can actually tell your men to move, when to charge, and archers who to shoot at. Changing the terrain is awesome as well. Most the time in games like this, you get a terrain and your stuck with it no way to change it. In this however, you can raise, lower, clear, and do even more with the terrain.        I highly reccomend this game to you, and remember i spent no money(not even within the game) to play. I hope this was helpful			"

												Yes, recommended: But be prepared. Essentially a Clash of Clans-esque game with the Total War logo. Played it for about 3 days straight. First of all. To all those naysayers, and I know there are many for this game. This game is not a traditional Total War game. It's essentially them trying out mobile games. And it's amazing, in that regard. Then, for those people saying it's pay to play. That couldn't be farther from the true. It's the perfect homework game. Start mining, start farming, then do your homework. It is not pay to play to play, in the three days i've played, i've been doing just fine, winning online matches aplenty, rank is 16 and continuing to go down everytime I do an online match. It's an amazing game overall, simply understand that this isn't a traditional Total War game. The game was never meant to be a traditional total war. 8/10			"

												This game is nothing like all other total war games. And most gamers who like a series do not like to see that series do something different (like all shooter series). This game is more like tribal wars and settler online. If you like those games you will love this. Also the slow start will scare most gamers away, but like most building games you start with nothing and you will gain more when you play. Ones you have your second castle and 8 units (12 with militia) at your hands things will move faster and faster until you do not need to wait until your units are healed. By the time I'm writing this I have played the game for 4 days and I now have 4 castles and have 20 units and have not spend 1 gold. Gaining new lands is important and not impossible if you play smart. Also it takes time and practise to make the water your friend instead of your enemy (but then again I’m Dutch so building dams and cannels is in my blood)Pro's: Water: is vital for growing grass, tree’s, grain and fishinteractive map: you can built more things on this map than another free to play game out there. From canals to serval city's. (but you need to think ahead)different seasons: these will change the map and how fights look but also create new problems and opportunities (like droughts in the summer are great to change the flow of the rivers)You can build all things: No need to pay for stuff with gold/ real money to get all stuff in the game.interactive fights: the fights are interactive can be won with pure skillupgradable units: you gain experience, learn skills and you can build new and better weapons for your unitssmart AI: the AI will use skills and will change formations of his units to match yoursdifferent ways to gain gold: You can gain gold trough serval ways without paying for it with real moneyGreat graphics: best graphics for a game of this kindcons: Player vs player sucks: from cheating with buying all stuffs from unfair match making combine that with low reward and in sort multiplayer no fun.slow start: If you are not able to gain new area’s fast (by fighting) you will have to few unitscons/pro'sNo player raids: you cannot steal from others and they cannot steal from youRaids :  sometimes a raider will appear and steal your resources if you not beat him in 24 hours (or bribe him)Verdict: 8 Great game for those who are willing to spend  "

												As far as free to play games go this one is ok, but the only reason it is good is due to it being a TOTAL WAR game. If this didn't have its title no-one would play it.Pros:-Adds a new spin on city builder games-Addictive-Not hard to get good-competitive with friendsCons:-Autumn flooding is complete bull ****, you spend loads of time in summer trying to ge water through your lands and then along comes the f***fest of rain. One river overflow and 2 towns got flooded, 3 quarries, 2 farms and all of my f***ing roads were destroyed. But I can't do anything about it until winter comes to get rid of the sea in the centre of my kingdom.-Secondly the combat is completly broken, when taking over new regions the firs two are fine, the third is hard but not impossible and then comes the fourth. All you have to do is look at the army and realise it is impossible without paying them off. It seems as if they don't want people to progress without spending their life savings for an army. Also when you go into online duels there are no matchmaking, all that happens is they put you with some random person without looking a if you spent money or your level in game. In 3 instances I have been against people who have obviously spent loads of money which means I definitely will not beat them. A couple of times I have been against people using the starting units when I have a very strong army without spending money, this system is completely broken and must be fixed.Although it seems the cons are much greater than the pros I must still remind you it is in BETA so this game still has a while to go before it can be judged as a full game like Rome 2 was.

												Pay to win- Yeah Have I played alot of pay to win and never pay a dime- Always.This I dont mind sure slower but a time waster.Speed of game- SlowLike I said if you want something to do and dont mind clicking around and waiting or coming back to it then this game is not bad.People complain about the 8 hour time it takes for certain things.(It can happen) If you want to harvest wheat then do it individually and dont press the Harvest All or Fell All button which takes longer instead do it individually to minimize time.I Like the fact that before bed I can click then harvest all and come back in the morning to see it ready for me.Graphics are nice simular to the CIV games and Total war games.Battles are different but whats wrong with that sometimes. If you play this game dont expect the same gameplay as the other Total War games.I do think this game would be more enjoyable the farther I get and when it comes to mobile, I can play whenever and wherever I am at to waste time.All in all not bad if you enjoy this kind of game 5/10 from me here. Again Its free to play so give it a try, I dont complain much when I get free things.			"

												Been playing this game for quite some time now. And Do i think its a Bad game?

NO.I do enjoy that game And Even if there are a few bug here and there,One of them made my whole kingdom reset but i kept all my Army units and their experience points.But that's it mainly.And for the Butthurt Fanboys out there.I have been playing the toal war games since Total War Medieval 2 So im not completly new to the Series and i find this quite a charming addition to the mobile/Pc games For when i have a few minutes to spare to check out my ressources and so on.

Why Is Everyone Giving This Game a Negative review? Maybe Because They Have Not played This Game For Even a Hour! First Of all Its Not a pay To win Game, If Any one played through the tutorial you (start off with 100 gold and pay 1 or two gold pieces) to get one thing done. second of all this game just released so they will give the game some patches to let it grow and become better! Third Most people dont Respect the Graphics Or The Gameplay Or The Ideas That Make This Game Unique! The Graphics are a 8/10 For a game that will be releasing on mobileThe Battles Or Gameplay Feel 6/10, This Game Actually takes Strategy! It also feels like a improvement to most games (in which they dont copy and paste clash of clans or boom beach and try to improve it) The Ideas are amazing 7/10 in which you could raise or lower the terrain, build dams so they wont overflow your city, There Are many types of units 7/10( archers, calvary, infantry, spears pikes,spears,and artillery) In which you could upgrade them.The tutorial and Campaign are the only bad parts of this game Tutorial (5/10) The campaign (4/10)There are many things to make you keep going in this game (6/10) like battle quests, duel, campiagn,and daily missionsI rate it a 6/10 on pcI rate it 8/10 on mobile devicesThis Game Does Not Deserve A 5/10 or lower like star forge2 things To remember one its in beta two its not a pay to win gameThere is more then 1000 people playing this game right now (check on the community hub)But more then 1000 people on a game that just released a day ago is bad rightIf you want to argue fine I will argue with you! The only way I wont is if theyDLC SPAM!!!!			"

												Followed Total War since Medieval 1 this game in my opinion is perfect for someone on the go a lot who needs a game which they can just sit back on a plane manage their settlement and then sleep, though I wouldn't say it is any better than any other TW game but its a mini Medieval II is how I see it and people will argue that it takes too long to farm heres some advice put the farm on medium ground with loe ground next to it then run a river through the low ground ^^ bit of common sense lads			"

												The negative reviews appear to be people largely expecting a typical total war experience which they should do after 15 years of that. This game however is alot more similar to that of Settlers Online and Stronghold so you will be very disappointed if this is what you are expecting. There is a pay to get there quicker or you can choose to put some time in and grind a little. For once this is not a P2W style game.I run through a small vid on the main features to begin with. There will be other elements such as invaders that pop up, duels and a campaign so the game is set to expand a bit more.

												This game is good and fun despite what the naysayers with 30 minutes of playtime are saying.To dispel the myth of Pay to Win...-CRAFTING - This game is not Pay to Win. It is Pay to Go Faster like most F2P's.  You can craft everything so by definition, not pay to win.-Many ways to obtain gold - Mine, wolves, tombs, daily tribute, markets, taverns, battle quests, challenges, conquering regions.-Wait times - typical of Free to Plays.  Get used to it or move along to buyable games.EDIT: ~6 hours in and I am just about at Lord level 15 (PVP unlocked at 15).  You unlock better units and coat of arms customizations too sometime after level 10.  There are a bunch of ways to earn gold for free too.  Could use a decrease in times here and there and some better explanations on certain aspects but I think it is a neat little game. Sorry not sorry.EDIT 2: 10 hours in - I have multiple ways of getting gold now, but slowly.  I am level 19. Still liking the game.EDIT 3: 20+ hours in - Level 27 Lord - a few cosmetics unlocked, 27 gold earned/received so far, 2 battles lost to the AI (which actually was smart in the last loss, dayum son).Update .3 ReviewOverall I'd say it is an improvement.  I played 53 battles on the first night of release.+Reduced times, mostly. 20 minutes >> 1 minute.  1.5 hours > 19 minutes, etc.Gold 100% on daily login. Tombs now give goldNew things to mine (although not as intuitive). Silver, coal, gold, stone.Adjacency bonuses - might still need tweaking but overall an improvement-Realm sized reduced. This is bad. We'll see how bad it is late game...Fertile grass should be removed (wheat can't grow if it is 3 hexes away.)Quarry has a massive range and can't be built next to each other. We're pressuring them on forums for change. Removing a lame prospect takes 12 hours which is absurd.Gold prices for some units have been increased (others reduced).			"

												You know what they say; ""You don't change a winning team"".Or do they?Total War formula revolves around the hybrid turn-based management/real-time strategy and it what defines it. Creative Assembly and Sega are probably exploring new grounds on the ""free-to-play"" market, a realm filled with casual players who don´t mind spending a buck or two for a few gold coins that will give them an edge like upgrading a unit or instant harvesting of a wheat field. Battles: Kingdom picks up the same battle mechanics of Total War Battles; Shogun and adds an hexagonal map were you build and manage your kingdom, similar to Civilization V, Master of the Arcane or Endless Legend. This is truly the high point of this game; you can actually terraform the environment to your liking, building dams to divert rivers and raising the terrain to your advantage. I spent hours just messing with all the options available. It´s alot more fun than the Beyond Earth terraforming features for example. Honestly, this doesn´t feel like a Total War kind of game but it doesn´t mean its bad. Just make sure that before you venture into it, be prepared for something different that you are used to.			"

												CA's Marketing Team does them no favors here: This is not a ""Cross-Platform Total War"". It's a mobile-designed City Builder with above-average mobile-designed battles that, for some reason, is only being beta tested on PC. The tablet app is still ""coming soon"", apparently.When you and I think of ""Total War"", we think of great real-time battles. The battles here are more interactive than the Game of Thrones game or Stronghold Kingdoms, but it's not to the level you're led to believe or expect. No mobile game can pretend to be a full Total War, but CA's description here leads you to believe otherwise.City building is more interactive and strategy matters more than in Stronghold Kingdoms. But Stronghold is about playing Lego Master with city walls. Give this a shot, but understand that it's not a Total War in the way Empire, Rome, Attila and Shogun are; this is a tablet City Builder.			"

												Total war has taken their own twist on a different strategy game.PROSBattle gameplay better than all similar gamesIt doesnt take forever to construct. I really like this, games such as clash of clans may take hours for you to do upgrades, constructions, recruitments. This game however shortens it, making it a better experienceResources dont run out quickly. I love this because in similar games, resources run out very quickly, in which you may have to wait hours to gain back. But total war battles makes it so resources are very well keptYou dont lose your army after battle. Yes you can keep your army, this makes the game even better, because you dont need to waste resources on another armyCONSFeels very slow paced. It just doesnt excite you.Battles should feel more like total war battles. I prefer it when you can move your army about, and not have your army auto moving. You should have more options to what you can do with your army.This isnt really a PC game. It more of a mobile-style game, but oh well.Turns. You know in these other total wars where you have turns, and after it recruits units and finishes constructions. I like that, however I suppose this isnt meant to be like it, I can accept thatOverall I enjoy the game. "

												Total war has taken their own twist on a different strategy game.PROSBattle gameplay better than all similar gamesIt doesnt take forever to construct. I really like this, games such as clash of clans may take hours for you to do upgrades, constructions, recruitments. This game however shortens it, making it a better experienceResources dont run out quickly. I love this because in similar games, resources run out very quickly, in which you may have to wait hours to gain back. But total war battles makes it so resources are very well keptYou dont lose your army after battle. Yes you can keep your army, this makes the game even better, because you dont need to waste resources on another armyCONSFeels very slow paced. It just doesnt excite you.Battles should feel more like total war battles. I prefer it when you can move your army about, and not have your army auto moving.

												First of all - addressing most of the negative reviews of this game: Do not treat this as a total war game. It may have the name Total War on it but it was never meant to be compared to the standard TW games. I started the game up expecting something similar to Tribal Wars and nothing more and that is exactly what this game has offered. A highly polished cross-platform casual game with fast (but fun) real-time battles.As with all games of this genre there is an option to pay for gold to speed up your progress and recruit different (not overpowered, just a slightly different role) units. You can still earn gold in-game but unless you intend on playing this game for long periods of time in one go then gold is not neccesary. The Kingdom building is fantastic, you can terraform the land to your liking, build it how you like focusing either on your military to capture enemy (AI) settlements or on your economy to buy them out.The PvP multiplayer aspect I haven't yet reached but I'm assuming so far it is for 1v1 army duels only so I can't comment on this. You can customise your coat of arms with a variety of options which will then show up on the shields of your units, loading screens, and various other places.Despite looking rather simple, the combat actually does have a lot of depth to it. In fact compared to any other casual-like game of this genre it has the most depth I have seen. There are 9 unit slots and you can build your army as you wish, individual-stat / ability progression per unit, special  ability-activated buffs you can earn from building churches and so on. There is more to the combat than this - try it! It seems mind-numbingly simple at the beginning but as the army sizes begin to grow and as you gain more abilities the game reveals more and more depth which was a very pleasant surprise.Overall unless you buy gold with real money (you do get A LOT of gold for a small amount of money!) apart from at the beginning this is not a game that you can play for more than an hour at a time due to the nature of the game, but for playing half an hour or so every now and then it's brilliant. A fun, casual game. I highly recommend it!			"

												(Written as BETA tester) The game is fun and quite addicting. It is not your usual Total War game though it brings quite a number of new elements to the franchise. I have more than a thousand hours in various TW games combines and I can say that TWBK is fun. The wait can be a bit annoying but as it's meant to be a game where you drop in, do a few things and drop it doesn't really matter. The whole battle mechanic is simplistic at the beginning but it's yet to get boring.			"

												I have not played a long time but this is first impressionsThe Concept:The Idea here is amazing you can play total war (admitedly scaled down) on the go and that is amazingthe fact you can play total war anywere (within reason) is a fantastic concept but it leaves the desktoppart of the game a little small compared to napoleon or shogunThe Gameplay:Like i said before this is better on a mobile device for a quick 5 min burst of total war that is unaccesable on PC The Battles are short and sharp but when you first start it is a bit long winded but overall it is a niceidea like clash of clans and total war got squished into one.The Good:For a mobile game it is quite a ballenced easy to do game with the hex buillding and teraforming giving ita burst of freshness to an alredy good gameThe Bad:Personaly i prefer having more of the RTS Factor having a unit of samuri or line infantry facing off againsta mass cavalry charge and gold Really Creative Asembaly Really it will just be another thing for pepolewith more money than sense to get better at a game and i hope this game does not end up likeHeroes and Genarals,Clash of Clans,Boom Beach and so meny other games of the P2W machanic.Over all i give the Beta verson of total war battles:kingdom a 7/10 A fresh Take on a solid francise but the Gold Machanic and the fact it lets down PC Users knocked some points of but i can not wait to see what happens next.

												This game is actually spectacular.Of course, there are plenty of problems, and mainly this game being made for mobile devices. However, the world is quite beautiful, and there is always something to do. Battles are short and enjoyable, however the tactics previous Total War games are known for are swapped for a arcadish style 3 lane battle map. This is still very enjoyable and quite refreshing.Total War Battles: Kingdom is far from a pay2win game like many are saying, but you can see from their lack of playtime they have an opinion formed by others and nothing. Seriously, you can't buy extra resources, you can't buy XP boosts or anything like that. All you can do is speed up harvesting/collecting.Although the map is quite static at first, over night, one of my regions actually partially flooded, and now one of my farming estates is underwater and now appears to be really very dynamic. Build cities is also very enjoyable. There is a challenge to handling resources efficiently. Sure you can set the woodcutter to 'Fell all' trees around him, but that would prevent the opportunity to hunt deer until the forest returns. There are some nice terrain molding tools, although the way damns work are still unknown to me. The army builder is interesting, with an initial 5 places for units, with more slots opening with a higher level. You also can use XP gained from a battle to upgrade certain aspects of a unit, and can choose to keep collecting XP so that you can level the unit up, or use a small amount to level up a certain attribute. My advice is play it now if you really want to help with the development, otherwise, await a spectacular full release :)			"

It is like Farmville/clash of clans/etc...  If you like those games you will probably like this one.  If you don't play those games, this game is not for you.  Very simple really.

												1. Yes it feels like a mobile game, so it's more of a casual pick up once in awhile and collect and fight etc. The fact you can play on all your devices makes it a good mobile game.2. Yes a lot of units you have to pay in game gold, which is bought with out of game real money. But with that said, I haven't felt like I needed the extra strong units to win battles. And it feels like more of a pay to get ahead quicker rather than the pay to win like everyone claims. People really have a stupid view of what pay to win means.3. I haven't encountered many bugs, and since it's autosave if the game were to crash you wouldn't lose any progress. Loads real quick also.4. The battle is very submersive, you feel like a commander, commanding his troops on the battle field. You command when your units charge and who your bowmen fire upon. Do you shoot the men your horsemen are battling and risk killing some of your own?5. Reminds me of a slow paced Ages of Empires. The graphics are nice and simple, but still pretty and colourful. It's a free game despite what the idiot masses would have you believe. It's not very pvp focused so you don't have to fight people who pay for units, etc., and get slaughtered. Just play it as a casual medieval times simulator.Some things I would like to see implemented are, naming your towns, being able to move peasants to other towns, multiple profiles if I want to start a new game, more things happening graphically on the map i.e peasants walking around, trade carts moving from town to town, barracks has soldiers training, etc..Total Wars games are usually $60 on release, the fact this game is free should tell you people that it's not going to be like a Total Wars game. It doesn't take 8 hours to farm crops, it takes 20 minutes, it takes 8 hours if you want to farm all at once. You should have to take an intelligence quiz before writing reviews, people are dumb.

												Considering this game is a mobile game i have to say i like it. Compairing it to lets say Clash of Clans i like this way more because it looks a lot better and as a player you have a lot more control of your city and your units in battle.To all the bad reviews about people saying this is not a Total War game you are correct. Its a Total War BATTLES series game. And just like the shogun battles game it is Pay to Win and it takes a lot of time to do anything but thats part of any mobile game. I like it and when it is available on mobile devices i am worried i am going to get addicted to it.			"

												Seeing quite a few negative reviews I was hesitant to try this simple game. Is it a total war? Well.. Technically yes, but only at the bare minimum of comparisons. Is it a good game? Yes for a simple slightly more advanced ""facebook"" style of game, it is.  Is it worth all the negative reviews? Well that depends on if you were ignorant enough to go in expecting a Total War Attila style facebook game or not. If you don't like Facebook games, you won't like this. It's a good game to just manage when you're bored, or sitting waiting for something on your mobile. The Game Itself:Alot of reviews are claiming this is just another usual facebook game with nothing new. Obviously they didn't spend any longer than a few minutes in the tutorial. There are quite a few interesting things in this game. Of course it is a pay to win setup, as all facebook like games are, however that doesn't mean there aren't alternative ways to getting gold. There are 2 currencies in the game, Gold and Silver. Gold being special currency to buy advanced soldiers or upgrades for soldiers. The main way to get Gold is through paying money. Silver is used to buy everything else, and is gained through Blacksmiths, Markets, etc. ingame by waiting for the timer to loop like most facebook games. This doesn't mean paying Gold is the only way to get gold however. Linking several Taverns together can net you some Gold, as well as Mining. Mines can uncover Gold deposits as well. Chopping down tree's and uncovering ruins can also net you surprises including Gold. Completing Quests and Objectives will net you Gold as well. There are other unique features as well, such as being able to raise and lower the land, fill land in, or use mines to dig land out gaining Dirt. Or simply raise and lower it. Why would you want to do this? Besides being able to sculpt the land to your liking for cosmetic reasons, there is water on the maps. Dams can be made to stop water flow, and make usually unuseable land, useable and buildable.Battles The battles are pretty basic. With special skills gained from the churches you build, your soldiers are lined up 3 x 3. Like most Total War games, the basics are there. Swordsmans vs Spears, Spears vs Horses, Horses vs Archers or Swordsmans. Choosing the correct time to charge as well nets you bonus's. Comparisons  I mentioned this can be compared to other Total War games at the very basic and most minimum. The only real comparisons are the fact that soldier types are rock paper scissors at the basic like other Total War Games, and that you are essentially building up multiple towns to upkeep your armies... yea.. not really much comparisons, you can still argue it's not a Total War game at all, and I wouldn't say you are wrong. This is a facebook game however, so expecting more is lunacy.			"

												I have played over 500 hrs (or so Steam says; it must include time the compurter is active even though I am not).The game is okay, but not great. Now that I have occuppied all six territories, I am not sure what would motivate me to play again. There is not much variation in the game; gather resources, update buildings and/or units then go fight a couple of battles, then repeat. The battles are boring, the waiting for some some buildings and upgrades are boring and the battles do not come close to representing medieval warefare.The game starts out stating that it is 915AD.The English did not have longbows in the 10th century. The Welsh may have had longbows that early. They certainly did by the time of the Anglo-Norman invasion during the later part of the 11th century. Edward I (kind of England 1272 - 1307is generally regarded as being the one who introduced the use of the longbow into the English forces. There were no knights in England prior to the Norman invasion in 1066. While the Thegns and Ceorls rode to the battle on horseback, they dismounted to fight.I have no idea what composite bows are suppose to represent.Crossbows and longbows have similar ranges and impact (killing power) but longbows have a much higher rate of fire yet in the game, they seem to fire at the same or nearly the same rate. Longbowmen took years to train while crossbowmen took an half an hour at most to instruct, yet in the game you have to pay real money or spend an eternity to make crafts to acquire a crossbowman, while a longbowman is available immediately.Javelin men usually only carried two javelins which were expended as a preliminary to a melee charge. Yet in the game, they have an unlimited number of javelins to throw. The effective range of a Javelin was about 20 meters while the effective range of a longbow and crossbow was in excess of 100 meters, yet in the game they have essentially equal range to the archery units.Spearmen vs mounted knights, this is an absurdity. Until the advent of pikes and halberds, the knights were the kings of the battlefield. Prior to the battle of Sterling Bridge, there was no significant battle in which a knightless force defeated a force with knights. Pikes and halbards were effective against knights but the Pike did not come into common use until the later half of the 13th century and the halberd about 100 years later.Knights should be extremely expensive and rare and virtually industructable. Longbows and crossbows could bring down a knight, but mostly they brought down their horse and knight was trampled by one of his peers or foes.  It took years to train a knight. They started training at the age of seven as a page. After seven years, the page would become a squire and after another seven years the squire might become a knight. An exceptional squire might become a knight as early as age 18. however, not all pages became squires and not all squires became knights.So if the game is to be about England and you want knights, longbowman, and pikes, the it need to be set in the middle 13th century, no the 10th centry.

												I haven't played any total wars before, but I knew they were about controlling great armies. This game is pretty awesome, but gaining resources and upgrading buildings is the worst. I know it's the kind of game in which you have to wait, but this is way to ridiculous. Not even battles can grant you enough resources, and gold is really hard to get.			"

												I've never played a 'Total War' game, so my review of this game doesn't come from having any expectations associated with that name.  I have, however, played a lot of these types of strategy games.  This one is a bit different from the ones I've played (I'll go more into that as I go), but I still found it was one I will keep playing for a while to see where it goes.  I've played 34 hours now and have started over three times because the game does not really walk you through all you need to know as a newcomer to the scene.   After searching through forums, I found most of them outdated, as are some of the complaints in this review forum.  Not everything you read here as pro's/cons are relative anymore.  They've changed up a few things that were people's pet-peeves  (thank goodness).  I can appreciate game designers who do that.  So, take everything you read here with a grain of salt.  Also, this game is not for someone who likes to rush to the top.  It is the slowest-moving game of this type that I have played thus far, but it used to be slower from what I've read in some of the negative reviews here, compared with my experiences.  I have gotten to level 22 in the first day of playing, but that only helps with unlocking more buildings and more objectives (it's easy to level up in this game).  What takes up the most time in this game is the timers on everything. There's timers on construction, deconstruction, food, troops healing, people becoming available to use in your economy buildings, on trees re-growing (although, it used to be worse), etc.  Most put this game in the category of being one that you pick up and play for a few minutes, then come back to a few hours later.  I didn't do that during my time going from level 1-22, so there were some stretches there that were boring.  However, you have to do a lot of battles in order to keep the flow or resources coming in, as well as working on leveling your troops, which is important so that can keep you some-what busy.The things I find the most frustrating about this game are (Con's): 1. There is no real need for the timers.  I don't understand why they exist for everything.  Some games like this require them to make the game competitive with other players, but in this game, you choose when you do any PVP business so that pretty much eliminates the need for timers.  You aren't fighting against the clock because your protection lifts in so many hours, type of thing.2. The materials you need to build or craft anything are astronomical.  It is a bit ridiculous and it is not like they are that easy to come by.  3. To level your castle to level 2 is a pain.  I found a way to do it ""easily"" but it is still a pain, nonetheless (I peeped on a forum where it was 'theorized' you could build three castles in the first two sections of land you acquire and I did it, but it came with a very steep price and I am not talking about any real money or game currency - I used up a lot of resources to do it, which means a huge loss of time making them back up).  It is imperative that you level your castle to level 2 in order to get anywhere in your duels, which opens the door to you obtaining your third tract of land to build on (I still have yet to do that).   I also have yet to level a castle to level 2, but was thrilled to finally open the door to it being possible now.  It's imperative to do so I can level up my military buildings, which opens the door to being able to level up my troops to two-stars.  That is necessary for dueling, which leads me to the next con on my list...4. Duels are where you finally PVP with other players.  They are just like the battles with AI, so there is no need to defend your castle(s) or village-folk in fear of being plundered, you just have to survive on the battlefield.  I don't know how their match-up system works, but my first attempt at dueling I was set up with someone that had 2 more slots open for troops than I had, which made them way more powerful than I was.  They wiped me out fast.  I do not like their match up system, whatever it is.  It does not seem balanced at all. 5. Also, along with their fail matching system for duels, there does not seem to be a lot of people who play this game.  I have sat and waited a long time before I was matched up with anyone and I attempted three times at different times of the day/night before I finally had any takers.6. Last but not least, I do not like how you are basically left to your own devices on how to figure out how the game works.  You have no clue that it is important to build certain structures next to certain other structures in your villages till you throw a few down on the tarmac where you can finally read about them in their 'menu' that you have to manually open and read.  You also don't have any idea exactly what a troops strengths/weaknesses are till you find your troops strewn about the battlefield dead before you realized it.  There are no tool tips and no up-to-date forums on such things anywhere that I could find, so I am learning by trial and error.  Some folks like that, I prefer more of a balance.  I don't want my hand held, but at the same time I don't like making costly mistakes that set me back several hours.  For the Pro's:1. Quality of graphics: It is a beautiful game for what it is.  It's free to play, but looks better than most.2. Game play:  It doesn't have bugs in it from what I've experienced thus far.3. It's a pain to advance at different points along the game, but that is what keeps me motivated to push forward. 4. There are seasons in the game, with positives and negatives that affect your overall progress in the game and I think that is awesome.  I have only experienced spring thus far, but look forward to seeing the other seasons, as well as the other areas on the map.  I just hope I last that long before I give up, lol.  5.There's no need to pay to play, or to win.  You get plenty of gold bars just playing the game and meeting certain milestones, or finding them in a tomb/cave.  6. The game is not easy.  I like that.  7. This game is expanding my patience thresh-hold. :D  It is not fun waiting for things to finish up, nor is it a lot of fun to grind out levels on my troops, but it is satisfying when it's done and you see/experience the results.  Overall, I am recommending this game despite it's pitfalls.  It's worth trying out, it doesn't cost you a dime....only a few new gray hairs or a sore forehead as you learn by trial and error what is going on.  :P  Enjoy and best of luck to ya.  Hope to see you on the Battlefield.			"

												Well i figured i might wright a review on this game my actual playtime is around 36hrs but my last pc blew up (not litterally). anyways should you try this game, yes and no if you like total war and want to rule a kingdom in real time but have epic battles this game is NOT for you however if you like rts and easy to control battles this is FOR you.the battles are nothing special you have lines of units, front, middle, back. you earn unit place areas when u level up.your soldiers consist of, infantry, archers, calvery, and siege weapons (catapult, balista, and trebuchet)when u start off u have a couple of farmers and hunters in your army  then mr. adviser guy MAKES you build a barracks WARNING you can only have one unit per barracks so you cant go out and train 85 knights (you need to have a knights manor to train dismounted knights) there are microtransactions too.

												The design of the game is great and the battle may not be a Total War's normal battle but it's good -- however -- the building time in the game is not something I'm a big fan of. It is made to be ridiculously and unreasonably long that you are indirectly forced to use gold. Gold is something that you cannot gain easily from the game and I believe that you have to use real world money to purchase them. I hate to say this, but the game feels like a scam similar to a lot of mobile games that are designed not for the game to be enjoyable, but to make profit. I do not recommend it, but some might still like this game.			"

												Well I do not do reviews often because I do not wish to come off wrong nor be trolled. But this game has made me wish to try.First this to me isn't even worth being on PC. It is pretty much an app game or facebook game. I have played for a bit and grew bored of the similarities to app games harvest times and crap. Also fighting battles on normal and having lord units destroy me over and over and the tiny amounts of exp battles give is useless, granted if you wish to spend real money you can instantly get better units just like in an app/FB game... I wish this game was more like other total war games or even like shogun total war but with knights and your hero could fight in the battle...but alas your leader is a useless image and that's it.  I am not impressed with pay to win games. If i spend money on a game i expect to get cool dlc, new units (that do not break the game or whatever), or cool looking appearances for characters not the ability to instantly buy high tier troops, buildings, cancel out timers or whatever. I would not... No Can not recommend this game to people. If this is your thing fine but its a waste of time when there are so many great free to play games out there. Sorry if you like this game that's fine, this is just how I myself feel.			"

												This game definately has potential. I really like the idea, but the gameplay is slow. Even navigating your town takes way longer than it should. What I was most excited for about this game was the battles because the Total War series seems to have mastered battles. Unfortunately, they completely changed their gameplay in battles to slow, boring, and painfully unrealistic. I understand that the game is not finished, and if it is improved, I will gladly change this review.			"

												TLDR:Long waits between actions - spend gold to avoid.Simple, but fun, combat - made un-even by buffs bought with gold before each battle.The units you buy are limited - use (lots of) gold to buy better/more advanced ones.Don't want to do that? Spend vast amounts time/resources instead. Use (some) gold to make it faster. (Oh, you might fail in crafting them, too.)AI frequently uses higher leveled, advanced, units.Competative Multiplayer has all of these problems, made worse by wonky net-code.A fun, casual, strategy-lite game. Or, it would be, were it not spoiled by a steep powercreep in the combat minigame.  If it were just a game designed to be tough, that would be one thing.  Unfortuantely, giving attacking AI with full exp, top tier units and then calling that ""challenging"" (the term they use for medium difficulty) in the mid-game reveals a cynical attempt to push the player to spend gold (money) to even the field.It doesn't get much better in the 'campaign' section, where you are hampered by long waits for just about every action.Don't be fooled by the intial gameplay; the initially speedy pace slows dramticaly as the tutorials end.  Incidentaly, during the tutorial they give you some gold - which you then have to (as in, the game tells you to and does not progress if you don't) spend that gold to get around the long waits, establishing that this is 'normal' gamplay.Now, this might not be a problem in and of itself - you can just dip in and out, gather your rescources, play a battle or two - log off for an hour or two and then return.  However, this is a more expertly designed freemium game than that.You soon realise that the AI is using the units you don't have access to, generaly further leveled up than your own too.If you want those units, you either have to spend significant amounts of gold up-front or spend lots of time gathering stuff for crafting.  Then, wait a long time for the crafting to happen. Then, do it 5 more times for each item. If you decide that you can wait it out, gather your resources and use them to make a better army, you are attacked by AI periodicly.  If you fail to beat them or pay them off, they take a percentage of your resources when they leave.I'd give this a miss, folks.  Save the money you'd spend on gold - spend it on a game that has been designed and balenced to be entertaining.This is designed to extract the your gold - I mean cash - from you.			"

												I played before they restarted the game with updates. I found it difficult to advance without paying, mostly because of the level of AI encounters once it starts invading your territory, PvP que was horrible, but so far it seems playable. It is good enough for casual play at early levels, I'll see what happens later before I make a final decision.			"

												It's simple but fairly enjoyable. Do not expect Total War from this game but there are elements to it. It would be better if you could play as the other factions: the Norse or the Picts to offer some variety. It's simply a mediocre game. For the genre it's pretty decent however. If you're into this genre I'd recommend it.			"

												           This is a pay to win game, Honsetly a pay to play. You will be flooded endlessly and will run out of trees vary fast, so you will need to buy Gold to use to trade for wood. You might be able to get by for 2-3 days like this. After that you will be straped again for wood. Wood lets you build dams, and change the ground elevation.  You can only plant with in 2 hexes of a fresh water source.  So a lot of your teritory will be useless to you. Because you can only build off from your castle when it comes to your town, with the exception of mines, woodcuters, and farms. The combat is poor at best, you cant manuver your troops, flank or do any kind of stratigy.  instead the armies march strait at each other. Vary dumbed down. In order to gain a decent reward for the random battles, you will have to face higher difficult enemies. But in order to win once again you have to use Gold to buy advatages in battle. Such as artillery, flaming arrows and so on.    Conclussion: If you like to rebuild your town daily, because of the floods, and have no problem wasting real money on a game, this may be a game for you.			"

												Come on Total War!!! I love yals games but I don't understand how you could make a game this bad, even if it is free! I get that the pay to win games are the new thing but it has to at lesat be good and or remotely fun. City building and resources are completly unforgiving without mercy. Thats probably the biggest killer. and theres no way to restart the game! So if youre new and never played before and make a simple mistake ..... like release a dam on your whole city... youve permanently screwed yourself. Besides that just about every other aspect of the game sucks just and bad and equaly unforgiving. Sorry Total War kinda droped the ball on this one and might have lost a little respect for ya			"

												1. After playing: a)24 hours it is somewhat interesting.. b)48 hours it is rather boring.. c)72 hours it is quite boring.. d)96 hours it is so tedious..2. Definitely needs money in order to be succesful. If you don't buy gold you won't unlock the better units without hard-working gaming for many many hours [tedious].3. It is a different game than Total War series, it is too simple and much MUCH worse. Don't expect to find similarities.4. The basic project of this game, suspiciously looks like the ""Forge of empires"" project.. [money-eater].5. You have to log in and play usually [every <8 hours], otherwise you won't be succesful [tedious].			"

												OK WE GET IT all you poor little -takes a second- people... you wanted something that was already around right? THIS GAME IS NEW, it is not a copy of any other game, it is an industry leader, and I am in <3 as of my current hours in-game I have not paid a penny into it, and the price for the ""Gold"" is really good- i have decided i will only do the 1 time purchase and the 50 bucks after cause it gives you almost double buying the five dollar when you add up 10 $5 buys- I will save up and stop playing hard if need be lolThank you Total War for creating a game where you don't HAVE to kill everything else on the map- nice change!!!100% Casual game, once you know a few very important thingsblacked out lines are walkthrough of basics I discovered!1) Seasons matteryou start in spring, things grow fast and stone is slow- look at the strange season wheel2) let time be timedon't pay to skip seasons so your little kingdom gets productive again- losing winter's special gift is just as bad as paying for trebuchets ""because you can""    i) I have made it a policy to only use gold when i get it and the price is under 4(usually I wait for 1)    ii) Don't use gold to buy resources- it is completely unworth it3) YOU CAN MAKE GOLD WITHOUT PAYINGI really didn't see this in the other positive reviews-    i) it is not a lot but a castle will give you 1-2 every day or 2     ii) also you can make gold with with taverns (have yet to get that- its like a 3% chance or something -shrugs-)    iii) exploring tombs gives you gold, and leveling up gives you 10 gold     iv) there are a few other ways I'm sure4) Please, know the surface and remember gravity!!! TOTALLY MODIFIABLE TERRAIN LEVEL and other things can be manipulated as well (grass/tree type)    i) I was warned, and I laughed when it actually happened- lowering terrain next to a river is stupid if you didn't want the river to flow somewhere new ;-)     ii) lowering 1 plot at the top of a hill with a river can literally flood 30 tiles as it goes down- don't flip out, just build up about 300 coin and wood and stone so you can rebuild if you screw it up- and do this B4 you modify it you must also have at least 1 market (it will kill you to do but it is still a better deal then using up the construction gold) I have 7 markets and only now is it dealable to trade (I will expain markets better shortly)    iii) just because a prospecting zone wants you to lower terrain does not mean you have to- demolish the damned thing if it will require you to kill off trees you don't want to harvest or get rid of other production buildings or roads- they have (so far) not been worth it at all to do so    iv) walls will protect from floods- build them on the sides of your land that border a river if you want to change it's flow- if there is one terrain level not protected it may flood- and it happens FAST    v) beware of fall- but do not avoid it!!!4) Markets, Taverns, Castles, Cattle Farms and the connected land effect    i) connecting land is not simple- you have to think of how much land your taking away from other things (don't build too many roads within 2 plots of water unless you don't mind the cost in future output of food- i didn't risk that in one area and did in another)    ii) Markets, Taverns, and Castles all need to be connected to gain bonuses and upgrades    iii) cattle need to be connected to a market to buy cattle5) you have to have the people to use some of your buildings     i) 10 peasants = 1 crafts man the transfer is not worth it early- just save the craftsmen and use the peasents as often as you can until you are full then trade them in and start raking in the stuff!6) multiplayer is a side-note    i) I chose to do the 3 rank 18 battles and it was not an easy road toward the end, but much more worth it than as 1500 or every resource!!!    ii) it is much more fun knowing someone real is playing against you7) modify troops b4 going into campaign, to match the needs of your victory8) keep learning- I still haven't gotten into differing tree types (it matters) or masters (pains in the asses) or the fact that at first you think that all of the back slots for troops have to be filled by siege so you end up having 3 balistas and doing great for the first 6 days then you hit a all and go WTFM???? then your like ""oh"" and you feel so unlearned you want to punch 5 holds in the brick wall your desk is in front of9) only pay-to-win-multiplayer and I have not reached the last unlockable place yet so i do not know how that would be to pay forwill update but you have all you need for the early game			"

												The game I think has good potental but the game is terrible if you dont understand the beggining and use all your resources then the game takes for ever you have to sit here and basicly sit here and do nothing but thats not all like silver you have to collect it you get 20 silver in like 30 mins but you have to collect it. It doesn't pile up so you constantly have to  be on to get anything done then you need crafts men or peasants. Crafts men do it faster but they retire faster thats right they retire and you can only get these crafts men and peasants from houses so it takes longer to do anything in this game. Now how you get resources. They have woodcutters,farms, and quarrys. Now the wood cutters don't bother me but the farms and quarrys do. What you do for the farms is get them as close to the rivers as possible but sometimes the water overfloods things and you need water for wheat to grow and even then it takes like 8 hours to get the wheat. The quarrys are terrible in this game you can only mine from 1 stone deposite and keep in mind you have to use stone for like everything. The prospecting was a good idea but the chances of you finding anything but a stone deposite is like you having the chance to find a 100 dollar bill on the sidewalk. The fighting is ok but not like the other total war games but intresting. The rewards arn't worth having your soldiers go in there not even the brutal rewards.			"

												Horrible Game.  Resource collection is a joke.  I get the desire to make it so it is way easier if you pay your way but unless you live, breathe, eat and screw this game you will never be able to collect resources at anything but slower than a snail's pace.  Combat is another joke, a sad, sad joke.  The best units cost gold.  The crafting system takes forever because of said resource collection.  Your units are under armed and overwhelmed against the AI and other players that pay their way to win.I thought, hey, its a game from my favorite developer, it should be fair and balanced and fun to play.  Nope not even.Don't waste your time, so many other tablety games out there with better progression and WAY more fun to play.			"

												As far as I can tell most of the negative reviews are gamers expecting this to be like normal Total War games. These players seem completely unfamiliar with the MMORTS genre. It is VERY different than other total war games. I am a huge total war fan and if I was comparing this to other total war games I would give it a terrible rating. But the reality is, for the genre, this is a fantastic game. Few other games I've played in this genre (like Stronghold kingdoms) are as well done as Total War Kingdoms. It has graphics, a fun playstyle, etc. The biggest issue it has are the pay to win elements. I would ultimately recommend the game, but make sure you're looking for what it's offering. If you go into it with low expectations you might be pleasantly surprised. :)			"

												This game is designed for the mobile, microtransaction market and it shows.  There are so many things wrong with this game that I don't know where to begin.Here's the biggest problem I've had so far: I spent hours building up an area and gathering resources in order to pay tribute to a new area.  The original area I built up showed no water source to the north.  However, upon conquering the area to my north a river suddenly appears out of nowhere and floods my original area, wiping out my roads, farms and mines.  I built dams at the source only to have them break several hours later, once again putting the entire region under water.The wait times in this game are ridiculous.   Build a farm and it could take several days before you see any food source appear from said farm.  Build a woodcutter and it will take several days for the land to turn to dirt, for your workers to plant trees and then several more days for the trees to grow so you can chop them down for a meager reward only to repeat the cycle over and over and over.Armies are small compared to other games in the total war series, yet you always seem to face an army that is twice as large as your own.  Your army to limited in size and if you choose to train the wrong type of soldier you're pretty much SOL until you're able to upgrade your baraccks.  However, upgrading is so tedious it'll take days, if not weeks, to get said upgrade.If you're a glutton for punishment and love ""paying to win"" then this is the game for you.			"

There isn't a battle system that comes even close to the complexity and genius of Rome: Total War- a game that came out 9 years ago! Instead, you have LANE-BASED combat. There really shouldn't be any more reasons for you to stop and simply uninstall the game. It's not worth your time.			"

												My biggest beef with this is that I know the Total War franchise knows how to build games.  It has build countless award winners and pushed it's genre with each new hit (there are exceptions to this rule too ie Rome Total War, latest Attilla expansion).  This game was lazyly put together to add quick cash flow into a stail genre and a slowly sinking ship that has now become wargamming.  Like countless other city builder games, the only high light I find note worthy is that you can attempt to command your small army around fighting invaders and other unwantted sort in your kingdom.  What i find to be the biggest insult, is that War Gamming makes you pay for anything that you any chance against a AI that seems to be able to counter any army you bring (Easy armies tend to be well over quallified to be called easy and the fact you get nothing from them not even silver is a mockery when all you get invading you is easy targets).  Aside from that, the whole buy into this game to progress, makes this game just another (like mentioned before) quick buck, builder game with little to no character that makes it stand out amongst a sea of other more established games in this genre.

												Resource management is too punishing if you don't know exactly what you are doing. Battles just feel like rock, paper, scissors and overall the game has way to strong of a pay to win vibe for me to enjoy.			"

												So I logged on to steam and this showed up "" TOTAL WAR BATTLES KINGDOM"" I didnt buy it (its free). So i play it and quickly realize that to actually make progress you have to buy up to $200 in microtransactions ( in game purchasing to progress)! It also mocks many games on the app store on a phone or tablet,and I have to say i'm very,very disapointed in the ""TOTAL WAR"" devolopers and quit frankly the game. NOT WORTH IT! 1/10!			"

												I gave this game a shot for a couple days. While the game looks nice and many key elements are there, they are arranged all wrong.  Here are some my issues with the game. Very little in game information or help.  You can only figure things out through costly trial and error, and I mean cause a flood that destroys your whole town kind of errors. Nitpicky resource collection that requires checking in every 15 minutes for a tiny amounts of reward.  Resources that are essential for growing your economy I should add. Ain't nobody got the time. Wildly divergent difficulty in the battles even when they are rated the same level. The battles themselves are paced horribly.  It takes a minute for them to even start, and when they do you have 5 seconds to issue as many orders as you can, but most have global freaking cooldowns including picking targets for archers! And then you just wait while some sort of confusing magic happens and either you win or you lose.  Impossibly long waits for duels and when you get one its often somebody you already fought recently.  The matchmaking pool is about as deep as a Kardashian.  Crafting menu looks like the controls to some alien spacecraft, in other words indecipherable.  No online resources.  I realize this is not the domain of the developer per se, but it is a bad sign if no one cares enough about this game to even make beginner's guide. Tiny icons.  I play this on a widescreen monitor and I can not imagine playing it on a mobile screen.  I would rather smash my gonads with a hammer than try and click finicky little buttons with my fat fingers.  Hidden virtual dead ends. It is easy to get yourself into a spot where uninformed choices will lead you down a path to obsolescence, either militarily or economically.  Which leads me to my last point.  There is no do over button. There have been about 12 times I have wanted to start over in the last 4 days I have tried this game and I have found the lack of this ability incredibly frustratingAll in all I recommend staying away from this poorly designed mess until they streamline the gameplay.

												I will actually give a review that isn't childish hate for hardwork. Or a fluff of fanboyism.This game is free to play. So in reality they need to make some sort of profit off of it to make it worth their time and money, Keep this in mind when you begin playing it.This is a game built to cater to total war fans AND tablet F2P fans. Keep this in mind when you begin playing it.It is designed to let you play for a half hour to an hour. And then set it aside and do something else. When you come back the next day you are rewarded with the things you did the previous day.Hate this model or love it.But this is a well built F2P game.Looks beautiful, has a strategy battle system that is fun. But can become a little annoying because it is very rock, paper, scissors.If you are willing to pay for your enjoyment, then you will be getting the accelerated experience. But it is no different then someone who doesnt. Just comes to you faster. The F2P idea is interesting. But I am not usually a fan. I love creative assembly and appreciate their hardwork on every game they have ever made. Because they do things no one else is willing to try.These games are more rewarding if you are willing to be patient. But I will probably spend between 10 - 20 dollars on the game if it continues to pique my interest.Don't turn away from the game based on the haters. Give it a try, and actually give it some time. If its not your thing then remember that ITS FREEEEEEEE.Thanks for reading, and hope you found this useful. Have a good day! "

												Loaded up game. Graphics are okay, not fantastic but not bad either. Followed my way through the tutorial - game crashed twice here (tutorial window would lock and not proceed, had to keep restarting the game). Tutorial walks through buildings and terraforming the land, which is kind of neat. Did my first tutorial battle. Stared dumbfounded at my screen as I did literally nothing and the battle was won. Was rewarded gold for winning the battle where I stared down my enemies?Decided to try this battle thing one more time. Ordered one group of archers to attack an enemy. Clicked on the other group of archers to issue the same command, only to discover ""attack"" is on cooldown. Watched while one group of archers engaged an enemy with deadly arrows, while the other group just sorta sat there and took it like a lil ♥♥♥♥♥. Battle doesn't pause, it's like being forced to watch the train wreak of your troops as they throw themselves forward for slaughter. I won the battle again somehow, must be rigged.This game is a lot of clicking and a lot of waiting. The battles are boring and oversimplified. Everything in the game boils down to spending gold to buy something - boosts, heals, equipment, etc. You know, that Pay2Win model that's so popular on the mobile games market.I'm almost disappointed Creative Assembly went this route. I'm not about to start logging into TW:K every 4 - 8 hours just to harvest wheat. This is not really a Total War game, but I guess a lot of us already know that. /uninstall			"

												Many excuses for saying such things (especially for people who considers the game a pay-to-win video game), but this one has a small potential of success due to three things:1) Construction - building on a Total War game is the first thing I ever seen, yet it's no wonder due to the fact that also, in Total War Battles: Shogun, you had the ability to build. The building materials, even if require patience for cutting trees in eight damn hours, are very well handled because, in the previous Total War games, you had to pay gold to build a keep or a harbour.2) Battles - these battles still remained as realistic as possible. From splattering swordsmen with a rain of arrows, to the horsemen who bangs through the spearmen, I can't say, but the battle physics are well done.3) Real-time physics - maybe I spelled wrong, but the time of the game is very realistic. Putting seasons and flooding, the game looks more harder to play, and I really like this.Other than the fact that you have to pay gold, the game is remarkably nice and realistic.			"

This game is still only in beta and they ware still working on it already this is one of my favourite games and is fairly new with new things surely to be added.  Summary- it is a fairly new game in beta stage and is already very enjoyable if you have work you only have to go on for a few seconds a day to keep your village/ kingdom good.  The good thing is it is only going to get better, barely any crashes and is a neat game if you like medieval games.			"

Except instead of using a hot blonde to market their game, they piggyback on the Total War franchise.  It's a real shame this unecceptional game bears the title of an exceptional series.   BUT   Seing as that i ahve some hours on this, it can be enjoyable if you like this type of idle game, and you can't argue with the price.  So, you can look at it like Total War branching out.  Or you can realize its a sad attempt to reel in a quick buck or two.			"

												Don´t get misled by the name Total War. It has little to do with TW-series when it comes to gameplay.While that being said, it is a nice little game itself. Don´t expect serious challenges though.Main focus is on managing your keeps or villages and their surrounding resources. Has a nice little(!) touch of keeping environment healty, instead of devastating it all for quick resources.Secondary task is to maintain and upgrade a small force of troops to defend your realm and attack NPCs and other Players.This keeps you entertained while you wait for your resources to be harvested and building to be build.Overall:  It is a pretty decent game for lazy hours, but it is far from being as thrilling as real TW-series games.

												The only reason I am recommending this game is because it is in beta right now and, despite the problems, it has potential. What problems? Crashing isn't really a problem, because when it does happen you lose nothing and it is very easy to get right back into the game because it is constantly running your scenario somewhere up there in the cloud.-Gold is a problem, not a solution. I have no idea how to get it. It is far easier to spend than get, so don't spend it, but then what is the point in having it.-Resources, in general, are a problem. Everything gets gathered so slowly you can't do anything without spending gold, which, when you do, you run out quickly and then can't do anything because you can't get gold. Either increase the yeild of basic level resource gathering facilities (because it costs way too much to upgrade them) or reduce the time it takes to gather the resources themselves. When you do have renewable resources like cattle and sheep, you can skin them for hides or sell them for 'honour,' but they don't let you keep a couple of them in order to keep the herd alive. Nope, they cut them all up and then you have to buy more cattle with the swiftly dwindling resources you no longer have.-Getting good units is a problem, because whenever you have a single type of unit of quality, like longsword knights, you can't make anymore. You can make other knights, but they cost gold and you can't get gold so you shouldn't spend it. You could craft units, but that takes a ridiculous amount of silver and hides, and as previously noted, resources like silver and hides take absolutely forever to gather in.-I have found that when you harvest something the results of the harvest can change dramatically. I have harvested all my wheat fields at once, but somehow get less per field than if I had done it one at a time. Ostensibly, the reason is that you don't have enough workers to get the full yield out of the wheat fields if harvested all at once. Then why did I sow all the wheat fields at once? And if we are going for reality, why don't we harvest wheat in the autumn and increase the yield to cover the year?-I have gathered wood from deadwood piled up on shore in odd places. The store of the deadwood when you click on it says 100. When you gather the wood though, you get 50 and the deadwood disappears. -Fishing takes longer than harvesting wheat. And fishing should replenish itself if you spread out and slow down your efforts. It does not, however, replenish itself.-Battles can be quite maddening. The good news is you never completely lose a unit unless you delete its training facility  or disband it. Mission difficulty seems to increase with your rank, but your troops don't really keep up because it costs so freaking much of the resources you can't gather fast enough or gold which you don't get just to upgrade training facilities in order to upgrade the unit, which has experience points from battling you can't use unless you do upgrade the training facility. So, as you continue along, you start to lose a lot of battles because your troops just can't keep pace. I'm losing about half now.-the Total War folks do put out codes to redeem in the game for free resources, which points out they are aware of how ridiculous it is to grow/gather your own stuff, but they seem to think that giving them out as 'single-use' codes is a good idea, so that only one person can use the code and then it is no good for whoever else is next. There are millions of gamers out there and I'm not tuned in to Facebook at all hours of the day, so I have given up on getting a code. Ever.That's a lot of complaining, but I do like the game. The persistent timeline is cool, I don't have to be playing for everyone to keep on working. All this having been said they have a lot of good stuff going on in the game and I am eager to see it developed further in its gameplay and in ways to play, like tablets. This is definitely better than the Total War Battles: Shogun.			"

												I'm just five hours in and somehow I think I'll be quadrupling that figure in not too much time. Yeah, there's the fact that you can buy gold for your precious dollars, but you don't have to. There are many ways you can gain gold in the game, namely completing quests, mining, taverns, tracking, exploring tombs and tributes from your people. They bring in little and that not too often. Just enough to support your vanity and let you buy a new hairpiece once in a while.Landscape management is just a blast: getting that damn water to flow where you want to is a challange on its own. Personally, this is my favourite part of the game, and the most engaging. Battles offer just enough depth to keep them fresh, but they're also a reminder that this game was made for mobile. In terms of tactics, there isn't very much going on here.All in all I'd recommend you give this game a try if you've got some time on your hands. Preferrably on your phone, because for a mobile game, it's gorgeous.			"

												This game, can be fun when you want to sit back and kill time. But it get's pretty frustrating. You are given limited troops that are ""Free"". After which you either save up Gold bars to buy more special units, or you have to get a lot of resources to create them in your blacksmith.Or you pay money to buy them.This is a huge issue, due to the cause that the computer will have tons of special units at the ready, at which point they have the upper hand over you.This game is Free, more more like ""Free"" you can play without paying, but to progress far it will be super difficult. The devs should have given you more special units for free before making it ""Free"" you only get 1 special Knight and Calvary before you have to pay to get even better ones.This is sad, because I enjoy the Total War games, but this is starting to really frustrate me, that you can't make a fair advantage game play with your ""Free"" games.

												Nothing much to add to the others reviews. This game is about waiting or spending money, I've started with a 1000 gold extra from the Humble Bundle pack, but still takes forever to mine and gather other resources, a time-waster. Battle mechanics are nothing special, the ""click-charge"" thing it's just annoying and has nothing to do with strategy, after a few battles it just gets boring.I'm not saying it's a bad game, just the business model they chose and the dull battles, I prefer to pay for any other Total War game and get a better experience.

												This seems like the type of abomination they'd put out because the executives and shareholders at sega demanded a game for the IOS platform. My best guess is that they put a small portion of the dev team to work on this because the larger portion is working on Total War: Warhammer and Total War: Arena, which may explain the drastic shift in gameplay type and why it differs so much from the Total War franchise in general.Here is a basic rundown of why it's terrible and should be reworked to the point where it is either almost an entirely different game, or just dropped entirely.1.) Building-Obviously meant for mobile devices, the building system makes getting any visible progress tedious and boring until you start dropping good portions of money on it. 2.) The main reason I even installed this- the combat- is slow and unintuitive. Don't expect to be making any decisive military tactics here, the only possible strategy is to walk forward until the AI get within range to attack.You are basically an observer in the conflict, which is almost painfully terrible in itself. I haven't played long enough to get to the so called ""Multiplayer"" and I don't intend to.This game has literally no saving graces, pro's, or anything gameplay wise atleast. The graphics aren't great for PC, but it's clear they were shooting for a mobile audience here too.Avoid this game and don't give it any money, for at the moment, it deserves none.			"

												A VERY lite version of TOTAL WAR SHOGUN. Not nearly as large in scale, not nearly♥♥♥♥♥large in unit count movement , deployment, or commands.. Not nearly as complicated. It is quite nice. Sometimes I like to micromanage my managers. Sometimes I like to command multitudes of men, units, squads, PLatoons, and armies. Sometimes for about an hour then it starts getting a little weary. A very good game like SHOGUN . which is fun an hour at a rime (game time also) means you progress an hour ata time . Here you dont have to manage EVERY minute detail. So it can run in your time and develope in real time.			"

												   Unfortunately,  this is another one of the growing number of Clash of Clans style knockoffs, not a small installment of the RTS we all know and love.  Except instead of using a hot blonde to market their game, they piggyback on the Total War franchise.  It's a real shame this unecceptional game bears the title of an exceptional series.   BUT   Seing as that i ahve some hours on this, it can be enjoyable if you like this type of idle game, and you can't argue with the price.  So, you can look at it like Total War branching out.  Or you can realize its a sad attempt to reel in a quick buck or two.			"

												So many bugs holy crap.on my pone as well. Battle don't load at all on computer 99% of the time. But your units are automatically dead. duel battles are way not balanced. even when you set up your units correctly for the oposing units. the same goes for normal battles. I have evel lost whote battles that give no exp they should be so easy. You don't ever have to upgrade your troops. all it does is increase the respawn time. upgrading ur units just has you fight stronger units. no advantage in battle. if you mine something in high level land you have to dig a huge hole all around it doestroying anything to get to the lowest level. then do it again for 1 square away. To get good units you must pay. or you can buy one like every year with your 1 gold give per day.for a game that asks for gold to be able to get anywhere. you have a lot to fix before I would spend a cent			"

												This shouldn't even be a game with a 'Total War' title, or even a game at all. Give it a try, but you'll be disappointed.All-in-all, this isn't a brand-spanking new installment in the Total War franchise. Oh no no. It's just a ridiculously 'farmy' mobile title that claims to be something fresh. The graphics are actually quite nice and crisp, but it's useless having a visually decent game when there is little to nothing of interest to actually do.If you're a person that enjoys waiting 10 minutes to harvest some wheat, or a minute to build a house, you'll love this game. Alternatively you can pay-up some real money to instantly complete these 'jobs'. Once you've waited for minutes on end to complete some useless stuff, now you can go fight......on a three-laned 'Plants vs Zombies'-styled battle, where your only input is pressing a button at the right time.Seriously, just don't spend your precious time on this 'game'.1/10 (1 point for good art style and graphics)			"

												Well, I have read other reviews, played this game for few hours. This game is not really bad actually. Let's say about it pros and cons:Good:_Graphic is fine, work well on old/slow PC._It's free... so heck.yeah.Bad:_Take time to wait (waiting is fine with me)_No mini map. You know, the game is pretty wide, but no map == really..._Pay to not waiting._So hard to earn gold, I mean nearly impossible to earn it beside doing the quest._The amount of resources collected is not really much._Boring combat. Limitted number of units. Seriously, only 3 lines fighting. *sighSo anyway, this game is pretty fine to me. You know, go in game, do stuff, then exit to do your own stuff then come back. They dont put the knife to your neck and demand us to buy gold.However, some people are right, this is better to be a mobile phone game. It looks like Class of Clans (waiting and waiting) combined with Civilization (hexagon area).			"

People have said it before: this game doesn't deserve the titel Total War. it's an other one of those awful mobile phone-strategy games, with bad graphics, awful controls, and things that you need to keep buying to make the game playable. WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THOSE KIND OF GAMES!!!!! Go make good games again, please. I have always liked Total war. Attila wasn't a desaster, but still: don't pull another EMP-RO2 failure.

												Well I do not do reviews often because I do not wish to come off wrong nor be trolled. But this game has made me wish to try.First this to me isn't even worth being on PC. It is pretty much an app game or facebook game. I have played for a bit and grew bored of the similarities to app games harvest times and crap. Also fighting battles on normal and having lord units destroy me over and over and the tiny amounts of exp battles give is useless, granted if you wish to spend real money you can instantly get better units just like in an app/FB game... I wish this game was more like other total war games or even like shogun total war but with knights and your hero could fight in the battle...but alas your leader is a useless image and that's it.  I am not impressed with pay to win games. If i spend money on a game i expect to get cool dlc, new units (that do not break the game or whatever), or cool looking appearances for characters not the ability to instantly buy high tier troops, buildings, cancel out timers or whatever. I would not... No Can not recommend this game to people. If this is your thing fine but its a waste of time when there are so many great free to play games out there. Sorry if you like this game that's fine, this is just how I myself feel.			"

												The game engine is well made, though, CA needs to improve those bugs a little bit, or make official guides to make people NOT think those are bugs. The other thing I would prefere to see is a bigger voice story, like in the tutorial, more interactions between other player and so on. More issues, maybe things like allyances, Lord interactions (khights fests, duels, the possibility of upgrading in some ways the Lord, etc.). As well I'd prefere to chose religion, maybe factions, or something like that, but i really believe that CA don't leave this as a beta, and will improve the game in the future.

												Edit after over 2 months: After over 2 MONTHS since my previous review, I figure that this game should be a lot better. Plenty of time to patch and improve things, right? WRONG! What do I see? The exact same, pay-to-win garbage. I was hoping that this wouldn't happen, but it did. This game is cashing in on the (fairly) good name of Total War. I am incredibly dissapointed, and will likely not play again.THE REVIEW BELOW IS OUTDATED:As a fairly experienced Total War player, I can say that this game still has some of the spirit of the other  games in the franchise. Keep in mind, though, that I am recommending this as a free-to-play mobile game. Do not expect the same amount of depth as other Total War games. Combat:For a game of this type, the combat is amazingly good. For once, a mobile game allows you to have some control over your men (unlike letting them ""roam free"" as in similar games).Graphics:So far, so good. I really like the overall atmosphere of the game. The lighting, textures, and objects all look crisp and good.Pay-To-Win:In the tutorial, battles were fast, building built in minutes. After the tutorial, it's a different story. I was quickly slammed with a 9 hour wait time. Advice for CA:Lower the building and clearing times in the beginning of the game. The jump is just too large after the tutorial. Also, try to lower the building restrictions.Should You Play?I think that this game has enough potential to give a reason to play. Although, to go from ""having potential"" to ""great"", changes have to be made. It is in Beta right now, so I am confident that CA will make the changes necessary for this to be a great game. Try it out.			"

												This may be the first positive review...!In short, it's engaging, dynamic, fairly effortless and solidly immersive. A game to snack into from time to time.It's Civilization meets Travian meets Total War - and done fairly well.To be clear, the idea of this game is to be a cross-platform thing you can dip in and out of: Battles are tres petit and your actions generally take several minutes to several hours to complete on the campaign map. With that in mind, it's not a typical Total War game to sit at for 18 hours solid conquering. If you come in  with that expectation, you're going to cry.Instead it's like so many similar time-based multiplayer online games (Travian, Tribal Wars, Clash of Clans - there may be haters, but they're good fun with work colleagues when you don't have a lot of time on hand). Only difference is that this is so far more immersive and much more fun. Battles are suitably tactical and challenging and deliver a quick buzz (handy for coursework breaks).So far, the campaign map's relatively well paced and there are plenty of new glossy things getting unlocked to keep me interested. It's a massive hex map that you unlock new theatres by defeating the army there - in each one it's a mix of terra-forming and town-building (lots and lots of little houses), trying to twist streams where you want them to make life more fertile and sustainably milk the land. It was an emphasis I wasn't expecting, but a lot of fun.I haven't felt at a disadvantage by not buying any things yet either.Negatives... Haven't found any significant ones yet, other than it's eating too much of my productivity.Give it a go - just don't expect MTW3.			"

												The design of the game is great and the battle may not be a Total War's normal battle but it's good -- however -- the building time in the game is not something I'm a big fan of. It is made to be ridiculously and unreasonably long that you are indirectly forced to use gold. Gold is something that you cannot gain easily from the game and I believe that you have to use real world money to purchase them. I hate to say this, but the game feels like a scam similar to a lot of mobile games that are designed not for the game to be enjoyable, but to make profit. I do not recommend it, but some might still like this game.			"

												I have played over 500 hrs (or so Steam says; it must include time the compurter is active even though I am not).The game is okay, but not great. Now that I have occuppied all six territories, I am not sure what would motivate me to play again. There is not much variation in the game; gather resources, update buildings and/or units then go fight a couple of battles, then repeat. The battles are boring, the waiting for some some buildings and upgrades are boring and the battles do not come close to representing medieval warefare.The game starts out stating that it is 915AD.The English did not have longbows in the 10th century. The Welsh may have had longbows that early. They certainly did by the time of the Anglo-Norman invasion during the later part of the 11th century. Edward I (kind of England 1272 - 1307is generally regarded as being the one who introduced the use of the longbow into the English forces. There were no knights in England prior to the Norman invasion in 1066. While the Thegns and Ceorls rode to the battle on horseback, they dismounted to fight.I have no idea what composite bows are suppose to represent.Crossbows and longbows have similar ranges and impact (killing power) but longbows have a much higher rate of fire yet in the game, they seem to fire at the same or nearly the same rate. Longbowmen took years to train while crossbowmen took an half an hour at most to instruct, yet in the game you have to pay real money or spend an eternity to make crafts to acquire a crossbowman, while a longbowman is available immediately.Javelin men usually only carried two javelins which were expended as a preliminary to a melee charge. Yet in the game, they have an unlimited number of javelins to throw. The effective range of a Javelin was about 20 meters while the effective range of a longbow and crossbow was in excess of 100 meters, yet in the game they have essentially equal range to the archery units.Spearmen vs mounted knights, this is an absurdity. Until the advent of pikes and halberds, the knights were the kings of the battlefield. Prior to the battle of Sterling Bridge, there was no significant battle in which a knightless force defeated a force with knights. Pikes and halbards were effective against knights but the Pike did not come into common use until the later half of the 13th century and the halberd about 100 years later.Knights should be extremely expensive and rare and virtually industructable. Longbows and crossbows could bring down a knight, but mostly they brought down their horse and knight was trampled by one of his peers or foes.  It took years to train a knight. They started training at the age of seven as a page. After seven years, the page would become a squire and after another seven years the squire might become a knight. An exceptional squire might become a knight as early as age 18. however, not all pages became squires and not all squires became knights.So if the game is to be about England and you want knights, longbowman, and pikes, the it need to be set in the middle 13th century, no the 10th centry.

The battles are basically you using special abilities and clicking circles to be able to even move.Made a damn and rose the terrain?

Even thiough my troops are in tip top shape they still loose to inferior forces.  i decided to wait it out and try hope crafting would improve something. What a total wast of time and resources in crafting. What a total waste of time in terra scaping. What a total waste in expecting eventually you can match up and beat others in a Duel. to sum it up ... What a TOTAL piece of crap game. And yes it is free to play enjoy			"

												I do not recommend this game for TW fans as it is a very different game than the rest of the TW series. Furthermore, this game is intended firstly to make money without any real marketing strategy. The basic gameplay is directly linked to the purchase of gold with real money. Otherwise the game is very slow. An example: my character is level 24 and I've done (almost) all possible developments after 20 hours of gaming. To go further, I need to have a castle level 2, which means 1500 stones and 1500 silver. If you don't speed up the game using gold (i.e. real money), you're making around 100 silver every 2 hours. Same with stones... So, just to get this damn castle to level 2, I have to wait around 30 hours!  The basic gameplay should be the same, gold or not. I have no problem with paying some money to the developers. Gold should allow to improve the gameplay, not to replace it. But in this game, if you don't use gold, there is no gameplay and the game is just a mock up version of old strategy games I played in the 80's on my first computers. The combat system is obviously made for tablets, not for PC. It is dull, with very little strategy and tactical choices (the biggest stick wins). The only interest I found in this game is the map and the way you can change it. There is a good idea there but it's a pity: no action (except economics and construction) is taken on the map... As if the devs had never played Stronghold or Civ. Strange!			"

												This game is designed for the mobile, microtransaction market and it shows.  There are so many things wrong with this game that I don't know where to begin.Here's the biggest problem I've had so far: I spent hours building up an area and gathering resources in order to pay tribute to a new area.  The original area I built up showed no water source to the north.  However, upon conquering the area to my north a river suddenly appears out of nowhere and floods my original area, wiping out my roads, farms and mines.  I built dams at the source only to have them break several hours later, once again putting the entire region under water.The wait times in this game are ridiculous.   Build a farm and it could take several days before you see any food source appear from said farm.  Build a woodcutter and it will take several days for the land to turn to dirt, for your workers to plant trees and then several more days for the trees to grow so you can chop them down for a meager reward only to repeat the cycle over and over and over.Armies are small compared to other games in the total war series, yet you always seem to face an army that is twice as large as your own.  Your army to limited in size and if you choose to train the wrong type of soldier you're pretty much SOL until you're able to upgrade your baraccks.  However, upgrading is so tedious it'll take days, if not weeks, to get said upgrade.If you're a glutton for punishment and love ""paying to win"" then this is the game for you.			"

												It's really ok as long as you have something else to play when your waiting 8 hours for something to finish building. Point is that its a horrible PC game, but a decent iphone game. Other negative reviews are pretty spot on with it being a tedious piece of trash, but at least its better then other trashy similar games on the iphone. It just needs to have a better and more indepth battle system, cancel out the wait times, not hold your hand through the first hour, not pressure players to use real money, have a better and bigger map for your kingdom, have a more total war feel, etc. You get the point, its garbage... but free garbage and a title slightly better then the other top RTS gerbage games on your iphone.3/10 on PC7/10 on iphone			"

												A lot of fun. Really wish there was a detailed tutoiral somewhere. I messed up my initial position because I did not quite get the synergy effects from nearby buildings.  Also caused a lot of accidental floods, etc. but it's still a whole lot of fun.  Played for 12 hours without buying any gold from market. Obviously that's the way to get the best out of your troops via gear. but made it to level 20 lord with no problems other than building and terrain mistakes.   And some tactics errors in battles. but it is a very fun medieval sim.I like that the classic problems of resource management are factors.  flooding, lack of funds, deforestation, really enjpying the challenges, and watching and managing the little towns that are built.I think it is the right mix between tactics and a little bit of strategy, plus kingdom management.  And the battles have the right level of command from the rear feel. A few simple commands, give your tropps the right formations, and trust to equipment and luck.Even if the troops lose battles, they learn and get better.  And armies can fight on without getting wiped out completely,  lessons learned, go at it again, with better tactics.Learning the battles and warfare as I go is a nice progression, building skills, makes it a semi RP game at a very low level.   And the graphics are really good and have a lot of flavor.  But not too intensive.  Playing from dialup on an old laptop, it's not a problem, unlike many other games on steam.Great job, developers.

												Just downloaded this game because I was bored. Looked like a great game on steam and had pretty good review and so I downloaded it, As I got further and further into the game I reaised how similar it was to Age of empires which is also a great game, the point of the game is to build up your town/village and take over the world. Its also simliar to Mount & Blade war band which is another great game that I love where the fight scenes take place and how you control the battle as well as who you can have in your army, you have full control! Overall great game and I highly recomend it if you like strategic and war games! as well as Mid evil times. I rate this game a 9/10 a 9 for how great the game is but it would be better if you could tweak it and make it so your lord can go to battle as well!			"

												Good game so far as I've played.  Combines strategic resource production and simple battle tactics for a fun game you can pick up and leave be as time permits.  There are (as always) some elements where those willing to spend money will be sligtly ahead of the rest that are wont, but not so much as to make the game hard or frustrating to play.   DO NOT expect this game to be like a normal Total War game.  But it's not suppose to be.  Normal Total War games require pretty in-depth planning and careful execution, I can average 30-45 minutes per turn not to mention the 45min+ battles.  This takes a simplified approach to the game, like I said above it allows you to pick it up play for 5 minutes and leave it be.  Its not bad by any means, just don't expect a normal Total War game.All in all I'd say 8/10 and considering it's free, I would highly recomend it.			"

												This game offers a two mode game similar to Campaign and Battle in Total war, but remade as ""mini-town building"" and ""mini-tactical battles"". Think a slow moving yet somewhat compact version of a Total War with other feature in mind. I find myself doing more landscaping and ""town planning"" by hex buildings -  This aspect is quite new but interesting because it gives something to explore for new players who come sign-up (although from this point, maybe people decide whether the game is their style or really hate how it does not feel like Total War).For battles, don't expect to see huge army stacks in epic battle. But quick skirmish with smaller ""army groups"" but with upgradeable and persistent soldier units. If you like a bit of RPG-element of improving stats and selecting which one to focus (although, there are not too many to worry about).If you dislike the trend of ""freemium"" games nowadays by any type and aspect, please beware of the ""time limiter"" of progress of both the town building and unit management for battles (the replinishment). While gold can still be acquired in game, it is not plenty and if you are not the waiting type, you may have to choose between paying real-life money to speed things up.So, adjust your expectation, think more like a ""small-town army"" manager game - with ""mobile-style freemium"" limits to action. If you can do this, then Total War Battles: Kingdom is a quick-fix game you can have on computer and take with you if you so feel attached to your hex town and warbands of upgradable units. It can still be likeable depending on your initial expectation.			"

												After a few more hours of play, I've changed my review. It is fun to play 10-15 minutes at a time and it's cool to see your empire grow and establish new cities. It's also not forced on you to pay real money. Gold (which you can purchase) can be exhanged for in-game resources or to replenish your men faster.All-in-all, it's a fun game if you're into the mobile gaming platform			"

												this is an interesting mix of strategy game like other total war series and a card game like magic the gathering.  It is interesting, but the format has less of the feel of active combat and more of the feel of a city building game.			"

												I've never played a 'Total War' game, so my review of this game doesn't come from having any expectations associated with that name.  I have, however, played a lot of these types of strategy games.  This one is a bit different from the ones I've played (I'll go more into that as I go), but I still found it was one I will keep playing for a while to see where it goes.  I've played 34 hours now and have started over three times because the game does not really walk you through all you need to know as a newcomer to the scene.   After searching through forums, I found most of them outdated, as are some of the complaints in this review forum.  Not everything you read here as pro's/cons are relative anymore.  They've changed up a few things that were people's pet-peeves  (thank goodness).  I can appreciate game designers who do that.  So, take everything you read here with a grain of salt.  Also, this game is not for someone who likes to rush to the top.  It is the slowest-moving game of this type that I have played thus far, but it used to be slower from what I've read in some of the negative reviews here, compared with my experiences.  I have gotten to level 22 in the first day of playing, but that only helps with unlocking more buildings and more objectives (it's easy to level up in this game).  What takes up the most time in this game is the timers on everything. There's timers on construction, deconstruction, food, troops healing, people becoming available to use in your economy buildings, on trees re-growing (although, it used to be worse), etc.  Most put this game in the category of being one that you pick up and play for a few minutes, then come back to a few hours later.  I didn't do that during my time going from level 1-22, so there were some stretches there that were boring.  However, you have to do a lot of battles in order to keep the flow or resources coming in, as well as working on leveling your troops, which is important so that can keep you some-what busy.The things I find the most frustrating about this game are (Con's): 1. There is no real need for the timers.  I don't understand why they exist for everything.  Some games like this require them to make the game competitive with other players, but in this game, you choose when you do any PVP business so that pretty much eliminates the need for timers.  You aren't fighting against the clock because your protection lifts in so many hours, type of thing.2. The materials you need to build or craft anything are astronomical.  It is a bit ridiculous and it is not like they are that easy to come by.  3. To level your castle to level 2 is a pain.  I found a way to do it ""easily"" but it is still a pain, nonetheless (I peeped on a forum where it was 'theorized' you could build three castles in the first two sections of land you acquire and I did it, but it came with a very steep price and I am not talking about any real money or game currency - I used up a lot of resources to do it, which means a huge loss of time making them back up).  It is imperative that you level your castle to level 2 in order to get anywhere in your duels, which opens the door to you obtaining your third tract of land to build on (I still have yet to do that).   I also have yet to level a castle to level 2, but was thrilled to finally open the door to it being possible now.  It's imperative to do so I can level up my military buildings, which opens the door to being able to level up my troops to two-stars.  That is necessary for dueling, which leads me to the next con on my list...4. Duels are where you finally PVP with other players.  They are just like the battles with AI, so there is no need to defend your castle(s) or village-folk in fear of being plundered, you just have to survive on the battlefield.  I don't know how their match-up system works, but my first attempt at dueling I was set up with someone that had 2 more slots open for troops than I had, which made them way more powerful than I was.  They wiped me out fast.  I do not like their match up system, whatever it is.  It does not seem balanced at all. 5. Also, along with their fail matching system for duels, there does not seem to be a lot of people who play this game.  I have sat and waited a long time before I was matched up with anyone and I attempted three times at different times of the day/night before I finally had any takers.6. Last but not least, I do not like how you are basically left to your own devices on how to figure out how the game works.  You have no clue that it is important to build certain structures next to certain other structures in your villages till you throw a few down on the tarmac where you can finally read about them in their 'menu' that you have to manually open and read.  You also don't have any idea exactly what a troops strengths/weaknesses are till you find your troops strewn about the battlefield dead before you realized it.  There are no tool tips and no up-to-date forums on such things anywhere that I could find, so I am learning by trial and error.  Some folks like that, I prefer more of a balance.  I don't want my hand held, but at the same time I don't like making costly mistakes that set me back several hours.  For the Pro's:1. Quality of graphics: It is a beautiful game for what it is.  It's free to play, but looks better than most.2. Game play:  It doesn't have bugs in it from what I've experienced thus far.3. It's a pain to advance at different points along the game, but that is what keeps me motivated to push forward. 4. There are seasons in the game, with positives and negatives that affect your overall progress in the game and I think that is awesome.  I have only experienced spring thus far, but look forward to seeing the other seasons, as well as the other areas on the map.  I just hope I last that long before I give up, lol.  5.There's no need to pay to play, or to win.  You get plenty of gold bars just playing the game and meeting certain milestones, or finding them in a tomb/cave.  6. The game is not easy.  I like that.  7. This game is expanding my patience thresh-hold. :D  It is not fun waiting for things to finish up, nor is it a lot of fun to grind out levels on my troops, but it is satisfying when it's done and you see/experience the results.  Overall, I am recommending this game despite it's pitfalls.  It's worth trying out, it doesn't cost you a dime....only a few new gray hairs or a sore forehead as you learn by trial and error what is going on.  :P  Enjoy and best of luck to ya.  Hope to see you on the Battlefield.			"

												Garbage. It requires constant input but uses a F2P model. It's like a game that might have been fun to play if you could just keep going but someone came along and thought they could make money from it by making it a boring slog.Your resource buildings can hold exactly 1 production cycle, meaning that every 15 minutes you need to empty them. Your armies have to be grinded up over the course of hundreds of boring basic tactics battles. It is not fun. It is boring.It is the game a company makes when they have no idea what to do with one of their spin offs.			"

												Well i figured i might wright a review on this game my actual playtime is around 36hrs but my last pc blew up (not litterally). anyways should you try this game, yes and no if you like total war and want to rule a kingdom in real time but have epic battles this game is NOT for you however if you like rts and easy to control battles this is FOR you.the battles are nothing special you have lines of units, front, middle, back. you earn unit place areas when u level up.your soldiers consist of, infantry, archers, calvery, and siege weapons (catapult, balista, and trebuchet)when u start off u have a couple of farmers and hunters in your army  then mr. adviser guy MAKES you build a barracks WARNING you can only have one unit per barracks so you cant go out and train 85 knights (you need to have a knights manor to train dismounted knights) there are microtransactions too.

												What shall we do now chef? Let's make a game that makes that even our most die hard fans, who stayed suporting us after desasters like Empire and Rome 2, go and write down on steam how bad this game is. People have said it before: this game doesn't deserve the titel Total War. it's an other one of those awful mobile phone-strategy games, with bad graphics, awful controls, and things that you need to keep buying to make the game playable. WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THOSE KIND OF GAMES!!!!! Go make good games again, please. I have always liked Total war. Attila wasn't a desaster, but still: don't pull another EMP-RO2 failure. If you guys go ahead and make decent or good games again, then we might even forget about the fact that this 'total war' battles: kingdom has ever existed.			"

												This shouldn't even be a game with a 'Total War' title, or even a game at all. Give it a try, but you'll be disappointed.All-in-all, this isn't a brand-spanking new installment in the Total War franchise. Oh no no. It's just a ridiculously 'farmy' mobile title that claims to be something fresh. The graphics are actually quite nice and crisp, but it's useless having a visually decent game when there is little to nothing of interest to actually do.If you're a person that enjoys waiting 10 minutes to harvest some wheat, or a minute to build a house, you'll love this game. Alternatively you can pay-up some real money to instantly complete these 'jobs'. Once you've waited for minutes on end to complete some useless stuff, now you can go fight......on a three-laned 'Plants vs Zombies'-styled battle, where your only input is pressing a button at the right time.Seriously, just don't spend your precious time on this 'game'.1/10 (1 point for good art style and graphics)			"

												Well I do not do reviews often because I do not wish to come off wrong nor be trolled. But this game has made me wish to try.First this to me isn't even worth being on PC. It is pretty much an app game or facebook game. I have played for a bit and grew bored of the similarities to app games harvest times and crap. Also fighting battles on normal and having lord units destroy me over and over and the tiny amounts of exp battles give is useless, granted if you wish to spend real money you can instantly get better units just like in an app/FB game... I wish this game was more like other total war games or even like shogun total war but with knights and your hero could fight in the battle...but alas your leader is a useless image and that's it.  I am not impressed with pay to win games. If i spend money on a game i expect to get cool dlc, new units (that do not break the game or whatever), or cool looking appearances for characters not the ability to instantly buy high tier troops, buildings, cancel out timers or whatever. I would not... No Can not recommend this game to people. If this is your thing fine but its a waste of time when there are so many great free to play games out there. Sorry if you like this game that's fine, this is just how I myself feel.			"

												Spending a bit more than eight hours on this might have been a serious mistake. At first, when I enlisted on participating in the beta, I was hoping that this might be a nice game (knowing the praise that the franchise gets from all it's fans) although I had played very little from other Total War games. After starting up the game and playing around with the options, I entered the tutorial. As previous reviewers have mentioned, there you are taught how to spend as much money as possible, to be only able to skip the ridiculous and tedious amounts of time you have to wait for the construction and completion of simple tasks. So, after I thought about it, I figured out why they decided to implement this peculiar feature: the game was designed for a mobile phone. The weird and unrealistic battle mechanics, the seemingly endless building time and the interface itself just shouted it out. But then came the simple question: Why did they release this for the PC? At least if they had it just for mobile devices, maybe they would have had the understanding of the community. Although this game is an abomination, I think that the developers will redeem themselves and put this setback aside, continuing to release good and ambitious titles, worthy of our money and respect.

												Fan of the Total War Series, have most all the titles.Fan of Paradox, have most of their titles (no they didn't make this, yes it ties in read on):This is not a ""grand strategy game"", it should not be approached as a ""Total War"" game.It is, however, a good game. In fact, the map is simply beautiful - it feels like a sand box.It is a Total War BATTLES game, for those familiar with the other title.And, to be fair, it is massively improved over the first Battles game. Yes, it is a mobile game, but to be fair it is one of the most well balanced micro-transaction games (if not the most)...that I have ever seen.And I'm the guy who ALWAYS quits micro-transcation games (and LOVES the South Park Episode about them). But tough this one out, and if you do spend cash I know you all remember when we had to shell out $5 a month for Runescape - I don't play WoW but it is not free. Look at it that way, again - if you do spend.ALSO IT DOES NOT TAKE 8 HOURS TO GET RESOURCES! THE ONE OPTION THAT DOES IS A WASTE OF TIME, DO NOT CLICK IT.It takes about 20 minutes, usually. Which is actually short for a micro-trans game.			"

												I do really like this game. I'm having a lot of fun with it but i do slowly see that it's starting to get really hard to were i would  have to use gold to pass. Luckily I think i can just keep playing and finally make it through. Still recommend tho. Still a lot of fun.UPDATE: Although i still recommend that people try it, I'm having a more and more of a hard to keep myself playing. The reason being that even on normal difficulty, it's really hard and you barely get any xp for it. To maybe pass the even harder ones you'll have to use gold to help you pass via boosts to archers, boosts to melee troops, quicker cooldowns, or an extra army. They need to make it more worth fighting so that way you don't feel like you are cheated when in combat.UPDATE 2: Game cheats... getting anywhere in this stupid game is ridiculous... I am so dissapointed because i really got into this game too. Don't waste the time.			"

												If like me you don't have the time or patience to sit for hours and play a game, and if like me you like games like Age of Empires, this is a pretty good game. Especially with the latest update to make the game more user friendly, you build experience, resources and complete challanges to further your progression. Plenty of opportunity to stay in-game and play AI which comes in three different difficulties, or there is the option to compete against human opponents. Rewards are good and yes, you do have to wait say.... 20 minutes to farm a piece of land, or 8 hours to farm all areas of land, but if you do it before bed or before work, next tim you're on, it's all done for you. I've progressed well through this and played for a few months and haven't spent a single penny ..... although the developers will probably kick me off now I've admitted that :-)			"

												Before you read this you have to know that I see this game as a decent tablet game. It has the same systems like coc etc that make you wait 10min-3days before something is complete.(The longer waiting times reflect forests and gras that have to grow wich isn't even that unrealistic)I like a lot of it:- NOT pay to win, people who say otherwise are just plain bad at playing strategy games or don't have patience.- Graphics are nice- Very nice Potential!- Battles are exacly how they describe them: fast and hard enough (I win alot and lose some)BUTThere is of yet no Wiki or ingame help that explains why the water levels recede or increase and what the other effects of the seasons are etc.No info on the enemy unit cards wich makes it gueswork to know how to counter them.Recourses increases at a steady rate exept for silver wich is pretty hard to get and is needed for everything. (gues you can trade in the market but it's a 4/1 ratio in the start which is baaaad)EDITWith the new patch there is alot of info.Changes made to the income rate from several recourcesOther fixesGenerally good news :) 7,5/10 for version 0.2 PS: if you don't like tablet games or stuf like Anno online don't play!

Tutorial walks through buildings and terraforming the land, which is kind of neat. Did my first tutorial battle. Stared dumbfounded at my screen as I did literally nothing and the battle was won. Was rewarded gold for winning the battle where I stared down my enemies?Decided to try this battle thing one more time. Ordered one group of archers to attack an enemy. Clicked on the other group of archers to issue the same command, only to discover ""attack"" is on cooldown. Watched while one group of archers engaged an enemy with deadly arrows, while the other group just sorta sat there and took it like a lil ♥♥♥♥♥. Battle doesn't pause, it's like being forced to watch the train wreak of your troops as they throw themselves forward for slaughter. I won the battle again somehow, must be rigged.This game is a lot of clicking and a lot of waiting. The battles are boring and oversimplified. Everything in the game boils down to spending gold to buy something - boosts, heals, equipment, etc. You know, that Pay2Win model that's so popular on the mobile games market.I'm almost disappointed Creative Assembly went this route. I'm not about to start logging into TW:K every 4 - 8 hours just to harvest wheat. This is not really a Total War game, but I guess a lot of us already know that. /uninstall			"

												Overall, the game has a nice feel, a different take on the Total War series!  With no initial, overarching critiques to the game itself, there is one negative I notice so far.  I'm always being disconnected from the server!  I don't know if this is a problem with my computer/modem, or with the game itself!  Hopefully, over time, this issue can be resolved!			"

												Everyone is hating on this game because of its layout and its lack of strategy. Well the fact is this game isnt meant to be something you spend hours upon hours on like Total War Rome II or Attila. This game is meant to be a casual, come back to it when you can, kind of game. Basing this game on that criteria it fits the bill well.  Its the kind of travel and forget until your bored kind of game. Haters need to quit comparing it to totally different titles and expecting it to be the same. Decent game. Definitely good if youre traveling or flying about the country, or just want a low key total war ish experience			"

												Awful and a shame to the Total War name, do not buy. Filled with micro transactions that if you don't purchase the game is unplayable. Wait hours and days to complete tasks. Superior units are only available if you pay real cash. Even when you design your flag they try to make you pay to use 85% of the colors and options. Battle interface is terriable and not enjoyable.

												Quite enjoying it though I wish it would let me restart cause there are quite a lot of lessons I have learned from playing the game, that I would like to restart and redo all over again. For example I built my second city on high ground then discovered I could not get a road to it, so I had to demolish it and rebuild.  Structure that I have learned earn me incoming like smithy, merchants, taverns etc. Built my tavern near the water and it got flooded :p, slums good for recruiting peasants but best built near water, mansions give more craftsmen, building farm in an area with only 3-4 available hexagons is a bad idea as this is where farm land is. Building soldiers no point in upgrading them at early stage rather just buy better soldiers, better soldiers are ultimately cheaper and will win e.g. upgrade soldiers gives 1 point in defence, as you unlock better units, that unit could end up offering an extra 25 points, each point you earn from experience is more expensive, so to earn 25 point equivalent is not going to happen, can also upgrade soldiers, armour, weapons etc.			"

												1.7 hours played, and 1.7 hours is all I need to make a decision.Sadly, it seems that Creative Assembly has been in bed with SEGA too long to the point where everything becomes a micro transaction or a DLC cut from what should've been in the original game. This is a review for Kingdoms, so I digress.Total War Battles: KINGDOM does not appear to be anything more than Creative Assembly's attempt at Game of War, or Clash of Clans (although this could viewed as an insult to these games). While their attempt is noble, these types of games are exclusive to mobile devices for a reason; I could play a much more fleshed out strategy game on my PC. If I want to play a game with busy work, it will be on my phone when I am waiting in between classes.Creative Assembly revolutionized real time/turn based strategy gaming with the Total War franchise. My advice would be to stick to your niche and let the iOS devs stay in theirs.			"

												This may be the first positive review...!In short, it's engaging, dynamic, fairly effortless and solidly immersive. A game to snack into from time to time.It's Civilization meets Travian meets Total War - and done fairly well.To be clear, the idea of this game is to be a cross-platform thing you can dip in and out of: Battles are tres petit and your actions generally take several minutes to several hours to complete on the campaign map. With that in mind, it's not a typical Total War game to sit at for 18 hours solid conquering. If you come in  with that expectation, you're going to cry.Instead it's like so many similar time-based multiplayer online games (Travian, Tribal Wars, Clash of Clans - there may be haters, but they're good fun with work colleagues when you don't have a lot of time on hand). Only difference is that this is so far more immersive and much more fun. Battles are suitably tactical and challenging and deliver a quick buzz (handy for coursework breaks).So far, the campaign map's relatively well paced and there are plenty of new glossy things getting unlocked to keep me interested. It's a massive hex map that you unlock new theatres by defeating the army there - in each one it's a mix of terra-forming and town-building (lots and lots of little houses), trying to twist streams where you want them to make life more fertile and sustainably milk the land. It was an emphasis I wasn't expecting, but a lot of fun.I haven't felt at a disadvantage by not buying any things yet either.Negatives... Haven't found any significant ones yet, other than it's eating too much of my productivity.Give it a go - just don't expect MTW3.			"

												The game is okay. It's designed like any other freemium game and it's pretty fun if you accept that fact. If you treat it like a single player freemium game, then youll probably like it. However the PvP is terrible. It's pretty much a pay to win ordeal. There is no balanced matcghmaking so you get pitted up against guys who bought all the best units with real cash. Then you lose and you have to wait 30 minutes before you can play again.			"

												It's a completetly normal free-to-play ""browser-game""-like game. It's slow, and there's micro transactions if you want to go faster. It doesn't really have much in common with the other Total War titles, but it's still a decent game. So if you're familiar with browser games and like them, go ahead, if you're expecting a f2p total war game with full scale battles and all that jazz, get Rome or whatever			"

												I think people focus to much on the negatives and yes i agree that the game has alot of bad sides for example how long it takes for grass to grow and how you have to pay gold (which cost real money) for most of the things in the game. However the game is still enjoyable and i haven't spent any money. On the other hand i feel that there needs to be more stuff to do with friends for example trade, send a unite to help in a battle, or even form guilds and i do understand that the game is still in beta. But all i ask is that new features like trade are added in at a later date.			"

												OK WE GET IT all you poor little -takes a second- people... you wanted something that was already around right? THIS GAME IS NEW, it is not a copy of any other game, it is an industry leader, and I am in <3 as of my current hours in-game I have not paid a penny into it, and the price for the ""Gold"" is really good- i have decided i will only do the 1 time purchase and the 50 bucks after cause it gives you almost double buying the five dollar when you add up 10 $5 buys- I will save up and stop playing hard if need be lolThank you Total War for creating a game where you don't HAVE to kill everything else on the map- nice change!!!100% Casual game, once you know a few very important thingsblacked out lines are walkthrough of basics I discovered!1) Seasons matteryou start in spring, things grow fast and stone is slow- look at the strange season wheel2) let time be timedon't pay to skip seasons so your little kingdom gets productive again- losing winter's special gift is just as bad as paying for trebuchets ""because you can""    i) I have made it a policy to only use gold when i get it and the price is under 4(usually I wait for 1)    ii) Don't use gold to buy resources- it is completely unworth it3) YOU CAN MAKE GOLD WITHOUT PAYINGI really didn't see this in the other positive reviews-    i) it is not a lot but a castle will give you 1-2 every day or 2     ii) also you can make gold with with taverns (have yet to get that- its like a 3% chance or something -shrugs-)    iii) exploring tombs gives you gold, and leveling up gives you 10 gold     iv) there are a few other ways I'm sure4) Please, know the surface and remember gravity!!! TOTALLY MODIFIABLE TERRAIN LEVEL and other things can be manipulated as well (grass/tree type)    i) I was warned, and I laughed when it actually happened- lowering terrain next to a river is stupid if you didn't want the river to flow somewhere new ;-)     ii) lowering 1 plot at the top of a hill with a river can literally flood 30 tiles as it goes down- don't flip out, just build up about 300 coin and wood and stone so you can rebuild if you screw it up- and do this B4 you modify it you must also have at least 1 market (it will kill you to do but it is still a better deal then using up the construction gold) I have 7 markets and only now is it dealable to trade (I will expain markets better shortly)    iii) just because a prospecting zone wants you to lower terrain does not mean you have to- demolish the damned thing if it will require you to kill off trees you don't want to harvest or get rid of other production buildings or roads- they have (so far) not been worth it at all to do so    iv) walls will protect from floods- build them on the sides of your land that border a river if you want to change it's flow- if there is one terrain level not protected it may flood- and it happens FAST    v) beware of fall- but do not avoid it!!!4) Markets, Taverns, Castles, Cattle Farms and the connected land effect    i) connecting land is not simple- you have to think of how much land your taking away from other things (don't build too many roads within 2 plots of water unless you don't mind the cost in future output of food- i didn't risk that in one area and did in another)    ii) Markets, Taverns, and Castles all need to be connected to gain bonuses and upgrades    iii) cattle need to be connected to a market to buy cattle5) you have to have the people to use some of your buildings     i) 10 peasants = 1 crafts man the transfer is not worth it early- just save the craftsmen and use the peasents as often as you can until you are full then trade them in and start raking in the stuff!6) multiplayer is a side-note    i) I chose to do the 3 rank 18 battles and it was not an easy road toward the end, but much more worth it than as 1500 or every resource!!!    ii) it is much more fun knowing someone real is playing against you7) modify troops b4 going into campaign, to match the needs of your victory8) keep learning- I still haven't gotten into differing tree types (it matters) or masters (pains in the asses) or the fact that at first you think that all of the back slots for troops have to be filled by siege so you end up having 3 balistas and doing great for the first 6 days then you hit a all and go WTFM???? then your like ""oh"" and you feel so unlearned you want to punch 5 holds in the brick wall your desk is in front of9) only pay-to-win-multiplayer and I have not reached the last unlockable place yet so i do not know how that would be to pay forwill update but you have all you need for the early game			"

												           This is a pay to win game, Honsetly a pay to play. You will be flooded endlessly and will run out of trees vary fast, so you will need to buy Gold to use to trade for wood. You might be able to get by for 2-3 days like this. After that you will be straped again for wood. Wood lets you build dams, and change the ground elevation.  You can only plant with in 2 hexes of a fresh water source.  So a lot of your teritory will be useless to you. Because you can only build off from your castle when it comes to your town, with the exception of mines, woodcuters, and farms. The combat is poor at best, you cant manuver your troops, flank or do any kind of stratigy.  instead the armies march strait at each other. Vary dumbed down. In order to gain a decent reward for the random battles, you will have to face higher difficult enemies. But in order to win once again you have to use Gold to buy advatages in battle. Such as artillery, flaming arrows and so on.    Conclussion: If you like to rebuild your town daily, because of the floods, and have no problem wasting real money on a game, this may be a game for you.			"

												This game makes you want to smash your phone, tablet, or PC to bits.  The only way you can gain any advantage is pay to win.  The battles aren't ranked fairly and you'll sit pulling your hair out trying to figure out why you keep losing battles marked as 'Easy' over and over.  There is no way to reset the game if you decide to start over.  You have to register a new game using a different email address than you originally used.  This game has a lot of potential and it's unfortunate the game creators can't get things to work better.  Very disappointing.  The lack of a manual or strategy guide doesn't help the situation.			"

												Have to agree with most of the reviews. This game is made for the phone or tablet. It is NOT a PC Game. In fairness I think the graphics are quite good and the concept is there. The fact that it takes SO long for things to build / resources to devlop makes it unplayable as a PC game. Who is going to sit here sitting at a screen for minutes/hours on end just waiting for things to happen, not me! So i tried it, i kinda like it, but got bored. I think its worth a punt, you might like it, but dont go into this thinking it is ANYTHING like a Toal War game!Now, back to a REAL Total War game....			"

												Not very impressive from the Total War producers. It's got a good layout and the ability to alter the enironment is great and makes for great personaliztion of your kingdom. But it takes a really long time for your projects to complete and money/ resources are not earned quickly enough to keep a god paced game. This is mostly a collect, assign, battle, and logoff game. Not too much attention needed at a time. So next time i have to take a squat, ill be checking in on my kingdom. Other than that, i wont be spendign too much time on it.			"

												Spending a bit more than eight hours on this might have been a serious mistake. At first, when I enlisted on participating in the beta, I was hoping that this might be a nice game (knowing the praise that the franchise gets from all it's fans) although I had played very little from other Total War games. After starting up the game and playing around with the options, I entered the tutorial. As previous reviewers have mentioned, there you are taught how to spend as much money as possible, to be only able to skip the ridiculous and tedious amounts of time you have to wait for the construction and completion of simple tasks. So, after I thought about it, I figured out why they decided to implement this peculiar feature: the game was designed for a mobile phone. The weird and unrealistic battle mechanics, the seemingly endless building time and the interface itself just shouted it out. But then came the simple question: Why did they release this for the PC? At least if they had it just for mobile devices, maybe they would have had the understanding of the community. Although this game is an abomination, I think that the developers will redeem themselves and put this setback aside, continuing to release good and ambitious titles, worthy of our money and respect.

												Total War Battles:Kingdom is ok if you just want to sit and vegetate for awhile. I was split between recomeninding and not recomending. I decided to recomend it only as a casual distraction. I leave it open and alt+tab out to check facebook or sufr the internet. At times, I click back in and collecet resources or fight another battle. I agree with the other reviews that state this isn't really a total war game (at all). It is a little better than clash of clans. It looks nice, but it is a FTP/PTW game. I can see playing it later on the phone, checking once in awile. My most serious concern is that my original account locked out. I get errors trying to sign in an so far I've not been able to resolve it by reinstalling or posting a question on the official forums. I wouldn't put a lot of time into the game until it is stable.			"

												I think this game has a lot of potential. The game has a great opening and a good tutorial. I also like how the troops control during combat. It has a very smooth feeling and appears to be a rather good game considering it is 2 days old. There are a few issues however. First is the teraforming issue. I like how you can change the altitude of the ground to help prevent floods or to create rivers. It is also cool that only certain buildings can be built in certain elevations. (Like how roads can only be built on medium height. it doesn't make sense for a road to go right over a mountain and then right back down) Now the issue I have is that when you want to raise something to be one higher than the area around the tile you can do that. BUT if you want to raise it 2 times you must raise all the other tiles around it. and if one of those tiles can't be raised you either have to raise all the tiles around it OR deal with the lower land and the inability to build something. So if I am at the top of the map and need to raise a piece of ground to medium for a road I have to first raise the tile I want to low, then the 3 below it to low then the nine below those to low. If you want to alter one tile you may have to raise 20 or 30 tiles. It is crazy. What should happen is that if I raise a tile from low to medium and the ground around it is very low it costs double and it just makes the ground look like a little hill on that tile.The other issue is camera control. Just let me use WASD for camera movement. I don't to have to click and drag. It is alright for a mouse but what about anyone using a touch pad. It can take 30 seconds to a minute just to go from one side of the map to another just on the small starting one. Also, who likes a stagnate map? You are building a kingdom. Have people training in the barracks. Have a blacksmith hammering. people walking on the roads. If no one walks on them, what is the point?The game itself is fun. Good combat aspects as well as animation and building design. I think for a new game it is doing alright but there is a lot of progress to be made.			"

												I will actually give a review that isn't childish hate for hardwork. Or a fluff of fanboyism.This game is free to play. So in reality they need to make some sort of profit off of it to make it worth their time and money, Keep this in mind when you begin playing it.This is a game built to cater to total war fans AND tablet F2P fans. Keep this in mind when you begin playing it.It is designed to let you play for a half hour to an hour. And then set it aside and do something else. When you come back the next day you are rewarded with the things you did the previous day.Hate this model or love it.But this is a well built F2P game.Looks beautiful, has a strategy battle system that is fun. But can become a little annoying because it is very rock, paper, scissors.If you are willing to pay for your enjoyment, then you will be getting the accelerated experience. But it is no different then someone who doesnt. Just comes to you faster. The F2P idea is interesting. But I am not usually a fan. I love creative assembly and appreciate their hardwork on every game they have ever made. Because they do things no one else is willing to try.These games are more rewarding if you are willing to be patient. But I will probably spend between 10 - 20 dollars on the game if it continues to pique my interest.Don't turn away from the game based on the haters. Give it a try, and actually give it some time. If its not your thing then remember that ITS FREEEEEEEE.Thanks for reading, and hope you found this useful. Have a good day! "

												To behonest I only played the game for an hour, and I have read reviews and I know there is much better games, heck better total war games but its a free to play and most, if not all free to play games are, you guessed it! pay to win. but I just think of this game as... a 3rd party total war game had a child with clash of clans, boom beach, etc, but it should not feel like a 3rd party, the only element this game brings back from the actual total war is the battles and even that is bad.  But what were people expecting at the beginning there were 8 people and after, well i dont know how long, could not be bothered to find out theres 20?

												Resource cooldown is too slow compared to building costs. Also given the fact that you don't get new resources if you don't collect the acquired ones, I am not sure if they expect me to leave my computer on with this game running 24/7, and invest all my life into collecting resources from this game.  Probably they don't. What they expect is, later on when you can acquire gold with real money, that I pay hundereds of dollars to a game which actually only costs at most 50 dollars.  Just allows us to buy the game with money and play it in peace. Man I hate this kind of ""if you don't pay us gold continually, this game will be unbearably slow"" games.			"

												So much hate on this game - I feel its misplaced.OK - this is not a standard Total War PC game.  It is a mobile FTP kingdom building game with appointment mechanics.  Yes there are 8 hr cooldowns, but you're not supposed to sit and watch the cooldown.  You can use gold or you can come back later.  Its designed for short 5-10 min play sessions.  Obv this doesn't sit well on PC as its not what we're used to.  You can spend money to skip grind, but you don't gain utility value from spending so its not pay-to-win.  However if you spend as much as you'd be prepared to on a standard PC game, you will probably be able to compete with higher ranks, but only if you spend strategically.  I've played 9 hrs (FOR FREE) - it's got some interesting base building strategy, like balancing expansion with managing water levels.  You do have to wait to re-heal troops between fights which can mean you only have 1 fight per session, but if you overwhelm opposition you can get away with zero casualties and thus fight again straightaway.   Battles are more like a puzzle game than a traditional Total War fight, but still retains elements of setting up your formation to outwit opponent and making strategic moves mid game to counter act opponent's moves.Biggest failing is that the game doesn't pit you against real opponents soon enough.  After 9 hrs I still haven't fought a real person - I assume this is coming!?!?			"

This is a review for Kingdoms, so I digress.Total War Battles: KINGDOM does not appear to be anything more than Creative Assembly's attempt at Game of War, or Clash of Clans (although this could viewed as an insult to these games). While their attempt is noble, these types of games are exclusive to mobile devices for a reason; I could play a much more fleshed out strategy game on my PC. If I want to play a game with busy work, it will be on my phone when I am waiting in between classes.Creative Assembly revolutionized real time/turn based strategy gaming with the Total War franchise. My advice would be to stick to your niche and let the iOS devs stay in theirs.			"

												Well I do not do reviews often because I do not wish to come off wrong nor be trolled. But this game has made me wish to try.First this to me isn't even worth being on PC. It is pretty much an app game or facebook game. I have played for a bit and grew bored of the similarities to app games harvest times and crap. Also fighting battles on normal and having lord units destroy me over and over and the tiny amounts of exp battles give is useless, granted if you wish to spend real money you can instantly get better units just like in an app/FB game... I wish this game was more like other total war games or even like shogun total war but with knights and your hero could fight in the battle...but alas your leader is a useless image and that's it.  I am not impressed with pay to win games. If i spend money on a game i expect to get cool dlc, new units (that do not break the game or whatever), or cool looking appearances for characters not the ability to instantly buy high tier troops, buildings, cancel out timers or whatever. I would not... No Can not recommend this game to people. If this is your thing fine but its a waste of time when there are so many great free to play games out there. Sorry if you like this game that's fine, this is just how I myself feel.			"

												Please fix some of the terrain problems on the map. ive tried four times to build a dam so that i can have land to expand and build my second castle, how do i progress when every building, forest, farm and quarry gets flooded or destroyed? ive built multiple dams and tried to fill them in, ive tried to raise the terrain untill it became so deformed i cant build anything onto of the fact i cant build anything at all anyway! please fix these issues and make some of the battles like the original total war games.Thank you			"

I didn't even know what i was playing i was just messing around and ended up being on an online game....kudos to me for reading - haha - any help would be great. Otherwise the game is fantastic, good graphics, and a really cool story line if you like that kind of stuff (which i do).Thanks in advance,Dweaver110			"

												Look, I know this is getting a lot of hate, but remember; This is not made by the Total War teame who made the games we love, this is by the Total War Battles team, who have only made one game before. And this game is supposed to be realesed on mobiles and Ipads, its ment to contest with games like clash of clans, not pc games! I was a beta tester, and it was boring some ways, but this game is ment to be one you play for maybe 20 minutes each day, not like a normal total war where you constantly play! Overall for a pc game its crap, but then again its for mobiles, so in that perspective its not the worst I have seen. I do not recommend to play this all the time, but instead once a day! If you take it casual and slow, without constantly getting back to the game, it can be quite enjoyable indeed. But for  pc game in steam, this sucks			"

												This is a very good empier building game with basic battle mechanics that anyone can master.This game is still fairly new so I'll make this short and simple:Pros:-Fun building and collecting resourses / water manegment.-Simple battle mechanics, you get 9 units each with 10-30 soliders-low system requirments unlike other TW games cons:-Limited multiplayer, only duels (pvp) while some consider is pay 2 win-No chat or alliances like other empire building games-Archers can be really over powerd-Other than playing missions stone is a pain to gatherOver all I would currently rate this game 3.75/5Defeintly check it out :)			"

												A lot of fun. Really wish there was a detailed tutoiral somewhere. I messed up my initial position because I did not quite get the synergy effects from nearby buildings.  Also caused a lot of accidental floods, etc. but it's still a whole lot of fun.  Played for 12 hours without buying any gold from market. Obviously that's the way to get the best out of your troops via gear. but made it to level 20 lord with no problems other than building and terrain mistakes.   And some tactics errors in battles. but it is a very fun medieval sim.I like that the classic problems of resource management are factors.  flooding, lack of funds, deforestation, really enjpying the challenges, and watching and managing the little towns that are built.I think it is the right mix between tactics and a little bit of strategy, plus kingdom management.  And the battles have the right level of command from the rear feel. A few simple commands, give your tropps the right formations, and trust to equipment and luck.Even if the troops lose battles, they learn and get better.  And armies can fight on without getting wiped out completely,  lessons learned, go at it again, with better tactics.Learning the battles and warfare as I go is a nice progression, building skills, makes it a semi RP game at a very low level.   And the graphics are really good and have a lot of flavor.  But not too intensive.  Playing from dialup on an old laptop, it's not a problem, unlike many other games on steam.Great job, developers.

												Total War Battles: Kingdom. Expand, command armies, alter the land. Basically this game is free and i will differ from those who say this is a p2w title, this is a very time dependant game in which you grow over time, and constant care of your kingdom. This means that if you don't have the patience to wait and collect resources over time is totally up to the customer to buy ""gold"" to hasten the process. So, apart from that, this is a good game, created and aimed to  a market very different from the famous TW games.			"

												This game is horrible.  The pace is slow, resources are limited (unless you pay), there is limited tactical flexibility, and the battles results are quite unrealistic.  It is just not fun to play compared to the stand-alone games in the Total War series.The Good: - Graphics and music are not bad.- It does actually work on iPad and Windows laptop.The Bad: - The server is often unavailable and you cannot complete combat missions.- Server repeatedly disconnected me during duels resulting in an immediate loss.- The battle mechanics are simple and unbalanced.  There is no tactical flexibility.- Battles are boring after the first few.- Terrain and weather have no impact on battles.- Even if the enemy is down to a handful of troops and you have overwhelming numbers, you will still lose if the server disconnects.- There is a limited technology tree.  Unit advancement is very slow.- The water flooding issue in spring was just plain annoying.The Ugly:- The game basically requires you to stay logged in all the time.  If you only log in once per day, your resources cap after about 1 hour and there is not much to do after about 10 minutes of game play.  After several weeks, I have made limited progress – two castles and a few units.- The game also strongly encourages (really requires) you to duel; and every time, I have been pitted against a total mismatch – someone whose level is far above mine.- Unit match-up results make no sense when fighting the AI.  Cavalry charge crossbowmen or archers…and somehow are all killed in the melee and not with missile weapons.  That seriously makes no sense.Total War Battles: SHOGUN was essentially a series of puzzles, solved through creative use of various units.  KINGDOMS is just an attempt to get you to pay for fleeting power-ups and resources on a recurring basis.  I recommend that you stick with the previous installments of Total War: Medieval, Shogun 2, or Empire specifically. "

I get that the pay to win games are the new thing but it has to at lesat be good and or remotely fun. City building and resources are completly unforgiving without mercy. Thats probably the biggest killer. and theres no way to restart the game! So if youre new and never played before and make a simple mistake ..... like release a dam on your whole city... youve permanently screwed yourself. Besides that just about every other aspect of the game sucks just and bad and equaly unforgiving. Sorry Total War kinda droped the ball on this one and might have lost a little respect for ya			"

												This game, can be fun when you want to sit back and kill time. But it get's pretty frustrating. You are given limited troops that are ""Free"". After which you either save up Gold bars to buy more special units, or you have to get a lot of resources to create them in your blacksmith.Or you pay money to buy them.This is a huge issue, due to the cause that the computer will have tons of special units at the ready, at which point they have the upper hand over you.This game is Free, more more like ""Free"" you can play without paying, but to progress far it will be super difficult. The devs should have given you more special units for free before making it ""Free"" you only get 1 special Knight and Calvary before you have to pay to get even better ones.This is sad, because I enjoy the Total War games, but this is starting to really frustrate me, that you can't make a fair advantage game play with your ""Free"" games.

												While it seems like an interesting concept, the game is frustrating as hell, mostly because of the policy. Seriously, are you guys so money starved that you go on and ask for premium currency for freaking flag patterns? I understand speed ups, I understand micro transactions like cool looking vanity items, but in a strategy game of one of the most well-known franchises, you go on and charge for the ""amazing privilege"" of making your coat of arms navy blue or stripped? Even the emblems are for sale only, save 3-4 of the most simplistic. And honestly even the artwork of the emblems seems sloppy and doesn't even have enough variety. Simply ridiculous and annoying.Also, the game could not be more pay to win. And I know that there will be the crowd saying that ""no you can very well create and gather all the items that you can buy with gold"". While that might be true, it is only half true though. Because the amount of grinding and waiting required to achieve something someone who feels like emptying his pockets for Sega can achieve with a click, is comical. Crafting a single item/unit takes 2.5 days in the very best case and requires a ton of resources, especially early game. And while you struggle to get your barings, you go to a duel and have a same level player pound you with artillery and flaming arrows just because he appeased the coin hungry spirits of Sega with a couple of hard earned clicks.And the final touch is the silly terraforming that is both frustrating and before getting the gang of it can just flood your entire map. Just one step closer to creating Total War: Farmville... battle the toughest vegetables and conquer your garden!The game could be fun, some ideas are good. The implementation is really bad though, and the company policy, even worse.			"

												This game, can be fun when you want to sit back and kill time. But it get's pretty frustrating. You are given limited troops that are ""Free"". After which you either save up Gold bars to buy more special units, or you have to get a lot of resources to create them in your blacksmith.Or you pay money to buy them.This is a huge issue, due to the cause that the computer will have tons of special units at the ready, at which point they have the upper hand over you.This game is Free, more more like ""Free"" you can play without paying, but to progress far it will be super difficult. The devs should have given you more special units for free before making it ""Free"" you only get 1 special Knight and Calvary before you have to pay to get even better ones.This is sad, because I enjoy the Total War games, but this is starting to really frustrate me, that you can't make a fair advantage game play with your ""Free"" games.

I for example play this on my mobile and knowing I can play this on computer is even better making me able to manage it a lot better.For a mobile game it is one of the best out there! The detail and gameplay are by far some of the best.Yes, for a pc game it is ♥♥♥♥♥♥. But for a secondary platform for a mobile game that can be linked to a mobile save game it is a great little extra!			"

												This game is simply the best medieval combat/kingdom simulator on mobile ever conceived; the fact that it's cross-platform is just icing on the cake. Those looking for a complete Total War experience are largely missing the point. KINGDOM takes the legacy of previous games (large-scale unit battles, resource management) and iterates upon them to make something entirely new. The result is a casual, portable and supremely fun game that you can play in short bursts from anywhere.			"

												Although 0.0 hours are shown on the last 2 weeks of my profile listed here, I've played this game on my iPhone everyday, several times a day, for about a month.  The i5 processor on the laptop (I'm using to type this review with) does not work as well. Too much lag.  But my phone plays this game very nicely (iPhone 6plus).  However, the play time does not appear to transfer over.  This game is, as other players have already noted, is geared more towards a phone or tablet. It's terrific for down time away from home.  It is a free download. However, the money this game generates for the company is by selling ""gold"" which can be used to advance your position rapidly. That's ok with me.  I like to work slowly and later decide to make a purchase with these type games.  Because I loved the Total war games that were published, I wanted to give this game a try.  First thing I noticed was the lack of instructions and no user manual that I could find. So starting off was mostly trial and error.  That was a little irksome, but I continued because I was still enjoying the experience.  I did find a forum on line that gave suggestions for play based on the authors' experience.  I used them to improve my game.  So, here's my first complaint about this game (1) Why the secrecy on play.  There may be players out there that like the challenge of exploring the unknown, but I find it tedious making the same mistake over and over again, not really knowing what I'm doing. The instructions offered are pitifully brief. I would have found it more interesting having a basic manual that showed what did what.  Like the classic PC games did.  The strategy can still be left up to me, but at least I wouldn't be fumbling around. I am sure there are players who do enjoy that approach.  I don't.Now, in spite of the initial trial and error period, I still found this game very interesting and started following the advice of the online forums.  As I said, I found myself playing this game every day, several times a day.  I was enjoying the process of slowly building my Kingdom.  This leads up to my final complaint: (2)  So, as I said, I'm slowly building up my Kingdom with farms, roads, castles, houses, blacksmiths, etc, and just got to the point of having 4 towns in 4 regions.  This was a long time in the making.  Then, I log in after an update today and find 2 of those towns completely destroyed.  No explanation.  Instead, there were 2 large large patches of icons, each indicating 'ruins' where the building once stood.  This, in short,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.  No aspect of the game gave me a hint of this coming.  OK, again, maybe there are those who take this in stride and take up the challenge, but I personally play games on my iPhone for immediate comfort and gratification. There may be others out there, like me, who are not looking for unexpected massive tragedies, and very challenging play.  I just want to expand my own Kingdom at my own pace.  It would be nice if the publishers of these games would provide options to cover varying degrees of game difficulty for different target markets.That being said, I wish there was a choice for the above recommendation beyond ""YES"" ""NO"" if I recommend this game.  I would definitely recommend this game for those serious players who enjoy the challenges this game offers.  I wouldn't  for the vanilla players like me.  It's a shame.  I was really starting to enjoy this game.  I'm curious about the statistics of the purchases made by this game's players (of ""gold"").  If there is any correlation to time span played vs purchases.  I can say that I've lost my interest in continuing under these circumstances. By the way, the graphics are incredible. "

												I absolutely love everything but one element about this game and I'm very sad that it's the old pay to win problem. It really isn't necessary, there are many business models that allow paying but not paying to win. The game is still in beta so there is still a chance for redemption and I believe this really would stand out among the other games of the same format due to its graphics, simplicity, unique features and style. Please please please remove the pay to win element and the fans will come flocking and you'll make more money that way (I hope).Update: I may have been a little hasty in saying it is pay to win as you can craft all items bought for gold.... It just takes a hell of a long time. But that's fine, it gives patient people the same options as impatient or time poor people to play the game to and these people are needed to keep the game going.... If no one spends money there is no game for anyone. One more thing. The game is still in beta so give it a chance. I have a feeling this will be something great. Overall...... I love this awesome game!			"

												The game is cool in offline battles and everything else but the online battles are♥♥♥♥♥♥because every time I do one I get disconnected but my army somehow is completly destroyed its freaking stupid having to have my army get destroyed by another player I cant even fight against and alot of the watchtowers make you have to rank up in dueling rank to get their land or you can get 2000 everything and buy their land its just stupid. AND your can almost only become good at the game if you buy stuff with GOLD! You can even have the resources produce faster for GOLD! And to players who do not pay for stuff get rekt by the players who buy stuff for GOLD! And since the resource production times take so long many people arent on the game because they're WAITING! HOURS! and HOURS! so their resources can produce. And the battles arent even cool they arent like Total War: Shogun or Total War: Attila its hard to tell who's winning untill the fights over and this game really seems like it has the potential to really be something but in its current state its just not fun and even the level of detail put into your kingdom is bad I mean the kingdoms are COMPLETELY deserted theres no citizens walking around no soldiers theres just no life to it the only things I see that ARENT building grass trees water etc are ANIMALS!.....ANIMALS! the only living thing there I mean theres also boats but still the game really is in a state of Alpha it really just needs serious changes that improve gameplay I mean yeah they have made a few improving changes. And sadly based on this games current state I gotta thumbs down.			"

												Spending a bit more than eight hours on this might have been a serious mistake. At first, when I enlisted on participating in the beta, I was hoping that this might be a nice game (knowing the praise that the franchise gets from all it's fans) although I had played very little from other Total War games. After starting up the game and playing around with the options, I entered the tutorial. As previous reviewers have mentioned, there you are taught how to spend as much money as possible, to be only able to skip the ridiculous and tedious amounts of time you have to wait for the construction and completion of simple tasks. So, after I thought about it, I figured out why they decided to implement this peculiar feature: the game was designed for a mobile phone. The weird and unrealistic battle mechanics, the seemingly endless building time and the interface itself just shouted it out. But then came the simple question: Why did they release this for the PC? At least if they had it just for mobile devices, maybe they would have had the understanding of the community. Although this game is an abomination, I think that the developers will redeem themselves and put this setback aside, continuing to release good and ambitious titles, worthy of our money and respect.

												A lot of fun. Really wish there was a detailed tutoiral somewhere. I messed up my initial position because I did not quite get the synergy effects from nearby buildings.  Also caused a lot of accidental floods, etc. but it's still a whole lot of fun.  Played for 12 hours without buying any gold from market. Obviously that's the way to get the best out of your troops via gear. but made it to level 20 lord with no problems other than building and terrain mistakes.   And some tactics errors in battles. but it is a very fun medieval sim.I like that the classic problems of resource management are factors.  flooding, lack of funds, deforestation, really enjpying the challenges, and watching and managing the little towns that are built.I think it is the right mix between tactics and a little bit of strategy, plus kingdom management.  And the battles have the right level of command from the rear feel. A few simple commands, give your tropps the right formations, and trust to equipment and luck.Even if the troops lose battles, they learn and get better.  And armies can fight on without getting wiped out completely,  lessons learned, go at it again, with better tactics.Learning the battles and warfare as I go is a nice progression, building skills, makes it a semi RP game at a very low level.   And the graphics are really good and have a lot of flavor.  But not too intensive.  Playing from dialup on an old laptop, it's not a problem, unlike many other games on steam.Great job, developers.

												TLDR:Long waits between actions - spend gold to avoid.Simple, but fun, combat - made un-even by buffs bought with gold before each battle.The units you buy are limited - use (lots of) gold to buy better/more advanced ones.Don't want to do that? Spend vast amounts time/resources instead. Use (some) gold to make it faster. (Oh, you might fail in crafting them, too.)AI frequently uses higher leveled, advanced, units.Competative Multiplayer has all of these problems, made worse by wonky net-code.A fun, casual, strategy-lite game. Or, it would be, were it not spoiled by a steep powercreep in the combat minigame.  If it were just a game designed to be tough, that would be one thing.  Unfortuantely, giving attacking AI with full exp, top tier units and then calling that ""challenging"" (the term they use for medium difficulty) in the mid-game reveals a cynical attempt to push the player to spend gold (money) to even the field.It doesn't get much better in the 'campaign' section, where you are hampered by long waits for just about every action.Don't be fooled by the intial gameplay; the initially speedy pace slows dramticaly as the tutorials end.  Incidentaly, during the tutorial they give you some gold - which you then have to (as in, the game tells you to and does not progress if you don't) spend that gold to get around the long waits, establishing that this is 'normal' gamplay.Now, this might not be a problem in and of itself - you can just dip in and out, gather your rescources, play a battle or two - log off for an hour or two and then return.  However, this is a more expertly designed freemium game than that.You soon realise that the AI is using the units you don't have access to, generaly further leveled up than your own too.If you want those units, you either have to spend significant amounts of gold up-front or spend lots of time gathering stuff for crafting.  Then, wait a long time for the crafting to happen. Then, do it 5 more times for each item. If you decide that you can wait it out, gather your resources and use them to make a better army, you are attacked by AI periodicly.  If you fail to beat them or pay them off, they take a percentage of your resources when they leave.I'd give this a miss, folks.  Save the money you'd spend on gold - spend it on a game that has been designed and balenced to be entertaining.This is designed to extract the your gold - I mean cash - from you.			"

												It's simple but fairly enjoyable. Do not expect Total War from this game but there are elements to it. It would be better if you could play as the other factions: the Norse or the Picts to offer some variety. It's simply a mediocre game. For the genre it's pretty decent however. If you're into this genre I'd recommend it.			"

I found it difficult to advance without paying, mostly because of the level of AI encounters once it starts invading your territory, PvP que was horrible, but so far it seems playable.

Also the rock paper scissors fighting style makes it not too hard to pick up. The strategy and use of skills and even charge techniques makes it not just another sit-back-and-watch battle game; you are involved in the action of the battle and can even zoom in close to the conflict.

												While it seems like an interesting concept, the game is frustrating as hell, mostly because of the policy. Seriously, are you guys so money starved that you go on and ask for premium currency for freaking flag patterns? I understand speed ups, I understand micro transactions like cool looking vanity items, but in a strategy game of one of the most well-known franchises, you go on and charge for the ""amazing privilege"" of making your coat of arms navy blue or stripped? Even the emblems are for sale only, save 3-4 of the most simplistic. And honestly even the artwork of the emblems seems sloppy and doesn't even have enough variety. Simply ridiculous and annoying.Also, the game could not be more pay to win. And I know that there will be the crowd saying that ""no you can very well create and gather all the items that you can buy with gold"". While that might be true, it is only half true though. Because the amount of grinding and waiting required to achieve something someone who feels like emptying his pockets for Sega can achieve with a click, is comical. Crafting a single item/unit takes 2.5 days in the very best case and requires a ton of resources, especially early game. And while you struggle to get your barings, you go to a duel and have a same level player pound you with artillery and flaming arrows just because he appeased the coin hungry spirits of Sega with a couple of hard earned clicks.And the final touch is the silly terraforming that is both frustrating and before getting the gang of it can just flood your entire map. Just one step closer to creating Total War: Farmville... battle the toughest vegetables and conquer your garden!The game could be fun, some ideas are good. The implementation is really bad though, and the company policy, even worse.			"

												The game is still in development. All the right Tactical game play elements are here, It just depends on where they go with it that will make it or break it. I believe if they can bring out the multiplayer aspect of it and allow for more customizations and take out the limits on how many of each unit you can have and fix the harvesting of resources because it tends to take a bit too long, it could be a true gem. Bringing army building, city development tile style, based in a classical castle building era makes for a nice break in life.  SEGA and Creative Labs keep developing it and for now expand the territory, army size and make it easier to edit tyles. God Speed.			"

I get the desire to make it so it is way easier if you pay your way but unless you live, breathe, eat and screw this game you will never be able to collect resources at anything but slower than a snail's pace.  Combat is another joke, a sad, sad joke.  The best units cost gold.  The crafting system takes forever because of said resource collection.  Your units are under armed and overwhelmed against the AI and other players that pay their way to win.I thought, hey, its a game from my favorite developer, it should be fair and balanced and fun to play.

Looked like a great game on steam and had pretty good review and so I downloaded it, As I got further and further into the game I reaised how similar it was to Age of empires which is also a great game, the point of the game is to build up your town/village and take over the world. Its also simliar to Mount & Blade war band which is another great game that I love where the fight scenes take place and how you control the battle as well as who you can have in your army, you have full control! Overall great game and I highly recomend it if you like strategic and war games! as well as Mid evil times. I rate this game a 9/10 a 9 for how great the game is but it would be better if you could tweak it and make it so your lord can go to battle as well!			"

												The only reason I am recommending this game is because it is in beta right now and, despite the problems, it has potential. What problems? Crashing isn't really a problem, because when it does happen you lose nothing and it is very easy to get right back into the game because it is constantly running your scenario somewhere up there in the cloud.-Gold is a problem, not a solution. I have no idea how to get it. It is far easier to spend than get, so don't spend it, but then what is the point in having it.-Resources, in general, are a problem. Everything gets gathered so slowly you can't do anything without spending gold, which, when you do, you run out quickly and then can't do anything because you can't get gold. Either increase the yeild of basic level resource gathering facilities (because it costs way too much to upgrade them) or reduce the time it takes to gather the resources themselves. When you do have renewable resources like cattle and sheep, you can skin them for hides or sell them for 'honour,' but they don't let you keep a couple of them in order to keep the herd alive. Nope, they cut them all up and then you have to buy more cattle with the swiftly dwindling resources you no longer have.-Getting good units is a problem, because whenever you have a single type of unit of quality, like longsword knights, you can't make anymore. You can make other knights, but they cost gold and you can't get gold so you shouldn't spend it. You could craft units, but that takes a ridiculous amount of silver and hides, and as previously noted, resources like silver and hides take absolutely forever to gather in.-I have found that when you harvest something the results of the harvest can change dramatically. I have harvested all my wheat fields at once, but somehow get less per field than if I had done it one at a time. Ostensibly, the reason is that you don't have enough workers to get the full yield out of the wheat fields if harvested all at once. Then why did I sow all the wheat fields at once? And if we are going for reality, why don't we harvest wheat in the autumn and increase the yield to cover the year?-I have gathered wood from deadwood piled up on shore in odd places. The store of the deadwood when you click on it says 100. When you gather the wood though, you get 50 and the deadwood disappears. -Fishing takes longer than harvesting wheat. And fishing should replenish itself if you spread out and slow down your efforts. It does not, however, replenish itself.-Battles can be quite maddening. The good news is you never completely lose a unit unless you delete its training facility  or disband it. Mission difficulty seems to increase with your rank, but your troops don't really keep up because it costs so freaking much of the resources you can't gather fast enough or gold which you don't get just to upgrade training facilities in order to upgrade the unit, which has experience points from battling you can't use unless you do upgrade the training facility. So, as you continue along, you start to lose a lot of battles because your troops just can't keep pace. I'm losing about half now.-the Total War folks do put out codes to redeem in the game for free resources, which points out they are aware of how ridiculous it is to grow/gather your own stuff, but they seem to think that giving them out as 'single-use' codes is a good idea, so that only one person can use the code and then it is no good for whoever else is next. There are millions of gamers out there and I'm not tuned in to Facebook at all hours of the day, so I have given up on getting a code. Ever.That's a lot of complaining, but I do like the game. The persistent timeline is cool, I don't have to be playing for everyone to keep on working. All this having been said they have a lot of good stuff going on in the game and I am eager to see it developed further in its gameplay and in ways to play, like tablets. This is definitely better than the Total War Battles: Shogun.			"

												This is a good game with lots of content.  You get to build your own medieval kingdom a bit like clash of clans and the wating time isn't that bad either.  This game is still only in beta and they ware still working on it already this is one of my favourite games and is fairly new with new things surely to be added.  Summary- it is a fairly new game in beta stage and is already very enjoyable if you have work you only have to go on for a few seconds a day to keep your village/ kingdom good.  The good thing is it is only going to get better, barely any crashes and is a neat game if you like medieval games.			"

												Like: Beautiful art and design (Awesome job)Dislike:        •	Use of methods to nickel and dime your account, such as;           o	Takes only 3 or 4 min to prospect a mine but 8 hours (or 5 gold) to remove the digging equipment when it conveniently pops up in a location that would cause you to spend more real money if you wanted to transform all around the dig sight…. This as opposed to starting from camp and exploring in the immediate area then moving outward: but that would not prompt you to spend as much.           o	A.I. matching for duels makes it frustrating to the point either you spend a lot of money to equip or you quit playing all together. The people you duel against are generally over powered in relation to you if you are trying to play free as advertised.                  	If you have patients and are able to place, your second castle in the lower right so you can place a third in the upper middle, in a few months you might be able to make some gains.        •	In about six months to a year, you may be able to craft something. There are many other examples but that should suffice to make a point.       In short, I want to love this game but the matchups for duels are not even close to being balanced and the time or money it takes to get things done makes you want to just pay the forty dollars to buy one of the Total War titles (Rome etc.) and save yourself what could realistically amount to hundreds of dollars in just a few months.

												It's... It's just not good.I hate saying that, too. But it takes forever, you have to honestly pay to win, it does weird things with water suddenly just flooding everything all the time, and you're stuck with basic stuff and waiting and wasting time unless you have gold. Which is with real money or by waiting a long time.It's earnestly a pity.			"

												If this wasnt a P2W game i would love it.  The economy moves way too slow unless your willing to click complete for gold option.  Having to wait 6h in real time for a new worker is just insane.  I love the mix of empire building and fighting.  The only other real thing that drives me nuts is the flooding which may be something i am not doing right but when the source of the flooding is out of your fog of war its hard to fix.  I know this is beta but unless your willing to feed this like an old coin op game this isnt your game.			"

												If you're a hardcore Total War fan avoid! The lack of battle field control makes it a formulaic scissors, rock, paper - no room for ambushes or clever flanking moves. It seems to be designed for 10 year olds with a smartphone and dad's credit card details. Very disapointed, got bored DURING the tutorial, that's always a bad sign. There are a million resource based strategy games, most try to have some kind of fun element or do things a little differently - if this one does I didn't see it. But to be honest I didn't finish the tutorial.Can't wait to get my hands on 'Attilla', a game for grown ups and real men that demand to be tested; until then I'll carry on trying to win 'Empire' as The Ottoman Empire (yes, I know it's nearly impossible, but dreamers can dream, can't they?)

												I know my review is probably gonna be lost among the other 998 reviews before it and I have read a couple of them. I am gonna be honest here: Yes, it is a waiting game. This is a game designed around patience and strategy. Patience for the building and collecting of resources and strategy for the battles with your army. I have seen alot of people say in the other reviews that they have uninstalled the game SIMPLY because you can pay real cash for gold which instantly finishes any action you need to wait for. Yea the game gives you gold for free but it isn't much, and you know what? I never use any of it. I like the wait of collecting my farm or felling trees. Wanna know why? Because in real life this♥♥♥♥♥♥takes time to do and I think the game devs wanted to put some of that time into the game. How I deal with the wait times is log in, set everything up that I want done [Harvest farm, harvest trees, harvest rocks, build new buildings] and then close the game. You don't need to be logged in for the wait time to be in effect! You can set♥♥♥♥♥♥up, close the game and play something else, then later come back and BAM it is ready for you. This is a fun game for when I have nothing else to do and am looking for some kingdom building.			"

												This game offers a two mode game similar to Campaign and Battle in Total war, but remade as ""mini-town building"" and ""mini-tactical battles"". Think a slow moving yet somewhat compact version of a Total War with other feature in mind. I find myself doing more landscaping and ""town planning"" by hex buildings -  This aspect is quite new but interesting because it gives something to explore for new players who come sign-up (although from this point, maybe people decide whether the game is their style or really hate how it does not feel like Total War).For battles, don't expect to see huge army stacks in epic battle. But quick skirmish with smaller ""army groups"" but with upgradeable and persistent soldier units. If you like a bit of RPG-element of improving stats and selecting which one to focus (although, there are not too many to worry about).If you dislike the trend of ""freemium"" games nowadays by any type and aspect, please beware of the ""time limiter"" of progress of both the town building and unit management for battles (the replinishment). While gold can still be acquired in game, it is not plenty and if you are not the waiting type, you may have to choose between paying real-life money to speed things up.So, adjust your expectation, think more like a ""small-town army"" manager game - with ""mobile-style freemium"" limits to action. If you can do this, then Total War Battles: Kingdom is a quick-fix game you can have on computer and take with you if you so feel attached to your hex town and warbands of upgradable units. It can still be likeable depending on your initial expectation.			"

												This game is horrible.  The pace is slow, resources are limited (unless you pay), there is limited tactical flexibility, and the battles results are quite unrealistic.  It is just not fun to play compared to the stand-alone games in the Total War series.The Good: - Graphics and music are not bad.- It does actually work on iPad and Windows laptop.The Bad: - The server is often unavailable and you cannot complete combat missions.- Server repeatedly disconnected me during duels resulting in an immediate loss.- The battle mechanics are simple and unbalanced.  There is no tactical flexibility.- Battles are boring after the first few.- Terrain and weather have no impact on battles.- Even if the enemy is down to a handful of troops and you have overwhelming numbers, you will still lose if the server disconnects.- There is a limited technology tree.  Unit advancement is very slow.- The water flooding issue in spring was just plain annoying.The Ugly:- The game basically requires you to stay logged in all the time.  If you only log in once per day, your resources cap after about 1 hour and there is not much to do after about 10 minutes of game play.  After several weeks, I have made limited progress – two castles and a few units.- The game also strongly encourages (really requires) you to duel; and every time, I have been pitted against a total mismatch – someone whose level is far above mine.- Unit match-up results make no sense when fighting the AI.  Cavalry charge crossbowmen or archers…and somehow are all killed in the melee and not with missile weapons.  That seriously makes no sense.Total War Battles: SHOGUN was essentially a series of puzzles, solved through creative use of various units.  KINGDOMS is just an attempt to get you to pay for fleeting power-ups and resources on a recurring basis.  I recommend that you stick with the previous installments of Total War: Medieval, Shogun 2, or Empire specifically. "

												It's a great game and the fact that it's free is even better. It's a sad fact that my IPad is outdated and cannot have this game, but that's a personal problem. Let's get to the major good points and bad ones. The graphics are great, as is the gameplay. It's different from the other Total War games from the franchise, which gives it that one little slice of fun that the other games do not have. It's basically the little better version of Medieval II: Total War. There isn't much bad to be said about this game, it's free, has great graphics and the gameplay is just fine.			"

												I've gotten to a point where it's just a castle builder sim.  You only get limited unique troops.  Ranged combat is manual as well as timer delay when commanding multi troops.  Computer is typical ""controls / react instantly"" which detours most TBS games.  Eventually you get pitted against Tier 3 mobs, which make it nearly impossible as it takes literally several days to upgrade 1 troop gear stat when crafting, and the xp is very low to increase troop levels / tiers.Controls are a bit awkward.  Having to click so many times for resources is painful.  Click building .. click harvest 1 or 2 sources .. wait 5 mins .. only speed up is a hold click on building w/ auto collect but none the less painful slow collection.  There isn't enough to do to keep you playing more than 10 mins at a time, even then its usually waiting for a 2nd resource to complete.I typically to ""harvest all"" which greatly reduces your output and takes 1 hour.  But is much less of a hassle.			"
