												It is well... Its different but you will get bored after few hours of gameplay.Good concept i like post-apocalyptic games but when you play it you will feel like it has been finished in rush.There are features like limited ammo for every soldier so you have to keep your soldiers suplied then you need oil for your vehicles to funtion and oil can be gathered from limited sources which are located in strategic positions.Campaign is short and boring you will find most of them are repetetive go to place one , kill everyone, defend against counterattack etc. Skirmish plays as in most of the RTS game you start with basic structures gather resources , attack/defend and also u can control special structures like crashed plane which can be occupied by your soldiers this gives you some advantage over your enemy since when you control special structures you unlock some of the vehicles or upgrades etc.Your HQ is basicly used to gather survivors this is similar to the ""Battle Realms"" system you cant ""build"" your settler he have to find your hq and join with your group so you can assaign him for a specified job.###In General i wouldnt recomend this game.It gots some fancy features but it still plays like any outdated RTS.It's one of this games that you dont want to play again after a short break from playing.If the price goes down you can have a try but you may be dissapointed if you will buy it at its full price.Overal Score:3/10			"

												Game with alot of potential however it is sadly very badly executed, gameplay is stiff and boring and the game isn't really interesting.The campaign is a DLC.It just feels like the devs should've put more time into the game and the core aspects of it.-1/10 (Only buy it if you're desperate to kill time or if you're in need of knowing what a bad game looks like.)

												Wouldn't recommend this. Great concept - poorly executed.Multiplayer is dead/unsupported and requires some file configuration to get working.

												I found this to be a rather poor strategy game. It's a typical strategy game, with the basic controls every game of the genre has; but what dissapointed me is that it has several bugs, for example, when changing scenarios, the game restarts completely. Another problem I found is that, in my opinion, it's a bit unbalanced, even in the tutorial scenarios, something that doesn't leave a good impression in newcomers; after all, a tutorial should be designed to teach how to play the game in a user-friendly way.

												This game is by far one of the worst uses of disposable income. Apox is an unsightly and poorly developed game and here are the reasons why. First and most importantly the programming is horrible, no game should ever be released with this level of neglect obvious in it. I often thought to myself that this game could have used much more love from it's developers that it received.The pathing is bizarre, the units behave oddly (sometimes do what they are told), the ""economy"" side of things is a waste of time, and anything involving single player missions is a waste of time and effort considering that most of the time the game will either crash due to a programming error or some trigger failing to initialize.Story wise this game feels like a concept that was thought up by a bored person who already had the game's assets made. I often felt that this could have been a loveable cult game if it had a good plot but your honestly better off playing a side scroller or flash game compared to this.Overall this game was a headache to try and actually play, if your a fan of good rts games like myself dont add this to your wishlist because you will be unhappy with it.

												Apox is a rts set in a post apocalyptic wasteland. Unlike other rts games, Apox has its own twist on unit production, resource gathering and micromanagement. You don't get hordes of units to rush and swarm, instead you have to be smarter about your units. Unlike some games, resource management is very simple. The key to victory is holding and defending the important resource sites. There is a learning curve to the game, maybe about 30min of playtime. Once you figure out the basics, play the tutorials, you will be well on your way to some Co-op and player vs player action. That is where the game shines the most, in its mp. Team work is a must for this game, and rounds can be intense. Games generally last for about 20 minutes+ depending on the player count, which by the way, boasts up to 32 players at once! Locking in with over a 100 maps, this game offers a lot. For less then 15 dollars you are getting one of this years more interesting rts games and supporting a great developer.###update###The online is dead, and support is now nil. Pick up are your own risk.			"

												(Reviewed on January 25, 2011. No, I'm not going to update this review, I can still tell it's♥♥♥♥♥♥from here.)If you've seen Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome: This game is like that, Well meaning but falls flat on it's face. Oh, and Tina Turner's severed head will occasionally manifest itself in the executable and sing to you randomly.If you've haven't seen Beyond Thunderdome: It's a half-baked, unfinished mess that forces you to connect to a server to play singleplayer, so it counts as two forms of DRM. Flamethrowers ♥♥♥♥ing rule all. The touted FPS/RTS hype mechanic is merely an excuse to excuse the micromanaging the game forces you to do. The interface ♥♥♥♥ing sucks.  Battles take longer than usual, and so you're forced to wait for soldiers to finish killing each other. The music is ♥♥♥♥ING IRRITATING. The tutorial strikes a nice balance between a condescending lecture and not giving you a complete picture of what you can do. And you have to sit there and grind your way through battles in order to buy new maps. Worst of all: It fails to be fun. It's tedium and waiting for your enemy to die.			"

												I liked it, despite all the bad reviews, it has great potential and plays much like any other RTS. Takes a bit to get used to the post-apoc style and its tech trees after playing so many that are set in fantasy and old world. The game can seem a little fast paced, and yes it can use some polish to its mechanics, but overall i would give it a decent rating for bringing something new in a scenario setting to the genre, or at least out of those i have played.So thumbs up from me, and i look forward to playing with those that do find it worthwhile :)			"

												Apox is possibly one of the worse games I have unfortunately purchased on steam. Multiplayer is dead. The sound and music in this game is way below average in terms of quality; in most cases sound effects don’t even exist. The game just doesn’t have the bam affects you would expect from an RTS game. The controls are wonky as hell, who knew that a total clone of Men of War concepts could be this bad. Want to second guess me, look no further; this game has an average metacritic score of 48. This game’s score puts it head to head against Battle: Los Angeles for worst game of the decade. I urge anyone who read this, to avoid this game at all costs. I guarantee you will hate yourself a lot less if you ignore all deals regarding this game.			"

												First of all, shader 3.0 and 1 GB of FREE memory is highly recommended. Otherwise u'll just have this nasty warnings every time you switch to main menu... But if you are as patient as me or close to that, you may ignore my warning and f##k with those sys messages.About the game itself - it's awesome if not to mention that an RPG does not kill wnything with 1 grenade. I believe it would be cool if it used more ammo but had a greater damage on everything. Come on, it's not some special armor piercing grenade in there! =D Simple frag will smash a man into pile of guts...The idea of ammo that should be refreshed and weapons that break if not shown to mechanic in time is supercool. if u want you even can make a sniper-flamer that will ""make em all pay"" =PYes, it looks sort of unfinished... May be menu.. may be some more units or buildings should be cool. I guess if creators allowed modding, this problem would be fixed. Some balance updates are also required.bad news is that I don't see any updates: small like fixes and balance updates or some new features - non of them. that's sad. But good news is that still no bugs I saw. dunno what other dudes are talking about o_O Apart from constant warning about memory and shaders when I start the game (I have 1 GB RAM, and shaders 2.0), the game works fine.Anyway I like it and sure that it's worth the money I paid (on some sale).

												This game is Mad Max combined with Company of Heroes. Is that really a bad thing?APOX is a hardcore RTS game that requires players to carefully manage their limited resources and units to succeed in destroying the opposition. Despite the mass negative reviews APOX received, is it actually quite an enjoyable RTS game once you have spent the time to learn how to play the game properly. I will address some of the reasons why APOX got the backlash I think it didn’t deserve.Outdated graphics: Sure the graphics look like it was a game from 2004. But who cares about the outdated graphics? They are good enough to create the gameplay and that is all that matters.You have to be online to play it, even in single-player: This issue was addressed in the later patches, at release you need to be online just to even play APOX in single player. Now you can play APOX for as long as you want without an active internet connection.There is only one faction to play with: I know it would have been cool to have a 2nd or 3rd faction but there are no zombies or aliens or killer robots in APOX, so adding another human faction might not have added much in terms of gameplay.Lack of people to play with in online multiplayer: I never really saw this as a real issue. You can play on most of the maps with bots that are just as challenging and in most of the time are able to play APOX far better than other real players can.Poor RTS gameplay: APOX was designed to be a challenging game, it is not for the casual gamer. Unit caps, limited oil, ammo and scavenging for supples all come into play here. If you are expecting to develop a large army very quickly to send to the enemy base like in the 1st gameplay trailer than you will surely be disappointed. What may seem like gameplay flaws are actually APOX’s strengths, in the post-apocalypse world of APOX, resources are very limited, you need to be able to think on your feet of how you can conquer the oil factories, ammo buildings and pipelines to get the resources you need to build a proper attack force, this can lead to some pretty intense gameplay moments where you will need to be attacking and defending the limited resource spawn points over the map and destroying the enemy supply lines. In APOX it’s whoever has the most amounts of resources wins, so getting to those resources as quickly as you can is critical to victory. If you conquer and destroy all the supply points of an enemy base, you have pretty much isolated them and victory is guaranteed, like-wise the same can happen to you, this is oil warfare to the extreme. If you prefer an RTS game where you have plenty of easy access to resources to play with, than APOX isn’t for you and I’ll recommend that you play Command and Conquer instead. APOX makes you work for your resources. Command and Conquer simply gives you them all.			"

												1.3 hours of playing time, being honest, i spent most of that on the toilet with severe diarrhea and i still had more fun on the toilet than in this game. This is a prime candidate for the only game you'll ever have in your library that's so bad that you'll consider removing it permanently.			"

												APOX isn't given as much credit as it ought to have.  Despite its somewhat dated graphics, it's quite a fun RTS with several unique components.  Games are quick and usually full of action.  I'm not an RTS kind of guy, and I'm typically really bad at them, but this was one I could get into for a little while.			"

												BUTWhy do I start with the word 'but'? Because I don't know how to write butts? No, I know how to write that.The reason why is because this game has some pro's, and a lot of cons. I recommend, BUT.The gameplay is refreshing, ammo-management makes the game more interesting, mostly in the campaign mode. Infantry feels nice and marching over the field with 20-30 men feels like you have a huge army, while in most games you would laugh when you see 30 grunts run towards your base.However, there are a lot of annoyances, first off the vehicles. The vehicles are extremely fast, of course they are based from cars, but it just feels unnantural driving with 100 km/h through war-raging wastelands. It also means that your vehicles have already engaged and 3 minutes later your infantry finally arrives unless you completely micromanage the movement.Another annoyance if your soldiers picking up all kinds of weapons, I start an assault with 10 rifleman, and suddenly 6 of my men turned into mortars and when I give an order to attack an enemy soldier, they either do nothing at all or attack the enemy with knives. While it's nice that you can pick up weapons, it should not do it by itself, or at least keep it in reserve.Skirmish mode is decent fun, the AI isn't the stupidest ever (though they do tend to attack with 3 soldiers half the time rather than a full force). But after the first few minutes, you often start piling up on ammo. Negating the idea of limited ammo. Once you capture another outpost or a resource building, the stockpile of ammo goes through the roof. And when you attack an enemy, often you kill so many enemies you can just pick up their ammo and continue.The game is fun for 5-10 hours. After a couple of hours you some things will start to bug you a bit, and I expect the longer you play it, the more they will annoy you.I do not recommend buying this game for 14 euro's.But for 5-8 euro's you can get some good hours out of it.

												As there’s no story in the tutorial-like missions that only serve to gear you up towards scrimmage matches, there’s also no drive in playing. If the only goal of a game is to pit you against each other eventually, then you’ll need more of a punch to bring people towards it. The bottom line is that APOX offers an innovating concept with a disappointing delivery. It gets a lot of points for effort, but that’s it. You can’t blame a guy for trying, but the fact remains that this first title from Bluegiant Interactive is not a successful operation. Only if you were to be a desperate RTS addict that hasn’t heard of the joys a game like Company Of Heroes can bring you, will you find any solace in the bland production of this game. Otherwise, APOX is not worth your time.			"

												The concept is awesome but the game is underwhelming and requires a lot of polish. If you're an rts enthusiast it's too simplified to satisfy those more involved in the genre, and the gameplay doesn't blend well into the other genres. Visually the game looks outdated, not terrible, just from a few years back.			"
