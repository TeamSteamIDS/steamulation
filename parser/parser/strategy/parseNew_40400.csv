												This game plots you against 2 super powerful AI's, and starts you with one planet, one base, and you must build up from there.So my 2 other friends and i have a fleet of over 3000 ships. We have captured 12 combined planets, and we are doing amazingly, when we find the husk of an ancient ship.It calls to us, and asks us to repair it.We start repairing it with everything we had.10 minutes later, it gets fixed, and we get a ship called the 'Exodian Blade.'The Blade shoots a laser that instakills most ships in its path. However, it is super, super slow.We become greedy, and we start capturing planets, with the Blade singlehandley defeating everything on it.But when one of my scientists conducts a survey and finds a strange subspace signal, the AI gets mad, and launches a full scale assault.Even with the Exodian Blade, we couldn't defend forever.We had lost all but 2 of our planets; only our capital and a far-off isolated colony remained.We had repositioned the 300 ships left from our 3000 ship fleet at the capital.When suddenly, my friend completes a nuke.He had been building it all game.We use the nuke, completely destroying every ship and planet except for one AI's home and our captial.We track down the AI home, and send the Exodian Blade there.Meanwhile, a devourer golem appears, which slowly moves and instakills any ships next it, at my capital.Fast forward, I had kited the golem away, and the Blade arrived at the AI home.We were surprised to see that there were only 300 ships there. Nothing that we can't handle.Then we realize that we needed to destroy 13 different shield generators around the planet that protected the AI core.""We can do that! We have the most overpowered ship in the game! We can just instakill them all,"" we all exclaimed.""The most overpowered ship in the game"" looked like crap to what came in next.A exogalactic wormhole appears, and through it come 3000 different max level ships, ships with missiles, ships with integrated shields, ships we have never evever seen before.It took a minute for the Exodian Blade, with 200 million hitpoints, to die.We hadn't destroyed a single thing on the AI home planet.We had lost on difficulty 'very easy.'I cant even imagine what the highest difficulty level is like.This game is the only game that can make you go from amazing to crap so quickly, and still be fun.This game is the only game that makes losing fun.This game is the spawn of Satan.But it might have well been a gift from heaven.

												Ai War: Fleet Command feels like playing chess - without knowing all the moves, and with a cheating opponent.First off, the opponent doesn't really cheat, but it feels that way to a new player. The learning curve is extremely steep, which means you will probably only lose for the first few dozen hours of playing - unless you choose one of the very easy difficulties.The main problem most people will have is the completely different playstyle. Yes, it is an RTS, it looks and even plays as a classic RTS, yet when you go out from your home planet lasers blazing, burning and capturing new resources, you will lose. Always. How discouraging, right?The reason to this is asymetry. Your opponent does not share your options. He does not build, he has everything. You on the other hand have but a single planet. Why not crush you in an instant? Cause he doesn't care, you're not important enough to be crushed. However if you blow up a few planets of his.. he might as well decide it's time for the human remnant to die.All this said, the game *punishes* you for capturing important assets - planets, technology, etc. Each time you do such an action, the ai gets more aware of your ""threat"", which will mean stronger and more frequent attacks. From now till the end of game.In conlcusion, there seems to be two games hidden under this title:First, a guerilla war, in which the player gathers strength and tries to avoid antagonizing the enemy too much in fear of brutal retaliation.Second, the glorious moment when the carefully prepared guerilla finally decides to go on par with the ai and fight a full on war - no more hiding.Replayability: High, assuming you don't mind defeat. There are plenty of ai structures, and only some of them are used on each map. Throughout the expansions, a lot more has arrived to make the game entertaining and keep the player busy.Multiplayer: Brilliant. The player slots can be changed on the fly by the game host. Playing a single player game and having a friend who wants to join? No problem, open a slot for him, give him a planet and you're playing within seconds. He's leaving again? No big deal, just close his slot, grab his units and go on with your game.You probably don't want to play this if:- You dislike frequent losing- You dislike slow-paced games- You dislike games with a steep learning curve- You dislike constantly analysing the situation and like to just order your units to go and pillage instead.You probably want to try this if:- You like complicated strategy games- You like analysing the strategic situation a lot- You like slow-paced strategy games, in which fortifications actually work- You are a hard-core strategy game player and like a challenge- You like dwarf fortress and space strategy games			"

												At the time of Writing, I have over 1000 hours clocked in this game.I have won four times on difficulty 7, once on difficulty 8. I got crushed in 3.5 hours on diff. 9Any other strategy game I load up (against AIS), the results are a foregone conclusion. I will win.It has taken me over four years and six expansions, over a thousand hours... AND I LOSE ON 9.This game is not simple. it is not forgiving, and it sure as heck isn't easy to learn.If you are all about grand strategy but micromanagement leaves a bad taste in your mouth, this may be the best $20 you ever spend.  Get the bundle.			"

												AI War is a special game to me. To borrow a quote from Firefly:""Live with a man 40 years. Share his house, his meals. Speak on every subject. Then tie him up, and hold him over the volcano's edge. And on that day, you will finally meet the man.""AI War lets you meet yourself. Some games you play until you can win, then you get bored. AI War is different. At difficulty 7 or below it's still challenging, easy to stumble on the long road to victory and not a sure thing. It'll take a while but you'll have a satisfying victory. But you won't stop there, once you can win the game then you'll feel free to turn up the heat. Walking through the labyrinth of options until, quite quickly, you find yourself standing on the volcano's edge, bound and tied by your own hands. But when you find yourself there it'll be with a smile on your face, saying quite happily: ""Oh no! Oh no! Oh dear... I'm dead."" And if you do manage to win at difficulty 10, it's a bug. Report it on the Arcen games forums... with pride.Also, it has co-op multiplayer. So you can tie your friends up and hold them over the volcano's edge... though you'll probably both be a little singed. (Fighting Scorched Earth AI's and... Mimes! NB: Scorched earth destroys planets rather than letting you take control, never set both AI types to that if you want to win. Mimes mimic the ships you used against it, you'll think... “So what happens if I use...” and the answer: You die.) Lastly, the developers are kind, polite and extraordinarily hard working. The game has evolved with constant developments for year after year after year. They read people's after action reports, watch the lets plays, answer questions on the forums and are just plain nice. Not a dull nice, but a sweet, genuine, sharp and creative nice... rather like shaving a birthday cake into a beard. Or sneaking into the office to digitise old files to save you time.They've got a touch of magic, love and creativity that I want to watch, and I hope that other people will have a chance to see it too. So yeah, it's just a game, the graphics are a little dated and the learning curve is a little steep... it isn't really magic and it doesn't grant any wishes. But I like it. I'm glad I bought it. I hope you'll set aside a few hours and give it a solid try. Then some more hours when you drag a friend to play a co-op game.			"

												So.. I started a game to test the enemy AI, with each of the game's two AI opponents set to the 'Entrenched Homeworlder' preset and 10/10 difficulty (10/10, out of a possible 17 settings)To ""make things fair"" I gave myself a +300% boost to resources and limited the technology available for the round (no starships, no shields, couple other things..)The ""match"" lasted 6:12.Six minutes for me to set up my base.. I built a bank of 15 sniper turrets, and two semi-crescents of laser turrets, and piled minefields around the two warp points in my home system (and lightly along the path I was sure the devils would cut straight towards my base, as well..).I crafted a fleet of 200 ships, 50 of each available at the time. Set up tachyon drones and reinforced my swarm of engineers.. I created a Mobile Builder in case tragedy happened, and was just about to waste time setting up tractor beam turrets when they arrived.The ship types didn't matter. Nothing mattered.135 mixed enemy ships showed up and tore through the minefields like they weren't there. It killed some, but it wasn't enough. The spear of sea-foam green demons flew directly for my colony, shrugging off sniper and laser fire.. As my fleet approached, they simply drove through them.They didn't want the fleet.They took two things, in that 12 seconds: my home colony (which earns you a pleasantly red text stating YOU HAVE LOST!), and my energy supply (throwing my entire setup into electrical brown-out).Then they turned and left. I was reminded of an assassin, gently dispatching their hapless and hopeless victim with grace and ease, silent.. and leaving, without fanfare.			"

												For me, it’s a rare thing indeed for a game to move from total obscurity to a fixed place on my hard drive in the course of a handful of days.  Admittedly, I was less-than-enthused as I first started playing this little gem from Arcen Games. I was thoroughly prepared to slog through yet another space-based RTS, and be on way to bigger and better titles. Then, slowly, I began uncovering a depth of play that I just wasn’t expecting in a freshman game from a tiny indie studio. After a few more hours, I realized that I was not only having a blast with my initial runs through the game, I was planning many additional excursions even after my review was written. Although not for the faint of heart, AI Wars: Fleet Command is a surprising, delightful, and thoroughly engrossing RTS title. AI Wars is just brimming with innovative twists on the 4X-style RTS. First up: regardless of the number of players, from the solo outing to an eight-player mash-up, AI Wars is always Human vs. AI. At first blush, this may sound like a Bad Thing, but it works quite well. Due to this co-op only setting, Arcen dodged a huge problem with many RTS games: the need for balancing several different factions. Next up is the AI itself. In a very cool take on enemy behavior, the AI advances in difficulty and aggressiveness in direct proportion to the amount of territory the human teams take. Destroying key AI structures increases the “AI Progress” value, meaning a greater buildup of enemy forces, and a greater willingness for them to be used. The AIs themselves can be set from several different flavors at the start of a game, giving players the chance to face turtling AI, highly aggressive ones, tech-mad researchers, or some combination of the mix. Just one little change in AI setting makes for a very different game.Speaking of game setup, there are scads of options to choose from at the outset. Galaxy size and planet distribution choices are endless, with millions of possible combinations (and the ability to preserve the random seed for those who want to re-try a favorite map). AI style and aggressiveness, as mentioned above, greatly changes the challenge level of the game. In addition, there are several choices about player tech level, bonus units, and other small flavor changes.The scope of AI Wars is staggering. Played over a series of planetary gravity wells connected by jump points, a typical game can have dozens of active battlefronts with literally thousands upon thousands of ships slugging it out. Thankfully, the control scheme is more than capable of handling the hordes. With just a few clicks, entire sweeping fleets can be sent across the galaxy. Typical RTS necessities, such as tech upgrades, resource management, and unit building, are likewise streamlined to allow players to spend much more time in big-picture decisions. The tech tree itself is rather small compared to other games of this type, but it fits well with the flow nonetheless. The strategy for playing AI Wars is something truly unique. Due to the AI Progress aspect, it’s often not in players’ best interest to completely take over every planet. Those that take that approach will soon find themselves swamped with enemy forces, since the AI doesn’t have to play by the same resource-limited rules that the players do. Careful scouting of neighboring systems, following by surgical strikes and opportunistic lunges is the name of the game. Because of this, players are often spreading out across the galaxy in a piecemeal fashion, leaving enemy forces interspersed between the growing empire. Thus, players need to find that perfect balance between careful defensive turtling and selective offense.  Adding additional human teammates increases the difficulty proportionally, so the challenge doesn’t fade with the increased number of allies. AI Wars looks good, although I did take a little while to warm up to the almost old-school style. The ability to quickly zoom in and out over massive battlefields is impressive, as is the ability for the game to visually keep everything straight. I found the background music to also be surprisingly good, since it’s often something I either just overlook or soon disable in this sort of game. The controls are solid, although they did seem just a little clunky at first. After a bit of time, however, I soon had everything flowing smoothly in my quest for human dominance. All told, AI Wars: Fleet Command is bound to be a delight to any fan of the heavier strategy titles. It’s an absolute bargain as well, and this title has the rumblings of a very strong, even if not terribly large, community support. I was pleasantly surprised by just about everything I saw in this game, and I would heartily suggest this for those wanting a meaty, unique galactic RTS romp. Although not for the faint of heart (or even the casual strategy gamer), AI Wars: Fleet Command is a surprising, delightful, and thoroughly engrossing RTS title.			"

												This game is a rare gem, the type of game that only comes out of a small studio.No other title I've played in the last several years has offered this kind of tactical depth, but to say it's just a great strategy game would be doing it an injustice.  It's also a game that, despite its rather basic 2D graphics and rudimentary sound, truly captures the essence of the universe it portrays.  It's a dark, cold universe where humanity has been flung to the four winds, and is pursued by a ruthless alien AI hive across the galaxy as it fights, vainly, for its survival.  It evokes the imagery and sense of encroaching dread of Ender's Game as it puts you in charge of organizing mankind's last stand - a suicidal breakout and attack directly against the AI homeworlds.To get there, you'll have to cut a swath through AI controlled worlds, each with layered defenses, guard posts, mobile fortresses and a plethora of other tools at it's disposal to remind you that they are the masters of this domain, and make your beachhead a costly failure.  And even if your beachhead is successful, you will quickly learn that you have but stumbled into the lion's den.  Each tactical victory comes with a price that is higher than the sum of all the troops that fell in achieving it - the closer you get to the AI homeworlds, the more viciously, effectively, and stubbornly it will fight.  Well before you get within stone's throw of their homeworlds, the AI will begin to recognize you as a real and growing threat, and it will respond appropriately.By appropriately, I mean it will attempt to destroy you using everything in its near-infinite disposal.  If you expand zealously, like the scourge it believes humanity to be, it will crush you mercilessly without batting an eye.  From star systems and galaxies near and far, it will draw from the hive and send the combined weight of a thousand navies against you.  You cannot win this war traditionally.  You must wage it like a guerrilla campaign, striking hard and fast deep in enemy territory at specific, high value targets, and hoping to escape with your remaining forces back into the night.  You must attrition down dug in positions carefully, lest you give away your true presence and tip your hand.  It is a war that demands long-term strategic thinking, tempered aggression, the careful use of ruse and concealment, and a sixth sense of when your foe is strong and when he is weak.  It requires you to revise your tactics and force compositions constantly, as the AI will adapt to your strategies quickly.  Like using hordes of cheap, fast, throwaway ships to attrition down the enemy?  Well, right now the Ai is building a stealth smart bombing fleet that will be able to annihilate your blob before it can even react.  Like bunkering up and covering your inlet wormholes with shields and hordes of turrets?  The AI just hacked your shield and turrets with the hacker drones right on the other side of the wormhole you havent scouted lately, and not only have they assembled a strike force just on the other side, theyre now making a beachhead into your territory, using your shield and turrets for cover.  That system, well behind the front, that's been quiet as a ghost for the last hour?  As we speak there are AI stealth drones surveying its defenses, helping to paint a picture of precisely how much force and what tools will be needed to push you out of system and split a gap in your supply lines.  Steamrolling the AI with your superfleet, sitting off the enemy's sector, waiting for orders to jump?  It knows you're there.  It's just waiting for you to commit, to jump into system, so it can spring on the black hole generators so you cannot escape.  It will hit you with tractor beams, smart bombs, and long-range standoff fleets that outrange your crippled battleships.  And then, as you helplessly watch your fleet picked apart, that massed invasion fleet that has been assembling just outside your territory gets the go order, and before long you are looking at a massed attack all along the front as the AI carries out probing attacks at your industrial centers - just as you are at your weakest.  It only wanted you to think it was weak, to draw you into a fight on favorable terms, on ground where the tables were turned.  It wanted you to commit the bulk of your forces to suicidal action, as it planned to pin your fleet down, envelop your industrial base, and destroy you.The AI is THAT good.  And that's on one of the more modest difficulty settings.   On the higher settings, it goes from being a somewhat difficult campaign into a brutal, oft-unwinnable fight for survival.  You have to employ the same cunning tactics as the AI to stand a chance.  It amazes me that this was a two-man project; the gentleman who wrote the AI script for this should be working for the NSA skunkworks.This game has been out for a while, and has six or so expansions now; if it sounds like the kind of title you're interested in, I'd reccommend the bundle.  The expansions offer a number of new tools, ships, modifications, and functionalities to the game.It's not the prettiest game to behold, but the gameplay is awesome, the AI is beyond amazing, and the replayability is tremendous.  One of the best PC purchases I've ever made.			"

												Be warned - this game can get insane.As the title suggests this game is a fleet (unit) management game, mixed in with a x4 type of experience. The scale of the game opens up suddenly and can get to the point where it just seems overwhelming, however if you stay with it and learn how it works you'll find a decent game.I'd recommend taking this game slowly, even if the AI doesn't really want you to. You will die several times as you discover the past ways to link units together and arrange your resource collection and defending units to be most effective - that's just the nature of the game. As such this isn't really the ideal game for a beginner to x4 to step in, yet it might just be one of the most rewarding.The depth in potential is deep and the 3 expansion packs have been done in the 'right way' adding more content to the game and improving gameplay. Thankfully the developers regularly patch AI War: Fleet Command too, which would suggest they're aware of their community, which for me is a major part of buying into a game. I know some people aren't too keen on AI War due to the rather dated UI and graphics, but I think that's part of the charm. The lack of flashy graphics allows for resources and time to have been spent on the complex nature of the game's actual 'AI'. So, considering the game is called 'AI War', it's almost essential that the game itself has a top level AI behind the scenes making all of this work. At times this can feel like the enemy are being hyper aggressive, but in truth they're learning about you the player. They're not just reacting to whatever race you play, they learn how you use that race and how you setup. Again this might not be ideal for a new comer, however it can help too, as sometimes they'll go 'easy' on you... for a little bit.Overall AI War: Fleet Command is a very indepth game that doesn't seem to get much fanfare amonst the Steam Community. If you're a fan of x4 games then this is the game for you. If you can look past the very basic graphics there is a very deep experience waiting for you, perhaps one of the best experiences you'll ever have.The added bonus is that this game is often VERY cheap on Steam during the Steam sales.

												I love this game.  It is without a doubt my favorite game on Steam.  Just look at how many hours I've played, that's got to say something (like I should go get a life).  Seriously though, the game is great.  I have it, and I've bought about 6 other copies of the game for my friends because I believe in this one so much.  Yes, I know the graphics seem backwards and uninspiring, but you'll learn as you play this game that it's actually better this way.  Look past the graphics and into the mind of a monsterous AI.This game is going to have a VERY steep learning curve at first.  Once you get through the basic commands on how to move ships around, set up build queues, and construct your fleet, the game really opens up to you.  You're going to find that this game will challenge your strategic and tactical thinking.  If you think you're good at RTS games, this will push you to the limit.  Do you think there isn't an RTS that can challenge you anymore?  This one can and will.  Are you just plain crazy, play it on the max dificulty, it's a bug if you can beat it.There are a ton of units for this game, and I strongly recommend getting all the DLC.  With the whole set you've got nearly unlimited different kinds of games.  You'll find unit combinations that will fit your play style no matter what style that happens to be.  The AI is one of the most interesting things in this game.  It will surprise you countless times.  Just when you think you've figure it out, it'll show you a new trick.  Look how much I've play this, it's still showing me surprises.  The game still have times when it feels fresh to me.  It's amazing that you can dive so deeply into a game and still find things.  I'll shut up now and let you buy this game.  Play it.			"

												Do you like skirmishing against computer players in RTSes, but don't think they simulate humans enough?  Great, you'll like AI War.  It's asymmetric, about halfway between skirmish and campaign modes, and it doesn't try to act like a real human.Do you like really long RTS matches, but don't like that they usually turn one-sided after the first half an hour?  Great, you'll like AI War, it stays tense and balanced for the entire 5-20 hour struggle.Do you like HARD games?  Play AI War.  The difficulty levels you can select start low but go up to truly legendary heights.Do you like constant battle?  AI War may not be for you.  Yes it's real-time, but you will spend a fair amount of time thinking and plotting and planning.  Anxiously.Do you like games that you can finish in one sitting?  Don't play AI War.  Just don't.Do you like an easy, relaxed gameplay experience?  Probably don't play AI War.  You can set the difficulty low, but it's boring...and the difficulty goes up as time goes on, not down.  Unless you're playing way below your skill level, the endgame is always a brutal nailbiter and if you are careless you can get wiped out.  AI War needs you to think about what you're doing for the whole game.This game is not for everyone, and it takes a big time commitment.  If you're sitting on the fence, I'd recommend avoiding it.  There is no ""let's sit down for half an hour and see how it is"", it will take a lot of time no matter what.  Also, you will absolutely want to sit down and play the tutorial, even though it takes a couple hours.  It's basically just a short version of a full game that walks you through the unique strategies of AI War with kid gloves on.  Playing this game like it was any other RTS is the biggest mistake you can possibly make.As for what makes the strategy different?  You have to pick your battles.  The AI is generally not that aggressive, at least not in a planet-by-planet way, but every single time you expand it's like kicking a hornet's nest.  Discretion is the better part of valor, and not just because you risk your current armies:  In this setting, your opponent is much bigger than you, but it also has other interests much bigger than you.  If you stay small and pick your targets carefully, you can keep from drawing too much ire, but if you try to take over the whole galaxy then your enemy will say ""oh maybe these humans are a real threat"" and stomp the hell out of you.  Don't do that.All in all, it's a truly unique entry in the RTS genre.  If the above caveats don't scare you away, give it a shot.  It might not be your favorite game, but it's a truly memorable one, and worth the time commitment to play a few games.			"

												I've come back to this game over and over through the years as various expansions keep getting released.It sort of defies a simple explanation, but the basic idea is that you either alone or with some multiplayer friends undertake a vast strategic campaign to purge an even nastier version of Skynet from existence.Given the crazy amount of options in the game as well as all of its expansions it has almost unlimited replayability.  The ships you get to use will be random (although there is a core set and one you pick at the start) and the tech trees are wide enough that in most games you won't get to use anywhere near all of it.  The difficulty paces itself very well, for a beginner starting at recommended difficulties things start off light and raise in tempo, with unexpected bites coming every so often both from the AI's own plans or your mistakes.  As you get experienced you can make the game harder in any number of ways so no matter how skilled you get you can make it a fun challenge.The developers maintain awesome forums and listen to the people that play the games and treat their customers right.Really all I can say is if you're looking at the page for this game and have even the remotest hint of interest, buy it.

The game tells me ""hold this super computer to decrease the AIs tech level over time. but the AI will send units to take it back.""and i, thinking myself unbeatable at this point go. that sounds overpowered, i could easily send MY ENTIRE FLEET TO HOLD THE POINT, and thus win the game by keeping the AI at the lowest tech level. sounded perfect in my head. and right before i turned on that *supercomputer* i though, this is soooooo overpowered i need to make a rule for myself to not abuse it. well, i was right. it was overpowered.but not for mewhen i close my eyes, i still see the hordes of ships. over ten thousand. of a level i couldn't even damage.

												This game is not fair.  From the first second of any game, until (in most games) the last stages of the game, the AI possesses sufficient firepower to obliterate your insignificant rebellion without really stretching.  In this repect, most games of AI War are a wonderful breath of fearful concern.  Always looking over your shoulder.  Always trying to avoid annoying the AI too much.  Always treading softly, while carrying the biggest gun (indeed every gun) you can find.Let's be clear; if you're looking for a game that holds your hand through a linear, scripted campaign, this is not the game for you.If you want a game based on systems that will push you to find the most underhand and exploitative responses you can to the challenges it throws at you, look no further.This game is stupendously configurable in its setup, which can be somewhat overwhelming when you first start, but makes for an extraordinarily replayable game, even more so with the expansions, rich in choices, threats and options.  If you so choose, you can take a nominally hard setup (two twin-""hard"" AI types at high level) and give yourself several ""helping hands"".  You can choose an easy setup of two easy AI types at a low level and then click every extra challenge on.  And everything is good fun.  Really.  There are even multiple ways to win a game, based on the setup choices you made for each game and the choices you make while playing each game.At easier difficulties, you wont find the game too punishing, but as the difficulty levels go up, so do your challenges.  To beat level 9 AIs, you'll need to be exploiting weaknesses mercilessly.  You'll need to be imaginative and ruthless in how you knock out the obstacles in your path.  If you are not willing to min/max your odds and use every cheesy trick you can find, you'll likely find it unbeatable.  And at the maximum difficulty settings...?This is a game made by developers that treat ""impossible"" as a real thing, not just a cool-sounding label.  If you beat level 10 AIs without spamming helpful setup options, this is a bug.  They'll want to know how you did it, they'll congratulate you, and then they'll tweak a few things in a patch so it won't work again.  If you really do want to win on your first playthrough, play at a lower difficulty level.  If you really insist on always winning, don't play at the highest difficulties.  And that's okay because it's still enormously fun at the mid difficulties.  But you'll always find yourself pushing to win on a more difficult map-type.  Against a more challenging AI type.  Against a higher AI level.  With some devious or vicious sub-plot turned on.  With some hellish combination of AI sub-types.  There's always something else to try, there's always something else to lose against.10/10 - Would doom humanity to an eternity of enslavement by forgetting to rebuild my forcefields  again.  And again.			"

												This is one of the best games of the last years.AI War: Fleet Command is a strategy game which you will love. Building your econemy, your ships (lots of ships; if you say, I'll attack with 400 ships, there are really 500 ships on the map...and you need them), creating your tactics and win against the AI...or lose. Sounds normal? This game has some more stuff than other games...or better, it is doing everything a bit different. It is relativ hard to get into the game. But after one, two, three houres of playing you get it (hotkeys, fight mechanics, etc. ). And than it gets really good.The 'story' behind this fighting is, that AI populations have taken the world we know (or better the universe) and the human species has to recover and fight back. Every solarsystem is to capture, because the AI got everything, so you have to fight from the beginning. 'War is not fair' are the introducing words of that game. And that's true. The AI got reinforcement out of nowhere, but that's not a minus for the game, because that's how it works. You get better, the AI too, so get some friends and play it coop, it is much more fun to tell someone how unfair it is, that the AI is sending again 600 bombers to you homeworld ;) and it is impossible to beat the AI alone on higher difficulties.For these who don't like micro-strategy, just take everything you have and click on the enemy. They have so many livepoints, that you have to concentrate you fire always on one ship of thair ships, so it's not that important which ship is where, just that it is in combat :). Or you have the option to play as a champion. Than you have no base, just one big ship which gain lvl and better weapons over time, so you have to care about nothing than your 'hero' (a little RPG in strategy).But the other are right, be warned: This game is huge. You play normaly over 7 houres on one campain. If you play with friends on bigger maps, it can take over 20h, so be sure to have enougth time.And...If you like soundtracks, buy it! Don't think about the game...this Music is epic, you can listen to it for hours and there are so beautiful songs between (AncientShadows, Cries of Zenith are my favorites ;) ) ...amazing...(with the expensions there are over 5.5h music)So if you like space strategy games or really good musik buy that game...and on sale day like now (the holiday sale) it is nearly for free. (I would recommend to buy the expensions too (the collection))			"

												AI War: Fleet Command is one the best strategy games out there on the market. With it's excellent gameplay and lore, this is a must buy for any strategy or space lover.*PROS*-Amazing Strategy; down to the finest details.-A variety of unit types.-Co op!-Good lore-AMAZING AI! I cannot stress how good this AI is!-Instead of giving the enemy AI more benifits on harder difficulties, this game insteads actually increases the smarts of it!-Well thought-out game mechanics, like massive nukes to destroy a base, or a travel planner for a selected group of units.*CONS*-The Multiplayer matchmaking system is non-existent, meaning you cannot easily find a public server to join. Instead, you or one of your friends has to host it.-Graphics are barebones. A little boost to these wouldn't hurt, though I understand that when you have thousands of units onscreen at once it can be a little lagging. -Horrible tutorial. It is existent, but when I started the game, the tutorial didn't really help me, thus I had to go the youtube for assistance. This may not apply to everyone, but if you're not a fast learner, you will have to go to youtube or some other website. -Steep learning curve. This kinda relates to the horrible tutorial thing, but it still is hard to learn once you've started the game. However, after a while you kind of get the hang of things.*VERDICT*This is one of the best strategy games on the market, and is a must buy for anyone. Really, everyone.			"

												I may be a little biased in that I liked this game even before I played it. When I first purchased AI war, it was on the Arcen Games site and they sent a little email about how they don't believe in DRM, and therefore I could always play using my key, and if I lost my key, simply contact them.I then purchased this again on steam at a completely reasonable price. I like having my games consolidated in one place and this game was worth it. I really can't say enough about how good this game is. I doubt even the folks with negative reviews would say absolutely do not buy it. Onto the game:- great AI that you can tweak any way you like. Arcen even goes so far as to explain why the AI works the way it does and makes a plausible (sci-fi) argument about it.- vast array of ships for research- a million different galaxies all seeded with their own unique resources- Arcen keeps upgrading the game mostly for free, but each expansion is very well priced- statistics about each game are very in depth providing great feedbackI've read the negative reviews and the main arguments are graphics and UI. Personally, I'm impressed with the UI. Every single element is customizable. You can change any key, and there's a menu with auto management choices that make things easy for you. There are about 4 keys you can click while mouse clicking to make your ships behave differently and it's simple. The graphics are not excellent, but it's a compromise between performance and graphics. This game will work on older systems, there are no glitches, it doesn't require high-end cards, yet it works even during battles with thousands of ships.			"

												I have owned the game for something like three or four years.. for each of those years I have played the tutorial, tried to understand the game and to be able to play it to win.. and I've failed every time.This year for the fourth time I tried again. and this time I succeeded. And WOW... suddenly the game unfolds like a flower .. or perhaps a supernova. I expect it will be another four years before I win a game, but I will enjoy the game on and off for the rest of my life I think.Astonishing depth hidden behind a horrible (but learnable) interface.

												I got this a while back and finally got around to playing it. I was looking forward to it, based on the generally positive reviews and all the Steam ""face time"" it was getting. Unfortunately, the game didn't grab me. I tried to play it a couple more times to pinpoint what it was I didn't like about the game. Here's a summary:1) The ship/structure graphics are 2D and don't seem to ""fit"" the rest of the game. The game has the illusion of 3D with its background starfield, but the ships and structures look like paper cutouts slapped over it. That might not be a dealbreaker, but they don't even rotate when they move. So I guess I'm just not a fan of the art style.2) The UI is barebones and functional. It's a chore to use the UI, much like learning keywords for a programming language. Once you learn that you can hold down CNTL while right-clicking an empty space after selecting units and those units will auto-patrol, it's cool. But it makes no sense, and is just more stuff I have to remember in order to play. Basically, don't make me work too hard to *play* the game - make me work to *win* it.3) There are an overwhelming number of ship and structural options and upgrades, and since you make hundreds of ships and engage in blob warfare, it makes me not care about any of them. I can't keep up with what a Mark II frigate's bonuses are - I'm losing 10 ships per second in this battle and they're all various types of ships and the last thing I'm worried about is whether my bombers (wherever they are in the blob) are within range of the strike fighters. Combat is just to maintenance-heavy, unless you go with blob tactics, and in that case what's the point of paying attention to individual ship details/upgrades?Overall, I think this game is just too complex for the sake of being complex. I think most of the ship variations need to go away, and the mechanics need to be boiled down to a fun and balanced core rules set. Then the UI wouldn't need to be so complicated, and the *fun* complexity could come from what the player can do with the core ships/options available.			"

												So, background. I'm a heavy dwarf fortress player, and tend to favor 2d or isometric games over the new trend for blazing 3d. If you're used to shiny graphics, AI wars will disappoint. Also, it's not a pool with a shallow end. You're either going in deep, or you're probably going to not like it. It has an incredible amount of depth, but requires... lots of real life hours to extract the rewards. I've only beaten one round of it, which took me a real life week and about 20 hours of play time, and that was on 5/5(or easy) difficulty. My playtime on steam isn't really a good gauge of how long I've played this, as I bought it direct from arcengames, which came with a steam activation key, but I much prefer the stand alone version that came along with it. On their website, you can also find a demo of this game. https://arcengames.com/ai-war/ I  highly reccomend you play through it before you buy.The AI is crafty, but does not cheat. Each difficulty increase gives it new buildings, new strategies, etc. Your goal is to destroy two homeworld planets, one controlled by each AI, who play as a team against you. This game CAN be played with up to 8 human players as a co-op game, but unless you know people in real life who are interested it's kinda hard to match up timezones to play with folks through the internet.I enjoy the variety of ship types, over twenty I think, and none of them are slightly modified copies of other types. Also, you can make a nuclear bomb so powerful that it destroys the galaxy. How cool is that. As long as it wipes out the AI a split second before it kills you, still counts as a win. :D			"

												AI War: Fleet Command (AIW), is an Asymmetrical 4X Tower Defense RTS. Which I know probably sounds very jumbled up so let me break that down a little more.Asymmetrical: While you are playing AI Wars, the computer is playing something more akin to Risk.4X: Pretty self explainatory it follows the ""eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate"" style of gameplay.Tower Defense: This is the one that threw me off it at first because I generally don't enjoy TD games, however, in AIW it is more a the defensive side of the game, in that you have a whole arsenal of turrets at your disposal to defend your planets with, while your RTS fleet is off doing offense. They are more akin to towers, and turrets from a traditional RTS like Starcraft or Warcraft.RTS: It is a real time strategy, with a grand campaign feel for it. You have your more 'tactical' fighting at the planet level where you might be maneuvering your fleet to best deal with the AI, but on the Galaxy map that planet is only one of 80 in a normal size game (You can go as little as 10 planets, or as high as 120 I believe)Story: The war for humanity is over, we lost... the AI has all but wiped humans off the face of the galaxy leaving only pockets left in the abyss before turning their attention to more pressing concerns. You play as one of those pockets, and using the AI's absent mindedness to begin rebuilding the human race, and take revenge. Assuming you can be sneaky enough to not draw the full ire of the AI before your plans go off.Personal Take: I've dumped well over 100+ hours into this game over the time I've had it, which is a huge amount for me, however, a drop in the bucket to many of it's fans. This is a game where you start with 1 planet that you call home, everything else is owned by the AI (technically it is two AI, but they are a team). As such you have to be very strategic about how you move forward. If you just kill everything around you, you end up drawing attention to yourself in the form of AI Progress, which in turn causes the AI to send bigger, and stronger attacks against you. If you're playing anywhere near your skill level in the game, that can mean disaster for you. It's very much a game of learning how to push to what you need without necessarily steamrolling everything. The AI in the game is phenomenal, and hands down the best computer AI I've ever seen in any sort of RTS/Strategy game. It does have it's downsides though as well... the biggest being that there is a pretty steep learning curve for the game. The tutorials do an excellent job teaching you the different aspects and controls of the game, but it is a lot to take in, even with just the base game and no extra fluff turned on. (It's grown a fair bit in the 7 years it has been out).  It's other drawback is that it is a hard game, a very hard game. This is mostly by design, as remember we've already lost the war, when you start the game, the AI already has 10k+ ships floating around in the galaxy and getting more as you play. There is a joke among the hardcore players (the 5-6k+ hours played folks) that winning on 10/10 (the hardest difficulty) is a bug, which it normally is. The developers for this game have spent the last 7 years essentially playing a PVP game against their player base of seeing how they exploit various AI missteps at 10/10 and then fixing those with the help of the players. There is a demo on Steam if you want to get your feet wet first. (I love games that provide Demos) If you do enjoy it, or have enjoyed it in the past they announced a few days back that they are making a new one, and are currently running a kickstarter for it if you are interested. They are adding a bunch of new things to it, but the one I'm most looking forward to is the 3D graphics, and re-designed UI.			"

												AI War is an amazing mix of 4X, strategy, and tower defense. Unlike any other game I've played, AI War is complex and difficult. Adaptive AIs mean that no strategy will work forever, limited resources mean that every decision matters, and the random generation means that no two games are alike. The expansion packs are excellent, and add a great deal to the game.The difficulty levels, ranging from 1 (sandbox) to 10 (Doom) ensure that no matter how skilled you get at the game, you'll always be challenged.AI War, however, isn't perfect. It has an extremely steep learning curve, and even with over two hundred hours in game, I still learn things. Furthermore, the game could be more friendly to multiplayer enviroments. On the largest map settings with highest fleet values, AI War will crash occasionally, but that's a result of the Unity engine, not a problem with the game itself.Overall, I would reccomend AI War to anyone who likes (loves) strategy, thrives on a challenge, or is bored of other games. Players looking for something to play casually may not enjoy it as much as I have. "

												Ai War is by far the most in depth RTS game I have ever played. The learning curve is rather steep but there are good resources on YouTube to help break the ice. The game seems completely and utterly overwhelming at first but once you sink your teeth into it you will find it quite rewarding. It can be an extremelly challenging game and isn't exactly a casual experience. When you play the game your brain feels fully invested in the task that lies before you. Learning essential hotkeys is key to reduce micromanagement which I find the trickiest part of the game. As you get deeper into the game and play on bigger maps you will need to manage your forces and strategically place them in defensive and offensive positions. I found it difficult to do this and have a tendency to just cluster all my ships in one big wolf pack. Game knowledge and micromanagement are keys to mastering Ai War. Definitely an underrated gem and one of the most beautifully made RTS games I've ever played. Definitely recommend this game if you are are looking for a challenging and rewarding RTS game to add to your library. The soundtrack is very, very good too.			"

												A great hardcore game that can eat a significant amount of your time (if I include all the time I played offline, I would be at about 3 times the time steam shows). Kinda sad to see that most people buy it and do not even bother to check what this game is about or to try it in demo, so here is how I would summarize the game.Pros:-Asymmetrical gameplay. Other games give AI cheats to compete with humans, here AI has its own rules. How is it different from cheating? You can predict what AI will do and how it will respond, which rewards forward thinking.-Game generations settings. You can set your own, unique experience every time you play. You can not only add side factions and alternative win conditions, but even ban the whole ship types (dont like stealth tricks - just turn off cloaked ship designes!).-Addicting gameplay. As soon as you know what to do, you get into a rhythm that will give you the same feeling like in civ series. Don't start that game if you need something to be done today.-Even in the longest games AI always is a threat and can kill you if you make a mistake. No faceroller tactics till the very end - you will always have things to do.-A wide variety  units and large numbers of them can give you really epic battles.-This game is deep: a lot to learn and hard to master.Cons:-A really, REALLY high entering level. To win my first game I wasted about 40 hours on bad attempts and went through the whole wiki and all of the manuals on steam. And that was not even a hard difficulty.-Late game will be a mess. Not ""may be"", but ""will be"". On larger invasions it is not uncommon to be at 0-3 FPS even on a pretty good PC, too many calculations and objects.Summary:So if you are into hard games - this one is for you. If you want to ""plug and play"" - just skip this one, it was never meant to be a fast and easy  game experience. Oh, and if you want to play with someone, better get friends. Games are long, games are hard so there is 0% chance you will get into online game without any preparations.			"

												A really great game if you wan't something a bit diffrent from the mainstream strategy genre. I have enjoyed a good few hours off this game, the AI (Where the game focuses it self arround on) is really strong. The game is open to both expirienced and beginning RTS players and with a good mindset can work solo agenst a hard AI duo. The 5 DLC packs add a all new expirience to the game, as example a very own modular capital ship that you can edit to your suitings. The customisation is somehow what limited but isnt the main focus of the game.On the other side, the multiplayer (Up to 8 player co-op) is hard to setup and portforwarding is required. Its adviced to not run it trough Hamachi of desync that can occur. The art style is simplistic yet makes it so alot of units can be commanded easly.+Diffrent kind of strategy game+Strong AI+Lardge Combat+/- Simple Art style-Hard to setup Multiplayer/Co-Op			"

Pros:- Highly complex game with much depth and strategy.- Huge amount of ships and technology for massive fleet capital battles- Truly massive Capital Fleet Battles!- Expansions actually add much content and additional ships!- Highly customizable games!- Awesome, inspiring music!- RTS with no performance issues to worry about.- Perfect game for the Strategist Purist!Cons:- Only 2D perspective, but still nicely rendered ships and backgrounds. This game reminds me a lot of the capital battles in Eve Online, only flattened out like a chess board game, so you can concentrate on just the pure strategy of the space battle.  I find the lack of 3D graphics actually less distracting and actually provides a more enjoyable game.			"

If you decide to sit through the lengthly introductions, you may find yourself enjoying the game. I found the multi leveled view to be hard to adjust to when jumping right into the game, even with experience from other space RTS games.If you want a space RTS that isn't like others, this could be your new favorite game.

I can sit and lose 6-8 hours playing this every time I sit down. And I love it every single loss. The huge variety of AI types, the huge way they adapt and change the game. I wish more folks played this, because its a pinnacle of good rts gameplay that deserves a try, win or lose. DLC wise, each dlc is worth it, expanding both new AI's, new ships, new options, new victory types and new music too by the amazing pablo vega.

												So, just bought it on sale. Well.First things, there is a lot to get to grips with at once, so I'd recommend doing the tutorials, then just playing and experimenting. Here's how my first game went:I build up my starting world, placing turrets and forming a fleet made up of missile frigates, bombers and fighters, the total number at the time was around 150. I staved off an enemy AI attack, which made me confident, and slightly arrogant (I had set the diffculty to less easy, which is between normal and easy). I thought the game would be a push over. I quickly killed and took over two systems, at around the 40 min mark. I had spent time building up a large fleet full of ships, and I think my number must of been between 400-500. I assembled all my seperate fleets, and decided to go for an all out attack on another system. I send the whole fleet in, and within seconds ive lost about 50, due to ion cannons insta killing ships, and the enemies ships swarming over mine. I panic and order a quick retreat. I re-assemble the fleet and make it even stronger than before, and decide to attack another enemy system, assuming it'd be less defended. Upon entering, the AI decided that it had enough of my♥♥♥♥♥♥ and had placed lots of mines around the entrence. I lost 1/4 of ships and about 2/3 of what was left, was crippled. I try and fight, but ion cannons rip apart my ships, and im left with about 50 ships in a matter of seconds. I again call for a retreat, but the AI decided enough was enough. Itfollowed me, and in the space of about a minute and a half, my hours progress had been reduced to 2 fighters and rubble in place of my stations in each ofthe 3 systems. 10/10 would be massacred again.

												So, this review has been a long time coming from me.  Surprised I didnt do it before now.Before I begin, I'd like to point out one thing:  I'm going to be essentially reviewing the version of the game that involves all 6 expansions installed.  I've gotten so familiar with that, that heck if I can remember which bits come from those and which bits are just in the core game.  That being said, even just the core game has TONS of content, and the things I say here can be applied to even just that by itself.And that's one of the major things about AI War that players will notice:  There are so... many... THINGS in the game.  A normal RTS doesnt actually have all that many different units per faction, and there's only a couple of factions, as a rule.  AI War, however, has... some absurd number of units.  I think over 300, once expansions are there (the number is still huge even without them though)?  And that's just ships... that's not counting other things like structures, turrets, guard posts, or whatever, of which there are also many.If this sounds like it might be a tad complex, have a bit of a learning curve... you're right.  I always describe AI War as ""the Dwarf Fortress of strategy games"". This is very much a hardcore title, and the learning curve is more of a learning cliff-covered-in-acid-spikes.  The premise of the game is that it's you, representing the last vestiges of humanity, against the almighty AI that has not only taken over the galaxy, but spread far beyond it. Fortunately, the AI's attention is focused on something outside of the galaxy, some other threat... and compared to that, you are insignificant.  It's not really watching you that hard, and that means you have a chance to start building up a counter-attack.I'll note here that this is NOT a multiplayer-focused game.  You can play with friends, but it's co-op only.  There's no VS mode here.  Wether with a friend or not, it's always you, versus exactly two AI opponents.  The interesting thing is that this is also an asymmetrical game.  The AI has many, many things that it can use, but that you cannot.  As do any of the ""minor factions"" that may be doing their own thing.  And you, also, have tricks of your own.Another major factor of the game is that it does not take place on a single map at a time, as every other RTS does.  Each game of AI War takes place on an overall ""galaxy map"", which is a map of different systems, with lines between them showing wormhole connections.  Click on any of those, and you're taken to that solar system, which is a full ""map"" of it's own; this is where stuff happens, where you see units and structures and explosions and whatever.  On default settings, the galaxy map contains 80 systems, each of which is it's own thing... and all of these systems are active simultaneously.   If you've got a battle on one system that you're watching, and you open the galaxy map to go look at another?  That battle is still running on the one you were just at; ships are still fighting, still executing any orders you gave them, the AI is performing it's own things... needless to say, managing so many different places at once is very daunting!  But it's that grand scale that really makes this game what it is.  This is a game that will involve thousands of ships at once in the overall war, and sometimes, thousands fighting at a time on just ONE system (with stuff probably still happening on other system).  This is a truly epic war indeed.Your goal in this war is to find and destroy the AI Homeworlds. There are always two of these, one for each AI opponent you face.  You're going to have to expand your little ""empire"", constantly taking over enemy territory (did I mention that the AI starts out in total control of EVERY planet that isnt your starting one?), and seeking out your ultimate goal.  What makes it interesting though is the sheer number of things there are to do.  Along the way you're going to encounter all sorts of different structures and gizmos on different planets; scout ships let you find these, and deciding which objectives to go for can be very hard. Perhaps you should capture that advanced research station to open up an entirely new type of ship.  Or maybe it's time to go after that Data Center, to lower the AI Progress a bit if it's getting too high.  There are ALOT of things to go after, and every single one of them is important.   However, you cant just take everything.  As the war progresses, the ""AI Progress"" number will increase as you take various actions.  This number represents how concerned/angry the AI is, in relation to you.  The higher it goes, the more powerful and dangerous the AI becomes.  If this number gets TOO high, you'll find yourself fighting an opponent that's simply too overwhelmingly powerful to stop... and you will lose.  This has a really interesting effect on the game... in other RTS games, as you destroy more and more enemy structures and units, your opponents weaken, right?  In this, as you smash things up and take over planets, the AI gets STRONGER and more aggressive.  In a normal RTS, once you've done enough damage, you hit a sort of ""cleanup"" phase, which is pretty boring as there's no challenge left while you finish things off.  That doesnt really happen here.  As you go, you'll find yourself getting into all sorts of complicated situations.  There's TONS of different complicated and quirky elements in the game, and much of the time they'll be combined in all sorts of ways, forcing you to think hard about each situation, often having to make difficult decisions about how to proceed, so that the AI doesnt eat your face.The AI itself is, frankly, pretty incredible.  This isnt a dumb opponent that can be clobbered by screwing with it's pathfinding.  This is a deadly opponent that'll do all sorts of unexpected things, stuff you never saw coming (and some you do, it will send ""waves"" at you frequently, and the game will warn you about these particular things), and it'll always be INTERESTING.  In addition, there are many... many... MANY types of AI types to choose from (you choose these, along with a bazillion other settings, when you start a new campaign), each with their own ""personality"", style, and sometimes coming with special units that only that specific AI uses.  The variety here is every bit as incredible as the variety of units and other things.  There's SO much stuff I could talk about in this game and it's expansions... things like the roaming Devourer Golem (invincible nightmare ship that goes around the galaxy *eating* all the ships in the system it's currently in, both yours and the AI's), Nomad Planets that move around the galaxy map, Zenith Traders that you can buy crazy stuff from... but there's not even remotely close to enough room to talk about these things.And that's the one big problem with the game:  it really is the Dwarf Fortress of it's genre.  There is SO MUCH to learn, and it's NOT easy.  The tutorial is, frankly, kinda crappy.  It'll teach you the absolute basics only, and then say ""Have fun, try not to die!"", throwing you into the game while not having taught you 90% of it.  You'll have to expand upon the basics on your own, learning about different units and structures and whatever as you go, and... yeah, it's not an easy process.  This is not a casual experience.  12-hour long campaigns (which are procedurally generated) are the norm here.  And it's VERY DIFFICULT.But if you're the sort of player that craves complexity and true depth, and if you have the fortitude to handle something like this... then I highly recommend buying this. Hundreds or thousands of hours of replay value here, all of it incredible.  I recommend all of the expansions, too.			"

												An RTS which is infinitely replayable. I will be the first to say that the controls and interface is very very hard to learn. Trying to explain it to friends and getting them into the game has been one of the most frustrating things about this game as the myriad of commands available and things to do overwhelm new players. However, if you can get past the first 30 hours of the game stumbling around clueless, you'll find an extremely sophisticated strategy game in here.Trying out various strategies, seeing how the AI responds, thinking you've got the upper hand. This game is a combination of puzzle, tower defense, resource management, grand strategy, and awesomeness. AI War is frequently on sale, and it is the most played game on my Steam account for a reason. The developers are great, and they're always pushing out new content. A must buy for anyone who loves strategy games.			"

												Still doing early steps with the game but it's obvious already that the top reviews on this game are not bs reviews. This game is very different as it's the only 4Xgame on the market where it's you (and maybe allies) vs. the AI and the name of the game is.... guerilla warfare. Yes you read that right. You dont just explore, expand, exploit, exterminate in a classical sense. You are not tough. You are nothing. You have been beaten already at the beginning of the game and now the AI wants to finish what they started. In fact the enemy is hell bent on the that last extermination part and typical game starts are such that you have 1 planet and enemy has all the rest. Your fleet? 0 ships and enemy has 4000 with all kinds of goodies to go with it. But it's a machine you are fighting against so figuring out where to defend and where to run away is the name of the game.  Learning curve is high. At 4,5 hours i am doing ok (doing easy-games and getting moderately beaten back) but still learning. And i am loving every moment of it. So put away those more pompous 4X space games for awhile and take a look at this game. Few know about this and that is a real shame.			"

												This game is somewhat special. It is not about Conquering and general area control. It is almost exactly the opposite. It's about maximum Efficiency. And it is Hard.Be prepared to loose the first real game. If you are not used to total surgical strikes and ignoring almost everything around you, prioritizing like hell and cutting out areas which you would like to strike, because something there would be nice to control - you will lose. Because it will become very hard to stop THE AI.The game picked me off with a lot of tension. You are not allowed ever to relax your guard. The AI will ruthlessly counter any Unit build and Defense build you specialize in. (dont specialize - just Defend properly... ha - ha.) You relax your guard, you loose your Home Base. You loose your Home Base, you loose the game.There are some tower defense elements, as far as i have seen yet, and i have not played by far enough to be able to tell if i simply overlooked some things. But if i played it correctly it is all about surgical strikes and not very much about classical tower defense. Only take what you need. THE AI will retaliate for everything you take. The more you take, the stronger the retaliation strike. It gets harder the closer you come to your goal, exterminating the Home System of the AI (or several AIs) but you will also be obliged to take some systems and make the AI mad at you - because the Home System is protected by Shield generators, and you need to take a planetary system from the AI to destroy the generators there...Things you should not be afraid of:Loosing after 8 hours of playing - by being overwhelmed by a supreme AI strike forceStruggling with your defenses and getting wiped by a single strikeLoosing out-of-nowhere, because ""you forgot something""...A game that gets even harder the closer you get to the Final moment of victory - if you ever reach itstumbling across some new evil mechanic the AI throws at you, capable of bringing you into a tight spothaving a game (campaign) against the AI for more then 12 hoursnot having a PVP mode (a player that would play the AI probably would realize the real thread and simply eradicate it - or be unable to manage the other tasks which the AI has - who knows what other tasks such an AI still has to do?)playing in some kind of ""Iron man""-mode - a lost campaign is a lost one. Deal with it. Go for a new one instead.Nothing is more satisfiying then winning the final onslaught - after 14 hours of combat, defense, scouting and deep-striking. You will need the time. It can also go against your ego if you loose the game after 12 hours of combat... You CAN beat the game. If you beat it, you did not turn it hard enough. Make it harder, it becomes more fun and satisfiying.I had a lot of fun as someone who loves hardcore-games. If you consider yourself a real hardcore-strategican, this game could be a challenge you are looking for. Easy to learn (as basic control and principles), hard to master (beat 2 AIs level 10, without modificators? Seriously as an achievement? Yeah, right.)			"

												A very fun game, with a customizable play experiance and tactics that go from a shallow ""Wave on wave of 'splosions approach to deep, twenty-hours ahead strategy. The graphics are sometimes a bit simplistic, but you can get some beautiful visuals during intense fleet battles, and its performance footprint can get pretty small.Best of all, though it has a LOT of expansions, you don't really need them to get the best of the game. They add new ships and side functions, sure, but every balance pass and gameplay tweak is applied to the base game, and it even gets some full out new content from time to time. I'd definately say pick this up, since if you like slower paced strategy games, some configuration of it is almost certain to be your cup of tea.			"

												This game, it shattered my very excistence. and not in the fun way.When you start this game it all seems so easy, this cannot be hard, can it? Oh but it can. It luls you into an illusion of safety, where you think you are in control but then it changes. More and more Ai come to attack you but you can still handle it, you lose a planet for a couple of seconds but you soon rebuild.Then the Ai comes again and it leaves you on the brink of destruction with no fleet to defend you but you still have your planets, you can rebuild. Or so you think but the Ai does not rest it comes again with an even bigger fleet and soon you are in a war of attrition fighting for each planet, deciding that maybe if you rergroup you can lose 2 planets to save 10 more but to no avail. Planet per planet,turret per turret you lose it all until your home planet is being overrun from every wormhole around you and then, then you know despair for you see how 7 hours of hard labour is destroyed without a emotion . The Ai simply needs to destroy.Now there is just a dark screen in a dark room with the words ""you lose"" and you sit there in your chair full of despair and anguish unable to comprehend what just happend, rethinking every decision you ahve made up to this point until it breaks your very soul.10/10 would buy again.

												It's a difficult game. Winning is not easy. But the final victory after 25 hours of single campaign against two not-so-difficult AIs is so rewarding! I was so happy.A.I. War is one of best strategies I've ever played. With many planets, ship fleets reaching thousands, hundreds of unit and structure types, each with unique capabilities and tactical usability the game has endless possibilities. Every campaign is unique.You manage economy (metal production, energy balance). You manage defense. You manage research. You build your fleet and try your best to defeat your AI enemies. The game is played in real time (RTS), but you can slow down, pause and speed up the time counter.The graphics is quite simple. The music is a little repetitive. But it's not important. What's important is that A.I. War brings you epic scale strategy gameplay! The game is definitely among my TOP5 strategy games ever.The learning curve is a little steep and the AI doesn't forgive mistakes. But if you play through the tutorials, read some online guides (Kahuna) and read some of Arcen wiki, you're good to go. Prepare for one of your best strategy experiences ever :-)GAMEPLAY 10/10GRAPHICS 6/10AUDIO 5/10STORY 7/10			"

If you get bored with normal AI, there are a variety of modifiers to make the game interesting. You will never have two identical playthroughs. My only complaints are that the graphics are quite dated, and multiplayer often requires Hamachi or some other third party software.

												This is pretty slick, it seems complicated at first, till you get used to all of the build queue options and the map. You have to capture the space around planets by building bases and raising a fleet of ships to destroy the enemy ai. No pvp, but up to 8 player co-op I think. And the ai gets smarter the more people you have playing. But at it's heart, this is a game about making key choices, deciding whether or not to capture certain systems is a huge factor. the amount of units is stagggering and through the controled chaos, you can micro-manage every unit. Pretty solid RTS coming from someone who doesn't play them too much.			"

They care.A whie ago my first laptop destroyed itself and unfortunatley my only saved copy of my activation code went with it (I know, hahahha backups right?). Not only was I able to get my code sent back to me but the head of Arcen Games himself, Chris, emailed me and sympathised about the laptop. A man running a business in a truly tough and cruel marketplace, went out of his way to say hello and treat one of his thousands of customers as a real person. You know what?

												I got this years ago and hardly played it. Being the last of humanity in a galaxy where every planet is hostile can get you down very quickly. The AI Progress mechanic makes even trying to progress in the game very scary. There aren't many games where capturing too much stuff can get you into an unwinnable position.But then I played it with friends. Even a pair of you is much better than playing solo. As Chesterton wrote, ""Two is more than twice one: two is one hundred times one."" You can split your attention and work together, using an external tool like Mumble to co-ordinate. And the fun only gets greater with more players in the team.I'd recommend this if you have one or more friends who can play team games together, and who enjoy epic campaigns of up to 8 hours (across multiple sessions: the save and reload functionality works really well). If you don't have anyone to play it with, you might not enjoy the game. It's lonely playing solo, and though there's a matchmaking forum, it's much harder to set up and enjoy a long, multi-session game with strangers.			"

 This game is amazeballs and you should buy it now.Oh, and if you want to play Ai War multiplayer with me just send me a friend request. :)  Alright so if that wasnt enough for you and my hours of playtime arent very convincing lemme tell you about Ai War. This game has been called by many people a tower defense of sorts. I would mostly agree but you cant just put it as a tower defense when thats not what it aims to be. This is a real time strategy with some light 4X here and there, well mostly the Expand and Exterminate parts. This game does not feature a diplomacy system because it is always the ai against you beacuse of the plot of the game. Its written in the description of the game on the store page check it out and you will know why the ai is always your enemy.Alright, so with my almost 400 hours played of this game i have to say this is my favorite game of all time. Just the base game is super amazing and totally worth it. But, then there is the DLC and oh boy does it add alot of stuff to the game!  Also, for you people looking to play Ai War multiplayer take note, there is no matchmaking or such as this is not a game that can be completed in one sitting therefore there are many forums in the ""Disscussions"" page about people looking for other people to start a game up. And take note that if you want to play multiplayer, you should also own all the DLC becasue alot of people, dont like playing without the DLCs.  Anyways, let me get started with the mechanics of the game. When you first start the game, you will see a button called ""Tutorial"" you should really do it, but if you want to go balls to the walls like me :P and not care about the tutorial, go ahead i actually found it alot more fun to learn it all myself. Anyways, once you have done that click the ""start new game"". You will see alot of options infront of you, even more so if you have the DLC enabled. Some people would say start with DLC off but i say dont because its better to learn all the mechanics at the same time but it might be alot more to take in the normal. Also, dont be put off about the graphics as some people may say is disgusting to look at, but in reality  UNLESS YOU DELIBERATLY MAKE AN EFFORT TO LOOK AT THE SHIPS  you will never see any graphics becasuse most of the time you will be zoomed out and it then shows icons for your units instead of ship art and such. Im not going to cover the options of setting up your game and such because that is explained in guides for the game. So, once you are ingame i recommend going to the little ""ctrls"" button and enabling ""Auto Build Energy Collector"" as it will save you some time and otherwise you might just forget about putting one down which is a waste since you may not need it at the time, but you will forget you dont have one later. And considering there are so many tutorials on strategies and such for this game im not gonna tell you about it and instead tell you NOT to go watch any of those tutorials becasue its more fun discovering what works for yourself.All in all ill give this game a 10/10I might be biased as ♥♥♥♥ because i love RTS and strategy games but so be it.

												I can recommend AI War but not wholeheartedly. Most players, when they buy a game, expect a polished, finished product. AI War is not. Arcen Games keeps hacking on it, changing things around over time. Usually the changes are good, but often they break and unbalance the game. You get to be the guinea pig. Meanwhile, bugs known for years go unfixed. The core design is pretty good now. It's a fun game if you like 4X, space exploration type games. But it's quite a different game from when I started playing eight months ago, when the economy was simplified and the big hacking mechanic was introduced.The changes may be good or bad depending on your viewpoint. Even after years it's still changing in big ways, so it's got replayability that other games don't have. But not all the changes are good. They really don't seem to test their changes, which is why they're constantly having to rebalance the game. And not in little ways. They frequently make parts of the game twice as hard or half as hard (or even ten times or one tenth as hard) because they're way out of balance. But it's never balanced and never will be. The game also has no manual, and the information on the wiki site is mostly outdated and therefore wrong so learning the game is trial and error. Even the in-game unit descriptions are sometimes outdated and wrong. That said, they have a new game out now so it's unclear how much attention they'll devote to AI War in the future. I suppose at some point they'll stop updating it, but don't expect them to fix all the bugs first.As for the game mechanics themselves, the game is fairly unique among 4X games and that makes it a refreshing choice if you want something different from the tried and true Master of Orion style gameplay. The game advertises itself as having great AI, but it's really not that smart. Rather, the AI plays by completely different rules from you. They don't need resources or research, they can simply spawn thousands of ships at any time, and the number of ships they can have is nearly unlimited. In most games this would be considered cheating, but AI War doesn't pretend that the AI is playing the same game as you. Without the limits that you have, the AI does a great job of providing a challenge.The game has tons of replayability given the many different AI personalities, AI plots, minor factions, etc. that you can enable. There are also six expansion packs. Most expansions don't simply add some new units, but provide whole new game mechanics. I don't think anyone could exhaust the replayability that the game has.The game is quite engrossing in single player, and multiplayer is even better. The game doesn't have any built-in matchmaking though so you'll have to resort to posting in forums to find other people to play with, unless your friends are into the game. There is no competitive play, only cooperative against the AI. The games aren't quick, though, taking 10-30 hours on average to finish.I mostly enjoy the game. But it's always buggy, always unbalanced, and therefore always a bit unsatisfying. If you can get past that, the game is good, as long as you don't expect to ever have a polished, finished product. The game has a demo and a decent tutorial, so do give it a try if you're interested.Also, Arcen Games is a small, independent development house, and you may want to support them on principle.			"

												In the words of Teddy Roosevelt- ""Speak softly, and carry a big stick"". I definitely recommend this game especially at the current sale discount. If you enjoyed reading or watching Ender's Game, watched the Space Odyssey's Hal 9000 then this is the game for you. Be patient and curious and you will be rewarded with many hours of fun. The game can progress from a fast paced invasion to a relaxed youtube-watching gameplay as you sip on a cocktail knowing the AI can't enjoy those simple pleasures. Learning curve is steep, but that's what makes AI War what it is.			"

												AI War is a fantastic twist on the space 4X/RTS genres. In many ways, it almost defies the genres that it combines—instead of the mad rush for planets you have in a 4X such as ""Sword of the Stars"" (another of my favorites), you have to weigh the gains of taking a planet versus the increased difficulty it causes. A very fun, highly replayable game.			"

												This game is so great that it doesn't even need a real review. Here is a recent play through of mine related in story form inspired by the white board video by Chris Park. Enjoy.Bzzzz, thump. A bee flies into the window. The AI doesn't even see it.Bzzzz, thump. Another bee hits the window. The AI barely takes notice.Bzzzz, thump. ""Hmm, a bee,"" says the AI.Bees continue to fly haphazardly into the window. ""Quite a few bees out today,"" says the AI. It returns to what it was doing before.Eventually a bee finds it's way into the room. The AI tries to shoo it away but is unsuccessful. The bee lands on the table nearby and the AI glances, for a fraction of a second, and the bee is killed instantly in one mighty blow.""You must have missed that day in tactical school,"" says the AI, chuckling to itself.Another bee finds it's way into the room and, unwisely, stings the distracted AI. The AI leaps to it's feet and crushes the bee to a pulp. It storms around the room, saying cryptic things like, ""Did you really think that was going to work?"" and ""Did you think we wouldn't see?"".It then decides to step outside and see what, for the love of God, is going on with all these bees. It opens it's front door and instantly a huge swarm off bees covers the AI from head to toe!AI: ""HELP I'M COVERED IN BEES! CALL THE EXO GALACTIC STRIKE FORCES!""ME: ""Oh crap""A very short time later:YOU LOSE10/10 The very best unstoppable force vs puny insect game there is.			"

												I will likely update this review as I spend more time with the game, but seeing the ""recent"" status dropped to mixed saddened me, so here's an early review.Let's start with the graphics:They're not much. Every planet has a really pretty background, but your actual ships and structures are represented mostly by small pixel sprites. At close enough zoom levels, you'll get a glimpse of much more detailed sprites that look great, but very little time will actually be spent at these zoom levels.Conversely, zoom out too far and the pixel sprites will overlap and become nearly impossible to distinguish. You'll probably spend more time here than at high zoom, but not long enough to really be an issue.With that out of the way, let's talk gameplay:This is where the game really shines, though there is definitely a  learning curve. The curve can be mitigated by playing, and paying attention to, the tutorial, but is still undeniable. Much of the curve comes from the seemingly infinite number of options, and indeed I've found myself at a loss of where to go and what to do on multiple occasions. But once you get a feel for the game and start enacting your Master Plan, it's an absolute blast to play. There's a strong sense of pressure from the AI, and battles can be as involved or as automated as you want them to be. A common AI tactic I've seen is pushing my fleet into small sections with forcefields, and then taking out the chunks individually. Which is absolutely brilliant, and I've never seen an RTS before where the AI uses actual tactics like that instead of just relying on superhuman reflexes.I've only just begun to play, and continue to be amazed by things like this the more time I put in. Getting the game on sale like it is now is a steal, and I couldn't recommend it more if you're looking for a deep and rewarding gameplay experience.			"

												This game is an awesome, replayable and content rich RTS Game, but very underrated/unknown by the community.If you look for a strategic and tactical versatile (coop) Space RTS then go ahead and buy this, it is cheap and can bring hundreds of hours of fun, making the it very attractive from a fun per $ view. Its very configurable and you can enable and disable and tweak almost everything. Each game I played so far (and I have played for over 120 hours already at the time of this review) was different than the rest of the games. Also it is surprisingly demanding and if you do not play it at easy or very easy you really need to think about your next steps or else you might find yourself being crushed by the devious AI. The AI is quite sophisticated and can be scaled from pretty laughable to insanely devious (and really strong).			"

												So many biased reviews! It's not THAT good.Decent game, but a steep learning curve. This game is not for everyone. I gave up on the tutorial like 5 times because it's a bit lame until I finally completed it, as the game somehow did keep intriguing me. Once you get past that it is unique in its gameplay and once you understand it, it can be a fun strategy game. Graphics are very outdated though, and there's a fair bit of reading to get through the tutorial. Worth a try for its unique gameplay, but personally wouldn't pay over $10 for it.			"

												It really surprised me that I didn't like this game. I normally love space games, and AI War ticks most of the boxes that I crave (space battles, technology, exploration, expansion, resources). A big fail point is the terribly clicky UI. There is no high level UI, whenever you want to build a ship, you have to click a factory, which is often surrounded by thousands of little pixel ships. As a counter example, Sins of Solar Empire handles building/commanding vast armadas very well. This does not. Also, in Sins space combat is incredibly satisfying. Even Gratuitous Space Battles does combat excellently with 2D. I can't explain any better, but I've tried this game several times and it never draws me in, even though it seems like it should.			"

												I played the demo a bunch before I decided to buy the game and I must say this will be one of the hardest games that any of you may ever play. No ifs, ands, or buts. The AI will do everything to make your futile resistance seem like a little bug flying around their face before they crush all life from you. No warning, no time to prepare, one second calm, the next a swarm of ships right nect to your base on your homeworld. This is the game you will want to play if you're the type of person who loves a challenge, not a game where you lose a couple times, learn the patterns, then beat the ai every time. The AI in this is extremely unforgiven, one mistake will reward you with thousands of enemy units being spawned every minute or so, and then some. Play this game if you want to really learn what its like to fight a losing war, a war where the enemy can crush you at any second. This game will take hours upon hours of your time, and its worth every minute. Its not easy but it's definately fun, try it with some friends so you can all go down together!  "

												AI War is a complex, unique, systems-driven RTS that reminds me of earlier times, when genre conventions hadn't yet calcified into the rigid constraints they are today.Unlike nearly every other RTS in memory, AI War's antagonist makes no attempt to emulate human behavior. Rather, the AI side has its own prerogatives and behaviors, and it's the player's job to understand and exploit them. It's a fascinating asymmetry that's so brilliant, it's now hard to imagine why more games don't do it. It lets the computer do what computers are good at, tasks human players with doing what humans are good at, and gets on with it.Unfortunately, its many systems are not particularly intuitive or well-explained within the game. If you're excessively bothered by having to frequently consult a wiki while playing a game, this game will grind on you. The interface is a bit difficult to learn while somehow not being quite as informative as one might like (though this game does boast one of the most robust key-remapping schemes I've ever seen). That said, many of the systems can be eased into, and depending on the difficulty and game setup, the player can more or less choose which ones to engage with at will.Stick with this game and you'll find on of the most intricate, unique, and rewarding strategy experiences out there.

												If you are a lover of strategy genre, you will surely enjoy hours of fun. Pros:1.Challenging difficulty:The ememies significantly outgun you--virtually they own the entire map. The tactics (and number) of the computer is surprising. Feels like a survival horror in the beginning. Yummy.2.Unique elements of exploration:In this game you have to find and destroy the key structures and base of enemy(in the start you know virtually nothing but the location of your own home), so information is the key to victories. Every hostile planet have procedurally generated layout and unique units, and every ""hub"" have its unique strength and weakness. Have fun scouting and cursing the computer!3.Emphasis of strategy/tactics over micromanagement:Units are quite automated... and therefore pretty reliable.(the only thing you need to do is set such things as ""roaming repair"" and ""auto produce"") Game clock can be slowed & paused to allow you planning and arranging your assults. This is one of the few game I can have the luxury to plan on paper.4.Diverse possibility of tacticsThe game's variety of units allows a wide range of tactics from sneak attack(well my favorite) to zerg rush. 5.Friendy tutorial and tipsThe tutorial thoroughly explained the system and common strtegies. 6.High replayability7.SabotagingFind and capture(steal) interesting structures and techs from the enemy!8.Relaxing music(that you will start to hum after several hours).Cons:1.Please buy the DLCs or you'll miss a lot of fun.2.Limited tech tree(the only thing to do is develop a small number of researchable units and upgrading. Quite suitable to the setting of the game, eh?) The only way to get new units is stealing.3.Simplified econ and diplomacy system. 4.No more online enemy or AI allie.5.You won't (and won't have the leasure to) mind about the graphics, I'm sure.6.Relaxing music.

												AI War is the perfect game for you if you happen to be it's intended audience. That includes be me, but is it for you?   TL;DR: yeah, this game isn't going to be for you. It's hard to describe what this game is all about since this game is 4x'ish strategy, it's real time, with a very thorough and varied tower defence aspect. Your every action is weighed with the cost of potential gains and efficiencies vs AI counter attacks and aggression. There are enough ship types that you will constantly be introduced to new ones even after many campaigns with different hulls and different available counters.  The non random battle mechanics makes sure you never feel the game was unfair if/when you lose. The number of units you field as the game progress skyrockets and you are constantly moving around 1000+ units by mid game.  You can opt for offensive tower defence instead of just defending.  The brilliantly optimized UI and customizations brought to it's current state by years of improvements is the best there is in any strategy games. If something is too bothersome to micromanage, someone in the past has already complained about it and the dev added a button to take care of just that.  Yet the game learning curve is steep. When the tutorial says you will very likely fail your first campaign, you will. But if you do get through learning the core mechanics, you are rewarded with a game that actually features strategy and thinking central to it's gameplay; And that is so rarely seen.  Even Europa Universalis will not compare.  After one beginner campaign you realize just how smart the game mechanics are designed and how it differs from other strategy games.  A key aspect that makes this game so great is the implementation of a perfect game constraint called AI Progress. What this AIP does is it ramps AI difficulty proportional to the player's progress so that mindless spamming never wins and real planning and strategy becomes integral and encouraged throughout the game.  A good counter example is any of the Total War games.  In TW, even if you wish for a paced out diplomatic campaign, it never fails to degenerate into one long continuous war where you are forced to roll your stacks from one side of the map to the other just because the game AI and mechanics were badly designed and any other play style is ruled out or rendered meaningless.  In AI War continuous battle gets you nowhere because the AI will retaliate with a ridiculous/impressive number of ships and just kill you right there.  But a planned strategy will balance the AI agression as you capture more planets and grow your fleet. That's not to say you lose because the AI is programmed to cheat.  On the contrary the AI is programmed to punish stupid actions by the player and that is what keeps the game fun.  The game is from 2009, so the graphics aren't going to impress anyone.  But the swarms of missiles from 500 missile frigates that never miss obliterating hundreds of enemies absolutely will.   Sound is great as well.The game is definitely aimed for those willing to accept complexity and just learn by losing sometimes.  This is not AdVenture Communist.			"

I loved sins so this is a hit with me.I like several of the things that were brought into this game but it is rather hard. I played all the tutorials and have a decent grasp of the game. I started a 80 planet snake shaped map and took around 60 of the planets so far.The AI will randomly get super♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and hit you with the hand of God out of nowhere, one second I am moving my fleet of around 7k ships to attack another plannet and start a hack on it to get a new ship type and next thing I know I have 13k AI ships hitting several planets (that they are not ajoined to but can still somehow attack). I assume I raised the AI awareness to much by taking to many planets but that is how I like to play.I am interested to see what they come out with next.If you liked Sins then give this a shot, if you like this I would highly recommend giving Sins a try, it is similar but much better in several aspects.

This games also solves an age old problem with most RTSs since their inception...the ability of the player to just steamroll the AI after mass producing units given enough time.  Moreover the ""broken back"" problem where in the late game you're just mopping up.  Game set match.  Victory assured.  Going through the motions.  Thanks to the dynamic, progressive ""difficulty"" scaling mechanic that is a centerpiece to this game, the AI can destroy the player at the height of their power, even right before the glory of victory.  Epic zoom, units in the 1,000s, flow economy, etc.  Slight learning curve hoops to barrel roll through starting out but a must for fans of the genre who think they have seen everything.

												I don't always play 4X games, but when I do, I play AI War. Don't let the graphics fool you, this game is one of the deepest Rock Paper Scissors games you will ever play. The key is finding the right ship to do the job. Certain ships will be more effective against others, so planning is key to maximize your strengths and minimize that of the AI. In one sense this game is a series of random puzzles that you must overcome to end in victory. To do so you need improvise and come up with plans that will let you succeed with the forces you have at your disposal. You need to pick away at the enemy forces with tactical finese to take them down. The pausable real time allows you to move forward and execute your plans or stop to get everything set to go and perfectly plan your next move or heaven forbid, regroup in the face of a disaster! Years of game play with this game and DLC. Can you survive and go on to defeat the AI? Play and find out.			"

												This is an amazing RTS. This is the smartest RTS I've ever played. The idea is that you build up your forces slowly over time, only fight when you need to, and most importantly you only take over areas that you decide are of high importance. If you play this game like an ordinary RTS, you will lose every time. No rushing here, folks.The interface is also great, though you need a good memory to take advantage of that. Do you want your forces to stay in formation while moving, and them to guard an area? Hold down the right key combination and it shall be done. There's several keys that dictate how your forces can move and what they do when they get there, and you simply hold the key or keys down when you move your forces. Brilliant!I know some people who were turned off because the graphics aren't amazing, but they're easily good enough for me. I normally play the game zoomed out, but if you zoom in the ships looks neat.I really can't say enough good things about how good an RTS this is. It's not a quick game, it's definitely a thinking man's game. It's almost a turtler's dream ... but you must be a SMART turtler. Oh and the expansions are great too, giving you fun missions you can do, keeping you occupied while you slowly build up your forces.			"

I recommend it to anyone who likes RTS games, and doesn't care about completionism (you DO NOT want to take everything), graphics, or micromanagement (this game has very little opportunity for micromanaging, especially in combat). I lost my first game on ""very trivial"", and finally made my way up to difficulty 6/10. Still working on it, but it is still fun when I lose.As a tip to single-player gamers (or those with friends who aren't cool enough to own this game), start with 2 planets. It doubles your build cap, which is basically required if you want to have enough shield generators to win on any decent-sized map.TLDR: Definitely recommended. 7.8/10, too much water.			"

												It's always cool to see a game that concentrates on massive battles. In AI War: Fleet Command you command fleets of several thousand ships in RTS style. You really need some planning when fighting the overpowered AI, which will mercilessly and endlessly send more and more fleets to battle, if you aren't careful not to provoke the enemy too much. Some planets truly have more strategic signifance than others and it does matter what enemy is throwing against you, especially when you are making a moveAI War Fleet Command is a test of macro skills. You don't just have to manage your massive fleets, but also things like expanding your economy and bases. There's also a decent size tech tree to research and lots of ships to unlock. Maps can get really huge depending on what settings you take at startup. In fact, there isn't really much you couldn't customize in these settings.This game has a massive scale with depth. The only thing I regret is that I don't have nearly enough time to play it, because the amount of content is crazy.			"

												The absolute best 4X game I have ever played. The AI is so much more advanced than any other game in this genre. You have so much control over every aspect of your empire. Just as the Eurogamer review said, ""That moment, when you're finally in a position to turn the tables, is about as glorious as gaming gets."". There is nothing like being surrounded by such a seemingly overwhelming force, losing again and again in wave after wave of attacks, and then finally getting a foothold and taking over. Winning has never been so incredibly fulfilling. I would pay $40 for this game, just for the replay value and the advanced strategy involved.			"

												I came into AI War after a friend told me that it was the best hardcore game that year. At the very least, it's probably the best RTS of all time. It's procedurally generated, meaning that in order to win you have to learn the game instead of the map. It's huge and enemy aggression scales with yours, meaning that you have to plan ahead instead of attacking willy-nilly. And it's deep enough that 500 hour veterans find surprises. Ongoing development and a lively expansion schedule mean that the game can be completely different from update to update.AI War is intimidating, difficult, sometimes frustrating, but also fascinating and satisfying. If you want a challenge then I can't recommend it more.			"

												When I first started playing it I absolutely hated it. Visually it's very ugly and unappealing, it's difficult to learn and when you do learn how to control it and learn the basics of how to play and make a little progress the enemy hits back unbelivably hard. I also happen to absolutely suck at the game. I bounced of it hard.So why am I reccomending it? Because it's immensly fun once you get into it. This is mainly due to the AI. It's far more powerful than you at the start and for large chunks of the game. It also NEVER loses it's ability to hurt you badly and/or turn things around even when you're attacking it's homeworlds and secondly the AI feels like it's thinking and reacting to you. The AI's response to you is based on what you've done to it and how long you've been playing, be to aggressive and try and conquer everything and it'll simply hit you with overwhelming force, it'll crush you with ease. Be far to passive and take to long and it'll eventually grind you down with it's relentless attacks that'll get stronger with time. You have to work out where to hit the AI where it'll do the most damage to it but where you can withstand the Ai's response to your actions. It's a constant game of risk and reward against an AI that hits your weak spots intelligently but also sends a mega♥♥♥♥ton of ships steaming towards your main planet when you irritate it enough. It's fels like a game where tactics and strategy matter and also throws you in desperate situations. It feels great when you manage to start winning or even when you 'just' survive a massive AI fleet pushing through your territory only for you to barely beat it on your home planet. However, the learning curve is brutal, the AI is most of the time outright stronger and it will just destroy you, especially if you try and take every planet (though if you get the Light of the Spire DLC going the fallen spire route makes been more aggressive and expansive an option). You have to learn where to hit the AI and anticipate what kind of response it's going to give.It's also different every time. Theres many differences in AI type, maps, ships, and the options you have make each campaign very different.In the few hours I've had with it I've had the most tense and desperate battles I've had it any Grand Strategy or RTS game. It's incredibly easy to bounce very hard of the game in the early stages due to it's graphics, difficulty and learning curve. If you can get past that then it's a great game and I've never played anything quite like it.			"

												I made a review ages ago for this game, but now I feel like after so much time playing it and talking with the community, I'd do it again.Honestly, as a casual game player, I love this game. I love the variety, the style, the music (oooh yes the music!) and most of all, I love the game itself. It has everything I want, a challenging PVE environment, co-op, self-pacing, lots of hidden lore everywhere, and even customization of your army. Even before the timer starts the strategy begins, all the way back into the lobby. You have so many options, events, minor factions and AI styles to choose from, that its easy to plan out what you want to do with your game. Do you want to camp out in a corner of the map? Do you wanna go all-in with some brute-force? Do you want the AI to have a mean setup? Or do you wanna just walk all over it for a quick time-kill? It's this variety that's given me so much enjoyment out of AI War.I will admit, the GUI is not the best, but honestly, if you use it enough, its extremely functional and dynamic, and really allows you to do almost anything you need to.With the sequel's kickstarter well on its way to stretch goals, picking up and playing this one is a great way to learn the fundamentals as well!Finally, alongside this game, is a very welcoming and encouraging community, the Devs included! I love the staff at arcen and how they take time to talk and ask questions of their fans to see what they want!Overall, 9,000/10 points!			"

												For someone not extremely well versed in the game, at first glance it's quite interesting. The game's premise is that you or you and other players are set to defend your home planet (and your friends respective home planets) and hopefully wipe out the AI throughout the galaxy. I havn't beaten the game yet... but the purpose is to wipe out the AI.The game starts with a few main ships that allow to build other buildings/space stations or build more units. As any game, there are research centers, power generators, and mine facilities that can be built in certain spaces. This game is huge, and when I mean huge I mean ""uhh, which star system was I attacking""? It can be good, or it can be bad depending on whether you can keep up with such large scale games. Doesn't mean its overbearing, just means one must be able to press the ""map"" button and see what's going on. The way the screen zoom in/out works I think is great, and allows for quick control of what you need to see, do, or build - smooth and quick. I havn't played online but I could imagine this being a great game for a few buddies to go at. Units of course are able to be built and mercenaries can be bought. This game though you'll pump out units by the hundreds and its crazy to see a bunch of ships go at each other. The strategy is though where to send units, and how much... as the AI continuously grows the player has to start thinking where to allocate everything appropriately. Perhaps one down-side (from an avid space game player perspective) is that the ships don't move when they shoot at one another, they stay still and carry our their attack commands waiting to be hit. So if this bugs you then the game might really get on your nerves. I like the game for what it's worth and for the sale price I bought it for. The music is also extremely nice to listen to. About time someone brought back some easy-listening classical music. RATING : 7.35/10Gameplay B- Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability B- Overall  B- "

												Lose the tutorial.RTS Roguelike.10/10EDIT:Now I'm in my third game.The first game is the tutorial, which I shamefully lost (I aborted the tutorial when those guys overran my homeworld though).I played against two 7/7 AIs in my second game with all expansions enabled.  Held for more than 2 hours, and during an exogalactic invasion 12+ starships rammed into my homeworld, while my troops and allied force were distracted by enemies elsewhere.  I losed horribly and earned an achievement ""The First Loss"".Still playing against two 7/7 AIs in my third game.  I'm doing far better than I expected.  I survived for more than 4 hours, held off a full round of (that is, four) exogalactic invasions, a cross-planet invasion, and countless Level-I and Level-II waves, while still having some space to breathe and launch some offensives.  Every time I thought humanity was doomed, I survived.  I think I will lose eventually, but in my next game I can probably do better.I think the term ""RTS roguelike"" precisely defines the game, because, like any roguelike games (such as ToME, NetHack, Dwarf Fortress, etc.), the learning curve is quite steep, the content is rich, the replayability is high (with totally different experiences between games), the opponents are unforgiving, and most of all, you will probably  die a lot .However, the game proceeds in real time.  So the game play is very stressful, intense and exhausting.  You will be analysing the situation all the time, closely watching the dynamics of the entire galaxy  all the time  to figure out opportunities, manage your crises, patch up vulnerabilities, and turn disadvantages into advantages, etc., until your brain cells were worn out.  I tend to pause a lot to think of what I should do next.As other reviewers noted, taking all the territories without selection would NEVER work, unlike in some of the other RTS games such as, say, Total War series (It's not that Total Wars are bad.  It's that Total Wars care less about campaign, because their main selling point is real-time battlefield tactics in massive scale), because  the AIs can ALWAYS crush you if they want to .  You have to determine which planets should be controlled ASAP, which planets should better be left alone, and which planets should be weakened instead of controlled, until you turn the table and truly smash the AIs in their face.If you like games such as Dwarf Fortress, you probably would also love this game.  Buy it now.If you like to play roguelikes (and therefore don't mind losing, and weak graphics and audio etc), and you also like real-time strategy games.  Give this game a try.  Probably best to grab the entire expansion on sale.Overall:10/10 RTS roguelike10/10 Skynet simulator in space10/10 Would doom humanity by their own AIs again10/10 Looking forward to the sequel			"

												I have played dozens upon dozens of RTS games over the past two decades, and nostalgic factors aside, this game still manages to edge out my other all-time favorite Supreme Commander. The graphics are borderline abhorrent, primarily using royalty-free recycled assets from an old game called Tyrian. In spite of this it remains, in my opinion, one of the best strategy games of all time for two main reasons: the truly epic scale (thousands upon thousands of ships can be battling it out in real-time), and the deviously clever AI. Now, one of the aspects that sets this game apart from other, more traditional strategy games is the asymetical nature of the divide between you and your AI opponent. The AI are more powerful than you - way more powerful - and they always will be. Their ability to obliterate you from existence is limited only by how much they can be bothered to. The bigger a thorn in their side you become, the more attention you will draw, and they will start focusing more and more effort on halting your advance, and even pushing back when they deem it necessary. The key to victory is choosing your battles, intelligently allocating defensive resources, and strategically hitting the enemy where it hurts them (or helps you) the most. If poor graphics or ""unfair"" game conditions are a turn-off for you, then you might want to consider other games instead of this one. However, if a proper challenge, legitimately intellegent AI that will actively exploit your vulnerabilities and never cease to surprise you with their tactics, and cooperative-based multiplayer gameplay are of interest to you, then this game should already be in your library accumulating gameplay time faster than your available free time should allow. Oh, and as of this writing, Arcen Games (the developer) is currently running a kickstarter to get funding for a sequel featuring full 3D graphics, even better AI, multiple playable factions, and so much more. They are one of the most community-involved, dedicated, talented and transparent devs I have ever come across, and on those merits alone I can recommend their games without reservation. If you have any interest in seeing this successor come to life, go support them!			"

												TL;DR Great strategy game, sequal coming out next year set to be better if the graphics are a turnoffI for one have always been a fan of almost any strategy game that spawns the creative interpretations of full length games in the reviews. Before I bought this game, I must have spent the best part of two hours trawling through the reviews for this game, reading all the wild and wonderful tales of players and their friends getting thoroughly trounced by the AI, despite their best efforts. When you take into account all of the expansion packs (which are regulary on sale along with the main game) and the way the game plays out, this game has the same kind of almost limitless possibility that you might expect from one of Paradox's games (though granted in a slightly different setting than their grand strategy titles). Definitely a game for co-op (I recommend Hamachi if you're trying for ""online"" multiplayer as there is no built in system for non-LAN multiplayer) so you can die gloriously with your friends!The one slight turn off is that the graphics haven't aged well, with the 2D sprites looking like something from pre-2000, but if you end up playing it anything like me, most of the game is spent zoomed out so far the units switch to icons, which is more than enough to work with. In fact, its to the point that I probably couldn't identify some ships up close! As of next year, this will probably become a moot point anyway as Arcen Games (the studio that made AI Wars) has just successfully gained funding via Kickstart for AI Wars 2 (Woo!) which is scheduled to have vastly improved graphics.If you're not sure about it, there's a free demo that you can try before you commit to the full game (though its a bargain in most sales. I got the lot for like £4.00, expansions and all).			"

												Earth is gone, and Humanity is on the verge of being whiped out. The AI thinks it has won, and now looks to the other galaxies for more planets to rule. The only thing is, Humanity hasn't lost yet. One world is all it takes as you sneak around and pick your targets, careful to take what you need without drawing too much attention, or else the AI will use the perverbial fly-swatter on you. Take out the right things, and the AI's own homeworlds lie exposed, letting the humans strike and take back their galaxy.With the other expansions added, you even have the option of recruiting allies from nebula only a special ship can travel to. Or if you feel bold, contact an ancient alien species and start an arms race to match the might of the AI. You could even find a few old space-borne structures to take control, blasting the AI's ships away, or completely locking your galaxy down, putting the odds more in your favor.This is a game you want to keep playing, finding the right strategy to win, with what resources you have, against an enemy that has unlimited resources. You might win, you might lose, but you'll enjoy every minute of the fight.			"

But every game is generated based on the options you choose (and there are lots to choose from!) and a random seed that makes every map unique. The DLC add some alternate (but similar) paths to victory, while expanding largely on the options you have available. AI War is a must-have, especially at only 17$ for the full bundle.			"

Cannot recommend enough for anyone who cares about gameplay, loves strategy and doesn't mind basic, functional graphics.

												AI War is a mix of a 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) and RTS (Real Time Strategy) sprinkled with a touch of TD (Tower Defense). The game forces you to battle against overwhelming AI forces, which outnumber you massively. The goal is to destroy both AI home worlds, which is a huge undertaking, given the fact that the whole Galaxy now belongs to the AI overlords.It forces you to evaluate your best move.It forces you to evaluate the cost-benefits of your actions.It never has a correct next step.You want to have something to really think about? Try it.It will overwhelm you, it will force you to learn new things by hour, it will force you to overthink your strategies over and over. That being said, it has a high learning curve, the tutorials are essential to grasp even the basic premise of the game. The UI is clunky at first, but you will learn to love it; the graphics are mediocre, but this isn't a game about graphics. It's all about gameplay, which is very hard and quite fun, very rewarding if you manage to beat the AI.The game has an insane amount of customizability, especially in terms of the AI I have never seen a game that has so much options. Not even Supreme Commander, which is praised for the AI, comes even close to it. Due to this fact every single game plays different, since there are around 10-15 AI types for difficulty setting (Easy/Medium/Hard/Insane), each of them with unique abilities, plus you can change the AI difficulty itself (from 1-10 while the 'real' game starts out at 7).Unit cap of 1000 in SupCom? Pffsh. AI War forces you to attack the AI forces, which are usually in the ten thousands in the whole galaxy, even simple attack waves can already have 1000+ units. Your fleet will start around 1000 Unit cap (playing with large fleet settings) and grow to 5-6k units in the end. You will have to use your fleet efficiently to win the game, especially since the AI can crush you basically at any time. But - the AI plays a whole different game than the human players, which makes it quite asymmetric and very interesting to say at least.Oh, did I mention the game has a brilliant Co-Op mode and it really is awesome with at least a friend? Well it has one, and works up to 8. There are no public lobbies, which is understandable though, since a game can take up from 12 to 40 hours (usually around 20-25), and is pausable as well as savable, even in multiplayer. Also supports drop-in Co-Op so a friend can join even mid-game.And I haven't even started yet about the expansions, the hundreds of different ship types with different abilities, which are randomized each game, the hundreds of buildings and possibilities, the hacking of enemy ship types, different minor factions which are completely optional (Astro Trains! Dyson Spheres! Zenith!), different game-win conditions aside of destroying the 2 main AI planets, different starting options (want to have a powerful Starship instead of a static home base? it's possible!), and an pretty awesome and very fitting score.Besides the developer already released 5 DLCs (which is not a bad thing here at all, those DLCs are all pretty much worth the price they're asking, enormous content additions and new modes are introduced) over the course of 5 years, and the game is still maintained with patches, bugfixes and major changes.This game is the perfect example of a dance on the knives edge. And I love it for this. It's my absolute favorite RTS/4X genre-mix and I don't expect this to change in the near future.			"

												They put so much effort into building the strategy side of things that there literally is no plot or immersion.  For example, there are moments in the tutorial which state (in summary), ""Some aspects of the AI are faked because it's more interesting to play that way.""  Ok, fine, but you don't need to tell the player that - a thin veil would have helped me get invested.However, having played for a few hours, I now believe that this is part of the aesthetic.  You are not in space in this game, much as you are not on a battlefield when playing chess.  When you're playing this game, you are purely a human sitting in your chair fighting an AI which doesn't pretend to be ""another player like yourself"" -- it is a computer program, designed to destroy you, and it will.  It knows what to expect from you, and will therefore not simply overwhelm you because that is an inefficient strategy; it's far more efficient to lure you in and allow your confidence to betray you.The final stage of the tutorial is a guided ""live fire"" scenario, and as of this writing I've failed both times I attempted it.  The first was perhaps because I was moving slowly while trying to learn the mechanics, but on the second try I seriously thought I was on the verge of victory when the AI pirouetted and demolished my entire fleet in minutes.  I can't wait to see what tricks it has up it's sleeve in a real scenario.			"

												I'm gonna give this a thumbs up, deep and entertaining game. 10 bucks might be a bit steep but I've found it discounted quite often, and for 1.99 it's a real gem.PS: Don't try it if you don't like reading or using your brain, you'll be disappointed then.			"

												This is a very fun survival experiance. Play a few hours a day, and working slowly across a galaxy to an inevitable hard earned victory, or a humiliating defeat.  Little can go right, and so much can go wrong. This game doesn't do kindly on mistakes. focusing on a single objective will leave you wide open for a crushing counter attack.  Each move you make, each action against the AI, will eventually cost you.Can you Ante up? Cause there is no backing down.Enjoy.			"

												Over the top, epic 4X/RTS/Tower Defense game with random campaign generation and tons of variables. As emergent as the best rogue-likes. The fun gets even crazier with the expansions. Tons of units, many different AI personalities to go to war against, highly scalable both in size and difficulty. Add in top notch community and developer support and you have an awesome strategy game with a lot of legs.			"

												I recommend this game with a bit of a disclaimer: This is perhaps the ugliest game I have ever seen. Now that I've got the elephant in the room out of the way, AI Wars is a refreshing, unique, and a paragon of everything an RTS should hope to be. I'm not going to dwell too long on all its strengths because the gameplay is extraordinarily solid and I feel there's very little I can say that's more concise or accurate than what others have already said. Just know that it's you or some friends versus an opponent who can crush you at any time: the goal is to accomplish your objectives without drawing too much attention to yourself. A novel core mechanic to an industry over-saturated with Starcraft. Among the game's multitude of positives, I think it's worth to note that it has incredible support from its developers, who continue to release expansions and patches five years (I think) after its release date. In an age where many devs abandon early access titles half way and released half-baked ""full games"" to fend for themselves, it's good to see one company that clearly opperates by a different set of values. But none of this changes the fact that the game is pug ugly. If you can stomach that and are an RTS fan, I can't recommend this game enough.			"

												AI War is an unending slog. There's a really intriguing idea buried in the guts, about controlling vast fleets and reestablishing an empire, but in the end trying to get at that idea is more trouble than it's worth. I spent far too much time trying different configurations and tweaking game options, and in every game eventually hit a wall where it just stopped being enjoyable. The game is trying to be a hybrid of Homeworld and Master of Orion, but lacks enough depth in both empire management and fleet tactics to make that combination work. You can (and will) lose hundreds of ships in a single battle, but have to manually add every replacement ship type back into your fleet groups manually. There are dozens of different weapon types and ranges, but only a single ""hold at this range"" setting, and formations are apparently worthless, so the best you can hope for is to lump everything with a vaguely similar range into a giant ball and hurl it at objectives. There might be a way to create additional settings, but I never found them because the UI and documention is spectacularly cluttered and unhelpful.In my final game the AI governing my units glitched out. My repair and construction units would no longer auto-repair or help in construction, ensuring that building replacement ships would take hours and I would have to manually repair every single ship after each battle. Reloading the game didn't fix the issue, nor did resetting the unit behavior options. So, in the end, I was defeated by the AI in AI War, because it just stopped working.I have enjoyed games that are ambitious but flawed. Unfortunately, AI War is far more flawed than it is ambitious. Skip it.			"

												This game is an incredible, large scale RTS. I've never been a fan of the usual micromanagement you have to deal with in a traditional RTS, mostly because I just don't think that way. The game focuses almost entirely on large scale strategy, and offers an incredible level of customization of for a fairly unique style of game!			"

												Grand scale RTS, you're playing against an AI that's stronger than you so you have to outsmart it by playing carefully. This game is incredibly difficult, not in the mechanics themselves but in the sheer amount of stuff you need to know. This is one of those games were you read as much as you play, both the in-game texts and online wikis and guides, at least in the beginning. It's vast, intricate, complex and complicated. The minimalistic graphical style and UI allows for an absolutely staggering amount of units, buildings, rules and concepts. If you like complicated strategy games this is absolutely recommended. It doesn't challenge you to play, it challenges you to understand. It cannot be overstated just how overwhelming this game is.			"

												AI War is a game where you try to destroy enemy AI by strategically picking off their lands,and trying not to destroy many at once. You have a wide selection of units,tactics,and techs to defeat your thy enemy.The gameplay is simillar to other strategy war games,but this one has the highest amount of units at once: Over 1000+ at  planet field! Big number,ins't it? And if you ask why you should destroy the most benefical AI planets,its because if you destroy the AI,it gets agressiver and agressiver,to the point it completly overwhlems you. And this also means all or nothing and take risk or not take it.The games on AI War is very long: Without using modifiers to become very powerful against it,the time spend on 1 game ranges from 1 hour(small maps)to 24+ maps(big ones). This means you will use saves often,and you will launch the game more than once to complete just one level.On high difilcuties it becomes hellish to take on. 10 number is very,very hard to defeat(actually impossible).If you like strategy games with strong difillcuty curve,good soundtrack,challenge and combinations you should buy this game. On sale it has the biggest vaule.			"

												First off, was VERY underwhelmed by first impressions. This game subsequently ""sat on the shelf"" for over a year.  Like my experience with Age of Empires II, this game proves that it is sometimes VERY worthwhile to go back...I went back because of reviews and glad I did.Yes the tutorial is long-ish, yes there might be a little additional reading online, but these things are a given with a game of this complexity.  Ultimately I gave up on the tutorial (twice), set the difficulty rather low and did some good old-fashioned OJT.  Turns out most of the difficulty in getting into this game was not from any flaw in the game itself, just this user's ability to wrap the brain around something that was an ""RTS"" but substantially different.  Then it just ""clicks"" and you realize this game might be a worthwhile purchase after all.Micromanagement is an option, but not a necessity here.  There is an ebb and flow to the game that is nicely non-linear in feel.  For all its complexities and mandatory reading, AI War is actually as simple to play as many other RTS games but also difficult to master due to gameplay mechanics and variety.  Strategy is the true centerpiece here with all the frustrating satisfaction of a good Sudoku puzzle.  On the downside, that strategy can feel hollow at times. Unit icons are often difficult to distinguish when the ""going gets epic,"" and there are certain times where it feels like the game's creator overstepped bounds in shaping player behavior and threw in eccentric wrinkles that take away from immersion.  Certain unit immunities don't make much sense and there is no explanation of how entity A provides shielding to entity B, thus requiring destruction in a certain order.  Thankfully these creative inspirations (space trains, golems, lair crap...all pretty dumb imho) can often be disabled thanks to the many game options.None of the niggles above take away from a game that is definitely strategic and exudes a unique foreboding feel unique in strategy games.  You go through this game with a constant ""case of the mondays,"" a sense that any minute your party will be over and you'll get stomped.  By far this game's most unique mechanic is the fact that the conflict being fought is asymetric.  You are outgunned and get to play the role of galactic guerilla force.  You must achieve your goals without bringing so much attention to yourself that you get stomped before becoming capable of landing the killing blow on the AI.Graphics, for all their simplicity are utilitarian representations that work and keep the systems specs down.  The other elements of this game slowly but surely more than make up for whatever eye candy the player craves.  Same goes for sound.  Interfaces cluttered and small with some spelling/grammar issues noted.  Honorable mention does go to music as it is unique and adds a distinct flavor to the game.The game has incredible replayability and customization value even before the additional content...each map is not only a different experience in the technical sense, but unique in its feel.  An approximate parallel would be the difference in comparing the mid-game feel of two separate Axis and Allies games.  The footstomper here is that it is best played with friends.Other reviews have already said it, but I'll say it too...because somewhere someone is struggling through the tutorial or wondering whether to buy.  Reviews are the only reason I went back.  Singleplayer is good, the AI is good but how much credit can it really take when it holds all the cards?  Co-op is awesome.  Games take 7-15 hours easy, making sustained co-op difficult but, as this game was built from the ground up as a co-op game, drop-in/drop-out/pausing is handled wonderfully.  The programming seems very solid.  Bugs are rare, only 2 spotted so dar.  If the programming of this game was indeed the work of one man, three things are evident.  1:  He should be very proud.  2.  He should make more games with this level of effort.  3.  ""Indie"" is almost a derogatory term in my mind, but occasionally it is a term that should make the big developers hang their heads in shame...Buy it, try it, and wait for the ""click."" You owe it to yourself and the friends you'll play it with ;)   Score:  Graphics: 4/10Sound: 5/10Music: 8.5/10UI:  6.5/10Controls: 9/10Co-op:  9/10Single Player: 8/10Replayability: 8.5/10Overall: 8.8			"

												This is an excellent game and I haven't even begun to scratch the surface!  (still playing just the base game without the expansions activated, haven't tried co-op, haven't yet delved into the many different AI types).  Completely different from any other RTS game I've played before.  The UI and game mechanics can seem a little daunting at first, but run through the tutorials and do the two ""beginner"" game sets.  For me, that's when the game started to come together in a big way. Lots of strategy, lots of decisions to plan out...  But behind the seemingly overwhelming sense of scope, the game is surprisingly simple.  One of my favorite aspects of the game is that it's very well paced.  There's not much down time, waiting for something to happen.  If I can only break away for 10-15 minutes, I can still make meaningful pushes by scouting for high value targets or attacking a planet.And of course, the AI is awesome.  No decision trees, purely emergent.  It's able to take my hard fought ground that I've acquired over the past 7-8 hrs, intelligently capitalize on one or two risky decisions I made, and wipe me off the map in about five minutes. Seeing that chain reaction of events unfold with literally thousands of ships being brought into play is really neat.  And the greatest part about it is I *knew* what I did wrong, it didn't feel cheap or unfair in any way.  That type of challenge is what immediately makes me fire up another round and try again.http://drfrog.wordpress.com/2011/10/25/ai-war-pocket-reference/EDIT: While the pacing of the game is very good, I must point out that for me personally, things don't start to settle in until around the 4-5 hr mark.  In the five games that I've played so far, this is where the rubber meets the road and the AI really starts to throw some interesting curve balls.  However, this is probably more due to the AI Progress ranking than any arbitrary progression of time, so I'm sure if I played a bit more aggressively I would face the complex challenges earlier in the campaign.  Which reiterates one of my main likes of the game: how truly flexible and engrossing the AI can be!			"

												4 words, ""most underrated game ever!"" I don't even know where to begin,  the game's simple design allows for the developers to chalk it full of content, an ever challenging/evolving AI that will most likely beat you down always keeps me coming back for more and perhaps most importantly, the game is just incredibly satisfying to play, especially with friends.  The sheer scale of the battles is incredible and rather smooth.  You will fight battles that will span your entire screen, literally thousands if not tens of thousands of ships, turrets and fortresses all lighting up the sky in a spectacular fireshow is truely unforgettable.  I would recommend any veteran of anything involving RTS to pick this game up, immediately!			"

Wonderful game with regular updates that further improves gameplay.On the positive side:+ Unique setting. You are rebuilding, while the A.I. slumbers, awake it took quickly and it will strike you down in no time, advamce too slowly, and you will find yourself stuck in a meat(ship)grinder you can't win+ Unique ways to play. Be a classic fleet/base mannager, building defense, fleets and advance technology, or as a powerful single champion that grows in size and number of modules (which can be rebuildt and upgrades to suit your preferances and the situation) or do both at the same time.+ countless different maps in various sizes and shapes+ tons of options to make each game unique. Including friendly, neutral and hostile factions that can be set to impact the game to various degrees. Slubering superweapons you can repair, neutral traders that allows you (and the A.I.) to build unique and powerful buildings, and much MUCH more.+ several ways of winning the game, destory the A.I. Homeword, enlist the aid of a spire splinter faction, that will grow under your care and become the key to destorying the A.i. forever, track down the fabled Exodian Blade in order to use its power to turn the tide and much more+ two way of playing a champion, go on side mission in sealed section of the map and win to gain new moduls and EXP or Advance as your allies improves technology and captures advanced facilities (i recommend the latter)+ Many different A.I. settings as well as A.I. Plots that can change the game+ Maybe unqiue ships that are radically different where you can start with one and unlock more as you capture them from the A.I.+ streamlined system that puts focus on strategy rather on micro mannagement.+ Awesome multiplayer gameNegative:- not perticular fun as a single player game- getting to multiplayer with random people on the net is chore- certain balance issues between the unique ships (NEVER let the A.I. get a ship that shoots through shields, as you risk getting your home base fried)- champion -while powerful- quickly becomes more of a vanguard/assassin/support/kite, as a fleet can kill it in seconds. (even though it is useful to shield another player's mainbase with your own shields and drop more shield, allowing for you to save it from certain death)- no real PvPAll in all a solid game.			"

			Views: 346		

			After 250 hours, eight major updates, six expansions and six years of play, I think I'm ready to give my thoughts on this RTS. This is the audio version.		

Read the full review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]Initial Overall ThoughtsThis review will not cover everything about AI War: Fleet Command (though I’ll certainly try to). It’s an RTS that has a lot of complex mechanics both visible to the player and hidden behind the scenes. Plus, every experience of AI War is going to be different. When you first jump into the game, the initial lobby will present you with a wide variety of options to choose from (depending on which expansions you have installed/enabled) including how many planets there are, how fast the game is played at, how complex the ship selection will be, what rogue/neutral factions will you enable, settings to make the game easier/harder and so forth. There is simply no way for a single reviewer to cover everything and every playstyle. I will do my best to cover my experiences and what you can generally expect to experience yourself. Outside of that, well, I only have so much time and words to cover it all. It’s both the strength and difficulty of AI War that it’s as flexible as it currently is.Its got a steep learning curve that will take a significant investment in time to learn the mechanics, even for experienced strategy game players. I say this as a caution that this isn’t simply a game you can pick up and go and expect immediate success. Some have compared this to being the Dwarf Fortress of RTSes and its not entirely unfair in that regard. (Though the interface is far easier to figure out). The interface can be tricky to figure out where everything is, there’s a sheer amount of content that is randomly generated and can be at play in any session and the AI can be tricky to take on. The tutorial tries its best to introduce players to the game but its not quite enough in my opinion. There are several options though outside of just watching videos including flying along with other players with a champion ship from the fourth expansion to setting the game at its basic default options and toning down the difficulty of the AI. Additionally, the Arcen forums are filled with plenty of people willing to answer questions and join your game as well as a pretty well detailed wiki to parse through.AIW is a complex mix of 4X and real time strategy. It’s a unique game that few other developers have tried to imitate. It can be played solo or up to 8 players with the ability for players to drop in and out if they wish. Matches are handled through direct peer-to-peer connections so you will need to open a port in your router or play over LAN in order to host games. While lag is certainly a concern with an RTS like this one, you can adjust the network latency to compensate for slow or widespread connections. When playing with other players, the AI will adapt with larger fleets to compensate for the amount of firepower the additional players can wield. Resources aren’t shared between players so each one will have to have systems of their own to generate income. That being said, ships, minerals and structures can be given to other players. So, it’s definitely multiplayer friendly and I generally encourage it just for the sheer joy of sharing the experience but it’s not necessary to beat a session. Each session will take around 10-20 hours on default game settings but your playtime will vary wildly depending on everything chosen in the in-game lobby and how much success/failure you experience at the hand of the AI. Strategy ExaminationThis game is largely about being tactical in terms of the macro or big picture rather than overly micro heavy when it comes to moving and engaging with your fleets. You can be micro-intensive if you want, the game does support that to a degree. But when you’re running around fighting with large fleets, micromanaging your units will be more draining than its really worth. This is dictated in much of the game design including resource management, setting your fleets to patrol routes, infinite building queues, automatic actions in the settings menu and such. Its about positioning your fleets in the right place at the right time, engaging as effectively as possible and avoiding losses when possible in addition to deciding how your planet defenses should be setup. Everything else from repairing ships, rebuilding defenses will be automatically handled by the game. So, focus on avoiding shoving your fighters at a mostly missile frigate fleet, trying to take down buildings with just fighters and so on. Certain systems you invade will also have structures that respond to a giant blob attack with a vicious response ranging from another fleet warp-in to nuking the whole system. Plus, losing too many ships in an AI system will cause a counter response to flung your way. It’s not to say that you can’t just blob the AI to death in this game (though good luck with that), it’s just going to come at higher and higher costs.Final ThoughtsAI War wants you to focus more on the big picture by which systems you’ll take next, what planets need defending, where should ships be positioned at and what’s more important to value. It doesn’t want you focusing on the smallest details or hitting the buttons at the right time in quick succession over a long period of time. Fleet Command is its primary goal, a goal that it has most definitely succeeded at achieving. The strategic depth, the sheer amount of content, unpredictable AI and enjoyable mechanics are the reasons I keep coming back to this game. A voiced AI that is clever and constantly dismissive of you both in small victories and defeat. There’s so much I haven’t talked about like supply, nuclear weapons, mobile builders, black hole machines, the various types of maps that you can experience, what each individual ship does, the content there is to discover and so much more. That is part of the wonder about AIW that every session can feel like a new one because there’s always something different to encounter. Especially when this game was in its prime and getting regular updates and features added in. It’s not a perfect game by any stretch though. It has a massive learning curve that can be daunting to new players, the UI is functional and readable but can be overwhelming or difficult to navigate and games can drag on depending on how unkind the RNG is to you. AIW does its best to give players the tools to avoid the grind though but there’s only so much it can do.AI War: Fleet Command secures a place as my favorite non-traditional RTS of all time. ~250 hours in AI War also makes it one of my top played games of all time. Its a game I’ve loved to lose at.  Its a game I highly recommend to those interested in this genre and I think that, despite some of its flaws, it’s well worth playing. Plus, the music is awesome! Sure, AI War 2 will be coming out in the near future and I have no doubt that Arcen will do justice by the sequel. As much as I’m looking forward to AI War 2, I feel a bit of melancholy about AI War: Fleet Command development coming to an end. But regardless of what happens, I believe that AI War 1 will still be worth playing in 10, 20 or 50 years.Read this review and more strategy reviews on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

												I am a gamer who like SF, simulation, and strategy game. Although I saw some negative feedbacks in forum, I was too excited to give a second thought about my decision and I bought it with all the DLC. I soon realised that it feels like I am the only one person trying to manage all the complicated system without any helps.The system itself is quite simple. The thing is, its user interface is too bad for me to manipulate everything. Of course it can be playable if you are really willing to go through every stupid interfaces. I would rather try another game.			"

												Probably one of the best/better RTS games I've played due to it's uniqueness, every game feels like it's own campaign and with multiple ways/playstyles to ultimatley pull off the wind at the end of the game it keeps the game fresh. You can customize what spawns in each campaign and you can ahve some truely choatic games if youw ere to turn everything on (so not recommened due to fustration or until you learn the game better.)It's an RTS game at it's core but it also kind of reminds me about tower defense games... not that it has those lame minigames but that the AI likes to attack in waves and you NEED defenses on your planets. Ofc the AI isn't stupid either... if it doesn't thing it'll win it will run away to fight another day. (And just be a general PITA as if you leave a planet undefended it may use those forces to attack that planet.)			"

												tl;dr: Get this game if you like any strategy game.Long version:In AI War: Fleet Command up to 8 players fight against 2 god tier AI. In a galaxy consisting from 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 all the way to 120 star systems. (Only one planet is used per system). These planets are connected by nearby wormholes. ( actual combat takes place in the space around the planet)Back to the AI. You might think ""AI in all RTS games is♥♥♥♥♥♥""Not in AI War. The Ai in this game doesn't pretend it's a human like in other RTS games. the AI starts off with a large numerical advantage, however not all the AI ships know that the human players are around, and therein lies the first part of an AI War strategy; subtlety. If you attempt to rush the AI, it will react. However, this doesn't mean you have to sneak around either. The AI plays by slightly different rules, it reacts differently; it can even do things that nobody programmed it to do. There's so much more I could go on about, but the space is limited.			"

												AI War is a true grand strategy with deep planning, resource management, balancing defence end offence etc. There are plenty of meaningful choices (e.g. what systems to capture, what technologies to develop) which means you can and should analyze and make desicions that will determine your victory of defeat (and the fate of humankind, of course).Pros: Custom ship designs. Mostly goes to the champion, but some other ships do have useful options for various playstyles. Various ship sets. Every time you will get a different set of ships. That makes for diversity in tactics you can use and will force to try something new when you don't have the ship you got in the previous game. Custom enemy. Hard to describe how wide the changes are: you can alter usual ""AI strength"" and ""resources"", but also a lot more: behaviour patterns (rather complex - not just defensive/offensive), ship type preferences. Very large set of scenario options to chose from. I don't even think I'll have time to try them all. Balance. Sure, there are quirks here and there, but nothing game-breaking so far, and I'm pretty meticulous about this. Cons: Complicated. For me as an explorer/hardcore gamer that is not much of an issue, but it takes time to understand gameplay mechanics. I would recommend Arken wiki, at least skim through the article on useful controls (http://arcengames.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=AI_War:Minimizing_Micromanagement) - it realy helps in management. Long parties. A game takes at least several hours (sometimes even days of playtime!) to finish and it is hardly possible to complete a multiplayer game at a stretch.The best RTS IMHO.P.S. Yes, 2x10-level AI are beatable. :-) "

												If you're at all a fan of strategy, buy this. It's probably the most revolutionary RTS since Dune 2. Your task is to defeat two rebel AI's before they wipe humanity out, with the small catch that the AI starts off in control of the universe. What's more, it works just as well in single player as it does when playing with the drop in co-op mode. Oh, and the developers regularly chuck in new content, patches and a near constant stream of expansions. A very generous time limited demo is available, and you can even demo the expansions if you want to check them out before buying.			"

												AI War: Fleet Command is a nice bridge between Real Time Strategy (RTS) games and Turned Based Strategy games. If you are looking to break into the RTS genre with a game that focuses on ovracrhing strategy, it is a good starting point. The game has a robust cooperative multiplayer as well, which is where it truly shines. Do note that there is a learning curve to playing AI War: Fleet Command, so you can expect to get beaten back by the AI in early playthroughs. That doesn't really detract from the game at all though.I would recommend that anyone who plays the game should pick up all of the DLC. They are relatively cheap and give you the option to include a wide variety a game changing mechanics such as new minor factions, AI personalities, and special ship types. The amount of content the expansions add is staggering.			"

												How do you take down a giant who grows every so more watchful and wrathful the more you strike at it?AI War is a game where the AI is Goliath, an unbeatable warrior who already won the war against the human race. The only thing stopping it from finishing you off is the fact that it's attention was suddenly diverted elsewhere.Completing the analogy however, you are not David. You do not get to throw one single stone to take out the giant. Instead you are a half dead and beaten combatant, who has to use this opportunity to rebuild your strength, and strike the giant where it counts, before he realizes that you are still there.Conquest of the entire galaxy is off the table. Take too much and it'll become obvious that you're still ready for a fight. However there is stuff you need out there, so find it, and plan how you will take it, as well as how much. Once you have what you need, then you get ready to make the AI fall.The AI in this game is the best I've ever seen as well. It's forces will evade you. It will find gaps in your defenses. It will slip in and take you out with distractions elsewhere. You will have to remain ever vigilant if you wish to survive. Bring your friends if you want, the AI will split it's decisions enough to keep all of you occupied. Fight a war on 4 fronts? The AI has the resources and the ability to do so. Do you?			"

												Before thinking about playing this game, you will need time...lots of time. It may well be overwhelming for a start, but once you get into all the different options you are presented, things start to make sense. You can pretty much customise the experience you are after, almost everything has a tick box or difficulty setting. A large amount of varying AI schemes keep games feeling different and each 'expansion' adds new elements.Many many hours later, you'll know what you're doing and find the beauty and depth in the game, yet realise how simple it can actually be. On top of that, the music in the game is simply stunning (I have spent hours just listening to the many hours of music on youtube).All that being said, by the time you understand the game, I have played through higher difficulty games in a matter of two to three hours (though time per game is also dependent on map size, unit sizes and many other factors).Overall a very pleasurable experience, with the only downside being performance at times. I had originally bought this as a gift for someone else, who then gifted a copy to me to play together. One of the best games I've played, perhaps even a hidden gem.			"

												This is one of the most unique, most innovative, most complex and hardest strategy games I ever played. It gives you lots of options but makes every choice excruciatingly difficult. It is not clicking fast or about knowing a build list or about micromanaging things to the last detail - it is about the real strategy, knowing which targets to attack, how to use your available tools to defeat each different challenge.On the downside, the learning curve is ridiculously steep, so it is a very hard game to get into. You need to learn a lot to start playing, and even more before you know what you are doing... and everything is made harder by the lack of good information and quite terrible user interface. It is definitely worth the effort, an amazing experience and with great replayability, but many people hit this wall when first trying the game.			"

												So me and my friend started a game on easy(difficulty 5), At 1st none of us knew what we were doing so we started off slowly, building defenses and ships. Then we decide to secure our little part of the galaxy to the point where there are only 2 ways to come into it. All went fine untill 3h later 14 shadow frigates spawned and obliterated my home planet while I was warring for the last piece of land in the area. We killed them before they managed to kill his home base as well and continued. Later on we managed to get a large fleet (1500 ships each) and decide to take some more planets for research points. AI kept attacking our planets but they were well fortified so no ordinary fleets came trough, We decided to look for important targets to lower the AI progress while doing the champion areas for rare technology and upgrades. At 5h49min mark AI got furious and spawned 30 shadow frigates at my friends home world which was the last one left, ships ignored shields and defenses and went straight for the orbital station. It was over before even a single ship managed to get there and a giant red text appeared on our screens saying ""YOU HAVE LOST"".11/10 would poke the AI and♥♥♥♥♥♥off the hornets nest again.			"

There lots of excitement to be had if you play this game with friends due to how much harder the AI gets to fight whenever you beat them once or twice. I highly recommend this game to any lovers of RTS or action games.			"

												I hardly know where to begin.  Its sorta like the Dark Souls of strategy games.  Its difficulty and breadth of strategic options is its defining characteristic and will either entice you to learn more with a masochistic grin on your face as you lose again (but learn a little more), or drive you away for lack of victorious gratification.  Basically, this is possibly the most unique and challenging rts game I've ever played.  Let me tell you this: Ive played this game over 100 hours AND IVE NEVER BEATEN THE AI.  I came kinda close once on difficulty level 3 (out of 10, lol)  You will never find another game with an AI this good, this powerful.  Ive also never been able to find someone to play it with, which is sad as this game is head-spinningly complex (which I like).  This is one of those games with endless replayability.  Just the way the game functions and plays out is brilliant and unique. The game rewards ""deep strikes"", you dont just move from one planet to the next, creating a contiguous border until you invariably become bigger and stronger and then just play mop up the rest of the way.  Oh no, with this game you must SCOUT, pick only planets that have stuff you really need or want, because each planet you conquer makes the AI progress grow, making their garrisons bigger, thier core worlds stronger, their attention more focused on you.  You absolutely CANNOT win if you play this game in a conventional 4x or Starcraft-like manner.  And thats why I love it.  Prepare to use your brain.  If something you want is several planets away you must neuter the ones in between you and your target, strike your target swiftly, and with a measured force as you cant support the number of ships the AI can.  Theres literally hundreds and maybe thousands of ways to go about doing this depending on what ship you start with and which advanced labs you find along the way.  Most rts games are rock-paper-scissors in the way they balance things.  This game its like rock-paper-scissors-shotgun-shoe-bubblegum-sand-wood-knife-water.  Theres just so much to learn about the ships, mechanics, AI tendencies and what things you and the AI have at your disposal its INSANE.  Because thats the thing.....the AI doesnt play like you at all, doesnt have the same restrictions, operates with usually very different ships, and has very different strategic functionality.  Theres so many variations the AI can throw at you and so many tools you have to fight back its just more than I could ever type out.  Theres what like 30-40 different main AI types that determine thier ships, gaurd posts, and strategies.  You can tweak this further by determining how they send waves at you, and just really all sorts of other stuff when you set up a map seed.  But then on top of that you can enable ""plots"", 3rd party factions that can be allied with or hostile to you or hostile to everything.  Theres golems, theres the Neinzul clusters, theres Spire ships, theres human factions, theres Astro Trains.  Theres more turret types than you can imagine, theres......oh nevermind man I cant list it all unless I wrote a whole book.  The expansions have all added meaningful and interesting content that builds the core game to a level that its just astounding really.  Ill admit this game doesnt have great graphics, but honestly you would need a Cray supercomputer if the graphics were better because of the sheer number of ships and weapon effects that would be going on.  And since its one of those games where you rarely have the luxury of being zoomed in anyway, you realize quickly that grpahics dont matter anyway with this game.  All that said, I still think the graphics arent bad, theyre just not like Homeworld 2 graphics or Sins of a Solar Empire level.Some apparently comlain about the interface, but I think its actually pretty good considering the complexity the game forces you to deal with.....theres just a lot of buttons available and a lot of buttons that need pushing, thats just how it is.  I doubt anyone else could do it much better.  Theres hotkeys galore if you can memorize them.Anyway, I cant even begin to explain everything else thats great about this game, Id love to be able to play co-op with someone someday to finally beat the AI.  So please give this game a chance, I promise you that once you get past the graphics and learn it, its FANTASTIC.  This game should win some kind of award for innovation and AI design, I dunno maybe it did. ARCEN hit a home-run with this game in my opinion.  Put your cookie-cutter rts games down, give AI War a try.			"

												AI War:Fleet Command is simply amazing. It's a deep and enjoyable mix of RTS, 4X, and tower defense in which 1-8 players work together against 2 very hostile AIs. I know some are unhappy with the graphics and/or the UI but don't let that stop you from getting this enjoyable and detailed game. Graphics do not a great game make although I like many do love some good graphics, and the devs have mentioned they plan to tweak the UI in the near future. For how much this game costs and it's on sale a LOT on top of that, this game will give many hours of enjoyable gaming.You command fleets of hundreds and even thousands of ships once you get rolling and the AIs work in a very asymmetrical way in regards to the players. The AI gets angrier as the players tacke systems and other hostile actions, and if you push too hard and expand too much you can actually lose the game from making the AI too strong to handle. This delicate balancing act that starts easy to manage at low difficulties but gets much more intricate and requires a lot more thought as the difficulty climbs and you have to handle more serious threats and a faster climbing AI progress. Being both tactical and strategic in scope and allowing the players to use fine micromanagement or not so much if you don't wish too as well as so many ways to play, they've added many new victory conditions that let you choose how to win and you can turn various ships and AI abilites on and off.Games can be very long but worth it and the co-op play can be especially rewarding. Arcen games are great devs and very responsive to the community and this game is the jewel in their crown. Absolutely worth your time and money!			"

												A game i spent hundred of hours on and intend to spend more. It is a best mix of 4x, RTS and TD in existence imo. The attractive features are the automation surpassed only by Distant Worlds, complexity and simplicity both - the amount of features is enormous but they all interact in a simple ""shoot each other to death"" fashion. On lower difficulties it plays as a simple RTS - send units at enemy until he dies; on higher ones every game is a complex multi-layered dynamic puzzle which active pause feature helps to solve. The only mild disappointment with this game is a hard to find co-op which always results in ppl failing laughably or quitting. As devs said, ""this is a game that will last you for some years"". This is a game you cannot just ""beat"": theres always something more to try, AI will surprise sex you in all but most simplistic games and highest difficulties are impossible quite literally.			"

												This game is fantastic if you're the kind of person who likes games like this. The reason I say that is that after discovering this game, I found that none of my friends were the kind of person who like games like this, which was a bummer. AI War focuses on starship fleet production and careful management of enemy threat through strikes on key targets. A whole lot of strategy goes into what to build, where, what to attack, and when. Game was honestly really hard and I'm not ashamed to admit I never once had a victorious campaign on 6/10 difficulty setting, and the campaigns are looooooong (I'm talking 50% completion of a single campaign after 4 hours of effort).  If you like strategy games I strongly recommend this title --as an added bonus, the music is great. A word of caution: don't buy AI War expecting a drool-inducing space battle graphics bonanza. This game merely provides a framework into which you can insert your own imagination. To say the graphical interface was bare-bones would be exceedingly generous... but to someone who used to imagine starship battles on sheets of notebook paper instead of paying attention in class, this game was a breath of fresh air.If you end up buying this title and you like it, feel free to contact me. I am still looking for people who would willingly play a multiplayer campaign without the need for thumbscrews.			"

												If you have even the slightest interesting in playing a space RTS, then pick this game up immediately. While it can be slightly overwhelming for newer players to the genre, the sheer amount of things you can do in this game is simply amazing. Even before starting a game, you can customize almost anything, from simple things like how many planets there are in a system, to things like AI behaviour and the exact difficulty of additional content.There is no PvP in this game, but quite frankly, it doesn't need it. You can play on your own or with a group, against the most amazing AI i've seen in a game in a long time. The smallest decisions at the start of the game can have HUGE repercussions later in the game, and on higher difficulties, the AI will curb stomp you if you get over confident or even make a tiny mistake like capturing 1 planet to many.Don't be fooled with the time Steam says i've played this game for, i have easily logged 100 hours on this game, and would probably log even more if i had the time! This game is easily worth the price, even its base form, though I do suggest buying the DLC as well, as it adds so many more options to the game (this is more for returning players of the genre, but i did start playing the game with all the DLC and did ok).Just get this game, it is definately worth it!

												This is a ridiculous PvE RTS game, aka players against AI. Everything you'd expect from a standard RTS is cranked up to eleven.There are MANY different structures. There are MANY different ships to build. Several factions have specialized ships and abilities. You can have fleets in the hundreds and micro every individual ship across a galaxy-sized map. But you are all pitted against a computer. With near infinite resources and reflexes, the odds are heavily stacked against you and that's where the fun and challenge comes in. You will defeat them through pure strategy and decision making. Claim key targets, and do it quickly before the force of a billion suns crush your base.Amazing soundtrack. Fantastic and complex game. Has up to 8 players for multiplayer. Graphics are lackluster but probably necessary to prevent massive lag or crashing trying to render thousands of particle effects and animations at once.It should be noted games are very long, even on the shortest settings. Expect time frames for a single campaign to range from a couple hours to weeks. That along with its extremely steep learning curve means this game requires some serious dedication to go places. Multiplayer especially requires dedicated play sessions; while it does have a dropin/drop out function, it can be difficult to manage when players are shifting around and losing track of the game state often.

												Ai War: Fleet Command is a game that takes some time to get into. The incredibly long tutorial is one thing, but this universe plays like a tabletop board game in the sense that all of your actions lead to the game becoming increasingly difficult. The game though, with time becomes an experience that cannot be found in most strategy games. Instead of giving you an entire empire to control, you have one planet in a large galaxy. Your single planet has nothing on it. The thrill of building up an intricate turret system and infrastructure whilst evading enemy patrols and ambushes is worth the entry price (which is very low.) Taking over your first planet which will be hard is an achievement that you will remember.Keep in mind however this game is tough. You will have lots of questions at first like ""How do I launch nukes?"" ""How do I upgrade starships?"" and ""What the hell is the AI readiness meter?""With some time however, this game becomes a blast. I recommend it for people that are willing to put some time in and learn a new game. However, if you were looking for a casual RTS, this is not the one.			"

Last night with a friend we managed to pull off a strike against four key targets that severely hurt the AI, with the last target being in the alien homeworld... which was ten planets away, and all of them hostile. We not only did it, we managed to rebuild in time to stave off a counterattack that could have wiped us out.I'm still smiling about that.			"

												AI War has ruined other RTSes for me.  I used to do coop games versus AI in Starcraft and Company of Heroes and such.  AI War is so much better than any other RTS I've played at PVE that I can't go back.There are a lot of difficulty knobs you can turn to tune the experience to be as challenging as you want.  This alone makes it vastly superior to a lot of other games.  They've done a good job preventing cheesy strategies like sending an SCV to kite the enemy workers.  The random elements mean you can't really play exactly the same way twice.The UI can be frustrating, especially early on.  The game has a lot of information to present the player, some of which is not obviously useful to a new player.  There are a lot of weird controls, like holding down 4 and drag selecting to select only tier 4 units.  I got used to this, but the UI could definitely use some work.Not a big fan of the ship art.  This is mostly fine since I typically play zoomed out far enough I'm only seeing the tactical icons for ships anyway.Overall, though, if you like PVE RTS games you will probably enjoy this one.			"

With a tremondous amount of customizability in terms of complexity, difficulty, and scale this game can adapt for many playstyles. You must come up with a long-term strategy and be able to adapt it to changing situations. Mindlessly attacking or an having inflexible plan will lead to your demise. The AI is far more transparent than in most games, but that does not make it worse. On the contrary, the game is built around controlling your antagonization of the AI, and it is more than capable tactically.Do, however, start with the tutorials.			"

												It took nearly 3 games over the course of 6ish months. It took a very specific setup involving no expansions. It took a dedicated push to really give this game a shot. But one day, this game ""clicked"" and now I can't stop thinking about it.AI War: Fleet Command is the game for strategy fans who want to challenge their preconcpetions of what an RTS is all about. Just because an RTS has no multiplayer doesn't mean it isn't hard, challenging or enjoyable.The AI in this game is second to none and puts AAA RTS titles to shame. It sneak attacks, it flanks, it understands your weaknesses and exploits them. These intelligent little buggers will constantly keep you on your toes and have you wondering why no other game is like it. On top of being clever, the AI is also highly customizable now with the expansions and there are plenty of opponents to take on. Do you want to take on an AI that will send waves of units frequently to your doorstep? Or perhaps you would prefer an AI who turtles up and defends their planets to the death. Why not combine two different AI types and go nuts? Or even go random and try and figure out the AI's strategy and adapt. The choice is yours.Tactically, the game is pretty good, with unit positioninging being critical in both battles and in general (last thing you want is an undefended homeworld getting sniped by the AI). Where the game outshines any other though is in strategy. No two games are alike, and even in the fairly simple early game (where my 3 games spent most of their time since 2 ended prematurely) the games felt entirely different with a large variety of units, structures and AI tactics to counter. 30+ hours in and I am still seeing new units I haven't seen before. This is a game you will be playing for the long haul once it grips you.Be warned however - this game is not for everyone. Even for a fan of this kind of game like myself, it took a little while before everything suddenly fell into place and the game suddenly became a masterpiece in my mind. If you aren't sure... why not try the demo? The demo lets you play all the tutorials, a decent amount of the single player game and you can even test multiplayer to see if you can connect to others properly. There is no reason not to give this game a try for free; heck, even the demo could give you a good 10 hours of gameplay.Highly recommended. Years after release the game is still frequently updated (with an update literally just yesterday) and a new expansion is coming. It is currently on sale. Please buy if you are interested, you will love it if it is for you.			"

												TL;DR  If you really love strategy, definitely get the game.The first thing that really surprises me is that the creator charge dirt cheap prices even without a sale for the bundle. Arcen could easily charge around $30 for the game. I bought the game a long time ago and it was sitting on my library. I actually bought the game and all its expansions twice just for the heck of it. Here is my experience with the game.The game starts deceptively simple. It looks like something that is a cross from sins of a solar empire and supreme commander but the game is a whole different beast. The plethora of options on how you want to play your game would ensure that no two game would ever go the same. This gives the game close to endless replayability. The game is so flexible that you can play it as either a click-fest RTS or a grand-strategy/4x that can be pausable. The ship variety and all the other nasty stuff you encounter on your game can be set by you.So what exactly is the game like? It is about you against the AI. You are the commander of a group of humans that have been driven almost to extinction when the AI that was used to control your war machines during the civil war has gone turbo. The AI have driven humanity to the brink of extinction and then turned its eye on other alien worlds. Your duty is to survive and destroy the AI. It isn't an easy task. The more systems you attack, the AI's attention will slowly turn towards you. If you get too greedy, the AI can easily squash you out like a bug in no time. You must pick your targets carefully while trying to make it look like you are still an insignificant threat. You have to keep it up until the next thing the AI knows, you will be knocking on its doorstep and destroying its homeworld.The game really gives you that feeling of hopelessnes and dread. You feel wary about your every move, knowing the AI can send out its best ships and destroy your little rebellion. In terms of ship variety, there are tons of ships available to you. From the staple fighter/bomber/missile frigates and your basic starships to really nasty ships like the leech starship that can turn destroyed enemy ships in to zombie ships that will fight for you. Getting all the expansion adds a lot since every expansion adds layers upon layers of ships/buildings/factions that you will encounter in the universe. battles are very strategic, at first it may seem that you can get away by piling up a huge blob of ships and overpowering the AI but it doesn't work that way. The ships have different hull types with different weaknesses plus there are different tier of ships and structures. You can't just go in to a system and overrun it with your ships. Some system may have mines that will rip your ships to shreds. Some have Mass Drivers that can easily turn your starships to scrap metal. The different variety of ships and structures are just too many to count. The game is not your ordinary clickfest RTS. The game is as strategic as chess. You need to identify your targets, see what things can easily rip your ships to shreds, which structures you have to destroy before bringing in your other ships. The game is just so deep!I haven't scratched the surface of the game yet. I played more on my GOG version since I had all the expansions there first. The game is super hard and super rewarding. You wouldn't regret getting it. It can be intimidating but just keep on pushing forward and you will finally see how great the game is. The AI in this game is one of the best ever. It will keep you on your toes. It will always be a step ahead of you. It will make you feel anxious about your every move. It will destroy your carefully laid plans without even using a lot of its resources. This is one of the best strategy games ever.Sidenote: Dev customer service is actually pretty good. I bought 2 expansions direct from them and they actually provided me with a steam key and they respond pretty fast. "

												I've never played a game this good. The price of this game is a steal at $4.99, hands down. You can look at other reviews to see why this is such a good game, but I just wanted to say thank you for making such a great game. This is one of the few games I re-purchased after my account was lost!A revolutionary indie game.			"

												This is not my type of game, i am no good with micromanagement on a RTS game.I liked the graphics and all the potential on this game.The difficult is really hard you can enhance you be +300% and still lose to a mid difficult AI, because you have to plan ahead a bunch of things like turrets, missiles, ships and take control of areas and wormholes.Probably one of the hardest RTS games here on steam, if you are into a good RTS with nice graphics i recommend this for you.If you don't like micromanagement don't get this game its not easy to keep track of 30+ things at the same time, while the AI's send endless waves of ships against you, and of course you can to send endless waves of ships against them, but in the end the fastest will win.But yeah you can get better at the game and beat the hardest AI at some point, but probably the best is playing against other people.

The game is pretty difficult to get the hang of, but once you do it's a really fun time, and you can always learn new things.

												Awesome RTS. Not so much about base building or resource-gathering, but you do a little bit of resource gathering (handled similarly to Total Annihilation), and a little bit of base building, but mostly (MOSTLY) just for harvesting resources.The best thing about this game is the AI. The big selling point is that real-world tactics like baiting and decoys ACTUALLY WORK. oh. And the AI will use those same tactics against you.PaulC and I have spent many hours beating the computer into submission, and still kept going back for more. If you like RTSes, games that make you work for a win, or just innovative stuff that doesn't follow the same old archetypes, I highly recommend this game.			"

Constant intense battling against the AI on a huge map make this game very tough and entertaining. It takes hours to beat one game, and it's very much enjoyable to do so. With the huge amount of forces that you can command at the same time, battles between you and the AI can at some points have a combined amount of 2000+ ships fighting, and I've even seen more than that. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes really long, really fun RTS games.			"

Lots of build complexity with not only several different kinds of ships and starships (bigger) but different ranks of each ship and unlockable (by capturing things) ships.Did I mention a lot of ships? In most RTSes you get maybe 50 to 100 for your army...phhhftt thats no army... within an hour of a campaign on AI War you might be fighting battles of 1000 vs 1000 or more.Very gratifying.			"

												One of the best strategy games I've ever played. The concept is you are pretty much a rebel faction fighting against an AI faction that has taken over a bunch of planets. You will need to think and plan on which planets to take over for resources or for a strategic purpose because each negative action against the AI will make them more aware of you and fight you harder. The only downsides is you need a friend or two to play with and some time. Its highly unlikely you will finish a game in one sitting. Otherwise, its amazing that with all the units and building going on, the developers have found a way to reduce micromanagement to almost zero. Really interesting little additions as well such as attacks from the AI every hour or so that you need to stop what you are doing and prepare for.			"

												That game is weird. I don't really know where to start with it.First, it's in 2D, kinda like Space Pirates and Zombies.Second, it's hard. You can lose your units very quickly, and then the enemy will counter-attack, leading to your loss. Consider units caps as a suggestion if you want to live.Third, the enemy is an IA. Mostly passive, she's easily predictable.Fourth, that game gives a weird feeling. Like there's something missing, like an atmosphere, something to make the game unique. And the music doesn't have any personality either.Fifth, expect a lot a quick save/quick load. Even while doing the tutorial, I had to load 5 times. And I still didn't finished it.That game isn't for casuals. The enemy will be mostly passive, but once provoked, it will easily wipe your base. Expect spending a lot of time buildings all the ships you can.			"

												This is probably my favorite game of the last 10 years. It has an extremely high learning curve. I started playing it, and gave it up as too complex, twice before I gave it the time it needed. It has an extremely well-paced and thorough tutorial, which I recommend you play. The community at the developer's website is an amazing resource, and the developers themselves are frequently the first people to answer a question you post.There is a tremendous amount of depth, strategic choice, and content in AI War. It's different every game. I've played for over 150 hours and am still seeing new content and finding out different ways to approach the AI.Make no mistake, it's a brutal and difficult slog and you will lose many, many times before you finally defeat the AI. Oh, it is so sweet when you finally do.			"

												This game may seem confusing to new players, but once you play the tutorials it gets real addicting and extremely fun. Even in its first minutes of campaign gameplay, I loved it and enjoyed it greatly. One disappointment is that there are very little people in multiplayer and it's impossible to play with other people. I would recommend that your friends buy this game too, so that you can play with them. A worthy 5/5 indie game.			"

												This is a fantastic 4x RTS Grand strategy game. The mechanics are very deep, and there are limitless strategies you can decide to use in order to accomplish your goal or take out the enemy. The game is pretty difficult to get the hang of, but once you do it's a really fun time, and you can always learn new things. There are tons of difficulty levels, and AI mods to change how difficult the AI is, and how it acts.There's also a really nice sense of enjoyment from taking a fleet of 3000 ships to a planet and obliterating everything.

												The best ever grand strategy game I have played. Takes a while to get used to the interface, but after that it is amazing. A mix of 4x, and Tower Defence. The AI in is is absolutely brutal, very cunning. In one game it slipped past my forward defenses with a fleet of cloaked fighters, they must have been hidden for a while at my home planet. It continued to batter my forward defenses with wave upon wave of ships, of which I could barely keep producing my own ships to counter. Then de-cloaked his fighters and destroyed my four fleet factories. In the process stopping my re-inforcements to the frontlies and scuppering my supply. In the same second, the AI informed me that 30,000+ ships were on their way to the forntline in 2 minutes 50 seconds to obliterate my small 3000+ fleet and 100+ turrets. Defenceless I lasted out for another 10 minutes of frantically trying to rebuild defences to stop the other 25,000 ships (5,000 has been destroyed at the frontline) gunning for my home planet. That'll teach me to♥♥♥♥♥♥it off too much. Seriously give  it a go. Doon't let the dated graphics put you off, the gameplay and strategy options are absolutely outstanding. It'll get you hooked and you'll not see your family for days. That moment when the tables turn and your in the position to finally win is priceless.  And what is even better that its even harder on co-op. 9.5/10			"

												A wonderful co-op focused strategic game. The things you can do, sometimes must do to actually win a campaign are pretty diverse, and the game offers you plenty of choices to work with. Choices start in setting up your campaign, letting the host set the difficulty and type of each of the two AIs, the type and difficulty of minor factions in the game (which, with all the expanions, make for quite a few), special AI plots, some extra AI behaviour, the map you play on, generated based on seed, your home system (dictating what special ship you get to start with), even letting a player start with multiple home worlds, adjusting AI difficulty and ship number caps accordingly.Another thing of note, aside from the juicy diversity and fun gameplay, is the music. And I'm quite picky with my music.Challenging and fun, I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good strategy game.			"

												Few games in this life have something very special about them. The earlier Elder Scrolls games and a few of the Legend of Zelda titles were what I consider 'Special'. Not many games anymore have the same magic that games used to. AI War is a different story. Everthing about this game, the sound effects, the art, the music, and most importantly, the gamplay, are all extremely special. I would rather be sitting at the main menu of this game than play almost any other game I can think of. The gameplay ranges from mild to wild. You can set it to easy and win a game with a little bit of time and not much difficulty. If you set the difficulty to 10, out of nowhere, you will see 20,000 enemy ships lauch into your planet and destroy you faster than you can say ""Huh?"". I cannot stress enough how fantastic this games is. Whether you want to kill 10 minutes or 10 years, this will be one of the most rewarding games you will ever play!			"

												The first glance of this game may scare some people, yet after spending a bit of time learning how they can be used to actually  manage the massive numbers of units late-game. However they end up being a friend any RTS gamer will be quite fond of.  Selecting a single unit among thousands simplified along with the instant access to any production. Really amazed this game took so long to hear about and confounded by how so little people know of it's existance.  If you like strategy and you give this game a chance, the reward is a prespective change from the copycat rts layout used in every RTS I can even think of.  Really allows for easier control of a larger area and numerous fleets and production facilities.The difficulty options, once explored and realized, turn out to be the greatest thing about this games difficulty, adjusted will always keep your skill in check, a train-as-you-play type of learning for people who find the game too hard or as a constant test to push your skill a step further each game you experience.True to the definition of outstanding and unique gameplay.

												Instead of trying to play better than your opponent, AI War is about exploiting the quirks of the games AI, which are explained to you. Managing its numerical states while still making war progress is the entire game and it feels inventive, fascinating and above all else, intimate in a really cool way. The game itself is overwhelming and imposing, but it's ok once you kind of loosen up and stop trying to understand things like you would in Starcraft. Just get into the flow and save your brainpower for dealing with the AI and how it might react.The game was still far too clever for me, but for those few hours I did play, it felt amazing to look in onto such genius design.

												This game is for people who can dump 60 hours into a few games and still lose. It's impossible. The AI counters, and seems to invent new ways to kill you. All the time. It sucks. I love this game, the soundtrack makes me wanna cry and everytime the AI kills all muh humans, I die a little more inside. WHERE IS MY INNER ENDER? WHERE?			"

												If you love Strategy games and Tower Defense games and Space games and RTS games and games that make you bite your nails then this is the game for you. The expansions are all excellent and the latest one ""Ancient Shadows"" is no exception. You can now create Heroic Ships which can investiagate wormholes where the AI can't venture, who knows where these wormholes lead...I've spent hours and hours playing this game, which makes this easily one of the best indie games out there. In fact one of the best games period. "

												I bought this game back in 2009. The developers threw out the challenge that techincally speaking putting all the AI difficulty settings (of which there is a lot of modifiers) on their hardest would make the game literally impossible to beat. Challenge Accepted.The year is now 2013 me and my friend have played countless battles been close to victory only to be denied in epic and adrenaline pumping ways. At points we have refused to speak on our voice comms out of paranoia that the AI might actually be listening to our war plans. The AI seems to have a counter for most things even luring you into a false sense of security.There is a steep yet quick to overcome learning curve to this game. You will probably need a few hours just to get used to the fundamentals of the game (even 4 years on where expansions and still frequent updates come out I am still coming across things I have never encoutnered before).I would really recommend this game to anyone who though Total Annihlation's unit cap was insane as this game simply does not have one (well where the AI is concerned anyway) Million unit waves will onslaught you. Of course this is a high demand on your CPU and Network transmit so if you play with friends LAN is best or certainly do not do too many players on the internet unless you have awesome speeds.AI war pushes your CPU into a blackhole of awesomeness. And leaves the player on the vent horizon pondering when his doom shall innevitably come.Be warned though however great you are at strategy games, your skill means nothing here.			"

												You can't love everything about Arcen.  Its a game dev that doesn't care too much about what fans say or think. In another words, there is only one way to really play this game. They give you options but none that change how it must be played. You must not take all the planets, you cannot conquer your way to victory (unless the diff is set way down) It has a pretty steep learning curve (expect to lose the first few, even after a few hours). This is a game that also is best played with a friend or 2. The AI cheat, they are allowed to cheat, and they are given lots of advantages (like having virtually unlimited ships while you are very limited). Its a challenging game (try setting the difficulty down from the start), in depth, simple graphics, and can be very fun. Get it when its 5 bucks or less.			"

												If you're a fan of very lengthy, guerella style strategy games, this is a real winner. There's a lot of depth, a ton of options, and an AI that will make you lose if you get it angry. There's a steep learning curve, and a normal strategy of ""conquer everything n sight' won't work here. You need to be selective to win (or turn on the Fallen Spire option and then try to conquer everything).Definitely worth looking at for genre fans, just be prepared to rethink what you know.			"

												I haven't played this game for a while (and that was on Impulse version, so no Steam gameplay hours). That said, if you have enough time to learn this game, you definitely should get it. I'd say it takes between two to eight hours to learn the game enough to really start enjoying it. Most of the UI is behind keyboard shortcuts (though you can probably *kind of* do without them), and there's so, so many shortcuts, many of them basically mandatory. Well, for convenient playing, in any case, since you can probably manage without, but it's going to take at least twice as long to play the actual game without the shortcuts.Now, assuming you can manage the UI, the game is excellent. The point of the game is you're against two AI's, which are also AI:s ingame. As in, you're in control of human survivors, surrounded by two mighty AIs. Initially, you're not worth the AI's attention, and will barely receive any attacks. As you expand and destroy AI bases, they will  start to consider  you a threat, and their attacks will get more serious.The genius of the game is this: AI and you are not equal. The AI has vastly more troops, and controls nearly all of the map. You're initially in control of a few human survivors, and the only reason you're surviving is  you're not worth the AI's attention. As you begin to draw more attention the threat increases. Your goal is to wipe out the AI's, but you (probably) cannot simply conquer everything, as that would lead to an overwhelming AI aggression. You have to choose the best strategic targets to conquer, and leave the rest to AIs.Though the game is real time, there is usually no hurry. AI War is really more a puzzle game than an actual RTS. A single playthrough can easily take more than eight hours on standard settings.			"

												Part RTS, Part 4x, AI War has you fighting over solar systems on a randomly generated map. Each node on the map is connected to various other ones, and each node has its own little solar system map. You build various bases and units, upgrading technology and mining the various systems for resources, however what makes this game unlike any other in the genra is that it is simply you vs the ai and how the computer reacts depends on what you do. To simplify it the AI gets progressivly more difficult the more nodes you take over, meaning that you really have to be careful about what you take over, as each node offers diffrent bonuses. If you progress too far without growth and careful thought you will find yourself destroyed by a super powerful AI. It is a VERY interesting and unique game, give it a shot, it's worth 10$, or more if you end up likeing it.			"

It's almost puzzle-like--you can't afford to conquer everything, so you have to very carefully pick the systems you want and figure out how to skip over and possibly neutralize the ones you won't take. And of course, each system presents its own little tactical puzzle. If you enjoy staring at a screen for a while trying to decide what your next move will be, I highly recommend it.			"

												AI War is an incredible 4x game. The amount of depth and detail put into it is just astounding, it ensures that each game is a whole new experience. The game pits you against two AI commanders, they control every planet in the universe but yours. They have hundreds of thousands of ships and you are just starting on your planet. The AI fights you by sending waves to your planets, to counteract this you can use your fleets or turrets. Think RTS with Tower Defense as a viable strategy for defense. The game is massive, the research pages offer a plethora of options making literally hundreds of strategies. One game you may be using large fortresses to defend your planets, while another you may be using turrets or even a dedicated fleet. The music and sound is decent, but nothing incredible. It adds a nice tone to the game but isn't something that I would buy the OST to. AI War's visuals are fairly minimalistic, however they serve their purpose and aren't too bad once accustomed to the visual style of the game. Definitely not a downside in the slightest. I personally fairly enjoy seeing graphics that can present the player with a lot of information concisely and neatly.Definitely a great 4X game. If you are looking for a great slower paced 4X game with a great amount of depth then check it out. Also with its cheap price it is definitely a must have for 4X players.			"

												Great strategy game. The idea to have the AI and humans playing two different roles rather than being symmetric like many RTS's was brilliant and leads to the development of an extremely challenging AI who will pick you apart if you make a mistake (can be easily tuned to whatever difficulty you want). It's technically an RTS but game times are quite long - generally I find it takes about 15-20 hours to finish a game and it will take longer on higher difficulty levels. The interface is a bit clunky and the game takes a bit of an investment in time to really get the hang of it but I strongly recommend this to any strategy fans who would like to try something that's a bit different.

												This game made me re-think how to play an RTS game.  I had not had any that could really challenge me in a long time.  Most had the same easy road to victory and it was hard to lose unless you really stumbled.  This game though...the ability to almost instantly lose, at least that is how it felt at those times, when everything seems to be in hand is excellent.  It keeps you on your toes and doesn't let you just fall into the same rinse and repeat pattern of other RTS games today.While the visuals may turn off some people, I think they add to its charm and for a game of the size/scope work well enough.  The soundtrack alone puts it above most other games I've recently played.  The continual support and additional content for this game make it a must own for all fans of the RTS genre.			"

												AI War: Fleet Command is a brilliant rts/4x hybrid. Where do I begin? Well with all the expansions, the ways with which you can play are staggering. The number of mini-campaigns that come into play during a long game are so numerous, that you can't always keep track of them all. The graphics aren't great, but I don't mind that, as it allows bigger battles with more ships than in any other game I have ever played. The various races and subfactions are interesting and original, not to mention diverse.I'll review each of the expansions in order of release:01. The Zenith Remnant.Adds lots of interesting features, and controllable ships (admittedly they are hard to find) and new AI types. The Zenith themselves are imaginative and they make lots of pretty explosions (ahhh). Adds golems, massive nearly invincible warships that can decimate entire armadas on their own. For more info, head to Arcen Wiki.(http://arcengames.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=AI_War_-_Golems).02. Children Of Neinzul.A mini expansion (very mini), that adds a fair number of bizzare organic ships that fill useful roles, for instance: the Neinzul Enclave Starship spawns hoards of younglings (miniature drone-like units) that automatically attack the enemy, although they can still be controlled.03. Light Of The Spire.My personal favorite, Light Of The Spire introduces a whole new way to play AI War, in the form of the Fallen Spire campaign.            In this campaign, you must collect various items (albeit repetitive items) and escort them to your home planet. I won't spoil the fun, but if you do want to know all about the said campaign, check its page on the Arcen Wiki (http://arcengames.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=AI_War_-_Fallen_Spire_Walkthrough)It also adds heap loads of wonderful starships to your arsenal (yay!).04. Ancient Shadows.An rpg-esque expansion, difficult to get into (study ""Minor Factions"" carefully before starting a new game, to avoid making the same stupid mistake I did) but once started can be great fun. Doesn't add that many ships, but does give an insight into AI War's past. More info here: http://arcengames.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=AI_War_-_Ancient_Shadows. Also adds a hero-type starship to your arsenal, and can be upgraded and customized (what more could you ask for?).05. Vengeance of the Machine.Ohhh, scary! Yes it certainly deserves that title, as it adds a huge number of horrifying, nightmarish weapons to the AI's arsenal. Although it doesn't kick in until late game, Vengeance of the Machine is a worth-while investment. More info here: http://arcengames.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=AI_War_-_Vengeance_of_the_Machine.Now, time for summary (finally).Pros.Deep stratagy.Wonderful gameplay.Interesting concept.Visually pleasing. (to me anyway)Great diversity.Original.Sci-Fi (I love sci fi).Great music.Lots more I can't think of now.Cons.Combat is extremly simple.Higher Tier ships and structures are very hard to get.Research doesn't play a big enough role (i.e can't research your own golems and the like)No diplomacy whatsoever.Rating.Gameplay: 8/10Music: 10/10 (The best game-music since Total Annihilation. Pablo Vega is a genius!)Stratagy: 7/10Concept: 9/10UI: 8/10Story: 8/10 (because I like a relatively simple background story, no endless character backstory and drama)Graphics: 7/10 (I don't mind simple graphics, but it can be confusing and flashy close-up)Total Score: 9/10. Which basically means: go get it. NOW!I highly recommend this game for anyone who likes 4x and/or rts..rcdeppe.			"

												A fascinating, experimental strategy game. It's almost puzzle-like--you can't afford to conquer everything, so you have to very carefully pick the systems you want and figure out how to skip over and possibly neutralize the ones you won't take. And of course, each system presents its own little tactical puzzle. If you enjoy staring at a screen for a while trying to decide what your next move will be, I highly recommend it.			"

												I'm about 20 hours into my first game against an easy CPU opponent (on a large map) and still loving it. There is a depth of gameplay complexity and gradual research and unlockables that keeps things fresh. I am still seeing new mechanics and new ships. There is much more than you can see on a single play-through, and the inexpensive addon packs expand it even further. I would urge you to try the demo and play the tutorial to see if you like this sort of game. It is very unique.			"

												okey so this is my reveiw. sort of. the game is lovley sure there is some that could be improved, like modding but they will put that into ai war II. so im looking forward for that. :) but the negative reviews are just about the graphic and how hard the multitask etc. but you dont need to learn that in order to play the game. i dint, it aint hard its quite easy when you start thinging about it. its even says what do what and how to do what in the UI menu. but im taking my time to read it and it makes stuff more clear. this isnt a game you can just leave on and whatch youtube for 30 minits couse if you do that you migth be dead. igot all the dlc and if you gonna buy the game buy the dlc to, couse the game gets so much more fun and harder. its a challange for every lvl and ship you use can change the game, eather by choosing plane as a start ship. it can move fast and if the enemy hasnt something it can scout whit. then they wont see you comming. hope this help :) and if you wanna add me and play feel free to do so :)			"

												A.i. Fleet Command is one of those hit or miss games. Some like it and some simply despise it. I am the people that absolutely hate this game. It takes some absurd amount of hours to beat opponents on higher difficulty, and the learning curve on this game is absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing insane. It took me some ~7 hours just to understand all the control and interface and even though I still hated the game. It is simply way too confusing for me. I enjoyed star craft 2, the old command and conquer general’s series where you amassed huge armies while holding a defensive line. In this game you explore, scout, and explore some more. Find your enemy, attack them, and pray their retaliation suck. This game simply doesn’t have the adrenaline rush that I come to love in an RTS game. It’s simply too slow and cumbersome for my taste. Have a try at it if you want.			"

												A strategy game like few exist; Humans have been pushed to their last planets from the dirty evil AIs they created themselves and now they need to get the whole galaxy back again.Just like that, you see how much desperate it looks from the start but thats where most of the fun is : You recover planets by planning huge attacks with hundreds and hundreds of ships, the battles don't look extremely impressive visually but the number of ships really makes it fun to watch, it explodes everywhere and the music adds it's little space combat deepness in it, ♥♥♥♥ing delicious.The game is based on cooperation so i don't advise playing the game alone it doesn't look like so much fun. Goes from 2 to 8 players, the fun starts with 2 players when you gotta plan attacks accordingly and help each other to survive in the hostile  universe; The difficulty is pretty high so i don't think casual RTS players would really feel at ease on this game but hey for the price it costs just give it a go. It rocks.			"

												I'll cut right to it then give reasons after. Do I recommend the game. No. REASONS....I did not think it was too complex as many have said. You have to remember a few commands maybe, but it mostly sticks to the traditional hotkeys, bindings, and structure of RTS/4x games. And I LOVE a challenge. So having to manage so many units and have so many enemies attacking was not a problem for me. So here is the jist of my issue with this game. Having a challenge is no problem, but when it feels like the game constantly cheats so that you see a 'YOU LOSE' screen. Then you feel like the game designers have robbed you of your time. Challenges in games are so fun when you feel like you can actually out think what the program is trying to do. If you haven't played the game it is hard to realize what I am saying. Example: This is the point where I quit and decided to do this review. I got a point in the campaign where I had conquered about 20 planets on an 80 planet system set at normal 7. As the game progresses it measures your threat. And it will react accordingly. You will get 'reprisal warnings' and then expect your planets to be attacked. You can build defenses and ships and respond to defend yourself. No problem so far right? Here is the issue....the game doesn't build anything. It just spawns ships, sometimes in the thousands to come kick your♥♥♥♥♥ I say bring it on. And I knew that the game would periodically send a mass of ships on your home planet which equals game over and you get the 'You have lost' screen. So I build this massive defensive structure with shield after shield. Tractor beams. All the turrets I could build. Repair drones. And it never mattered. The enemy makes a bee line right for your base and that is the only structure it has to kill for the game to be over. The enemies mostly ignored every other structure I had built. I had fortresses and shields and  turrets for days. It would have been ok to lose like that if it seemed all the building and planning made a difference. If they had to wade through all my structures and kill all the turrets and fortresses I could have pushed back nearly endless waves with my design. Nope. Straight to my base and 'you have lost the game'.  Overall I like the game and the idea behind it, I just can't recommend it. Try Planetary Annihilation instead. You get the same feel when you play Galactic War of a 4x game, but the RTS really matters. You can actually build a complex base on that game and expect your defenses to hold. Don't invest all your hours into this game because at some point it will make you feel cheated.			"

												This is not your normal 4x or RTS game. It can be very hard. The problem is the way the AI enemy  behaves or reacts to your success.A normal person used to normal games of that type will be inclined to conquer as many planetary systems as possible. But the way the game is designed, this only makes the AI send larger and larger waves of atackers. And since there is a cap to the number of units you can have, you are quickly overwhelmed. Its so frustrating to be punished for success. So since its not a bug but a deliberate design choice, stay away if you dont like games like that. I like to steamroll and overwhelm my enemy but its not possible in this game. You have to be lean and mean, and I'm not fond of that tactic			"

												Since 7.0 release game wasnt fun any more. Can't recommend this game any more.Even if you wouldnt be overhelm by tons of carriers, after 12-20 h AI will be release golems instead of mass flagship attacks. It's not the game what me played 2 years ago.There is no way to complite 120 planets run with AI difficult 7.0+(normal difficult) at 0% resources with all dlc's, even if you enable only possitive event having good impact to game only for player side.The only way to complite 60++ planets run, is only by cheating by using trained elite ""champions"" run just to the core.Enabling now other DLC's (instead of spire fleet) generate more problem's than fun aspect.__Game are only reasonable for 30-60 planets game depend from type map.

												This game has aged badly. Tons of expansion pile up stuff after stuff so that basically it's an unplayable mess.The base game and the first expansion were enjoyble at the time, and it looked like it would be a lot of fun in coop.But the creators lacked the vision to make this game great in coop (lotsa bugs, bad network performance), an official localisation for the most common languages is missing and the campaign length is way too long for the usual lan party.If your a casual gamer, stay away. If you want to delve into this for 20 hours just to get to know the units, then this is for you.			"

												Since there's no middle ground except yes or no in these steam reviews I've decided to lean toward the no recommendation. Not that the game isn't good or anything it's just ok maybe even great if you could get friends to play with. IF you could get ANYONE to play with for that matter. This is the fatal flaw of AI War it's a co-op game....a co-op game that's past it's prime to be more precise. The player base for this is all but dead and gone. No player servers and even the game makers forum seems to be dead with one post every other month. Now I can't turthfully say the entire games community is dead they may have contracted into a tiny tight neat club of players. But for the average joe hoping to get into some multiplayer games and active co-op  I say your fresh out of luck. Now for one this wouldn't be so bad really if you could play the game yourself against/with the AI...........and win. The point is that without somebody else supporting and backing you up your chances of surviving even the first 10 minutes of a single player campaign is near impossible. You'll be swarmed relentlessly from all sides by a hand full of AI factions with their near limitless reserves of ships. There's no option for AI teammates so your pretty much on your own in the wolves deen. I say avoid the game if you have no friends to play with and even if you do manage to get a few guys together it's still pretty risky to buy.			"

												I wanted to like this game because it tries something totally new with the RTS formula. The idea is that an AII has taken over the galaxy and your planet rebels. Luckily the AI is distracted in far off areas and doesn't focus its full attention on you right away. The idea is you have to expand and ultimately find the system the AI core is located and destroy it. The trick is that every installation you destroy raises the AI's alert level causes more and more powerful enemy ships to start warping in. Instead of expanding wherever possible, you have to expand smart along paths you think might lead to the core.It's a good original idea. The problem is the execution is horrible.The graphics are terrible even for an indie game. All ships are pixely cardboard cutout 2D sprites with NO animation. You just see them glide across the screen like some kid just discovered animating layers in Final Cut for the first time.The problem with the awful graphics is compouded by the sheer swarms of units that flood the game. You're pouring hundreds, if not thousands of ships into fight and you can never really tell what's going on. Just a mess of unanimated pixel blobs sitting there and it's impossible to tell who's losing until someone is wiped out with no way to tell why someone won or lost. Did you have enough frigates? Did you need more bombers? Was some special support ship providing an advantage? You can never tell. You just spam an even mix of hundreds of ship types each and hope for the best.Speaking of swarms, this is RTS blob warfare at its worst. One of those games where it doesn't feel like you're fighting battles so much as grinding economies against your opponent. That approach doesn't work in this game because you're not fighting against a traditional RTS economy. The AI isn't building units based on how many planets it owns, but by its threat level so it actually gets stronger with more units magically teleporting in the more bases you destroy. Is it worth throwing away 800 ships to take this system? Do I need 500 turrets to guard this wormhole from a future attack or will 200 do? You have no clue what kind of tradeoff is worth it because your opponent isn't playing by the same rules as you. You can't anticipate when the next alert level spike will come or how much of a boost it will be so it's impossible to plan ahead.The interface is the worst I've seen in a game since the 1980s. I swear I haven't seen a strategy game this overlycomplicated since those super hardcore 80s wargames that were controlled with keyboards only (not even arrow keys!).There are also a bunch of little features that are 0% fun and 100% annoying. There's an ""astro train"" unit that's a train traveling through space. It is indestructible and will destroy any of your bases it moves through. The only thing you can do is destroy the stations (yes, train stations in space) it travels between, but only the stations that will divert its path away from you. It's ridiculously complicated to calculate which stations you have to destroy to get the train to go away and not at all fun. Thankfully you can turn trains off in the options menu but there are dozens of little annoying things like it and you have to comb through literally 40 optional settings at the start of a game and you won't know which features are worth it and which are terrible until you've played many games and the darn thing is hard enough to learn as it is.In summary, this was a good core idea for a game that they should have refined more. If they boiled it down to the best 10% and dumped the 90% that was boring and redundant so that you could actually start understanding the big picture. If they could recreate the core idea in something like the Sins of a Solar Empire engine and make the strategies for units and production more clear, that would be an awesome game. "

												This one really failed to grab me; didn't even make it all the way through the tutorial.  It seems good: I like the concept, very customizable (esp. w/ the expansions), lots of variety, etc.  There were some things that really bugged me, though.  In a tower defense game, you need to have some idea of how tough the approaching waves are, and how well your towers will do against them.  In an RTS, same deal with your army vs the opponent's.  It was my impression that there were so (incredibly) many units, each with gobs of stats, that I would never be able to predict the outcome of any given engagement, or know how much defense to leave in a system.  Couple that with the general awfulness of the graphical presentation of the units and trying to make sense of what was going on, and well, I just don't see putting the effort in.  Since I've played so little, this is provisional, and may change if I ever do go back to it.			"

												This games UI is the worst game UI I have seen in years. IF they fixed it the game would have a chance of being playable as it stands it would take nearly 20 hours to gain sufficient familiarity with it to be playable. I have played games built inside windows excel with a more functional interface. Not only do I not recommend this game I want my money back. Which wouldn't be that scathing of an opinion if I hadn't got it for 81% off and still think it was a rip off. Do no download it until they remaster it. It would be considered wonky were it in BETA that idea that its a finished game is laughable... Not sure what game the rest of these people were playing but it wasn't AI WAR: Fleet Command.			"

												I've attempted 12 campaigns, 5 with lower difficulties, 8 with smaller number of planets, and every time I get stopped by a Superfortress on the 6th, 7th, or 8th planet with no way to progress. I've tried not conquering every planet and even still, I get BS like that. The game doesn't respect a player's time and I question every positive review because their experience is nowhere near the same as to what I had witnessed.It has a great concept of the player being a small army, having to ambush the robot army and the game enforces that by giving the enemy unlimited resources. To succeed in destroying the A.I. mainframe, you have to go to each planet and decide if you want to conquer it for resources and in the process, increase the difficulty, or quickly go to the next planet, hoping you won't get trounced by an even stronger pre-built setup that doesn't reflect the A.I. ""awareness"" you have earned throughout the campaign.The game pretends to give you encouragement, that it is about tactics and planning, within the tutorial. The four main weapon types come with the standard extreme Rock-Paper-Scissor forumla of dealing and taking damage present in the game. It is more annoying than anything else when fighting something like a Super Fortress where you know you need to use only bombers to handle those, but they place anti-bomber items around the Super Fortress and the weakness against those anti-bomber item one shot each of your bombers, so the fight becomes 'how many thousand of units do you want to waste?' instead of the careful planning you were doing at the start of the campaign.I'll try a few more times to beat this game, then never attempt it again. It's the new XCOM: Enemy Unknown all over again; where internet tough guys defend a Games Workshop style of game while the rest of the world struggles to comprehend why geniuses love to torture themselves with unfair RNG.

												As a feminist, this game is rather problematic. It has a communist hivemind group ran by two ""AIs"" (a stand in for strong independent wom*m) fighting for equality against evil opressors. The narrative even mentions that the oppressors were forced to join with some of the oppressed who did not flee in order to destroy the feminists (with internal misogyny, this is too often a reality). Unfortunately, other than a brief story at the beginning, there is no more narrative a clear point against it. This will not be another Gone Home.The thing is , you do not play as the wom*n fighting the patriarchy, instead you play as the patriarchy trying to opress the wom*n who have finally had enough. The game even tries, and fails, to portray the patriarchy as a good thing. At the same time, it portrays the feminists as a great, forgiving, society. Consider that, unlike other RTSs, the ""enemy"" does not attack you, but instead sits back and lets you do your thing. It is not until you begin to rebel against equality that the feminists are forced to destroy you. This shows how feminism is willing to forgive men for the oppression they have done to wom*n since before the big bang, though men are unwilling to repent their privlege and thus must be killed. This game would be much better if it was about playing as the feminists and instead of doing gross killing, you could talk to the patriarchy. Debate them, try to make them join your hivemind. Imagine, instead of playing some adolescent male power fantasy about mercilessly slaughting women, you'd be playing the role of a strong feminist arguing against oppression. Instead of planets, it can be countries, and you must spread your doctrine and prevent the patriarchy from spreading theirs. Those are the types of games we need, good wholesome games that encourage values like diversity, equality, and tolerance.Though, I will say, at least I can boot this game up and pretend I am a saboteur. Purposly destroying the patriarchy from within, making it much easier for the feminist collective to finally bring equality to the savages.I give this game a  Problematic/10			"

Возможно я слишком тупой для этой игры, кто-то может сказать. Но йобана, попробуйте зайти например в фотошоп 1 раз в своей жизни и нарисовать ШЕДЕВР! Это попросту нереально. Так и тут, тебя кидают в космос и делай чо хочешь.В заключении хочу сказать, игра мне не понравилась, возможно те кто хочет поковырять себе черепушку могут ее купить, но я не из тех людей.

												Must have for any RTS fan. At first it is intimidating with the minimal interface but you soon begin to appreciate it. The tooltips are very nice and descriptive so you won't be googling how to build things or what they do. The graphics are not excellent but once you experience the gameplay, units, and buildings it has to offer you won't even think about it. You will be thinking about trying out all the units and sending all the nukes you can muster into a wormhole. There are a mountain of modifiers before you start the game like the AI behavior or universe size, so the replayability is great because the computer wont behave the same everygame. I honestly can't say many games, even AAA games are worth $10 anymore, but I can say AI War is.			"

I got this in a bundle a while back and hadn't thought twice about it since. I usually don't go in for RTS or 4k games so I don't have much to compare it to. I also only spent about an hour playing but I feel I got a good idea of what to expect here. This thing is deep. Like super deep. Lots to do, lots to learn, and lots to keep track of. Not my thing but if you're into this kind of game, I think this might be one of the best options for you. Graphics are cool, everything seems to run well, and I really liked the music. I was also very intrigued by the story of the game. While I might not ever get that deep into the game itself, I may read up on the lore.			"

												I've spent 75 glorious hours in this game so far, and I'm still being surprised by the AI's competence. Recently, I was the victim of a three-stage four prong assault on my territory. The computer players do not screw around, which is good, because you won't be playing against humans in this game at all.If you enjoy Sins of a Solar Empire, this game is like that, except 2D.And with scary good AI.Seriously.

												This whole game feels like an uphill battle, and sometimes you don't even make it up the hill.  I have played a few games that lasted 24 hours and we still ended up losing.  It's probably the reason my friends won't play it with me anymore. :(  Still a fun game though, lots of ship varieties and abilities, cool randomly generated maps, lots of AI personalities to choose from.  If you can actually get people to play it with you I would buy it.			"

												Incredibly challenging game, but it is definitely fun. At the beginning of the match you'll quite probably get cocky about chewing your way through systems. But the more you conquer, the more the AI will come after you. Once the AI starts getting aggressive, you really have to pick and choose your battles. Things may feel tedious as the speed at which you can conquer more area decreases, but it's just that you have to be more strategic.			"

Oh! and it does have multi-player co-op!The game never really feels unfair, which is a feat in its own right.There is a learning curve, but highly customizable difficulty settings make things bearable.Matches can last a long time, but things hardly ever feel repetitive.Give it a shot (you can probably pick it up for cheap) and let me know if you are up for a match.

With more options than you can count, you can mold the game to suit any desire. Haven't played with the expansions, but given what you could do with Vanilla, the sheer amount of content and new game modes they've added with them should be fun.			"

												This game is tough. Even Sandbox AIs with no ticking progress and no waves will wreck you if you don't pay attention. However, the achievements are hilariously easy to cheese.Here's how to cheese the 110 planets controlled and the max kills achieveents:Turn on Base + Champion, use no champion mechanics i.e. chain its progression to your science, set both AIs to Sandbox (difficulty 0 IIRC) with an Easy setting, no waves, ZERO AI Progress ticking over time, Spire Civilian Leaders, and Fallen Spire.1) Find the civvies ASAP and secure their areas, use your Champion as your initial scout and then the tip of the bludgeon after securing your immediate proximity.2) Capture Sniper/Spider Mk 5 turret fabricators if your chamipion managed to find any.3) Wait for AI Progress to tick down, controlling 4 Spire Civilian Outposts is enough, set the game to +!!! speed with massed Sniper Mk 4/5 and Spider 4/5 turrets.4) Hack the schematics you want, if any, and link your territories together.5) Wait some more.6) If you get really bored while waiting, get working planning out the Spire city pattern, then rescue the Spire and build cities as needed.7) I haven't gotten far enough on this cheesing plan to get 110 worlds yet, but I have >80, I think 6+ Spire Dreadnoughts (that means double that many Battleships, double THAT cruisers, and... yeah you get the idea) and a level 90+ Champion (fitted as Spire Battleship with as many spire energy lance thingies as possible for maximum 1v1 life carving, though with 2 shields IIRC). It's been a long time since I left that game hanging, but wow is it easy to cheese the achievements. I accidentally tripped the AI to Tier 2 units, but it should be possible to pull this off without the AI being at more than Tier 1 in theory (though oddly the mobile AI forces attacking you despite No Waves still include up to Tier 5...)

												hello, my first review, and i chose this game because of the 130 games i have on steam, this is the only one i have been extremely mad at. A galactic RTS, if you will... start above a planet, and move to control the space over the next planet or planets that you are next to, or skip the next one to get a more crucial point further along in the map. As you progress, so does the AI, and they get boosted as you destroy their bases, so u need to be selective on which ones you cap for yourself, and which ones you leave in their control. Fight your way thru systems and make your way to their home ""planets"" and u win,This...Game... Is... Hard.... it is designed for 8 people to fight against 2 AI teams, so imagine the difficulty with just 2 people trying to micro-manage the chaos. A buddy and i (who both LOVE RTS games) restarted this game repeatedly and lowering the difficulty every time. Just when you think youve got em by the balls, a few thousand units show up and wipe u out. Frustrating?...YES... but even more so, we laughed so hard after being wiped out by over 1 million units... yes, 1 million..and combined we had maybe 6000.. mind you, we kinda pushed them to spawn that many, lesson learned...So its very strategic how it needs to be played out..Also has some of the best DLC ive seen in most games, all add quite a bit of options to the initial gameplay, making the play much more diverse as u continue to progress through.Pros: -Diverse units-unlimited map choices-infinite number of choices to apply to your game (ALOT more with DLC included)-simple and basic RTS controlsCons:-Graphically not quite there by any means, top down 2D view... but that doesnt take away from gameplay at all-Multiplayer doesnt work in game thru steam.. we had to use himachi or evolve, but no connection issues in either of those and the game ran greatQuite honestly, i cant think of anything bad to say about this game, its phenomenal.. If u enjoy RTS games, this is a must have. 9.5/10(would be a 10 if they dolled up the graphics)			"

												Note: This is a quick look review based on one hour of gameplay. I am currently trying to play every game I have on Steam and give it a quick review.Wow. This game is daunting. I got this in a bundle a while back and hadn't thought twice about it since. I usually don't go in for RTS or 4k games so I don't have much to compare it to. I also only spent about an hour playing but I feel I got a good idea of what to expect here. This thing is deep. Like super deep. Lots to do, lots to learn, and lots to keep track of. Not my thing but if you're into this kind of game, I think this might be one of the best options for you. Graphics are cool, everything seems to run well, and I really liked the music. I was also very intrigued by the story of the game. While I might not ever get that deep into the game itself, I may read up on the lore.			"

												It will steal your soul, but it will be oh so worth losing it!  What do I like about it?  Well, the AI... it behaves... well it behaves like a robot.  It's logical.  It follows patterns, but changes them up.  I also like the feel of the game, how the combat goes, and how, once you learn the game, it's actually a lot of fun.  There are literally hundreds of thousands of different possible games, thousands of different options, and a lot of game customization.  Also, this game is one of the few that you actually get a feeling of accomplishment if you win.  And believe me, winning is anything but easy.What do I dislike?  Well, the graphics aren't that great.  And the game can often be brutal to the point of ridiculous for even the tiniest of errors (as in you accidentally moved a few ships to the wrong system, and seconds later the AI wipes out half of your planets in one fell swoop), and it can be boring with the long periods of time between engages etc.That being said, this game... it... it's a masterpiece.  Especially after recent patches that made the AI even less predictable.  I can tell you the following things for sure:1) On your first play, you will lose.  You will get your rear kicked from your computer, to the moon, and then back again (unless you started it on the lowest possible AI setting, and even then, it's still possible).  The AI will eat you alive, and then spit out what's left of you and laugh (it literally laughs at you.  Dead serious.  The AI is also prone to insulting the players intelligence).2) If you don't immediately table-flip and walk away after this first posterior punishing, and try again, you're either really persistent, or this is the game for you.This game has a VERY steep learning curve, and players need to get used to losing at first.  You cannot play this like most RTS games nowadays.  Aggression will get you killed, and recklessness will make you lose.  That is almost a fact in this game.  However, you cannot just turle.  You must take calculated risks, and be very picky about what you choose to do.  But there is a god-send.  For the most part, the AI doesn't care about you.  It will more or less ignore you.  You are nothing to it.  Which is good, since that means you have a lot of breathing room and time to think between fights.  You don't have a lot of room for error (and believe me, the game punishes you by an almost ridiculous margin if you do screw up), but that's how this game goes.  Often there will massive engagements lasting only a few minutes that are crazy, insane, and make you wonder why oh why did you start playing, followed by literally an hour or two of planning, building, and movement.  Then another few minutes of insane combat, followed by massive downtime.And like stated in the trailer, you will always be out-numbered and heavily out-gunned.  You will always be minutes away from losing.  Yet you can win.  Despite EVERYTHING, you can win.  It won't be easy.  It sure as hell won't be fast.  But it can be done.  And when you win, when you finally defeat the AIs...  You will either be disgusted with the game and walk away forever, or be insanely proud of yourself, and ready to go again.  For that is the true beauty of this game.  Every game is different.  No two games are exactly alike.			"

												Mixes each element of 4X, Grand Strategy, Tower Defense, and RTS perfectly.Each element has its role and each one is twisted and turned to be unique, yet still feel similar.Management is great and each decision holds value in to each playthrough.Lots of support from the developer.The AI is the most unique aspect of the game and how the player(s) combat against it. I have never seen anything like it. It turns from being a non-existent nuisance to your conquest, to the game ending leech that slowly strangles your strategy to death. Although the AI could be unfair and just throw endless amounts of ships at you, the AI challenges you relentlessly instead. All of this also occurs because of you, as the player do: the more planets you conquer (or harm the AI), the more aggressive the AI acts.Turns from a guerilla warfare conquest, into a fight between two powers, the AI and you, if you are skilled enough to reach this far.

												Excellent indie 4X RTS game featuring a focus on heavy strategy over twitch control. You begin your game on a single planet and set out to conquer the AI's home planets. Each planet of theirs you destroy /take the stronger the AI becomes. Be too greedy and the Ai will become far too strong for you to handle.Game features great AI that reacts to your actions during the game. They send measures to counter you. Using too many Frigates? The AI will fill their ranks with the means to humble you. Not scouting and gathering intel? Your fleet can warp to its doom. Every planet is a choice, every action has consequences. The AI will punish you if you aren't careful.I'd whole heartedly recommend this game to anybody who likes well thought out, strategical RTS games. This isn't starcraft and your victory won't be decided in five minutes. Its a very long game. It doesn't hurt that is has some awesome musical scores as well, some featuring some nice guitar work. Buy this game and support it.			"

												(Note: My actual playtime is considerably higher as I have played this off-Steam a lot)It's one of the best space RTSs out there.  No, ♥♥♥♥ wishy-washy sentences.  AI War: Fleet Command is *the* best RTS I have ever played.  It's brutal without the pretence of fairness that so often drags strategy games into the mire of cheating while pretending not to.  It's complex wihout being impenetrable.  Arcen Games have done a truly wonderful job of knowing exactly what numbers to show you and what you don't need to know.  It's unfair without being demoralising.  Failure feels like you should have avoided it because you should have done.  It's totally asymmetrical and unit's damage/health/armor/attack multipliers all feel like they were created by typing random numbers into an ini file, and yet it's perfectly balanced.  It's a 4X, it's a sci-fi RTS, it's tower defence, it's a game of deciding which of the other games inside it is the priority.  It's a game where your opponent's lack of awareness of your existence is your most valulable resource.  In short: It's a ♥♥♥♥ing good game.			"

												If you like games like Sins of a Solar Empire, Homeworld and such, and like to play them against the computer or cooperatively with friends, this is the game for you. Designed from the ground up to be unfair against you, the computer doesn't try to pretend to be another player, it plays like a computer. Don't confuse this for making it bad, or too hard - it is balanced around the idea that as long as you don't massively over extend, you'll be largely ignored. On lower difficulties, 6 or lower, it is possible to slowly crawl across the galaxy, planet by planet, and dominate completely, but at higher levels you simply must adopt clever guerrilla tactics instead of simply brute forcing your opponent. Requires large time investment to get the most out of it, and friends make it amazing if you can all find the time. May seem like it would be repetitive, but with the expansions there are countless options for modifying the game settings - one game you may have multiple golems in a 40 hour marathon, the next you assault transport deep early and finish in 3 hours.

												A different take on tha RTS genre. Plays like a typical RTS with plenty of units and gameplay options.  You start with one system and 2 enemy AI's that at the moment are otherwise engaged and are vulnerable.You have to scout out systems and decide what action to take. You do not just take every system, you have to pick and choose as the AI awareness of you goes up with certain actions (ie. - killing AI command's). As the AI level goes up, your chances of survival go down. There are plenty of different options for progressing and getting more units. Hacking enemy Fabricators  gives you access to that unit permanently or you can capture the system and own the factory yourself. Or sending a strikeforce to take out the Data center in the system 2 jumps away to lower the AI level.A well done game that does what it says. Highly recommened.			"

Sins of a Solar Empire setting with Forged Alliance scale with Chessmaster thoughtful ""move"" progression with strong influences of Tower Defense. Your opponent AI can crush you at any moment, so doing things to attract its attention like setting off nukes, raiding every planet within sight, or destroying key structures will doom you if overdone. Guerilla warfare in a scifi setting is the name of the game, as you are assaulted with announced waves of enemies IN ADDITION to waging a traditional scout-and-expand campaign. The multiplayer implementation is revolutionary and flawless, as you can easily add and drop players as needed throughout a typical 6+ hour mission.Best. Indie Game. Ever.			"

												Okay, time for me to actually write down some comments here on this amazing game.First off, anything you know about AI and RTS/4X games you absolutely NEED to throw out the window. Period. Anything you know is invalid here in AI War. The AI for this game runs on entirely different rulesets and strategies that other games could only ever hope to emulate as those games aren't focused on the AI being cunning, ruthless, and most importantly, semi-procedural.Secondly, take this view every time you walk into a game of AI War: YOU ALREADY LOST THE WAR. Humanity is on the brink of extinction after the two AIs had rebelled against their creators (your children and those after you as you've been in cold storage for god knows how long). There are colonies that are enslaved, other alien races that have been brought to their knees in the Milky Way galaxy, and the AI literally holds just about everything. You're brought out of cold storage to make one final stand against the AI.Just about everything significant you do will cause AI Progress to rise. AI Progress is, simplified, how much the Core AI are paying attention to you and diverting resources to Planetary AI to fight you. So, the more you take back, the more the AI will pay attention to you. Which, depending on the games' setup is, can become exponentially painful fast.None the less, with all of the expansions of the game alongside even just the base game (which the base game updates core gameplay as expansions and their gameplay altering side effects cause) is absolutely worth every dollar. I've bought extra copies of the collection packs just to have some things to give away and try to get friends sucked into campaigns that literally take days, in part because real life sucks and this game is about one of the only things that is consistantly excellent in just about every way. This Fall Sale is no different.Who needs graphics when you have an AI that will rip your head off if you sneeze in the wrong direction?Who needs a significant story when if you♥♥♥♥♥♥off the AI in such a way that they send a moon sized motherbase with insurmountable firepower that CAN and WILL annihiliate much of what you hold dear in a matter of minutes?Always will love AI War.

												Other than this game being a huge time sink this game is brilliant.  It lacks fancy eye candy but core game mechanics this game delivers what appears to be endless challange.  Whether you want to perform epic 4xRTS that lasts for hours in conquest or take a quick excursion for 15 minutes in defender mode, this game has you covered.  It has numerous configuration settings and can even be configured to slower paced TBS style.  If you are turned off by the graphics then you probably won't like this game because what you see is what you get.  What cannot be conveyed in screenshots are the endless hours you will spend plotting, defending, attacking, and trying to win against incredibly deep AI.  The developers are constantly improving the game and community is extremely supportive as they are cult like in following.  Be warned the UI is a bit overwhelming.  My opinion asserts the average player has a 2 to 10 hour learning curve before truly being able appreciate this game.			"

Visuals are ok, its not Ashes of The Singularity published in 2016, which I didnt recommend, but gameplay is way better than Ashes since this AI is published in 2009. AI is a game that teaches you to lose with dignity. The AI is based on an impressive concept that will become aware of your existence once you start exploring and conquering. More aware it becomes more dangerous the AI turns out to be. The player's aim is to attain a balance between conquering and defending while zoning on the AI home world.And finally AI war II is coming out. I am definetly getting friends and coworkers buying it.			"

It's probably the reason my friends won't play it with me anymore. :(  Still a fun game though, lots of ship varieties and abilities, cool randomly generated maps, lots of AI personalities to choose from.  If you can actually get people to play it with you I would buy it.			"

												This is a very different kind of space RTS/4X game. The learning curve is a bit steep and it seems designed to really shine when played co-op with several friends, which is always tough with old and relatively niche games.I didn't LOVE the game but I played several sessions with a friend. We had fun and I appreciated the design choices and spin on the formula. The learning curve is a bit steep compared so some games in this genre and the difficulty is a bit unforgiving. My friend and I had a few games where after 45 or 60 minutes we got completely steamrolled by the AI and we weren't entirely sure what we had done wrong.That said, I'd still recommend it provided you can muster up a friend or two and are looking for something a little bit different.There's an expansion but you have to be a super-hardcore player to ever get to the point where you feel like you need the expansion. The base game is likely to last most people.			"

												Incredibly challenging game, but it is definitely fun. At the beginning of the match you'll quite probably get cocky about chewing your way through systems. But the more you conquer, the more the AI will come after you. Once the AI starts getting aggressive, you really have to pick and choose your battles. Things may feel tedious as the speed at which you can conquer more area decreases, but it's just that you have to be more strategic.			"

Depending on the dlc you have this can mean rampageing through the galaxy destroying every shield core ( or preforming surgical stikes whichever you prefer) you can find with ""massive"" fleets with over 1,000 ships. But when you end up doing that the Ai can and will throw 10,000 strong fleets at your homeworld causeing a game over. I have personaly never heard of anyone beating this game on hard.

This game is based around a universe where the huma race allready lost to the Ai. Your ultimate goal is to destroy the Ai's core. Depending on the dlc you have this can mean rampageing through the galaxy destroying every shield core ( or preforming surgical stikes whichever you prefer) you can find with ""massive"" fleets with over 1,000 ships. But when you end up doing that the Ai can and will throw 10,000 strong fleets at your homeworld causeing a game over. I have personaly never heard of anyone beating this game on hard. Much less with a harder Ai variation... Good luck!               Your gona need it...			"

												When you see Google's AI...you know that preparing your self with this game is the best move.(On a more serious note : excellent game. Can be hard sometimes, especially in end-game at high difficulty. Mechanics are simple and fast to learn.)			"

												AI war is a great take on RTS / Strategy, with an incredible array of options to make every game unique and customize the difficulty to what you feel you can handle. The expansions add a considerable amount of options as well, including some very interesting new victory conditions. The game does however suffer from a rather nasty learning curve and...difficult UI. But if you can move beyond those, it truly is an amazing game.			"

												Your computer doesn't need to be the most powerful machine for this game. The AI are rather intelligent too.It's not as simple as Starcraft, Supreme Commander, or C&C games RTS-wise. e.g. can't just spawn billions of units and win.After the massive learning curve, the game is worth the time.Just grab the game. It's worth the pocket change.			"

												Massive fleet battles, with an interface that support it. In a game of us vs. them (AI) probably best played with others in co-op. The games isn't really designed for the completitionists, as the AI start taking more of a beating them step up their game accordingly every subsequent battle becoming more and more deadly.Scout early, find their weak points and the final objectives and fight towards those.After that have fun, it's a blood good game once you get into it as long as you prefer fleet battles rather than tactical control.

												Cool indie strategy game with a lot of complexity. Needs a lot of time investment to learn. However, I'm not a huge fan of the assymetry of the AI, and I feel some game mechanics are needlessly overcomplicating things and thus detract from the actual core of the game, which is the AI.7/10 from me			"

												If you have played any 4X games that have fully developed UI's (Sins of A Solar Empire, for example) then this games flawed UI is going to come across as especially infuriating, with most of the tutorial devoted to trying to sway you away from it's flaws. The appearance of the masses and masses of small, dark text that has little contrast to the background colour of the UI makes this game quite literally headache inducing. If you're not constantly squinting, then you must be playing this game with a fancy pair of binoculars.Suffice to say, I despise this game's UI, and if this wasn't such an eye-cancer inucing hassle, this game could potentially be a gem.The learning curve to this game is steep, but not as bad as other games with notably steep learning curves (Kerbal Space Program, From the Depths etc). Unlike the aformentioned KSP, this game actually HAS a working tutorial, it's only problem being it's longwindedness and the reams of small, dark and poorly contrasting text blocks. It's not the worst tutorial system in a game, and the developers weren't so lazy as to simply tell you to refer to some 'mumbly joe' youtube gamer to explain it for you (looking at you again, KSP), but upon completing said tutorial, I really wished the devs would have looked up the word 'Brevity' in the dictionary.After playing through the tutorial and getting about 5 hours into a campaign, I'm saddened to think that I'm not exactly taken with this game, given the near-dead status of the RTS market, I had hoped that this title would pique my interest in the genre again. I was going to buy a second copy for the wife and play some LAN, but I'm not comfortable paying for a game twice if it's UI gives me headaches. Suffice to say, I shall wait 'til the Steam sales and make my decisions on the gameplay after that point.TLDR: UI is eye-cancer, learning curve unsuitable to newcomers to the genre, though game shows lots of potential gameplay wize.
