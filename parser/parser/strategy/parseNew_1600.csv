												Dangerous Waters is, without doubt, the BEST naval/submarine sim I've ever played, and I've played more than a few in my day.  The fine folks at Sonalysts really did their homework when they were creating this game, since nearly every aspect of it oozes a level of realism that you're hard-pressed to find in most other games these days. I truly believe that the gameplay you experience in Dangerous Waters is a very accurate portrayal of actual naval operations and procedures in practice today; every vessel and weapon you will encounter has been meticulously reproduced according to real-life records. Hell, I could probably operate my own Los Angeles or Seawolf-class sub singlehandedly thanks to what I've learned from this game regarding their operation. Let it never be said that videogames don't teach you anything.This tremendous level of immersion comes at a cost, however. Dangerous Waters is not so much a ""game"" as it is a genuine training siumlator, and as such has an extraordinarily steep learning curve that simply can't be overcome without first reading the manual and running a few practice missions as tutorials. However, even that won't fully prepare you for what you'll have to deal with once you finally take to the open seas, where even a single torpedo is usually fatal, and a compromise in stealth can ruin an entire mission. Dangerous Waters demands patience, dilligence, and a certain enthusiasm for submarines from its players if they hope to develop any real skill for it.Dangerous Waters is not for the faint of heart, but it can be a very rewarding experience if you take the time to learn the finer points of its gameplay. You may have to lose a boat or two or a dozen before that finally happens, but that's merely half the fun!			"

												Simply put: This is the greatest modern submarine simulator ever. This game is not for most people, because it is pretty hardcore realistic. The playable submarines are: Akula and Akula Improved, 688(i) Los Angeles Class, Kilo and Kilo Improved.  (They also make a MH-60 Seahawk, P-3c patrol plane, and Oliver-Hazard Perry frigate playable, but those aren't nearly as fun or polished) The level of depth they went through to make this as realistic as they could is breathtaking. Going through Sonar to find and classify vessels feels very rewarding. Once classified, you determine the speed through the Demon waterfall. After that, you go to the TMA (Target Motion Analysis) station to put in all the info to fire a weapon at it. All this takes time and a lot of effort, as you have to remain silent yourself because the AI is doing the same thing. If you feel overwhelmed by all this, you can put on auto crew on almost every station, so you don't need to do everything yourself, especially if you're bad at it. (Like me at TMA.) The campaign is very hard, at least for me. But you can train up on quick missions which involve you sinking 1-3 vessels depending on the difficulty you choose. And there is a ten-digit seed generator which makes quick missions infinitely re-playable.  Overall, I would give this game a great thumbs up and 10/10 rating. [At the time of this review, I have 37 hours on record.]			"

												Easily one of the best naval combat games available. If you own Jane's Fleet Command, C:MANO or NW:AC and have always wanted to have more direct control over your units, this game is for you. It may not be the best looking game now, 8 years post release, but it allows the player to fully appreciate the dificulties of Anti-Submarine Warfare. It will make you sweat, your brain hurt, and it will be exceptionally frustrating at times. It is very rewarding to finally put weapons on a target. Ant-Air and Anti-Surface warfare is also modeled beyond most other games, but neither of them feel as nuanced as ASW.There are several great mods available improving the fidelity of various areas, or adding many platforms. There's even a user made campaign to recreate Red Storm Rising!The learning curve is likely to be exceptionally steep for newcomers, mostly because the tutorial that was present for 688i Hunter-Killer seems to have been removed. Sometimes there are annoying UI and AI glitches, and the lack of a global map is a bit of an annoyance sometimes. However, given that DW does what no other game does, I'm more than willing to look past these issues.			"

												with over 600hrs of actual playtime, I would like to recommend this game for everyone who is intrested in real military/naval simulations.this can not compared to silent hunter.this is completley something on a higher level. you totally should get a good crew to play with, then this game will fill your life with tonnes of fun and thrills.expect a steep learning curve, read a lot, learn real naval tactics and sonar systems. (remember the developers actually produce sonar software for u.s. navy! I used this game to show my former physics class how sound propagation in water works. I did this two times in my life and gain both times A-grade.) DAMN NOTHING BEATS A SUBMARINE!dw will always have a place in my heart. 07			"

												In my opinion this is the best naval warfare simulator. It features 4 kind of platforms: Submarines (SSK and SSN), Frigates, ASW Helicopters and ASW Aircrafts. Each aspect of this warfare in modeled in the smallest detail. From the acitve/passive sonars to the torpedoes guidance/homing. From the thermocline to the sonobuoys. Currently there are 3 mods to bring more realism to the sim.The 1st is the Reinforce Alert (Current version : 1.40) that is an overhaul of all the sim. Graphic, Sensors, more playable platforms, new weapons and systems etc.The 2nd is the Lwami mod (Current version : 3.11)  that is a kind of sensors revamp. Is more stable compared to the RA but is less ""furnished"".The 3rd is the Alfa Tau mod (Current version : 3.1)  that is a mix between the RA and Lwami. It adds a bunch of platforms and is stable like the Lwami.			"

												Despite having developped several videogames, Sonalysts is originaly a provider of professionnal softwares and simulators, aimed at training US Navy officers. This is clearly visible, as the gaming experience in Dangerous Waters feels a bit outdated, even for its time of release (2006). The graphics, sound effects, and gameplay possibilities are quite limited, at least compared to Silent Hunter 3, which was released a year before. On these aspects, the game is closer to Silent Hunter 2 (released 6 years prior to Dangerous Waters !), and we feel like commanding a submarine from a distance, rather than fill the shoes of a real navy officer.That being said, the simulation part is meticulous, and has a great level of depth. We are able to command submarines (and a few other vehicles) with a high degree of realism. The game gives access to many weaponry, instrumentation (namely sonars), and takes into account a lot of physical parameters (force instance, thermal layers in the ocean having an effect on sound speed).It takes a bit of time to fully master the operating of ships/planes/submarines, but the gaming experience is worth the effort.Nota : apparently, DW is NOT Windows 8 compatible, and Sonalysts have stopped supporting the game. Therefore no official compatibility patch will be provided. Yet, some unoffical patches found on the subsim website may help resolve theses issue.			"

												Simulations seem to have a hard time when it comes to reviews on a gaming platform. And I would agree that also this simulation addresses a specific audience only . If you are a maritime warfare enthusiast or in any way interested in improving your knowledge about modern naval warfare, this simulation is for you and there is a good chance you already have played it in the past. If not, try it out. Since it is quite cheap meanwhile, you absolutely get decent stuff for the buck. This simulation is somewhat old now, true. But the things you have to do in it don't really require any of todays graphic wonders. Probably if this sim would have been developed today, it would bear less features after all.Conn, sonar, cavitation! "

												♥♥♥♥ yeah I recommand this game! Big time! Probably the best SIMULATOR game ever created. The main reason why I hate Windows 8 is because it cannot run D.W. Windows 8 will never touch my PC you can be sure of this. For those who have WINDOWS 8 and want to play DANGEROUS WATERS here is what you must to do (you will need a copy of Windows XP in cd or in image (iso) ):1: Download and install Oracle VM VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads2: Install Windows XP on Oracle VM. There are a lot of tutorial. It's not hard but it can take some time doing it. Here is a tuto:


YouTube™ Video: install windows XP inside Oracle's Virtual Box

			how to install windows XP inside oracle's virtual box and make a shared folder to be seen by both the host and the guest PC.		

 3: You will have to create what I call a tunnel folder that can pass some files from your actual OS (Windows 8) to Oracle Windows XP. It's an easy job but make sure that the name of this folder is as short as possible. like ""VD"" for Virtual Disk. Don't forget that XP Oracle will serve  you to play a bunch of other games that you cannot run with Win 8 so the job worth it.4: Install Dangerous waters from your CD or ISO file or even Steam again. 5: Patch it if it's from a CD or .ISO et voila.Thanks to my friend FPSchazly. If you have any question you can ask me.By the way guys if you are a fan of Dangerous waters I strongly recommand you the mod RA 1.37			"

												Dangerous Waters is a very serious naval warfare simulator with a primary focus on submarines, although other platforms are also controllable, such as the MH-60R and the Oliver Hazard Perry. The game's complexity arises not from navigating within your submarine or from having to press a million buttons -- indeed, these mechanics don't even exist. Instead, the game's interface is surprisingly simple for the most part as you move instantly from one screen to the next, and the graphics are rather bland, even on the highest settings, which is a bit understandable considering the game came out about a decade ago (as of this review year). Instead, the difficulties for the new player will be conceptual, and the learning curve for that will probably feel rather high at first.For those who master the basic concepts behind Dangerous Waters, this game largely tests your ability to be a decent submarine captain. The primary concepts to master in this game are probably those that have to do with sonar. Once a player knows how to utilize his sonar station, he is in a very good position to begin serious consideration of tactics.At this point, the player should see Dangerous Waters open up into a very serious cat-and-mouse game of war in which the superior tactician can often seize an advantage. Imagine a scenario in which a a submarine captain notices that he's stumbled onto an enemy submarine. Through Narrowband sonar, he determines that the submarine is a Russian Kilo. The captain knows that the Kilo doesn't have a towed sonar array, making it deaf to anything directly behind it. Accordingly, the captain orders a course change and swings in behind the Kilo. This Kilo's hunt for surface ships will be over soon.Nothing quite matches the anticipation of watching one's own torpedoes travel at the enemy, or the anxiety caused by listening to the constant pinging of enemy torpedoes as they get closer and closer while actively searching for their target. For those who can put up with the game's graphical shortcomings and high learning curve, this game is definitely an awesome submarine simulator.CAVEAT: This game does NOT run natively on Windows 8. It will, however, run in a virtual machine. It also reportedly works through WINE on Linux.Update: There is a 3rd party fix for the issues with Window 8. It is essentially a DirectX wrapper.			"

												A good game in it's day back in 2005. If you understand how real sonar works that is. Most peope can't get passed basic waterfall displays or bearing ambiguity. This is the game that has deeper sonar simulation  (pun intended) for people willing to learn. A good modern military simulation game back in 2005.Trouble is this was made in 2005 and never updated. It needs to be patched to run on windows 8.1. There is a fan made patch to get it to run. Even then by todays standards. It will feel slow. It will not be a graphic marvel. The control interface will feel ""clunky"" in places. Unless your are a die hard fan that has played before that or have read the on manual and really like it (which can be found online). Stay away form it. It is not worth it. If you have an interest in realistic modern submarine combat and don't mind patching the game. It is very good.			"

												I run Windows 7, so you're not going to get a thumbs down out of me for an OS issue on a 9 year old game.Pros:- Still in the top three as far as immersive, accurate, tactical naval action simulator.- MP is allowed.- You can make quick missions for instant battle, in addition to a campaign and single missions. - A mission editor allows more detailed construction of scenarios from the headlines (Spratley Islands, El Faro search, anything you can think of). - Drive a frigate with ASW search and LAMPS heli, fly a P-3 Orion, drive OPFOR subs AKULA and KILO. Large diversity of controllable forces. - Very well documented manual (~550 pages). There is a Training chapter on sonar theory, like a condensed STS A-school in a book. There is even a crash course on Target Motion Analysis (TMA) for those who wish to flog their brains. - SSN-21Cons:- The graphics are slightly dated after 9 years of progress, but a good improvement over the ""Sub Command"" title.- MP is inherently slow paced due to the vastness of the ocean. - SSN-688My credentials: I obtained my silver dolphins aboard a SEAWOLF class boat, and after OCS, served on two surface ships including as Navigator aboard a DDG (destroyer).

Multiplayer experience stands out of this and can be an interesting experience since the physical conditions are well represented.All in all this is a military training simulator designed to prepare submarine  and anti-submarine personel in the use of their stations, and Sonalysts did not care much to expand it  anywhere beyond that.3/10			"

												If SHIII is the king of subsims, then I have to call this the king of navalsims!The gfx weren't even that good when it was released, and reading a 700 page pdf manual weren't fun at all, and the tutorials on cd 2 sucked!Now the sim have lots of good tutorials on youtube, and a nice modding community on subsim.com (and other pleces too)Less then 4€ on a sale? I bought another one, just to be futureproof, if my disks die, or my backup ISO's runs away.Even as a subsim only, it's on par with SHIII with mods.. then add the controllable surface ships.. and planes, and helocopters etc etc.. This still lokk like a year 2000 'game'. But you will be to buzy wich calculations and sonarcontacts and all that's going on to notice that!It's THE naval sim!			"

												Hey it looks like a great game and a wonderful gaming platform like an updated Fleet Command. The problem is, it does not work on my windows 8. Steam does not support this game and should not offer it without some assurance of support. At the very list some sort of warning. Efforts to contact the powers that be are unsuccessful. No call back, no play and a waste of money. Maybe it works on other platforms but not this. Buyer beware.			"

												I got suckered into buying not only ""Dangerous Waters"", but the whole 4-game ""Naval combat pack"" for $30.00. Ooooh... buy the combat pack & save ""40-something dollars"". This is a perfect example of false advertising. All 4 of these games are total garbage. I even downloaded all available mods for them @ subsim.com, & they still all stunk. Had them installed on my PC for less than 24 hours, and then all 4 were removed. Games are so completely out-dated that you have problems getting them to run properly on Windows 7, even with XP compatability mode enabled. This was by far the absolute worst purchase I've made from Steam (I own over 50 games). I lost respect for Steam with this purchase. Shame on them for even having garbage like this for sale at all. If these games were all 100% free, I would not take them. This is the worst game review I've ever done.			"

												Technically outdated by now DW is still the only accurate modern sub sim on the market (incl. its predecessors). The funny thing is that the >600 pages manual only explains the controls work but not really how to apply your submarine, frigate, heli or airplane. It made me read several books and online publications and is one of the most rewarding games once knowledge can be applied successfully ... edutainment for grown ups :)			"

												I originally played this on it's release back in 2006, I loved it then, and I love it noe. In fact, I like it so much I bought it a second time here on Steam despite still having the original disc (and the beautiful ring bound manual!). By todays standards it is a bit dated visually, but that I'm not at all bothered once I get into the action. It's wildly ambitous in terms of number of plattforms simulated, but lacks a dynamic campaign, and as a submarine affictionado I miss Sub Commands focus on that particular plattform. Still, it's a great sim and one I will return to for many more years to come.Oh, and if you, like me, have Windows 8.1, and can't run the game, check this out: http://www.subsim.com/radioroom/showpost.php?p=2255333&postcount=22. Working great for me, even though the options menu is a bit... weird.			"

												complex, clunky yet oddly fun. My advice, watch ""how to play"" videos on youtube before trying anything as they can help immensly.the graphics feel dated but oddly that doesnt detract from the actual gameplay, Sadly i found a lot of my time looking at the tactical map which means you loose alot of immersion from actually driving the ship.once you know what you're doing it actually becomes a lot of fun and with sliders for difficulty and realism. theres nothing better than setting up a search area in a sub finding and then killing the enemy, or sitting in the weapons suite of an advanced destroyer sending out missiles, helo's and torps at various enemys.sadly there are a few glitches that make some missions either un-winable or un-playable, for instance in 1 mission you have to launch missiles from a sub at a shore target, i was in range, checked range to target crossed all the T's and dotted the i's but the missiles i launched only hit 1 out of every 4 so with a limited ammo supply i was fudged, i searched for a fix but only found peeps with the same issue.all in all i really enjoyed this game, but get it in a sale as it is quite dated so youd think they'd fix the glitches by now.

However I would recommend that the developers will add the Arleigh Burke and the Nimitz as player controlled ships because in most cases of modern navy tactics there is usualy 1 carrier and some destroyers.
