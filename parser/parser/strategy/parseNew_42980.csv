												I have to say, this isn't an easy game, it is also quite time consuming (time literally flies when you are playing) but when you start winning it is highly rewarding (kinda the way Demon's Souls and Dark Souls are). It is made in order to make difficult for the player to prevent the history repeating over again (or going worse for the country you are playing with).While instructions would be nice, the internet is vast and has quite a few explanations and tutorials.Yeah, it's an old game, graphics are not impressive at all, but really, who cares? it's not the point of this game. Also as your processor doesn't work much, you can play quite a few hours on your laptop before running out of battery, which is nice.I totally recommend it, it's worth every dollar and you get tons of hours of gameplay due to it's almost infinite replayability.Only advice: don't get frustrated if you get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked several times, you'll learn more and more each time.

												WOW. That is all I can use to describe this game. The depth, the strategy, the CHALLENGE! It's basically a strategy gamer and/or history lover's dream!Fancy playing as the supreme power of the UK? No problem. Watch your colonial empire grow, take on the French for Africa, and crush the Chinese in the Opium Wars.Or how about Prussia? Fight of the pesky Austrians and French and unify the glory that is the German Empire.Looking for a bit more, ""FREEDOM""!?!? Play the Yanks and have them whip Mexico into submission over Texas, emancipate the crap out of the Confederate States of America, and ""liberate"" Cuba from the control of the Spanish.All and all, this a game that you can play from all fronts; from the great and powerful United Kingdom to the feeble but determined-to-reach-glory Chinese. GET THIS GAME!			"

												Victoria 1 complete is a game which I only aquired through the Victoria bundle and was not the reason for which I choose to buy the bundle. However since buying this game I am happy to say it was not a waste of time or money to do so. The first thing I would like to point out is the fact this game is not ment for the casual gamer there is deep stratagy involved within, economically and also in the combat system. A strong feature of this particular game is the combat system it is complex however simple to grasp at base level for a better understanding some games will have to be played, or articles and tutorials will have to be delved into. However don't depend upon your militaristic skills for global domination the game might have a few nasty suprises in store for 'badboys' as it is known in game. The greatness of this game is that econimic management can be done quickly if required but fine tuneing is applicable whenever you are not amist a conquest so there is allways something to do.However I will admit that the diplomacy compared to Victoria 2 is much weaker and not as intresting to undergo and power difficult to obtain through the system in place, also some may find the graphics ugly and old fasioned which they are but I assure you you will get used to them and find a unique appeal if you give it time.The ability to play as any nation in the world across 4 diffrent starting points adds a lot of replayabilty into this game from either remaining a global power or starting from scratch and building a new economic and military superpower for the world to fear. Militarist or economist? New or old power? The world can be your oyster but can you make it?			"

												As of mid-September 2016 this game no longer seems to work on any OS from Win7 upward because of a Steam update that has also killed off ""Arsenal of Democracy"", ""Hearts of Iron 2"" and ""Europa Universalis 2: For the Glory"". There is no sign of any support from the manufacturer, and Steam is still selling a product that doesn't start on ""initialising graphics"" because of what appears to be sprite rendering problems, and they don't seem to have bothered to offer any help either. DO NOT buy this game unless you are absolutely sure that this game will run on your system.			"

												Victoria, I played this game (have an old disc) for many hours back when I didn't have a good gaming PC, but when I had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC. This game taught me how to enjoy classical music, real classical music, not modern classical music.This game also taught me that you have to forge Germany out blood and sweat and then forge the world into the Germans by blood and sweat.This game is a classic Paradox game and is a great game to play.Great game.Very great.

												Prefer this version to Victoria II, as the POP controls are more intuitive.  While the combat is simplistic, it can be very challenging.

												Don't be decieved by the hours shown, I've sunk many, many  hours into Vicky. I even printed off a well thumbed manual, reams of paper...those were good old days.  It sits on the same game engine as EU and HOI but its gameplay is totally different with the whole concept of pops being genius. It also tackles the 19th Century in a new and intriguing way and as always with Paradox games, it deepened my understanding of this period's history. My only caveat is that there are a number of key provinces and if you know them then you can position yourself to stomp. If you've not played Victoria 2 then I'd expect a strategy gamer to enjoy it having got to grips with the usual complex gameplay mechanics. But Vicky 2 is just better, so if you've already played V2, I would keep my wallet in my pocket. But if you pick it up in a bundle, you might want to give a few hours to see for yourself how the developers moved the game forward. Now, what would they do with Vicky 3 I wonder?			"

Posted: July 6, 2016
												This is a fun game for those who like the grand strategy genre of games. For those who dont care for them, or want to ease into them to see if they like them, this probably isnt the game for you.The game shows its age in 2016, but having just got it on sale with Victoria 2, for only a dollar in a bundle, I thought Id give it a try. Now I wish I had found this game when it released, well over a decade ago judging by its win XP requirement.The interface is clunky, to put it lightly. There is no manual (except online), so be prepared to do a lot of trial and error, and wondering about what stuff actually does.The graphics are dated and sprited based, but manageable.The AI is actually pretty good, and will present a very strong challenge to any new player on below normal settings.A single campaign can take more than 40 hours to complete, to get through just 100 years, day by day. This is one of those games where you NEED to be into the genre to find it pleasurable or youll end up quiting very, very fast.Be prepared to micro manage.Some tips: First, if you have windows 10, go to the executable and set compatibility mode to Win XP SP2. Not 3. SP 2. Otherwise the game crash. If you are asked to install direct 3D, just say yes, otherwise the game wont run. Second, if running win10, the game may crash on shutdown, or reloading a save after you have already been in a game, exited to main menu, and then tried to load the game again. Due to this youll lose all recorded hours you played the game (as recorded by steam) if it crashes on shutdown. I have about 60 hours, but crashed twice on shutdown after 2 very long sessions.Do not let the computer run your trading, ever. Set it up manually.The windows that pop up, you can right click them, and select when and how they pop up. Turn off spam like third party diplomatic deals, railroad completions, etc, or it gets very frustrating, very fast.If you lack manpower and wonder why, it means you need to convert some farmers into soldiers. Your soldier pop is low.Starting off in Europe is going to be tough. There are a billion tiny provinces everywhere and the user interface is not very good at sorting out useful information for you at a glance. The internet Ive seen recommends Brazil as a good newbie nation. I had decided to go with Prussia, and it was a tough learning curve, but can be exciting if you like a challenge right off the bat.This website: http://www.paradoxian.org/vickywiki/index.php/Main_Page will explain everything about the games mechanics, so have it handy when you have a question.

Not sure I would buy any more games from this company if the rest are like this. Also too bad because they covered some very interesting periods between 1836 to 1935.			"

												I played this a lot more before I had it on Steam. This is for any historical enthusiast who wants the power to control a country. The graphics is nothing special. The music is from the era and the historical events are all accurate. For the gameplay. This game can be slightly shallow if you only want to wage war. This in itself is fun and rewarding. There is however a very deep game hidden in this crazy awesome world conquering masterpiece. As you play the game with different countries you will notice that you can build up the industrialization by educating the people and build factories and railroads. You can also just let the capitalists roam free and build your riches on the broken backs of the working class. You have to fight corruption and rebells. Will you fight them or bend to their will? Is democracy really that great when you know whats best for them? I Highly recommend this game, but there is some downside. - Manually taking care of trading or educate the people is way to much work.- Progress is a bit too slow.- It’s extremely addictive. I’ve lost hours thinking it has gone minutes.- There is a Victoria 2 and maybe even 3. These should be (but doesn’t have to be) better.			"
