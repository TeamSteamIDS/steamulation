												I’m torn with this one.I love first person puzzle games and I love games that explore psychology. People’s minds, their inner torment, dreams, nightmares, thoughts and aspirations. So with that I imagine it’s pretty hard to put something so… deep, I guess? …Into a game, have it make sense and have the visuals live up to the vast imagination and expectation of others. All of which just kind of naturally come with the subject. I was pretty excited to try this because it really seemed from the trailer like they had all aspects, the visuals, the puzzles and the story, down to a tee. Well First off, the visuals are definitely what they seem. They are absolutely amazing. Although I was pretty gutted that for some reason Steam overlay wasn’t working for me with this game so no screenshots for me! There really is some amazing scenery in this game. I would actually go as far as to say this game is worth trying purely for that. But then again, not all people are as easily amused by how things look as I am.The puzzle side to things were quite unclear from the trailer (maybe I just wasn’t paying attention) so I was a little unsure on what to expect. But I was actually pleasantly surprised by the mechanics when I played. They’re unique and if anything the mechanics for the puzzles actually enhance the visuals even more. You basically interact with “tumble weed” like balls, place them in various different “hotspots”, I guess, which change your surroundings. Each one doing something different, changing the scene in a particular way, you obviously needing to figure out how to manipulate the level into being able to move onward.Now here is the iffy part.A lot of reviews that I read before I started this game definitely mentioned the storyline/voice acting being the main problem. I went into the game not really expecting much because of it and to be honest maybe that is why I wasn’t as disappointed as others seemed to have been.The voice acting is bearable through the most of it in my opinion, there was only one or two odd scenes which really were cringe-worthy to the point of giggling to myself like “REALLY?” despite it being a very serious and “emotional” scene.The story on the other hand, to be fair, was a little poorly executed. You can… kiiind of? See what they were trying to do with it but it really could have been done better. The foundations for something great are there, but as it stands it is very “meh”.Lastly, Achievements!This game is a pretty easy one to 100%, there were a few I thought were going to be very tedious to try and get but it turns out they weren’t! Apparently I have a total of 11 hours in this game, but honestly I think quite a lot of that is me standing around in the game hungover trying to solve puzzles (really wasn’t a good idea) and idling seeing as I wondered off a few times after being so stumped over one or two of the puzzles. So if a normal functioning human being wanted to 100% this I’m sure it’d be a lot less.All in all though, during the playthrough I was very unsure the whole time, I didn’t really know what to think, had these negative reviews rattling around in my head lowering my expectations, but now I have finished it and I kind of sit and reflect a little, I still think this game is worth recommending. The story isn’t great but you can see what they are getting at. It’s not AMAZING, but it’s bearable.TL;DR : Amazing visuals, iffy but bearable story and unique puzzle mechanics. Despite having a bit of a “I don’t know about this” attitude throughout the whole thing, after finishing it and looking back I would still say it’s worth a try.			"

												Just played through this in one sitting because, for some reason, it just felt like the right thing to do.HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥br>This game really knocks it out of the park with its design. Those visuals are fantastic. I really hope Carlos Coronado goes on to develop dozens of games.HOWEVERI hope he is given very little control over the narrative aspects of his games. It boggles me that someone can have such great taste in design and still give the greenlight to such awful writing and voiceover work to accompany their game.  This is some of the worst writing I've experienced in a game. I want you to think about that statement for a moment, think of every ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cutscene you've seen, every dumb plotline. This game still manages to outdo them. How? Because it presents itself as awful poetry, then subverts itself  and its plotine with cringeworthy self reflection, then manages to return to the awful plotline and wrap it up in a way that offers no imagination or room for interpretation. You can't scream at your audience ""this is what the story is!"" after you've just screamed at them ""aren't these metaphors stupid!?""It was announced that this game is getting a re-write. Hopefully they fix this but the narrative is so ingrained into its design (which, oddly enough, is actually good design) that I can't imagine a rewrite saving it.Ugh, how tragically disappointing.Update:I played a little bit of the new update and, while the narrative still has enough problems to warrant my thumbs down, it is indeed an improvement. In the new version, the voiceover is basically optional. It is clear that the designers weren't confident enough in the VO and writing to force their audience to endure it.			"

												In one word to summarize this game, that is ""inconsistent"". True, the game is supposed to be a psychological journey, so inconsistent seems to be an appropriate term in such case. However, the inconsistency is not in this manner but many other aspects instead.Firstly, the graphics of this game is inconsistent (both qualitatively and stylistically): I ran the game at maximum video setting, so around 30% of the levels look rather appealing which match the quality of the screenshots displayed here. However, the rest are a huge disappointment:  Poorly-rendered and lighted scenes, Low-res and repetitive textures, unapt color palette. Some levels really brought me back to the 90s, remind me of the Myst somehow (the original 1993 version not the remastered version). Yes, I'm talking about those forest and lakeside levels.Secondly, the gameplay is inconsistent. Like most other psychological walking simulators out there, as if their developers aren't confident enought with their already-expressive (might as well be self-interpreting) works, always trying to make them more ""playable"" simply by adding out-of-place cheesy puzzles here and there. But to be honest, most of those puzzles are badly designed, and has nothing to do with neither narrative nor expression, which also pull you out of the immersion immediately.I am excessively into hardcore puzzle game and pure walking simulator (such as Dear Esther), but the compromised hybrid between them? I rarely seen any good one (such as Ether One, no pun intended),  and this game is definitely not one of them.Last and most importantly, the whole ""flow"" in this game is inconsistent. All scenes and levels are so ""isolated"", there isn't a sheer connection between level and level. Conceptually, aesthetically, logically, visually, they are isolated in every aspects. Of course, someone might argue that this game is all about a subconscious struggle, so it should be in this inconsistent way, which I'd like to debate. Designing video games, especially artistic games like what this one wanted to be, is more like formatting the design language in a proper and consistent manner, in order to ""persuade"" the audience to get into the creator's shoes. However, with a shattered inconsistent language, this game is far from persuasive, but more like a rough patchwork putting together all scenes made in modelling practices from a long time span (considering the large disparity in quality), then sewed up with a improvised storyline.[All Achievements Acquired on 3 Jan, 2016][Final Verdict: 62/100] "

												Path to Thalamus, hum. Here's a tricky one. I don't wish to spoiler the story beyond giving you the intro, because the story is well told (I'm about one third to one half way through at the point of writing by my estimate), and the VA is well produced. The graphics, save one or two low res textures are uniformly exceptional, in a few places you can practically hit ""screenshot"" and you've got yourself a 1920x1080 wallpaper, yes, they're that good. The mechanics are creative as well, I am a great fan of games that eschew combat in favour of exploratory solutions, and I feel that games as a medium to tell stories, particularly the story that's told here, are finally now coming of age. But it's not a game I can recommend without a couple of caveats, it's not going to appeal to all and sundry, to those who have looked at the store page and who think this is a game that might appeal to them, read on. To those who are expecting the next dudebro shooter, move along please, that's not what you'll be getting here.So, to the meat of it - Mind: Path of Thalamus places you inside the head of someone who is currently in a coma, a man, a father, one who is buried deep in regret at the loss of his daughter (this is told in a very, very well played out intro scene which alludes to, but does not show the precise nature of it). Over time you'll learn this mans history, what drove him, what led him into the position that he's in, and now, deep in his unconsciousness, his path to redemption, the ""Thalamus"", represented by a great tree.The depiction of the mind and the subconscious in this case is very, very well thought out, everything takes on a logical significance without descending too heavily into cliche (though occasionally the VA does make a point of lampshading the obvious dream and story cues), and the graphical fidelity means you get a very good sense of atmosphere. There's a pervading loneliness that is reminiscent of games like Gone Home and Dear Esther, but even moreso because you're trapped in your own mind with only your own voice to self narrate. If you've the machine and the graphics card for it, the game will reward you with some stunning landscapes and a visual atmosphere that is well worth the time invested.Sound quality too, whilst it's not quite in the leagues of ambience as games such as Don't Starve or the seminal Endless Space, maintains a consistently high quality, and again, remains a good plus, the voice acting is decent, if not good most of the time, though once or twice when he lampshades the dream cues you will be thinking to yourself ""Thank you Captain Obvious"".Gameplay revolves around exploration, which is handled very cleanly and with the visual landscapes, is a pleasure, and the puzzle design, and here's where I have to issue the caveat. The puzzle design at the point of writing is a little uneven, some of them are very well paced, and despite being tricky little beasts, once solved, give you that feeling of satisfaction that comes with beating a well crafted challenge. Others... just have you running around doing a lot of legwork, and that's partly a problem in the core design of how the puzzles function, which annoyingly seems to be a case of placing objects in areas to manipulate the environment appropriately. The well designed puzzles keep the object movement relatively short, but clever, whereas the ones involving legwork (there's a cave level which is a particularly horrid early example) just makes you think ""there may have been a better way to do this"". I'm unsure on this point, but the busywork does take the sheen off of what otherwise has been an excellent experience.By now you will probably have a feeling if you know whether this will be a game that appeals to you or not, it's an exploratory game in the same sense Dear Esther and Gone Home was, and I feel the medium can only benefit from games like this, the puzzle design or perhaps the core mechanic of the objects should have been handled more elegantly, and some of the puzzles carry a risk of you ending up going around in circles, but to those willing to persist, and to those who enjoyed the experiences Dear Esther and Gone Home offered, this is a worthy follow up to those kinds of games.

												I was blown away by the beautiful visuals, emotive music and touching story of Mind:  Path to Thalamus. This game is a shining example of how far video games have come, and how artistic they can be. My only criticism of the game is that some puzzles drag out a little due to the player having to cover large distances. The slow movement pace is only annoying in a couple of challenges and for the most part moving through the beautiful environments was a pleasure. I think all critics of the games industry as a form of art need to play this game, as the experience is something that will stick with you long after the credits roll. Mind: Path to Thalamus is an amazing game, and has earned 9 out of 10 from me.STORYI was hooked straight into the story during this powerful opening sequence, and with the game assuming that the player already knows how basic movement works, no time was wasted with needless on screen prompts, allowing for quick immersion. As the player continues to search for Sophia you are knocked unconscious, starting your journey through the inner workings of your mind, to the thalamus.The game is minimalist with its on screen prompts, and with the purposefully basic controls I never felt that my progress was slowed due to a lack of explanation. I was having a great time, absorbing the story through the perfectly voice acted narration, while completing puzzles, when I suddenly realised I had just completed the tutorial phase of the game.The player is led through each environment by the floating drawings of Sophia, with the protagonist weaving in explanations of mechanics and goals subtly in the narration. The game utilise a huge range of metaphors in the challenges and environment  as the main character narrates his way through his painful memories and experiences. I don't want to ruin the story of Mind: Path to Thalamus by giving away plot points, but I will say this game was extremely moving and I was genuinely affected by the story of the main character.GAMEPLAYThe puzzle mechanics used in Mind: Path to Thalamus, are basic when considered conceptually, but are displayed beautifully in the environments. Players need to activate various environmental changes by placing themselves or small tumbleweed like balls in specific locations to allow them access to the goal of the area. The different environmental changes vary from changing between day and night, controlling fog, causing rain and controlling time.Each environmental mechanic is introduced gradually keeping the puzzles fresh and challenging without overwhelming the player. I found myself stopping and taking in each puzzle mechanic when it is used, as the impact on the environment is breath taking. Players must also be careful not to run into the"" trauma"", which are black and red electrical balls, that represent the damage that has been done to the main character's brain. The puzzles in Mind: Path to Thalamus are perfectly paced and are never too easy, or too difficult, but still make the player think laterally about the environments.VISUALSThe visuals of Mind: Path to Thalamus are the focus of the game, and are absolutely beautiful. I was forever slow panning each area and enjoying all of the intricate beauty of the environments. There are heaps of subtle metaphors relating to the story of the main character, and the use of minimalist area design creates surreal beauty while facilitating the puzzle focus of the game. One area that I found particularly beautiful, and fantastically designed, had the player traversing ice paths. These represented the synapses of the brain, with the images of his memories reflected on the ice surface.MUSICMind: Path to Thalamus continues its balance of minimalist design, with breath taking immersion, through the perfect use of sound and music. Many areas have no music at all with the sounds of the environment and the amazing voice acting of the narrator carrying the player perfectly. There were so many moments in this game when I would stop and listen to the rain drops splashing on the ground or enjoy the mystical wind blowing through the trees. During moments of beautiful environmental reveals or important character realisations, a gentle, but emotive piano score would resonate around the player, intensifying the situation. The piano score from Mind: Path to Thalamus is a beautiful piece of music, and I have found myself listening to it again and again since completing the game.For my full review and heaps of other delicious content see Glitch[glitchnews.com.au] "

												Mind: Path to Thalamus is the emotional aftermath of a careless father, one who dragged his children on trips to chase storms and other extreme weather. It’s a personal crusade that ultimately enacts cascading consequences: a fatal tsunami which swept away the narrator’s sister as he watched from the safety of a tree, his father nowhere to be found. A descent into drunken madness as a result of a broken family and an inability to believe in the truth of a sibling’s death. The narrator blames his father, but also himself, as he too chases extreme weather: the opening scene of the game is a massive tornado in which you must find your own daughter, named prophetically after your sibling.And thus begins a decade-long coma through which Mind: Path to Thalamus is a journey. As you make your way to the heady metaphor that is a giant tree called Thalamus, the road is paved with obstacles in the form of weather/environment changing abilities. Special areas—marked by gnarled trees, lilies, cairns, or slowly rotating gears—affect fog, night/day, rain, and time, respectively. Stand in their areas—or leave a spindly ball of glowing neurons in them—and the fog will expand, the sun will set, rain will fall, or ruins destroyed by time will grow whole again. Mastering these will be the nuts and bolts of your journey, the tools that let you pass into new areas and build up, more like Portal than Myst.Each map is nothing short of breathtaking in its complete disregard for spatial logic: chairs sit with their legs against walls, neat rows ordered to the ceiling. Railroad tracks truncate into blinding tunnels. Decaying ruins grow from an endless, ankle-high sea which reflects invisible, walkable segments floating above you. As the hollow avatar of the game’s narrator, you hold down W to move across these mindscapes, explore inner turmoil, solve puzzles, and listen to a voiceover that elucidates regret, dead sisters, drunken fathers, and shame.It’s incredibly ambitious subject matter from a young creator, but at times, it falls somewhat flat. All of this information is delivered in voiceover that pops up at the beginning of levels, whenever you solve a part of a puzzle, and so on, often in ornamental language or via out-of-place references. Awkward, overly poetic phrases make the game feel like a high school, compounded by a young voice actor who has a hard time passing for a father, let alone one who has been ravaged by life and death.Saying the game is about exploration may be a little reductive but it’s also true. It wasn’t the allure of puzzle solving that drew me in Mind. It wasn’t the developing powers over night and day, fog, clarity, or even time that are used to solve them. These elements deepened the gameplay in a necessary enjoyable way, but my ‘path to thalamus’ was characterized by soaking in each of the game’s environments. Puzzle solving, as tricky and inventive as the puzzles often were, was a means to an end: they were the reason to slow down and notice all that was around me. And that is why I will remember Mind.Mind: Path to Thalamus would never have existed ten years ago. Its abstract, high-minded premise isn’t one we would have seen from a big publisher. Instead, a single man and his small band of compatriots deliver on one of the most creative ideas of recent years.Mind is beautiful and its surreal environments will linger on with me longer after the story has faded. Exploration is its defining quality, even as the puzzle solving elevates above other exploratory games. For this reason, Mind: Path to Thalamus is an easy recommendation, even if its story falls a little short. This is a game that should be experienced.			"

												A great first-person puzzler let down by weak writing and voice acting, Mind: Path to Thalamus makes amends for its crimes against literature with magnificent achievements in visual design and an almost Valve-like ability to guide players without explicit pointers. Each and every major puzzle is of just the right difficulty: head-scratchingly confusing at first, then delightfully simple and logical later. Ignore the story and this is easily one of the best looking and most intelligent games of 2014.			"

												Even though this game is advertised as primarily a first person puzzler, what really impressed me was the atmosphere generated. A stunning looking game, with an intriguing story and engaging puzzles. I did have some screen tearing issues with the version I got to play but I've been assured these have been addressed in the finished version. Overall it's a fun little puzzle game with fantastic immersion and environments.If you'd like to know more you can watch our full review here -

												The game is absolutely gorgeous, with great graphics and amazing art style that's awe inspiring, Great narration with clever use of book author references, and a great story story that talks about a mans troubled life of a tragic event. Nice puzzles to solve that utilizes it's great visual art style in an amazing way.If you like Dear Esther, Gone Home, Dream, Myst (the new one), or Stanley Parable (with only one ending) and you like what you see then you will love this game as i did. The asking price is well worth what you will get/experience in the game.Also, Mind: Path To Thalamus is another game, if not the best one, that you can call 'Art'.More info here[www.ksalue.com] "

												Pros:Very nice to look at.Cons:Practically everything else.I bought this game mostly because I usually enjoy these types of atmospheric/explorative games, regardless of whether or not they have puzzles to solve along the way. And I really wish this one didn't, or at least made the puzzles more fun to solve. For me the puzzle solving was oddly confusing at first. Nothing was explained, though once you realize that every single puzzle is going to be ""get a blue wired ball to a specific location or hit the mirror so you can proceed forward"", it gets old very fast. Though the result of putting the ball in a specific location eventually varied visually, you were still essentially doing the same thing.I am not going to even start on the story. Read someone else's review for that. Long story short, it was rushed near the end, clumsy with its metaphors, and the narrative was painful.Simply put this game was okay. I would get it once it goes on a big sale, but only if you are willing to spend it on a 4 hour game filled with beautiful landscapes, tedious puzzles, and a story that you will forget about the following day; otherwise, don't waste your time or money.

												Great looking puzzler/walking simulator game.Not much to explore in the level's, unless you just want to look at the scenery. I would have liked more rewarding exploration.The story in the end isn't that bad, but it's not going to keep you playing the game to the end.To sum it up, quite slow paced wandering around in a wonderful looking world, trying to find the pieces for the puzzles.I recommend this one if you like to solve puzzles in a great looking environment, but not if you are looking for anything else.Pros:- Great looking world.- Music and atmosphere are wonderful.- Nice puzzles that aren't too easy or too difficult.- You can pick any level from the starting screen, so it's possible to skip a level if you'r stuck.Cons:- Quite short, game length depends on your ability to learn how solve the puzzles (and if you want all the achievements).- Music, would have wanted more of it.- You can't run.

												Mind: Path to Thalamus is an artistic first-person puzzle/exploratory game, blending ideas from games like Myst and Dear Esther.  Based on its influences, I'd be inclined to like 'Mind: Path to Thalamus,' but I found myself disappointed by the game.The visuals and aesthetics are outstanding, and are easily the highlight of the game.  There are fantastic uses of color and atmospheric effects to create beautiful, evocative scenes.  Even the skyboxes are amazing.  Music is used sparingly, but it fits the mood well.  If anything, I'd have much preferred to hear more of a soundtrack.Puzzles in the game work by changing part of the environment, including rebuilding ruined structures to triggering a beautiful night effect that looks absolutely gorgeous.  The 'fog' option is the only one I did not like.  It rarely makes the puzzle more interesting, but instead makes it a chore to navigate the environment.  Generally speaking, the puzzles were fine, though nothing outstanding.  Pretty easy, but a few brain teasers here and there. The main method of intereacting with the different elements usually involves walking over a certain area or placing a special ball inside of it.  Given the distances that often must be traveled, it often felt tedious, and the hands-off method of interaction took away some of the satisfaction of puzzle solving.The main problem the game faces is its writing and voice acting.  I feel a little bad criticizing this aspect, since it is clearly an earnest attempt to elevate the game as an artistic statement.  To be clear, the writing is cohesive and competent, but it's misdirected in several ways.  First, the protagonist's backstory comes off as increasingly fanciful, to the point where I found myself rolling my eyes whenever it was referenced.  Considering that the main game is awash in fantastical and unreal imagery, having some element of the story be grounded would have helped.  As it was, I struggled to get behind the incredibly unlucky disasters that befell the protagonist. Second, the writing becomes increasingly self-referential and tries to subvert narrative tropes.  It's a big risk whenever a story does that, and it didn't pay off. In fact, it completely turned me off of the story.Third, the way the main character is personified relies on him 'telling' us how he feels and what he knows, not 'showing.' At one point, the text almost directly states: ""and this is what happened next.""  I didn't care for this approach. It gives too much away and made it more difficult to empathize with the protagonist.The game's short length is another issue (much of my play time was spent idling).  I feel that a longer play time may have allowed the game to sink its teeth into me.  I think more subtle story telling technique may have also deepened my appreciation for the game.Overall, I was disappointed by Mind: Path to Thalamus.  It's not a bad game, not by any stretch, but it falls short creating a memorable story or puzzle experience, and in the absence of anything that truly stuck with me, I can't recommend the game. Yet I feel I must reiterate that there's nothing cheap or lazy about the game, esepcially its aesthetics.   I'd suggest readers of this review consider Ether One, a game that I think does a superior job in world building, restrained storytelling, and organic puzzle solving.			"

Posted: November 2, 2014
												Contrary to popular conception, I don’t revel in criticizing games, at least not ones which clearly tried to do something interesting with their concepts but wound up falling flat. Mind: Path to Thalamus is the sort of game I hate having to review; ambitious, compelling, and filled with beautifully imaginative imagery and a narrative that tries to explore intelligent themes of guilt, parental neglect, and the possibility of an afterlife. It’s a game with great potential that executes itself with an abundant lack of skill and cohesion, that by the end is almost pitiable in how poorly the experience comes together.Entering a dreamlike world within your own head by way of a tornado induced coma, you inhabit the body (for lack of a better term) of a father drowning in a tidal wave of guilt at the death of his sister (and more recently, daughter), for which he holds himself wholly responsible. His last thread of hope is to make his way to the Tree of Thalamus, a sort of tree of life which is at the heart of this world that in some ways serves as a bridge to heaven, where he will find his sister and beg for her forgiveness.Simply typing out that synopsis has given me an even more obvious view  of how fundamentally flawed the narrative is right from the start. It consistently loses its own plot as it attempts to draw meaning out of its level designs, juxtaposing new emotional hurdles for your character to overcome while never giving any of them time to develop into anything but poorly conjured schlock, existing solely to attempt to impose some greater purpose to the narrative than the mediocre writing ever manages to do. It’s telling that at the end of the game, the developer very nearly acknowledges the absurdity of the plot, though in doing so essentially writes off everything which came before and creates even more issues which ultimately culminate in an ending that seems to have no idea whatsoever what it wants to say, wrapping itself up hastily and clumsily before it can cause further harm.I appreciate that Mind attempts to tell a story that wishes to touch upon lesser explored themes than we often see in games, but to do so requires a great deal of forethought and an author capable of crafting something meaningful which is simply not present here. Mind drowns itself in self pity and heavy handed theology, leaving an abundance of plot holes along the way as the lone voice actor reads off a poorly worded script with a consistently over the top or lack of inflection that is little more than an embarrassment.The pacing also suffers due to convoluted and tedious nature of the game’s puzzles, which involves placing strange tumbleweed like balls within certain areas in order to change some aspect of the level, be it making day turn to night illuminating portals or causing crumbled pieces of the environment reappear. Its mechanics are never explained nor even highlighted in such a way as to make them apparent through their effects, leaving the player to meander about levels until they may stumble into the right area and realize the subsequent result.These areas are often hidden or placed out of the way, with the camera often being positioned in such a way as to lead you off in the wrong direction, as if the developer wanted to make them as hard to find as possible. The solutions are typically simplistic in nature, but because of the complete lack of a prior explanation of how the game’s systems work, it can be incredibly tedious to solve them. I never felt accomplished by discovering how to do so, instead a feeling much closer to relief that I could finally move on. They also serve to disrupt the otherwise gorgeous art design of the environment, inserting stagnant architecture that is used to provide consistency for the puzzles, but often feels out of place positioned on the changing landscapes you travel between over the course of the game. In such a visually imaginative world, having these moments when parts of it clash stands out even more aggressively and greatly weakens what is easily the most well crafted element of the game.The opening of Mind is without a doubt its strongest moment. It relates a possibility of something incredible, an excellently executed scene of a tsunami emerging out of the sea, destroying the countryside in a terrific display of destruction and chaos as our character frantically searches for his daughter. It gives the impression of lofty ambition and great promise, but only the former ever showcases again, more often than not to illustrate the danger of biting off more than you can chew.			"

												NOTE: This is a review solely for the gameplay with an HTC Vive VR headset. Do not play this game using the HTC Vive and the motion controllers. It is very disorienting/nauseating and difficult to navigate. I purchased this game specifically to play in VR, but you can definitely tell that the game wasn't designed with VR in mind. I can't comment on the rest of the game or content as I cannot continue without feeling sick.			"

												I can recommend this game but there are a few 'meh' things.The story idea is not bad but its narration doesn't catch me.. in contrast to it's atmosphere.Visulas and Soundtrack are amazing and blew my mind. The puzzles aren't that hard and after a while even me as a Puzzler-Beginner was able to solve them what is great in my opinion.I enjoyed it while playing so I am fine with some negative aspects.

												Mind: Path to Thalamus is one of the most inspirational game I have ever played.Those majestic landscape who may have no sense at first, but is yet majestic and simple.When playing this game, it's like I'm dreaming.Also, the soundtrack complete the ""final touch"", it gives me chills.I recommend this game to everyone.So calm, yet so complicated.This review is not very professional as english isn't my first language.(P.S. I would love it, if it was possible to buy an album of the soundtracks of Mind: Path to Thalamus)			"

												The mind is a beautiful, sometimes terrifying, thing. Projecting nightmares, anxiety, flashbacks to embarrassing moments we endured in our lives. In our day to day lives, we’re often able to draw attention away from such negative thoughts and musings with the distraction and hum of daily life. But when you’re trapped in your own head, and there’s nothing between you and the darkest corners of your thoughts, it can be a hell in which there’s no escaping. Sometimes, there’s nothing but a malfunction, a delayed chemical or electrical reaction in the body, that prevents us from leaving such a place. There’s little we truly understand about such conditions. Can one even fight their way back to the surface? Or is it totally down to chance?The protagonist of Mind: Path to the Thalamus, only known by the name of Nick, is a prisoner in his own head. His struggle to reach the Thalamus, the part of the brain which controls consciousness, is gorgeously rendered by dreamy vistas inspired by dream art, surrealism, and the culture surrounding the formation of those movements. His internal struggle is a powerful, personal one. Threads of plot are entwined between his younger self dealing with the death of his sister Sophia, an abusive drunk of a father, and the loss of his daughter – whom, perhaps unwisely, he named after his deceased sister. His path to the sacred tree he crawls toward in a disjointed journey is riddled with visuals both symbolic and grounded in the reality of Nick’s past.Perfectly in tune with the dreamy nature of the visuals are the puzzles, which take advantage of the mind’s ability to transform a scene and abandon conventional logic. Each element of a puzzle is controlled by placing or removing a webbed orb from an environmental cue. Dropping an orb onto a field of glowing flowers will bring about the night. Dropping one near a circle of rocks, which leak water from an impossible source, causes thunder to roar from the sky and heavy rain to pour down. Each brings some fundamental change that you will need to learn in order to solve an area. With the exception of the very first concept, which is abandoned for good pretty much right after it is introduced, every one of the powers is gradually taught to you and then added in progressively more difficult puzzles featuring other powers.The degree of cleverness varies wildly, from being brain dead easy to requiring some serious ‘outside of the box’ thinking. I’m no Mensa, so a softer approach to the puzzle elements kept me from feeling too frustrated. Unfortunately, this means those who were looking for higher level challenges will be let down. Even the most difficult of puzzles didn’t require more than a handful of tries before the solution would present itself. Even still, it’s fun to watch the leaves change color, or a night sky, complete with rain, to completely change the mood of a beautifully constructed scene.Some slight texture/detail pop-in marrs the otherwise gorgeous crafted scenery. For most maps, this isn’t an issue. Larger maps tend to have this effect rear its ugly head more often. It’s difficult to enjoy a wide shot of rolling hills when the texture on the hills displays its tiled texture until you’re a few feet from it. It’s only a small mark against the lush atmosphere achieved by the excellent use of color and texture to paint such striking imagery, but one that must be mentioned all the same.If I were to have any major complaints, it would be directed towards the ever-present monologue provided by the protagonist. The entirety of the game’s story is told through musings and introspective questions. The problem here, I felt, was the lack of emotion and unnatural speech patterns used by the narrator. His inflection, and emphasis on certain words over others, sounds awkward and stilted, getting in the way of my ability to stay immersed in the game’s world. Everyone will have their opinion on how much they can tolerate the voice acting and, while a Spanish voice acting track has been promised to players since before launch, it has yet to surface in the game as of yet.Part of the reason this review has taken so long hasn’t been because I was in a coma myself but rather due to the constant state of flux the game’s script has been in. After launch, feedback was next to unanimous that the script was very weak. The developers took this to heart and removed a lot of the game’s superfluous ramblings. Many of the sarcastic remarks made by the protagonist were also removed, as were some of the faux-philosophical quandaries. Mood and tone were pretty much instantly improved but the differences still aren’t quite enough to remedy the incredibly stale delivery by the lead voice actor. If I’m to be completely honest, I think I’d need him to be replaced as well. But again, opinions differ and it may not be such an issue for you.Mind: Path to Thalamus straddles a line between the artistic pursuits of games such as Dear Esther while tying its themes to puzzles that require thinking about things a different way, a la Echochrome or Antichamber. It’s a game with big ideas, and a gorgeous art direction, but simply cannot carry itself under the weight of some ever-present negatives. Much like a dream, however, parts are constantly shifting around. The developers are listening to feedback and actually acting upon it. And I hope they achieve the perfect balance to make the game shine, refining the way it speaks about the delicate topics it covers. In some moments, between the bitter sorrow and the picturesque backgrounds, I had small flashes of scenes from What Dreams May Come. That’s quite a feeling to achieve.Did you enjoy this review?

												This game has a quality of somberness and reflection thoughput the whole game. I've played for hours but this reflection is about a girl: this man's daughter. Thge whole game is a 'Puzzler', and a Great one too! I was taken by the total beauty of the game. It looks , sometimes, Photo-realistic. A very cool game for a good system. If you don't it's still very cool, and you'll be blown away by how beautiful it is. The puzzles are quite fequently merely being smart with what you know. Like ""Vanishing of Ethan Carter"", there's not a help menu. Exploring and checking your 'hunches' about what to do are the key because you build on what you've learned. All puzzles get harder. This game has very sophisticated puzzles, and they are Quite daunting,.. Like I said Remember what youve learned, maybe write it down..., like I did, because I intend to beat this sucker. Don't get your hopes too high. I see this game as a real time tested 'Work-of-Art"", because it gets to you and the puzzles only make you want to find out more!!I was So 'tested' by the puzzles. They are completable, merely with what you've seen and done. It gets better It really does, but after the first few puzzles your learning curve, isn't so hard. I got a few of the harder ones pretty easily nearly by muscle memory. Spopeaking of memory. This game has 'Time' as a part of it's Puzzles! If you like to take your time exploring like a good 'Myst' Game: Mind: Path to the Thalmus is a REAL gem. Hard games like Chess made my head ache. After finishing these puzzles, in Mind: Path to the Thalmus..., I feel, almost Not, an Ignoraneous!You, will too, if you can take your eyes from the scenery!This game Rocks, very quietly.9/10			"

												Wonderful game. With the new teleportation system, it is one of the most beautiful games for the HTC vive. I have been following the development of this game for years and I can assure you that the negative comments about this game not being a good VR fit were definitely before their implemented blink-link teleportation. With that, any locomotion or motion sickness problems have melted away and I can find myself lost in a beautiful world. Definitely recommend this for VR!			"

												It's a beautiful game with magical dreamy scenery and some smart puzzles.I had it wishlisted for a long time and the moment it came on linux I got it.Unfortunately the enhanced version is really bad. And that's the only version you are able to run on linux. Enhanced version means a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of bugs like, mouse not working properly, sound not working properly, dialogues not working at all after a point, items vanishing or stuck etc.What's worse, is that even like that, by patiently restarting the game a hundred times I managed to reach at a point close to the end and then the game just becomes unplayable. Nothing moves. A little before the end.Achievements do not work either.What annoys me even more is that I bought 3 copies, for my husband and friends and all would be for linux.Also, for the 100% achievement hunters:Even if you run the old version on Windows, you won't have a 100%. You can only accomplice 100% with the enhanced version. And that version is♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												The game is stunning and puzzles are designed well to teach you mechanics while gradually ramping up the difficulty. The scale of environments and the various effects in-play are used wonderfully. However, the voicework and writing is, in my opinion, terrible and detracts much from the game. The writing switches from self referencial to philosophical, quoting scripture to exposition and even at times comedic. All-in-all it did not fit with the rest of the game for me. It would have been much more interresting to have to piece some of the story together yourself through the interaction with the world, yet not much except the first level even give a hint of why anything is happening.

												For the price, this is an outstanding game.  Most notably are the visuals which are astonishing.  The skybox, the caves, other spoiler places, amazing.  The puzzles are challenging, but not to the point where you will get frustrated.  Normally one or two passes is all you'll need to figure something out.  That being said, there is a downside which lowered the entertainment and immersion of the game for me, and that is the walking speed.  It is so freaking slow and you have to walk many of the fields two or three times over (some more).  I basically held the forward key nonstop for 3 hours.  All in all, absolutely recommend if you have a few dollars.  It's short and there isn't any replay value, but it's worth it.			"

												Where should I even start with this game.  So many things to say, yet so hard to decide on where to begin.   Story/Plot:   Mind: Path to Thalamus is a game in which you explore a world that revolves around the mind of a father who reflects on his past.   Gameplay:   The game has various puzzles that start off simple and increase in difficulty, but never become so hard that they are near impossible.  Nearly all of the puzzles, are based off using a ball to cause create certain effects, such as accelerate time, or shift time-of-day, etc.   The places that you go to, are very open although there are boundaries to keep you from getting too far off track.  Being this open, you get to enjoy the visuals of the game, along with explore and find ways of solving various puzzles.Graphics/visuals:   I do not feel that I need to say anything here because just looking at the screenshots, and the trailer, should give you more than enough proof that the game is eye-candy and looks beautiful.  Now, the graphic controls are few and limited, but the amount of optimization in the game, is shocking.  Games like this when I max out, are usually smooth but have rough spots or hiccups every now and then, but even with max settings and vsync, I had liquid smooth performance with absolutely no lag at all.  In short, you can most likely play this game, with an older computer.Sound/music:   Music, was fitting and relaxing.  Sound effects were fine, although some things could have had more effects like walking on water or sand.  The narrator's voice is fine IMO, but certain lines felt really forced, but aside from that, he did fine.Enjoyment:  I love these type of games that explore the mind and make a game that represent abstract things, so it was a blast.Other:  No cards and no word if there will.  There are many things they could use as cards, backgrounds, and emoticons, but who knows.  maybe in the future they will make some.Any questions?  Just ask and I'll help the best that I can.			"

												I have a love/hate opinion of MIND: Path to Thalamus. To begin, it is evident that you realize that there are two separate versions of the game. Therefore I split up this review to compare the two versions.Old MIND (UDK):Pros:-	Narration throughout the game-	Gorgeous Scenery-	Different Puzzles-	Works-	Final Boss Cons:-	Less Optimized-	Less Complete Ending“Enhanced” Edition (Unreal 4):Pros:-	Optimized Better-	VR Support-	Different Puzzles-	Complete StoryCons:-	Different Ending with no Boss-	Less than Gorgeous Scenery-	Buggy-	Narration Missing Lines and Narration is only found within “floating orbs”Now, I may be slightly off with my information I have of the Old MIND version as I only played through the Enhanced Edition and tried the Old MIND version for less than an hour. The gameplay is a First Person Puzzler and is very simple as it involves moving these “balls” around to various points to change some aspect of the environment. However, that’s the biggest barrier in this game. Moving the balls too fast will cause the ball to glitch out and launch into space. Now maybe that is within both versions, I am unaware if it is or not. The Enhanced Edition has only one broken puzzle that involves reflection. I was going to mention the story; however I probably missed some of the “floating orbs” and thus missed some of the story. From the music I heard, I wish there was more of it, as it very much suits the beautiful scenery of the game. I tried so hard to enjoy this game, and whenever I started to enjoy it, a ball would launch out of my hands into space. I would recommend this game, only if you play the Old MIND version which is available as a beta within the properties of the game.			"

												MIND: Path to Thalamus (SteamVR) has been released of it's artificial locomotion shackles. With teleportation as a mode of transportation, this game is very much worth playing in VR. The story doesn't really hit the ball home, but the puzzles are challenging but satisfying. Above all else, the world is absolutely beautiful, and expansive at that.You can watch my full review  here  for my complete thoughts on the game.Definitely a good value pickup, I recommend experiencing it.Also note that my playtime isn't indicative of how much time I've actually spent playing, since this isn't my primary account for enjoying my games. One single playthrough should last you roughly 4 hours.			"

In MIND: Path of Thalamus, you traverse loosely connected surreal landscapes in pursuit of a floating piece of paper, presumably a drawing from your lost daughter, while solving clever puzzles that require both observation and thought.The ingenious puzzle logic demands scrutiny, such as spotting the reflections of invisible bridges in the water to reveal a hidden path. Unfortunately, this also translates into unintuitive navigation where you basically walk into the air after memorizing the concealed path.Consequently, the game made me feel queasy rather quickly. Only two other titles share that unsavory distinction in my 30+ years of gaming. Thankfully, maxing the FOV in the settings completely solved that issue in subsequent sittings.Later on you'll largely be playing with assorted balls of twine, leaving them in key areas to activate puzzle triggers that require a bit more thought and are fairly enjoyable to solve. These switches alter the environment in one of multiple ways that mainly affect where you can go, such as enabling portals or elevating platforms. Correctly sequence your steps to move on to the next level.Claiming to completely alter the environment oversells MIND's capabilities. The environment changes are purely aesthetic, and while that also works nicely as a game mechanic you never actually control anything in any significant measure. All states are binary.Inconsistent visuals vary from pleasant to conventional, showcasing a few striking visual moments and beautiful vistas, with the majority of the better realized scenes prominently featured in marketing screenshots and the rest consisting mostly of uninspired segments that lack the polish of the main levels.Some parts were so purposefully dark you literally see nothing but blackness even when carrying a glowing ball of light. Disorienting much? Later on excessive fog effects will bury you so intensely you'll barely see anything ahead of a few meters.Parcels of monologue are uncovered by staring at white particles long enough to produce short narrative elements, unconvincing in both writing and performance. This feels not unlike a collectible run and is a terrible, terrible way to deliver a story. More appropriately, the narrator should have conferred his thoughts directly and naturally, without forcing the player to hunt down the monologue particles.The story line is hardly worth mentioning anyway, since it is not the main focus and is completely disconnected from the actual puzzle solving. You could play through the entire game without the voice and the experience would not be diminished one bit.Of note, the rarely heard but soothing piano is very pleasant and makes me wish music played a bigger role.Invisible walls prevent you from reaching seemingly accessible places. The game does not expect you to explore beyond its tightly constrained play areas. It allows you to jump but doesn't expect you to do it either.Pausing the game resets your progress back to the previous checkpoint without warning. Menus as a whole are poorly handled. For instance all chapters are unlocked from the onset but they're nearly impossible to identity with their vague names. Pressing ESC doesn't just load a menu, it unexpectedly sends you back directly to the desktop.Oftentimes the sound glitches off completely and the game turns silent (Alt-Tab out and back to fix this recurring problem). Turning the settings to Ultra worked fine in-game but resulted in inexplicably acute stuttering in the menus.The ""enhanced"" edition completely robs you of the final action-oriented level, a sort of boss fight in complete contrast with the more contemplative mood that permeates throughout. I only know of its existence from watching online videos, from which it seems it delivered the core of answers regarding the story. It's easy to understand why the developer chose to cut this potentially nauseating portion of the game for the VR experience, but it still feels like a cheat to not be able to finally reach the tree you've been seeking the entire game.The following epilogue is artistically unique and very interesting, ending the experience on a positive note.A secret level can be discovered by walking through an immaterial door. Completing it sends you back to the main menu instead of returning to the current chapter, with progress reset. Good job. In it, the developers make a statement with a single phrase pasted on rock cliffs: ""Videogames are not art."" Well, there's no arguing here.It is disheartening to not recommend an indie product into which the developers obviously put a lot of heart, but this inconsistent game rarely elevates to what it aspires for very long. The adequate gameplay may not be for everyone but should appeal to those who like the genre, if they're willing to overlook its numerable inconsistencies.			"

			Views: 229		

			Azralynn presents a quick game review of the atmospheric walking simulator puzzle game MIND: Path to Thalamus. Written Review can be found on my website here:...		

TL;DR: SKIP TO CONCLUSION!MIND: Path to Thalamus is an atmospheric walking simulator puzzle game with VR and non-VR capability.The core gameplay revolves around traveling through different areas, and solving the puzzles in each area to move on to the next one. Each area is a new environment to experience, and provides more insight to the story. The story is interesting, and I enjoyed it, but for me, the highlight of the game is on the immersive world, and its puzzles.Pros:not much music throughout the game, but what there was, was done wellthe majority of the audio is relaxing ambience, and it does a really good job at enhancing the atmosphere of the gamegood graphics that create immersive, and unique environmentsenjoyable puzzles, and mechanics introduced as you progress - I really liked the puzzles overall, and how you have to put the ball in certain areas to trigger different effects and use different objectsCons:can cause nausea when using the HTC Vive because you move using the controller (I don't have issues with nausea in other VR games where you move by teleporting or actually walking around)some puzzles could have been a bit harder, especially closer to the endConclusion:The main story took me over 5 hours to complete, and I am very pleased with my experience. As a walking simulator, this game provided me with everything that I had expected from it, and with the decent puzzle aspects nicely woven into the game as well, it’s a solid purchase for anyone who enjoys a good atmospheric puzzle walking simulator.If you like my reviews, please feel free to join my Steam group, and follow my curations here.You can also view this review on my website here.[www.azralynn.com] "

												One of the best indie games i've played this year, it's an absolute must for any fans of indie, adventure or puzzle games. The game looks amazing and the music suits the dark yet colourful world that the protagonist traverses. I've heard people criticise the narration of the game, but I really can't complain as i found the story very ingaging and it kept me wondering what was going to happen next. The games biggest downside, like many indie games like it is probably it's length. Don't expect to get a full 8-10 hour experience out of it like you might with a AAA title, but the 4-5 hours you do get will be incredibly unforgettable. There are also some not story related achievements to go back for and a chance to speed run through some of those tantalisingly difficult puzzles.Overall, Mind: Path to Thalamus is a great gaming experience, with great game mechanics, superb graphics and an engaging story to keep you occupied for hours.For more information and gameplay footage, check out my walkthrough here -

												Mind: Path to Thalamus has an intense story line with odd puzzles. The game is very visually appealing and looks like a work of art; however, I wanted a game where i could wander aimlessly unhindered through beautiful landscapes and not have to do these.... puzzles. I'm glad i bought it though, for the price it's a fun game to go back to whenever i want a challenge in the form of a puzzle. The game should be tagged as a PUZZLE game before adventure, even though some are really simple, i just find them annoying when I want to explore. I still recommend this game, there is really no other game like it.			"

												Ambient and beautiful would be the two words I would use to describe this game. I was disappointed to find that it isn't very puzzling, however, as it lacked a certain ""Myst"" dynamic. The screenshots and videos show exactly how the game looks and plays.I was hoping for more of a puzzle, but it ended up being more of an exploration of art than anythine else. I enjoy the different levels, but could use less ball play and more symbolic brain teaser type action.I still give this a recommendation because it has been made well for what it is.			"

												Mind: Path to Thalamus immediately strikes you with its beauty and unique style, with the added substance of game-play; often lacking in the more “intellectual” “walking-simulator” type games. The dissociative narrative also serves the purpose of this general image, whereby you quickly get grabbed by the intimacy and self-awareness of the story which is also something you rarely come by in games. There is a heartfelt feeling to the game, and the guilt-ridden, grief-struck man we play as is a fairly easy one to relate, in this (his) pandemonium of emotive manifestations. As we traverse the neural pathways, ganglia, creating new paths: new associative links of lost memories, trying to make sense of the traumas, or to yet again connect with the traumas of our past. Exploring happily, in hope of absolving the implied sin, in hope of atonement and enlightenment, we trod along in this maddeningly wonderful world of explicit and poignant beauty. The puzzle design is in itself rather brilliant, apart from my success in “cheating” by my exhaustive attempts at jumping past, over and across different platforms which did not seem to be the correct way of doing things.The gradual introduction of mechanics in different forms, which all – despite the narratives self-hatred and degradation – I considered to be excellent, and surprisingly not too jarring to a world that could suffer severely by the hand of clumsy or all too “game-like” mechanics. As you walk across these shattered memories – and in some situations – traverse that which used to be, or crawl around in the organically ribbed (from centuries of successive rivulets of water) cavernous holes, intestinal and damp; slimy – or flow through between the enormously beautiful skybox, implemented to perfection, and its reflection, on the ocean beneath – or the forests that change color from gleeful green to autumn's golden glow – you can't help to feel a sense of joy, to be in this world, experiencing it: first-hand. The game in a sense, pertaining to level design and set-design, symbolize the disintegration of body and mind, which pertains to the vicissitude of the edifice of both mind and matter – memory and structure, network –, especially so with a contusion on the brain, and in how we perceive matter with this contusion; or perhaps not experience at all outside of our mind, such as with being comatose. What is might not be, but what we grab is tangible, and that is what we work with. . . that is what we have to work with. Any dubious thought, skepticism, will serve to progress us if what was once tangible – or perceived to be as such – turns out not to be. Only the shame and disdain one may feel towards oneself, may not be the progression we were looking for. Some puzzles seemed to be shining lights on a mosaic memory, lighting neural pathways with a mirror: a reflection, of the past or speculative pathfinding. The game switches on you towards the end, and the player, thinking about the symbolic situations and models sprinkled throughout the game, get their speculations happily denounced in thinking any real purpose or profoundness could be found in this game, sounding like a developer gone mad, even thinking it was all an obvious, not-so-creative attempt at clever metaphors. Perhaps I didn't see the pretense in the game, that would warrant such a reaction, but with insecurity comes an aberrative self-awareness, and in the case of this game, it slightly lessened the impact of quiet reflection, that it, before this point, had on me. Mind: Path to Thalamus. . . is pretty neat.*Apparently pretension was deliberate, which makes a lot of sense narrative-wise, and I now have egg on my face, I'll leave this abomination up for the sake of shameful regret.

												This game really failed to capture my attention in the early chapters. You start off hearing a guy scream at a girl you never see, then suddenly you're transported to some abstract reality and just have to wander around until something happens. In order for a walking simulator to be enjoyable (IMHO), there needs to be a captivating story. This game doesn't have that; instead, you get to hear awful voice acting pronounce some pointless dialogue, all of which needs to be manually accessed by walking into a cloud of floating lights. Should you happen to miss any of these, you'll miss out on all of those segments of the story. The story should not be missable! Walking simulators are held together entirely by the story! Even if you manage to hear most of the story, you'll discern that you're in a decade-long coma, but that's about it. By the time the game ended, I had no clue what the story was about.The environments further ruin the game as there is no cohesion between chapters. You simply walk until the level disappears and a new one is loaded. On the one hand, this gives the freedom to create completely dissimilar environments and possibly keep the game feeling fresh, but on the other hand, it makes the game feel like a disconnected series of nonsense. To make that even worse, the game seems to constantly alternate between beautiful environments and downright ugly scenes.Fortunately, I continued playing past the first few game segments and got to some puzzles. This game actually has some decent puzzles, and you don't have to play too long in order to reach them. I wouldn't say the puzzles make this a good game, but it certainly begins to makes up for the complete failure in the ""Walking Simulator"" aspect. I'll also warn you that the game has an equal number of worthless puzzles. One such puzzle is merely ""walk around in fog so thick you can't see anything until you find this small object in a huge area,"" and for some bizarre reason this puzzle appears repeatedly. Also, by the time you start to get a feel for the puzzles and think the game may not be a complete failure after all, the game simply ends. It seems even the puzzles can't deliver enough enjoyment.Other grievances:The game claims Full Controller Support, but that's a lie. Sure, you could use a controller, but there is no way to adjust input sensitivity so attempts to look around feel very, very sluggish. Gamepad controls are so bad that it's almost unbearable. Just use the mouse and keyboard instead.I also hate that I can't adjust the game settings from within the game. You have to restart the game any time you want to change quality or control settings. The checkpoint system doesn't really provide any useful checkpoints, so you're going to have to restart every level should you need to quit the game mid-chapter. This makes for a frustrating start if you're trying to figure out what settings work best for you, such as trying to use a gamepad and then realizing you can't simply switch to keyboard and mouse without first quitting the game, or when you realize that high shadow quality looks ugly and you need to change it to low.

												Played this game all the way through before VR and it was awesome and I can see why it won so many awards.  Then they tacked on VR and totally destroyed it.  The rediculous teleport mechanic totally ruins any immersion the game had.  Graphical glitches.  Puzzles ruined because what you fell through before you can just teleport past.  This is now a disaster even after the fix.  This is based on the vr version			"

												Game was already advertised to support HTC Vive and location-tracked controllers - but it's not fully compatible yet. Upon launching the game, it alters the room scal flooring, disables the steam dashboard from coming up, controls are confusing, graphics settings are inconsistent and buggy (set to All Ultra, but display is is blurry)I hope you guys update this soon, because this seems like a really good game content-wise.

												I wanted to like this game, and at times I did; but ultimately, the longer I played, the more I just wanted it to end. It's an abstract puzzle game, but the puzzles are unsatisfying and the story is too pretentious to connect with. It tries so hard to be clever and obscure that it comes across as corny. It's like, ""look at me, I'm symbolic!"" It's a sophmoric attempt at being deep and artistic. It's not terrible, it has its moments, but there are far better puzzle/story games to play than this.5.5/10			"

												It's as gorgeous as the trailer implies and thus far it seems to be well-paced and pretty fun (though I seem to suck at some of the puzzles and get just a little bit stuck sometimes). As some others have suggested, the game's main issue is that it has a lot of narration and the voice acting is pretty mediocre, ranging from pretty alright in a few places to ""that wizard came from the moon""-terrible in others. Still, an intriguing game, mostly recommendable thus far.			"

												This is a rather first impressions review of this game, and it might change in case I ever bring myself to play this game more. Visually the game is pretty great, but everything else in it leaves a bit to be desired. The story didn't grab me and the lackluster narration didn't help at all. There are some lighting issues here and  there with scenes being too bright or too dark. Some sound effects sound appropriate and nice, but others feel generic or are too loud.Also I have no idea who thinks invisible platforms and clipping through objects are fun puzzle mechanics. Pure excercise in tedium running back and forth drove me away from the game, though I was curious about it.			"

												Even if I'm writing a review for this game I'm still not entirely sure regarding my opinion on it.There is actually just one big reason to play (and enjoy) this game, because no other game lets you move around in fully 3D surrealistic environments just like being trapped inside a Dalí painting and this game does it very well.Everything else is really a hit and miss, puzzles are either too simple or based on ""cluncky"" mechanics, the plot is weird (in bad way) and certain sections of the game are clearly visually inferior to others (which for the most part are visually stunning). Finally the audio compartment is kinda bad.In spite of what I wrote in the last paragraph, I'd still like to recommend this game because the feeling you get from being trapped in gorgeous surrealistic anvironments is just so good that everything else is just ""some annoyance"", and also the price tag is not that high (if this was a 15€ game I most likely would have not recommended it).

												Path to Thalamus was okay. It really feels like it was made by a college student who was trying way too hard to be deep and poetic, but the visuals were beautiful. The puzzles themselves were challenging, but often felt like part of the puzzle was finding all the pieces. Imagine if you had to solve a jigsaw puzzle but one of the pieces was hidden somewhere else in the room.Another issue that I kept running into was that I couldn't tell that things were puzzle mechanics until after I had solved puzzles using them at least twice.For all that said the game was still enjoyable and I played it all the way through to the end. The visuals and uniqueness of the mechanics make up for the rest of the game's shortcomings.			"

												I bought this game because I saw recommendations claiming it was similar to Portal or Talos Principle. It isn't.Those games have intelligent puzzles that make you think. This game has terrible ""puzzles"" that include things like invisible pathways with no logic behind them. You don't have to figure it out. You just have to keep trying until you find the path. It doesn't make you think. It makes you try over and over with no reward.			"

												Really enjoying this game, it has visual eye candy mostly through art design than anything else, sometimes it does feel like it is an Unreal 3 SDK game demo but in a good way. Very creative uses of the engine.The naration is good, the monologue is decent. The puzzles are more subtle than puzzles you find in other games, sometimes it doesn't even feel like a puzzle but as part of the surreal world you are navigating through. The worlds just feel like a Salvador Dali painting, would call this art than most pieces I find in modern art galleries.The cons about this game are technical though and it won't apply to most people playing this, this is just me being a privaliged nitpicker.The resolution of the game only goes upto 1080p So if you have a screen with high res, 1200, 1440, 1600 or like me, 4k then you will get pixely images.There is also no way to change the mouse sensitivity so people with larger screens that have to use a higher dpi on their mouse means it's too sensitive. I was getting headaches after all the fast jerky movements of the camera.Luckily these are easier to fix and the important stuff that makes the game is solid. Recommended.			"

												I absolutely loved this game for its stunning visuals and (seemingly controversially) for its story. The aesthetics of Mind are glorious to the extreme, few games have had me so captivated merely by how they look, but Mind managed it on numerous occassions. Although this can be seen from the screenshots and videos, something which can less easily be brought across in such mediums is the story.Avoiding specifics regarding the story, the way in which the story is presented within the world, and the way in which game mechanics are narratively presented; are near perfect. Whether intentionally or unintentionally (I suspect the former), every element fits neatly inside a cohesive landscape which allows for, and stands up to, analysis of the pretentious sort: If you are prone to such things, I cannot reccomend this game more highly. Even simple positioning and landscape backdrop has been considered thoroughly to give a clear sense of where one is in the world, and assure a sense of progression, as well as maintaining a goal in clear view.Mind is not a tremendously lengthy game, but I found the length to be entirely appropriate, clearly however, if under five hours of play time (making allowances for puzzle solving,) is not enough, then obviously that must be taken into consideration but I would not consider any of that time spent as 'padding'. I have not yet mentioned game mechanics yet much, not because they are inconsequential or substandard, but because they were not what shone through in my experience of the game. Make no mistake, this is an experience that could not have been provided sufficiently by any other medium. But my enjoyment of Mind came overwhelmingly from the destination, and the journey, not the means of travel, but as previously stated the puzzles themselves did not feel contrived.If you are interested in games that ask for some level of analysis, or if you want a game that uses every element to help reinforce a core message, then absolutely buy this game.

												This game was beautiful and surreal and I very much enjoyed it. The atmosphere was very effective and some of the landscapes were absolutely breathtaking. I know some people found that the puzzles were a little easy, but who wants to be stuck on the same puzzle for 3 hours anyway? The level of the puzzles was just right to allow the game to flow and the atmosphere not to get bogged down in one place for too long.I have to say, I was a little disappointed in the narration. For a game that created such surreal and challenging imagery, the spoken portion was just plain and straightforward and uninspired, and the voice acting was frankly mediocre. If you're going to commit to a spooky, mysterious, surrealist motif, but you have a constant voiceover explaining in plain english what all the symbols mean, it does kind of pull the rug out from your whole concept. I can see the inspiration from Dear Esther in places, but Dear Esther was a literary game as much as it was a visual one. The narration left a lot to the imagination, and thinking through the story was a puzzle in itself. I did still enjoy the game very much, and moments of it were absolutely  inspired. I hope to see more from this developer.			"

												My experience playing this game was only after the revised narration was implemented, because of this I have no comparison of the monologue nightmare that some speak of before the changes.The latest version of this game was absolutely stunning to play. Its presentation reminded me of the Myst series, however instead of a journey through a book it's a journey through the mind. The puzzles rely on some basic rules in order to open gateways to the next state of mind. Some parts are more beautiful and relaxed while others are chaotic and jumbled.Puzzle solving relies mostly on using these neuron-looking spheres which, if placed in the right locations, can alter the state of the environment and/or time. Changing states in each world is how you bend the rules of each obstacle to complete the puzzles.I definitely recommend this if you enjoy puzzle games, or even games that focus heavily on atmosphere and story.

												This game is REALLY pretty. The art direction is some of the best I've ever seen in a game (just look at the screenshots). Beautifully surreal and just breathtaking to look at. It's honestly worth it just to see what visuals it will paint on your monitor next. Other than that it's a fun (though at times tedious) first person puzzle/walking simulator (and I use that term endearingly). The story is kind of meandering but it's alright. Everyone seems to hate on the voice acting, and yeah, while it doesn't feel particularly professional, it's not *that* bad. It sounds like a normal person talking. It wasn't enough to take me out of the game at least.So: Amazing visuals, interesting puzzles, passable story and voice acting. Pick it up on a sale or something; it's certainly worth playing through at least once.			"

I was honestly stunned at the incredible environments in this game. I can't honestly remember the last time I just sat and stared at such beautiful locations in a video game world. The game starts off with a incredible sequence and quickly transitions into a beautiful adventure game.

												Mind Can be a beutifully stunning game graphically while also being very annoying.  If you enjoyed the challenge of portal 2 then you'll find this game enjoyable as the developer built the difficulty around Mind based on P2.  The puzzles themselves aren't that difficult, its just the repetition of walking around the same spots back and forth that gets tedious.  There really needs to be a run button at walking back and forth just gets downright boring after a few minutes of walking through the same hallway because you didn't figure out the puzzle the first time.  All in all, this game may be worth the money if you can get it on sale.  I wouldn't reccomend this for 15 bucks as it only has about 4 hours of play time depending on how long you take to figure out each level's puzzles.  The graphics are simply stunning.  I've taken around 25 shots of this game while playing it and they all looked marvelous.  Some textures here and there are questionable though such as small rock surfaces, but most of the game has incredible graphics that shouldn't tax your computer unless its like 5-6 years old.			"

It's rewarding, even if things can be a little confusing at times.

												Just finished this last night. I recommend it, but with a few cautions. First the good....I love the environments, the crazy dream feeling of the locations, the twisted acid trip nature of the game. Very cool and trippy, and just exploring was a pleasure, being in these weird environments. The puzzles were mostly just ok, but occasionally they really hit well, some very clever ones. On the downside, the environments nearly all need to be traversed with the Thinkpad moment. They have implemented teleporting, and it works well, but the distances are huge and teleporting over and over gets tiring. I ended up using a mix of movement modes, and that was successful. The story is pretty obscure, and even at the end I am not 100% sure what the back story was, although that was ok considering the meta narrative. I was crazy and experiencing memory loss, so ok....I don't mind if the story doesn't make 100% sense. Overall I recommend it, especially at a sub $10 price. It will give you plenty of exploration and puzzle solving that is more than the majority of quick demos on the Vive.			"

The visuals are breathtaking in some moments (specially in the second half of the game and some parts of the intro chapter) and the puzzles, while not dificult, too much creative or frustrating, get the job done. I didn't like the narrative at all but the developers were clever enough to let the player skip the narrative at wish, so it doesn't get thrown at you. 8/10 Would recommend.			"

												Mind: Path to Thalamus is a visually stunning yet fairly straight forward exploration puzzler that has a rather literal take on it's  title. The journey you'll undertake is that of a self loathing father working through his issues within his own mind. It's canvas ranging from symbolic manifestations of emotional issues to elaborate and stylistic visual representations of the brain. All of this accompanied by your characters poor attempt at a meaningful monologue. This is where Mind: Path to Thalamus falls short, it's narrative and it's presentation of it. The voice over is so jarring that it pulls you completely out of the otherwise beautiful visual journey. It breaks the narrative in such a way that it feels like nothing more than a college freshman's attempt at writting about life without any personal experience with anything related to the subject matter.If the visuals intrest you, get it when it's on sale. If you're looking for a narrative masterpiece you're better off looking elsewhere.			"

Feels more like a chore than a game.Even from the ""I'd like to relax"" standpoint I can't find how and why I'd recomend this game. Not even to people new to gaming/entry-level.The game features simple gameplay mechanics such as below and it doesn't explore them much at all:Get Ball to put it on a switchTimed switch3 different switches (up to where I played)And the mirror hunt with the water reflected platforms at the beginning which for some reason never makes a return, unfortunatelly for which I found the most challenging/fun part of the game.Have I mentioned that you walk SLOW AS F---?! And that there is a level consisting of a big open field with a lot of fog which forces you to wander, again slow as f-, trying to find your way and only leading into frustration when it fails (which happened to me like 6 times until I gave up).The game's puzzles aren't intuitive at all but that would be fine if it didn't took so long to try solutions out because of the freaking walking speed.tl;dr: Badly designed first person puzzle game with slow sparse narrative with SLOW♥♥♥♥♥GAMEPLAY.

												DISCLAIMER: This review is heavily opinionated, the mechanics of the game itself are not a problem and nor is performance. I didn't have any issues with bugs and I did enjoy much of the gameplay.However I can't in good faith recommend this game. The puzzles are a little challenging, and I did have fun in some parts of the game, the scenery is pretty decent and on the highest graphics the game does provide a visually appealing experience...But the God. Damn. Narration. It killed it for me.. The story was lost on me, it wasn't interesting and the voice over work itself is shoddy at best. Imagine the writing of a depressed kid in grade 9, make that into the story of a game, and voice it by that same kid and boom, you've got MIND: Path to Thalamus. The game strived to achieve some ""deep"" or otherwise thoughtful meaning, but it tried so hard and executed it so poorly that it was cringy. Really disappointed that I wound up spending a few hours watching something with so much promise shoot itself in the foot so many times. Maybe it's just geared to a very niche audience, I recommend watching some let's plays and deciding for yourself before purchasing it.EDIT: I have come to realize that the dialogue in this game has already been edited once. I watched some of the original footage and it was even more profoundly confusing than I could ever have imagined. Props to the developers for at least attempting some damage control. "

												""MIND: Path to Thalamus"", is an exotic visual display akin to Surrealists such as Magritte and Dali at times. The narrative could have been accomplished even more effectively without a voice actor, but all in all the puzzling and art alone makes it a worthwhile purchase and play.			"

												I don't remember exactly where I picked this game up. It was probably in a bundle somewhere, and I had tucked it away in my library assuming I would never install it. It likely came along with another game I wanted, and that was the one that got my attention. I recently decided to take a harder look at a lot of the games I hadn't intended to buy, and while 9 times out of 10 I was perfectly justified in ignoring the title, this was the exception. If you enjoy first-person puzzlers like Portal and Antichamber, combined with rich, surreal landscapes and an immersive story, there is no better way to spend 5 hours than to play this game.			"

												A pretty, and pretty ok, walking sim/puzzle game, with puzzles about in the same vein as Vanishing of Ethan Carter, albeit a bit more repetitive.  Some puzzles seemed broken (one early one involving lighting seems confirmed in the forums) but the game allows you to start at any level, any time so it's not a big issue.Some really interesting visuals at times, particularly a couple corridor/walking stretches.  Biggest problem is the story (a bit trite) and the voiceacting (bad) which undermine the experience, but the game is pretty short and I didn't feel like I lost a couple evenings while sports were on in the background, so if you can get it for under $5 or in a bundle I would consider this a reason to buy the bundle.

												Easily one of the most beautiful games I've ever played, Mind: Path to Thalamus is a very atmospheric experience. Virtually every level consists of surreal, idyllic landscapes and I found myself wanting to simply explore them and postponing actual progress. I've also found the soundtrack to be excellent, matching the visuals perfectly with melancholic piano compositions during well chosen sequences. Ambience sound is present and it too helped in creating a believable, yet dream-like environment.Gameplay-wise, there's not a lot to it. It employs minimalistic puzzles that become progressively more complicated as you progress in the game, but ultimately require, in my opinion, little thinking. There is no inventory; puzzles must be solved by interacting with the available objects in the area, which are very limited in number and variety, resulting in puzzles that never really change much. The game is also divided into levels instead of having a big world that can be traversed and backtracked at your leisure, and each level has a puzzle that must be overcome before you can reach the next one. There's very little exploration to be done, since the levels are either very straightforward or surrounded by quasi-invisible walls in case of the outdoor areas and are functionally simply not very large despite sometimes visually stretching into the distance. In the end, the game felt to me more like a pure puzzle one than an adventure one.When it comes to the story, it's also quite minimal and it's mostly presented via sporadic narration. Unfortunately, I felt the voiced narration actually detracted from the otherwise solitary and cryptic experience; I believe it would have been more interesting if the player was allowed to come to their own conclusions regarding the story, by investigating their surroundings, instead of being handed actual dialogue explaining what happened. That, of course, is purely personal preference.Despite being really short (clocking at around 4 hours) and not living up to my expectations as an adventure game, the atmosphere alone was worth the price of admission for me. The visuals and music are impeccable and I find myself wishing for more games able to deliver an experience like this. If you, too, are an enthusiast for atmosphere in games and are not exactly looking for a big contender in the adventure genre, I believe you'll really appreciate this game.			"

												Although I have more bad things to say about Mind: Path to Thalamus than good things, I enjoyed my time with it and would strongly recommend it for the incredible game world!THE GOOD:(+8)+++The graphics can't be denied, they are beautiful. It's rare to see a game that can make a flat map look so good! I DID notice some disconnected models and floating rocks (not intended), but the artistic direction drowns out these minor flaws.+++The variance in the environment is what really steals the show! You'll start in a town being hit by a tornado, be warped to the Land of Oz with an endless beach, deep caves, expansive fields, floating islands, dense forests, ruins of ice and more!+Puzzles in the game are decent, but easy. Some take a bit of thought, but you should be able to get through it without resorting to a walkthrough.+The Music from the trailer is all you'll hear in the game and it's a very nice piece which fits perfectly! I wish it played more than 2-3 times though. The music is sprinkled throughout the game quite elegantly, but most of the time it's silent. It would have been much more enjoyable with a proper soundtrack though.THE BAD:(-10)---The story is pretty bad. I tried to give it a chance, I really did, but it's the usual ""Main character has issues. That's deep!"" plot you see in most artsy games. Without spoiling anything, the story throws around basic psychology and acts like it pulled a fast one on you with it's ""plot twist"".---The main character sucks and you want him to lose by the end of the game. If only the same amount of care spent on the game world went into the story, this could have really been something special.. instead you're attacked by an annoying voice with fluctuating audio levels that are either too quiet, or so loud they clip the mic. Let me be clear that I don't have a problem with the voice itself, it's the acting. It's no where near the level this game deserved.--The final confrontation (which is a pretty cool scene actually, but it's negative is worth mentioning) has the last boss swearing at you and telling you how useless you are while you try and solve the puzzle to beat him.. cool? His audio even repeats once he reaches the end of the script, resulting in an endless loop until ""you win"".-Walking is too slow for some of the larger environments, especially since some puzzles require backtracking.-This is just a minor complaint, but I found a few of the puzzles cheap.. hiding the required item in a body of water or tall grass where you literally cannot see it isn't a difficult puzzle, it's dumb luck.FINAL THOUGHTS:The story constantly trying to force itself to the forefront gets tiresome and feels more like a personal agenda than an actual plot, but if you're willing to accept it and move on, the game world is worth experiencing. Don't be mistaken though, the world is linear.Ignoring the story, gameplay only suffers from a few abrasive puzzles, otherwise it's executed extremely well. The game lasts about 3 hours which felt perfect! Not too short that you feel cheated, while not so long you don't finish it.Plot or not, this is a rare case where the rest of the game is so tight that it's worth getting anyways!If you're looking for a puzzle game with an imaginative world; get Path to Thalamus. It's right up there with games like Anna or The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, but if you're expecting a beautiful story to go along with it; search elsewhere.=Thank you for taking the time to read this review. I hope you found it helpful! Please excuse my harshness towards the story! You have to play the game to understand how awkward it is.			"

												This game did a brilliant job of creating an amazing atmosphere and presenting engaging puzzles, that aren't all that difficult, but feel rewarding. The only down side is the narrative. It's really good and engaging until the very end, then it becomes pretty lame. They had a great oppertunity to progressively tell the narrative throughout the game and unfold the mystery as you go along through showing rather than telling, but instead we just get a big narrator told exposition at the end that doesn't seem all that congruent or relavent to the rest of the game. All in all, great game, but a missed opportunity on the story.Still would recommend it though.			"

												Good game for troubled people and those enjoy a ethreal theatrical experience. The game itself is a very interesting concept of one mans inner struggle of forgiveness, guilt and overly exerted thoughts. The story's good for people that deal with anxiety and for those who want a very intriguing surreal ""Inception"" like experience. I must warn though, even though the game itself is therapeudic and beautiful; it still had flaws. The flaws consisted in repetition, all though this a personal opinion, It is important for a game to maintain momentum. The game opens up very differently when compared to most games. Path of Thalamus has major transisitions that are surreal and mind blowing. As the game progressed, the puzzles became tiring. I had gained the full feeling of success after every intricate subliminal puzzle. I just grew disappointed to see that the game had not kept the pace of the incredible transitions in the begining. This definitely is a different take on puzzlers, which I respect... I just wish I could run after I would make a wrong attempt at a puzzle. For the price of the game, this has got so much! Most worthy of the 12.99$ price. As a scale of rating, I would give an 8-10.			"

												After reading some negative critiques to the game I saw that many players are maybe a little exigent, maybe because they played too much games so far and is difficult to find something new for them. Since I played Portal I started to love puzzle games, and this one don't just give you a set of puzzles but also a beautiful visual design that you can enjoy while solving them, that's enough for me.Maybe the developer focused more on the story and the visuals than on the puzzles, but that's fine, I hate hitting a too much hard puzzle, the level of difficulty of the puzzles in Mind is appropriate for me, maybe too easy sometimes but I don't care.

												Mind path to thalamus is one of those indie games nicely done, good at mostly everything, but with some flaws to improve. The narrative is one of his weak points, and the first puzzle it's another one. In fact, in one of these puzzles I've recently discovered that the shadows are diffrent from the forms you see, and that's the clue to solve the enigma. But beeing fair, I would have never realized that by my own. Cmon, you must make it clearer. Aside from that, it's a great puzzle game with awesome visuals.			"

												A gorgeous but tedious and mind numbing slog. I'm not very far in, but far enough that the ""puzzle"" design should have evolved about 4 levels ago. They've created a sort of cruel reverse-Sisyphus simulator where you literally just roll balls down hills. For some reason this game has MASSIVE empty outdoor environments, probably for thematic reasons, but it's an absolute chore to walk around in. The top notch visuals lose their charm when you start to nod off after leaning on the W key for 10 minutes. Add to that some pretty bad amateur voice acting and you've got yourself a big waste of my time.			"

												Interesting premise, gorgeous graphics, interesting puzzles but rough execution. Even basic things such as keybindings are not configurable. It seems the VR build has broken the 'novr' version, for example pressing the Escape key will not bring up an option menu but some wierd floating while plane at the left side of the screen... Combine this with unskippable introduction sequencing and the lack of a pause screen becomes infuriating when you have to try different settings to get this thing to work.Currenty one of the chapters has a broken spawn position (probably due to engine change or things changed for VR causing regressions in the non-VR build), this has been confirmed by the developer but it is not known when it will be fixed. :(A portion of the halloween puzzle is also bugged out for a decent amount of players and will be fixed 'next patch'.After all of this I discovered I got none of the achievements, even for very basic stuff. I don't think achievements are very important but it is kind of a red flag for ongoing technical issues if the basics don't even work.			"

												TLDR:-Novel puzzles-Gorgeous scenery-Weak story-Puzzle mechanics are poorly explainedVery pretty, with some fairly clever puzzles.  However, it probably leaves a bit too much to trial and error.  The story is fairly original, but ultimately fell flat for me.It concerns a man who lost his daughter in a tsunami, who has since fallen into a coma.  He's trying to find his daughter in his own mind, and escape from his mental state by solving abstract puzzles in the (really quite beautiful) landscapes of his unconcious.  Interesting premise, however it's delivered entirely through poorly acted voiceover.  The game doesn't really explain much about the protagonist or his daughter (at least in the first half of the game, I didn't finish it), so we don't really have an incentive to care all that much about either of them.  So that really leaves the gameplay as the main drawcard.There are some strong ideas when it comes to puzzles, however much of it fell flat due to the trial and error required to understand the basic mechanics.  I'll explain them, if you don't mind being mildly spoiled on the mechanics.  Essentially, there are areas on the ground that, when stood in, affect the level in various ways.  Patches of white flowers will change the level to night, which opens various portals around the area, and makes balls of light become visible.  Stone circles will bring on the rain, which raises certain wooden platforms.  Tree arches/circles will make the level foggy, but remove spherical barriers blocking paths.  These effects only apply while you're standing in the zones, so you'll need to place balls you find into them to change the states and solve the puzzles.  This also means that if you enter an area and it's already dark, you know there's a ball in a flower patch somewhere.  Once you've figured this out, the puzzle system becomes quite rewarding.  But the trial and error required to get to that point can be irritating.Ultimately, I gave up on playing about halfway through because I wasn't having much fun with the puzzles, and the story wasn't compelling enough for me to continue.  There's definitely promise here though, and I'll be keeping an eye on future projects from this developer.			"

												A boring and uninspired walking simulator where you get to wander around abstract nature environments hear spontaneus 'meaningful' dialogue about how an adult man in a coma who admires his sister or child he named after his sister (who presumably died) for not yet being old enough to be jaded or for being cool depending on which female is possibly being spoken about at the moment.

The gameplay is actually interesting there.   Or one of the many other titles that seem popular like Talos Principle.  If you're REALLY craving your abstract walking simulation experience, maybe try Among the Sleep, or Naissance.Does this review seem harsh?  This game has no gameplay.  The story is barebones and uninteresting.  Even with everything on Ultra the graphics and aesthetic have little wonder, quality, or creativity to impress you with.  Not worth your time or money.			"

Mind brings to mind first and foremost Dear Esther.  Both are tales of a man exploring the concept of loss through imagery and an internal journey across a landscape painted in his own memories.  However there is just as strong a link to Myst: an adventure game where progress is driven by puzzle solving, but where primacy is given to the stunning backgrounds and fantastic, surreal locations through which you find yourself traveling.  The couple of moments of full video integration into the game (which is done supremely well and to great effect) really do evoke the groundbreaking work of the Millers.Before I mention the flaws in this game - and boy are there some whomping great big flaws - I want to call attention to the visuals.  The quality of the art in this game is exceptional.  The whole artistic theme of the game, throughout all the puzzles, all the narrative sequences, right up to the closing credits, is faultless.  Every single part of the world is composed expertly in all directions, including the sky above and the ground beneath your feet (and sometimes also the sky beneath your feet).  If you completely excised the story, the art alone would make for a worthy experience, like walking slowly through a surrealist art exhibition.  I took so many screenshots while playing that I felt like a tourist taking happy snaps.  If they release a big glossy coffee table book of the art from this game I would pay real money for it.  If you're a pixel ♥♥♥♥♥ who gets off on stunning, striking, truly gorgeous art, this game is worth the entry fee on that basis alone.However - and this is a big however - there are several serious flaws with this game which take away from the experience in very significant ways.  As with my review of The Moon Sliver, another worthy but flawed narrative game, I hope that by preparing you for those flaws in advance they will not reduce your enjoyment of the game to the degree they did mine.The first issue is purely one of game design.  The puzzles in this game revolve around moving these gorgeous glowing woven wicker spheres to different places on the map, and about a third of the time you're in the game (or more if you find the puzzles a struggle involving a lot of trial and error, as I did) you'll be carrying one of these spheres, and when you pick one up it fills the centre of the screen, making it hard or sometimes impossible to see what's right in front of you.  In a game as strongly visual as this (and one with so many bottomless holes in the terrain), the decision to give the player what amounts to cataracts for a good portion of the time is a terrible, terrible one.The second major issue is the story, or rather the telling of it.  Without any spoilers, the premise is so incredibly familiar that within the first two scenes of the game you will believe you know the entire plot, and you will be correct.  I'll compare it to Dear Esther again because that's just the most applicable benchmark game when it comes to this type of storytelling.  In Dear Esther the whole game is a blur of the real and the imaginary, you're never sure whether the protagonist is projecting onto his environment or experiencing fantastic elements in his own mind.  Even at the very conclusion of that game those questions are never really answered; it is up to you, the player, to consider the narrative and interpret what you have just experienced and to arrive at an understanding of the game yourself.  The story is masterfully constructed, and respects the old writer's adage that it is better to show than to tell.The writers of Mind: Path to Thalamus set up some imagery that is intended to communicate the bigger themes and questions to the player, but then they convey it all so heavy-handedly that they practically bludgeon you over the head with it.  The biggest spoiler you will ever read for this game is the title of the game itself.  There is a sequence towards the end of the game where all the imagery up to that point is literally explained to you - they have a voice-over sequence that literally lists the metaphors you've encountered and tells you what each one meant.  It is atrocious.  In a game that is visually so subtle and well composed it causes me actual pain to see the story - whose premise is not original but is certainly not bad, and is certainly worth exploring - butchered so bluntly.  Either the authors were so keen that their lovingly-crafted narrative be understood that they could not help but explain it, or they lacked confidence in their writing and over-compensated, or they thought so little of their audience that they felt they needed to be spoon-fed.  I charitably hope it's the former; I hope it's not a case of an auteur game designer too wrapped up in himself to allow the players to control their own experience of his artistic creation lest they experience it wrong.  Whatever the medium, good artistic narrative flows naturally; if you need to put it on rails, you've not crafted the narrative well enough.Although all credit to the developers for the way they handled the release; it has to be noted that when community feedback suggested the story was a bit pretentious, and ""too wanky"", they responded to the critique like true professionals, took that information on board, and deployed changes to the game when there really was no expectation that they would, or should, so they deserve props for that.  For such a new, loose collective they managed such an ambitious project, and its release, impeccably.However putting those two concerns aside, the game is a perfect length and is technically without problems (except for a little screen tearing I couldn't resolve), the puzzles have a gentle gradient that offers a fairly unique challenge that is the perfect mix of simple mechanics guided by logical, deductive reasoning, and as much as the conclusion of the story is mishandled, the final scenes in the game are visually and in terms of gameplay truly epic.  Get Mind: Path to Thalamus to experience walking through a gorgeously detailed, artistically flawless, stunningly beautiful surreal landscape, while dealing with organic, natural, thoughtful puzzles.  If you prepare yourself for the issues with the narrative you will be able to put that aside and just enjoy what is - and I can't use this word enough - the most artistically gorgeous game I've played.Support this game and these developers; even though Mind: Path to Thalamus is flawed, it is still a great game, highly recommended, and the sort of game we need more of.

												I'm in love with this game, all gamer should have a copy of this. First of all the graphics with the environment are awesome you will pass like the 70% of the game looking around, (You can check it on my profile pictures), the puzzles are not too hard but you should take a time for think about it. The game was created too teach you step by step how to resolve the puzzles with the mechanics. Finally, a complicated story what will blow your mind when you understand and maybe here is the only negative point, not everybody will understand it perfectly then for this people the game will be a solver puzzle HD.-Wannabe.

												""Mind"" is one of those games that stand out of the crowd because it was made with heart. It stands out because it is a titanic effort by a tiny team not afraid of breaking moulds with the visuals and with the storytelling. The game is full of relaxing and entertaining puzzles that guarantee you some hours of an interesting experience. I just wished i had the VR equipment to enjoy its visuals and audio in an even more immersive way. I guess i'll have to wait to know what is it like to be between two frozen sea waves...			"

												This is a first person puzzler with some unique puzzles, focusing on changing environmental effects to make your way through.  The story is meh (and the heckling of the final boss really annoyed me), but the environments are beautiful, and some of the puzzles are very tricky in their implementation, albeit usually fair (I did have to get help on a couple).  There could be a little more guidance through much of the game, but other than that, it's a worthwhile melancholy adventure through uniquely beautiful environments with creative puzzles. Not perfect, but definitely worth a look.			"

												I recommend this game, but I'm not overly enthusiastic about it.  I enjoy games in this genre, but this one is a bit opaque.  This game seemingly has some type of story but it is both obscure and weak.  I have played this through to the end (including the Epilogue) and am still left wondering what the heck all that psychobabble was about.  Compared to a similar game like Pneuma: Breath of Life, this game comes up lacking in almost every way.  The narrative is wholly unsatisfying.  The puzzle games are not varied enough and some require a quick reflex response that seems out of place.  MIND is a beautiful game--and what it lacks in narrative it compensates a bit with ambitiousness and uniquity.  I'd recommend it on the strength of the visuals and it's oddness; just don't expect any type of storyline or satisfying conclusion.			"

												This game contains a great dichotomy between the self-satisfaction of a puzzle game with the burden that you (as the main character) are a terrible person. I felt punished, redeemed, guilty, responsible, attached, and devoid of what he was trying to accomplish and/or escape from. It's one of the few puzzle games where the narrative is as compelling and rewarding as the puzzles themselves. Benefits greatly from a willingness to listen and empathise, so definitely play with the sound on. The environments are colorful and varied, and the last few levels in particular are ""stop and look at the skybox"" beautiful.It's only a few hours long, and not overly difficult, so you shouldn't worry about not being able to reach the end. Very much recommended for people who enjoy puzzle games, or who want a short but noteworthy experience.I don't write many reviews, but this game resonated enough with me that I felt the need to put those feelings in writing.

												Interesting game, great visuals, emotional soundtrack. I've been wanting to try this one for a while, so when I saw it on sale, I bought it right away. The gameplay is approximately 4-5 hrs, so for a few bucks, it's well worth it. The trailer sucked me right in, but unfortunately, I wasn't as immersed into the 'Mind' as I thought I'd be... At first glance, the levels look spectacular. But then after walking around for a while, you realize that the level design is usually limited to a small boxed off area (delineated by a picket fence in the game) with invisible walls. All of the backgrounds are just static images, so no matter how long you stare at the gorgeous artful of the sky, there's nothing dynamic about it at all. Some of the puzzles are very clever (I definitely encountered a few head scratchers), but most of them feel a tedious for no reason. The story is also quite confusing, and any in-game 'NPCs' look and feel like they were copied straight from an N64 game. It's too bad because this game had so much going for it, but the static environments, tedious puzzles, rigid characters, and confusing story made it really difficult to fully immerse myself in what the game developers had to offer. Still a great buy to have some fun for a night.			"

												This really is something special.  It's also clearly had a lot of love and care lavished on it, and it shows in the numerous updates since the game has launched to address criticism, and fine-tune the gameplay mechanics.Mind: Path To Thalamus is a really difficult game to nail down.  It could be erroneously referred to as either a puzzle game or (ugh) a ""walking simulator"", but neither would do the experience justice.  Sure, violence is conspicuously absent, and the main mechanical thrust of the game is solving some very clever (but never obtuse or frustrating) puzzles.  However, the game feels like much more than this, due to a very clear narrative thread that ties the various parts of the experience together, making a variety of visually stunning yet disparate environments form parts of an epic journey towards the Thalamus of the title.Of particular note is the frozen tsunami towards the end, which stands out as one of the most visually striking game environments in recent memory, although Mind is full of surreal and mind-bogglingly beautiful environments.  You'll traverse huge expanses of dreamlike field, navigate impossible geometry, fight a behemoth hundreds of feet high, and alter the environment itself.In spite of various criticisms, I also feel the narrative deserves praise for touching on the themes of bereavement and family tragedy in a manner notably absent of sensationalism or tokenism.  You never feel like the game is feeding you sentimentality, which it easily could have.  Although the voice-acting can come across as rather melodramatic, the story being told feels low-key and relatable.All in all, this is a fantastic purchase - a visual tour-de-force with finely honed puzzle-solving gameplay, good story, and a beautiful licensed soundtrack.  Recommended without a shadow of a doubt.			"

												Mind is a beautiful atmospheric puzzle game. In a way it reminds me of games like Dear Esther and Myst where the goal about getting to the end but enjoying the journey.  That said, the levels  are very linear. Ubiquitous hidden walls make the game feel more like a guided tour than  an open exploration. That said, there are still plenty of stunning environments to appreciate. Most of the challenges in the game revolve around understanding and manipulating various aspects of your surroundings.  For example, you might need to change day to night or create rain to access certain areas of the level. The main way of doing this is carrying around large balls which supposedly represent a cluster of neurons. Unfortunately,  this is where one of the games' major flaws comes in. The ball itself is extremely large and obstructs most of your view, making it difficult to maneuver at times. Add to this the fact that pieces of the landscape will frequently catch on the ball, ripping it out of your grip at the worst possible time. But despite all this, it is clear that a lot of love and care went into the baking of this game. It is easy to be drawn into the story as you begin to piece together the various bits from snatches of voice-over. It also bares repeating that the game is visually stunning. Any number of the environments could be considered works of art. If you ignore some of the rough edges here and there then Mind is a short and enjoyable experience.			"

												Though I may sound a little critical, I am definitely recommending this game to those who like exploration, puzzle, and highly narrative games.  It may not appeal to everyone, but those who enjoy this type of game will find it worth their while, even if it is only a short while.As you can probably tell, this game has a strong narrative.  The story is well constructed, and is told very well.  It's not a groundbreaker, but it's easy to care about the character and his struggle.Gameplay-wise, this is a little mixed.  I definitely enjoyed it, though some of the puzzles could be frustrating.  Fairly often I found myself concentrating so hard on the puzzles, especially later in the game, that I had to consciously step back and take in the visuals and atmosphere.  This isn't necessarily good nor bad overall, but I personally would have preferred a little more journey and exploration, and a little less puzzle.  Nothing wrong with puzzles, but the game becomes fairly well saturated with them before long.  Also, when you're carrying things, which is often, they take up most of the screen, blocking out much of the breathtaking visuals.When navigating the terrain, you'll often collide for no apparent reason, but it's not so bad that it ruins anything.  You're always able to get to where you're going.All in all, I had fun playing the game.  Some may complain about how short it is, but I find the older I get, the less time I have to sit and complete something.  So these shorter games are very welcome additions to my library.  While it seems to lack some polish, you'll still look back once you've finished the game and deem it time well spent.			"

												Walking simulator or Puzzle game? Early on the answer is puzzle game but then comes the walking sim part starting from the arduously long cave systems. Then it's a wicked puzzler and walking simulator that really strains your brain and your ability to keep your bearings in difficult foggy terrain and portals that need to be activated. I wish i could give this game a neutral review because it has some very questionable design decisions such as lots of portals and foggy level design in certain levels that has no other purpose other than to confuse the player. (and if player makes the right moves then the dissapearance of fog results in a awe inspiring moment)Low price though and gorgeous graphics and mostly good gameplay puts it from negative to a positive but with some caveats. I recommend this to friends of the genre. If this game type is not your tea then later levels will be both boring and confusing.			"

I feel like running out and buying an even better graphics card just to experience this game on all high settings.In the game (experience?), half the time I was wondering if I was going the right way, but then I ended up in the right spot I think. I'm sure that's all intentional to give you that ""wow I am lost in a weird place"" feeling!I'm not even sure what to call this game because I haven't finished yet.

												Personally, I'm not very good at puzzle games, but after hearing a lot of good things about the mood and art of this game, I decided to give it a try. Not surprisingly, I ended up having to use a walkthrough for some parts of the game, but for me, this game was as much about the beauty of it, as it was about solving the puzzles. Mind: Path to Thalamus is slow-paced and tranquil, which suits this game just fine. The player is taken on a journey, and both the music and the artworks make for a spectacular atmosphere, not to mention some really beautiful scenery. As such, this game might not be the best fit for anyone looking for something more fast-paced and challenging. But if you don't mind a slower pace, I might just suggest you give this game a try!			"

												It was good, for the story that is, the puzzles where easy and felt a bit lacking. But if the game is on sale I would get it for the story alone. So if you are looking for a great looking story game to take some time out of your day this is it. If you are looking for a super challenging puzzle game you might want to look else where.			"

												I wanted to love this game but just couldn't. Yes, it's beautiful. The strength of this game is in its dreamy, neoclassical landscapes that feel like you're wandering through an oil painting. But you can experience most of that beauty in a screenshot. In game, it feels hollow, stretched over an obtuse, lukewarm story and halfhearted puzzle elements that never quite reach Talos Principle levels of satisfaction.The biggest detriment, though, is the sound design. In a game that should feel immersive, the silences are glaringly awkward, punctuated by crashes and screeches set to jumpscare volumes. Meanwhile, the sparse dialogue sound like a mouse monologuing from inside a tin can. They didn't feel like surrealist choices to me. They just felt underproduced.If you go into this game anticipating a well rendered walking simulator instead of a story-driven first-person puzzler, you'll probably get more enjoyment from the game than I did. I don't regret the purchase, but I wish the game had matched its visuals with a better narrative and gameplay.			"

Can switch between keyboard+mouse and controller any time while playing. Some puzzels are acutually thought out and tough to solve. Some puzzles is just dying over and over to finally see the pattern. Other puzzles involve far more walking around to figure out what to do than doing the puzzle itself.			"

												Pros:-Some beautiful environments and excellent atmospheric effects-Only a handful of unique puzzle mechanics that were used well (reminded me of Talos Principle in that way)Cons:-Storyline is underdeveloped and unengaging-Gameplay is pretty dull, LOTS of walking, often in disorienting fog or darkness-Game is too short, I finished in about 3 hours-Was unable to invert X or Y axis using an Xbox 360 controller - ended up playing with mouse & keyboardI played through this in 2 sittings, hoping for some storyline development (or any excitement at all, really) and wound up disappointed. Some of the puzzles were cool and rewarding, and the environmental effects were well-done, but I wish I would have played something else. I think the narration is meant to be mysterious or vague, but it's so poorly done that it was more of a distraction than anything.Buy this game on sale if you're into atmospheric games, but don't expect a good story or any action.

												Changing review from Not recommended to recommended.So I finally figured out how to improve graphics, if you're playing this on VR, you need to launch the game in desktop mode then put everything in the option at ultra as well as the resolution @ 150%. Exit the game then launch it via VR. It should look way better after that.Finally appreciate the graphics as well as the music and sounds included on the game.Game was ok, unfortunately because VR has the option to teleport, it broke some of the puzzles so solving it became way easier. Finished within 2.5 hours so if that is faster than the average, the I definitely skip some of the steps on the puzzles due to teleporting.			"

												Overall, A challenging but intriguing and fun game. Positives:+ Unique Puzzles+ Beautiful, Scenic Views+ Difficulty increase is reasonable+ Background music+ Not too easy, or too hard+ Makes the user think outside the box+ Probe the inner mind, where memories are realityNegatives:- Storyline is not that good- Some puzzles are a complete surprise, since there is pretty much no instruction what to do. At the beginning puzzle I almost gave up simply because I had no idea what to do (I didn't even know it WAS a puzzle). It could use a little coaching at first.- Ending could use some work as it didn't make all that much sense to me (but to be fair this is linked to the story).			"

												*SIGH*  Where do I begin?  I'm sorry, but I did not like MIND Path of the Thalamus and I wouldn't recommend it unless you like psychedelic games that messes with your head.  I like puzzles games based on physics, mechanics, and could possibly exist in some world somewhere.  This game has none of that.  This game can only exist in the Mind... the title should have tipped me off but when I saw the “puzzle” tag, well, for me, that's like a moth to a flame.As with most games, there are pros and cons.Pros:The graphics are very well done (beautiful in some parts)There are several puzzles to solveThe voice acting, although not top notch, is decentThe developers still post updates and answer questionsCons:The story makes little to no senseThere are no mechanics or any way to know how anything worksSeveral times you are fumbling around the dark, fog, etc...Keeping control of items can be frustratingI will say this though, the saving grace for this game is that puzzles are challenging and it will be you busy for awhile.

												Although this game is beautiful, it was very was boring, I finished it in about 4-4.5 hours without even looking for help, I was hoping for a Portal/Talos Principal type game and although it seems like the mechanics start to go there, the puzzles are to simplistic with all but a couple levels mearly taking a minimal amount of common sense since the answers are almost handed to you.. I will not give any spoilers, but then again I am not sure how I could... the story was lackluster and seemed piece-mealed together, with an ending that was, well, stupid. I had to play through the last level a second time to watch it again to make sure I didn't miss something and I didn't. EDIT: After watching some Youtube videos of gameplay, it seems the Linux version is missing some pieces, including the ending and quite a bit of dialog. I am still not changing my review, as the ending seems very simple and weird, but the Linux version just leaves you hanging, at least the Windows version video I saw had something of an ending to wrap things up. For under $3 it might be worth it, just for the scenery and beauty of the game, but it isn't worth more than that. To be honest, I would only get it when it's CHEAP (which I did, $2.24 or something like that) or not bother getting it at all.Oh, and I just realized I didn't get ANY achievements... nadda, ZERO... and if you have played the game and read the achievements, it is impossible not to get several achievement just by normal game progression. So the fix to fix the fixes didn't work, it is still broken.			"

												I was under the impression that this was a puzzle game but after playing it for almost an hour, all I got out of it was incoherent monologues and chasing some balls.The few puzzles I did encounter were not terribly well designed and felt frustating to solve, mostly because no end goal was ever communicated beforehand. Y'know, like good puzzle games tend to do.Also, MIND has a weird volume issue where certain sounds (chimes, for instance) are way, way too loud compared to everything else. Around the time I stopped playing I had reached green plains and waterfalls and the badly looping and much too loud rain sound effect stopped along with all other audio. I guess that was the best thing that happened during my playthrough.			"

												An occasionally great looking game that suffers greatly from an uninteresting story, questionable design choices and technical difficulties.At times the levels look good (sometimes even amazing) and other times it brings me back to the 90’s where long hallways with repeating textures where commonplace. The quality of the levels is inconsistent to say the least. Even the pretty levels quickly lose their appeal if you walk from the ball to the place to put the ball. Walking through these fast landscapes becomes tedium quickly. I feel that with better level design they could have prevented the walking simulator tag.MIND had some weird bugs for me that I find hard to believe no-one in testing noticed. Once, I reloaded a level I couldn’t find the solution to and it suddenly turned nighttime (now finishing it was easy). I was able to ‘quake-jump’ up mountains, around portals and up the whirlwinds, sometimes allowing me to create my own shortcuts. Looking down allows the camera to clip through walls.Whilst I feel that the voice actor did his best with the material given to him, the story failed to make me care about the characters. Being in a coma with regrets seems to be a popular theme in walking simulators, to the point where it almost seems cliché.When a level has weird mechanics, or a giant colossus slowly stomping towards you, the game is genuinely interesting. When it’s not, it’s bland and sometimes tedious.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but I was unable to.I discovered the game because it was on sale on Chrono.gg. I'm into these kinds of games, and at the price it was asking I decided to give it a go.The main problem for me was the game made me feel physically ill at times. The camera is so low to the ground it feels unnatural and it was nauseating. I wasn't playing in VR either. Just playing the game as is, and it made me feel sick several times. I managed to finish the game, but I had to do it in small intervals to avoid feeling sick. At first I thought it may have been the FOV, but after messing around with the FOV settings several times I concluded that wasn't the issue. I wish there had been a way to adjust the camera height. You're playing as a grown adult man but it feels like you're crawling on the floor for most of the game. It made my personal experience quite unpleasant, though from reading other reviews I seem to be the only person who had this kind of issue.As for the rest of the game... It's nice but nothing to write home about. The puzzles weren't overly impressive, the story is so-so, and the game is severely lacking some kind of sprint button. I feel like that option isn't available to us because of how short the game is, so sprinting was removed to artificially increase the length of the game. And not being able to sprint really made some areas tedious.For me the ending really dragged on too. It was likely trying to be artistic and evocative but for me it just came off as annoying.The majority of users seem to have had a positive experience with this game, and I'm truly envious of that and happy for them, but based on my own personal experience I just can't recommend this game.

												First off I have to say that the aesthetic is stunning, it is a graphically impressive game if nothing else. The puzzles were also creative in design if perhaps overly obfiscated, along with the occasional physics based hiccup in the execution. The main wrinkle and why I am giving this a non-recommend is that it's primarily a narrative game, and the only thing I can remember about the narrative is that it was pretentious, extremely pretentious, pretentious beyond any and all reason. And I haven't even gotten to the narrator yet.If you find yourself muting a story based game, you KNOW there is a problem.			"

												Made by Spanish developers, Mind: Path to Thalamus is a game that looks like it will be a ""walking simulator"" (an atmospheric adventure based on exploration) but turns out to be just as much a first-person puzzle-platformer that took me 6-7 hours to finish.  Let's imagine for a minute that everyone accepts Portal as the best first person puzzle game and Gone Home as the best exploratory adventure, even if that's not true.Mind's title is a clumsy reference to memory or consciousness, as this is a story about your sister, your daughter, your father, a tragedy or two, and a coma. Unlike Gone Home, you don't find pieces of the story or read anything.  It's all told through fragments of voiceover as you progress.  The story isn't as interesting (or clear) as in Gone Home, so it doesn't compel you to move forward as much as it could, mainly because it's all pretty abstract.What will drive you forward is the desire to figure out each environmental puzzle so you can see the next breathtaking area.  The sights are amazing, so it's a bit surprising when you start to realize they are huge environmental puzzles.  There are elements of physics and jumping involved, but your only real way to manipulate the world is in where you walk and where you place a series of spheres you find in each level after passing the first few areas of the game.The puzzle design ranges from good to great, but not consistently great (by comparison, I'd say Portal and Portal 2 had consistently great puzzles).  There are red herrings and glitches and some twitchy physics which end up making you feel really smart but also a little lucky or relieved when an area turns frustrating because you keep dropping the sphere when you run into things, missing timed jumps, or wondering if you broke the level and need to restart.  These types of puzzles are most satisfying when you can see the rules of the world, figure out a plan, and execute it (see Portal).  Mind has some of those moments and, for me, others where I'm not sure if I did what the developers expected.  All in all, though, there are clever clues that point to a solution and there are fail-safes in place that usually keep levels from breaking.The final confrontation, if I am to avoid any worse spoilers than the Steam achievements themselves, is far too much like a boss battle for this kind of game, and more than any other levels, the several battle-themed levels feel unfair and frustrating.  I was glad to finish them and the payoff wasn't worth it.  The developers included several achievements for not getting killed in these levels and I didn't get any of them.  Good luck with that.In conclusion, the graphics are impressive, smooth and colorful and the puzzle progression is unique.  The puzzles are almost great even though the story is not.  I can see people buying this game and quitting as soon as they realize it's a series of brain teasers, so be warned.  On the other hand, if you want a pure Portal clone, there are other first-person puzzlers out there that are probably less aggravating.  If, however, you've wished that all those walking simulators would replace some of the story with some environmental puzzles, this game is a beautiful choice.			"

												Played through the whole thing and while there's good in there (the scene with the giant) but the overall experience just felt a little shallow. Some of the puzzles are nice and took me a while to realize what the solutions were, one scene (the fog) had me so frustrated I wanted to quit but I pushed through and felt rewarded (which I felt is what the scenario intended).There are a number of areas that could use polish, some of the audio is quite bad, and it needs an extra layer of love in terms of texture quality and placement of objects, some textures were low resolution even on ultra as well as objects and foliage floating. The story is OK, but for me the voice over was very off putting and perhaps the story could have been told via other means. A minor gripe but, apparently I press ""Escape"" to move backwards through menus a lot but in this game it immediately quits the game, quite frustrating after the 20th time.I'd only really recommend this for the scene with the giant, I really enjoyed that.

												Path to Thalamus is more a puzzler than a peacefull exploring game which I origionally thought it was. The puzzle's are brilliantly linked to the key premise of the game as it tells the story. The story is that of a man in a coma who has lost his daughter due to a natural disaster - by very quickly the game takes you on a journey into the subconsious mind of the coma patient. Trapped, but still free to roam but not able to interact, untill you discover the glowing orbs.Smooth and pleasing to re-play gameplayThe voiceover was not that great in the version I played a year ago, but if you turn it off (I assume its been updated by a recent patch) this is a really good game full of emotion and depth.3/5			"

												Well, reading how one liked or disliked the game is usually useless, unless that someone either provides plenty of unbiased facts about the game, or puts his/her views in perspective. Giving out facts about Mind would not be fair to this game, so I'll just say that this is my top 5 favorite game of all time next to Quake, HL2, Portal 2 and probably some other game I can't recall right now (Colin McRae Rally ;))). I even like this game's moderate length (hate long and open world games). The theological themes were worrying in the beginning (I'm an atheist), but, at least imho, all turned out well in the end, just as expected. Overall, this is the game that you can show to your friend who hates all computer games and thinks they're for infantile imbeciles only.Yes, it is far from perfect. Yes, the flow does get broken in places, because you're just not used to this kind of puzzles (and there's one super irritating jump to make). But as a surreal first person puzzlers go, it is brilliant. I fully expect it to be surpassed pretty soon though, as every other genre-first was surpassed in its time. And it is great! First person gaming was becoming too stagnant, too predictable, too dumb, but with games like this one it's getting exciting again.			"

												Visually and sonically beautiful, it definitely plays scale, minimalism, and surrealism to its benefits. Plenty of interesting puzzles to go along with the environments, though it only took around 3 hours to get through all of it. Considering the gameplay pacing, I'd say this was appropriate. I'm not totally sure what parts of the acting and script people were complaining about, so it must be fixed by now. Granted, the story could have done more with the emotions that it set up.Anyway, it was overall a very positive experience for me. Keep in mind, it's probably not for everyone. If you like more aesthetically-minded games and don't mind a lack of much action, you should appreciate it. If you're looking for fast-paced, look elsewhere.			"

												What a great game. Very symbolic, with a good plot. Some of the puzzles become tedious so it's best to space gameplay out into a few sittings. The visuals are gorgeous though.One area of improvement would be the script. It starts off alright, but the end comes suddenly and sort of throws everything in your face. Some concession should be made as this game was made by a Spanish game development team.			"

												Aesthetically, this is a superb game - the visuals and the OST are astonishingly outstanding. In fact, the MIND world was so immersive, I wouldn't mind if it were a pure walking simulator with no actual gameplay at all, because what the environment and the atmosphere of the game delivered had already exceeded my expectation and impressed me thoroughly. It's so beautifully crafted that it can potentially relieve stress and anxiety, just as it did for me. Imagine walking on a vast meadow along a clear stream, listening to the sound of pouring rain, accompanied by the gentle thunder every now and then...nothing beats this kind of feelings my friend.However, if I have to comment on the gameplay, I would say, it's far less satisfying as the aesthetics. After all, this is mostly a puzzle game, whose genre relies heavily on level design and mechanics, but sadly, it falls short on these very aspects in my opinion. The levels feel like kind of a mess - some are very short, just go through a couple of portals and you're done, while some are fairly challenging, you might need to figure out a specific sequence of actions and time your moves as well. Normally, you would expect the difficulty and the length of a level to gradually increase, instead of being random or taking leaps, but in MIND, the pacing does feel a little bit off. As for the mechanics, they're interesting and quite esay to grasp. The problem is, there're only 4 main types of puzzles throughout the 4-5 hours of experience, which could get a bit repetitive as you progress further, and there's not much of out-of-the-box thinking involved, besides following the rules and control your timing. Overall, the gameplay is alright, it's just not that impressive. When it comes to the story, I don't have much to say - you'll find fragments of memories or thoughts of the main character in the game which slowly unveil the whole plot. In short, the story follows the protagonist's journey through his uncousious mind and his inner struggle of finding peace and forgiveness which awakes him from his coma and brings him back to his counsiousness. There're also some technical issues I want to point out. First of all, it's the optimization. My PC has no problem running other much more system demanding games but it gets a low general fps on this one and some frame drops from time to time. Another one is the subtitles, some disappear too quickly, some have no spacings, and there're also some being complete nonsense. It doesn't affect the experience but it wouldn't hurt fixing them right? I also found a bug in one of the extra Halloween levels, in which an element needed for solving the puzzle kept dispawning, making it impossible to progress, and eventually I gave up trying.That's all I have to say about MIND: Path to Thalamus. Despite its flaws, I did enjoy it and I recommend it to those who care for an atmospheric, light-hearted experience.			"

												This is a walking simulator. An excellent, gorgeous, immersive, brain-teasing and touching walking simulator.With magnificent lighting effects and sky textures, beautiful landscapes, geniously designed, intuitive and not mind-boggingly difficult puzzles, and an ultimately fascinating storyline-gameplay paralellism created from a just-above-average heart-breaking story, this game should be an instant favourite for people who are interested in topics like family, loss, human nature, psychology, etc. The game's beauty is only surpassed by the feeling of authenticity it provides.I'm basically out of adjectives.TL;DR: Great game, recommend!

												Beautiful level design, wonderful music, incredible visuals, clever puzzles. The story is intriguing... for the first three quarters of the game. All of a sudden the plot becomes extremely literal and the voice acting seems to take a nose dive. I'm assuming I'm playing the ""Enhanced"" version, so it's a shame that they still didn't get this quite right.  In saying this, I thoroughly enjoyed two and a half of the three hours it took me to complete MIND, and can still highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys slow paced puzzlers. Please make more games, Carlos Coronado - you're very good at it - but please find a decent writer and voice over artist.EDIT: 11-10-15 - No I was not playing the Enhanced Edition (which apparently only just been released. This makes me more hopeful!). It's also important to note that I *STILL* have a screenshot of this game as one of my backgrounds - it's just that beautiful.			"

												Love this game, A trippy VR experience not to be done on Acid!, It's very similar to Talos Principle in it's handling of first person puzzles, Instead of lasers etc you now have weather, areas of effect, and magical orbs to play around with, The puzzles are easy then get a bit mind numbing but never to hard that you rage quit, It's just an enjoyable game to experience in VR and is a must purchase if you have a Vive, Using the Vive controls is a bit tricky and I stuck with a Xbox controler which made the game much more friendly to play, It's continuous movement and makes you feel a little odd if standing up, but seated is great and left me with no ill effects, The story is told in snippits of dialogue you find around the world and is an accompaniment to the gameplay, all in all a great ride. 8/10			"

												This was a good 5hr VR game. Played with the Rift and X-Box One controller the game is good both standing up and sitting down using the ""comfort mode"" view snap head adjustments with the bumpers. Unfortunately, as with most first person VR games it also has the analog view adjustments that all VR games should do without. Overall the abstract story makes you wonder and the gameplay puzzles are entertaining.			"

												I love this game.PROS:Performs very well on my 'VR ready' PC - smooth with high frame rates.Looks gorgeous.Nice music.Refreshingly non-violent, emotional journey; with some really magical and relaxing sections.Supports the Vive HMD natively.Supports WASD input so I can use the Virtuix Omni and move naturally without sim-sickness.Can quickly switch between levels from the outset.CONS:A recent update seems to have introduced a bug on the first level that makes my POV too high - hope that'll get fixed soon.Doesn't have hand tracking via the Vive controllers (it was developed before these were available, so that's understandable).The puzzle solving may not be to everyone's liking (this is not an action game, and is focussed on atmosphere - it may feel sparse to some), but I enjoy it and for me this game is more about the feels anyway.Doesn't use the Omni's SDK for fully-decoupled navigation (this has only just been released, so wouldn't expect it to yet).One of the mechanics in the game (where you get flung across distances by something) isn't very VR friendly, but again this game was not originally developed for VR, so this is to be expected.Be aware this game has free-roaming locomotion (the best kind!) and so you may experience sim-sickness if you don't have a motion platform like the Virtuix Omni. Unfortunately, some people may be giving this game a worse review than it deserves because A) They're not playing it in VR, so not getting the atmosphere, B) They're playing it in VR but without a motion platform so they're getting sick. Not criticizing those reviews, just noting it's a bit sad to see this game get a lower score than I would expect from my experience of it.I recommend getting an Omni to play this (and many other games), so you can turn off the chaperone lines safely, and there is even a way to remove the floor outline for maximum immersion. Here's a video of me playing some of the levels with it:

												Mind: Path to Thalamus is described as a surreal first person puzzler in which you control your environment to advance. But is it really so? Let's find out.The game follows the psychological journey of a comatose man through his own mind to reach conciousness. You will visit strange landscapes where you will be required to solve puzzles to advance. As you solve them, the man itself will reveal glimpses of what happened. Decent yet predictable story and good voice acting. No complains on this point.Let's move on to gameplay mechanics. You are suposed to change the weather to solve the puzzles, and you do it by placing yourself or some balls you will find in certain easily identifiable places. The way it helps you follows some weird logic, but a logic after all, and considering the setting of the game, this is not necessary a bad thing. I mean that the efects of the elements you control are not what you would expect. For example, fog removes some barriers, and night reveals some objects and activates teleportation gateways. In the end, the puzzles are reduced to find the balls and place them in the right order. In my opinion, this oversimplifies the game. I would have prefered that they came up with a more elaborated way of controling the environment. Another problem I see here is that the puzzles don't start to get hard until almost the end of the game.On the audiovisual aspect, I cannot but praise the developers. The game is really beatiful, the landscapes are well designed (although some better than others), and the atmospheric sounds get you into the game.In conclusion, I would say Mind: Path to Thalamus is a good game, with awesome ideas but with a gameplay not implemented in the best way. It is still fun to walk around and solve the puzzles (especially the last ones), but considering the duration (around 4 hours), my opinion is that the price is not worth the experience. I'm giving thumbs up because I enjoyed the game, but having payed 3€, not 13€. If you like first person puzzles, this is a quite good one, and I recommend it if it goes on sale. At full price, think twice.			"

												Mind: Path to Thalamus is a puzzle game with a narrative. I was on the fence about buying it, as I thought it would be another ""walking simulator"" of just walking through a story line, but ended up buying it on a sale. (TL;DR pro/con list at the end)I was completely off on the ""just another walking simulator"" notion. The types of puzzles in this game are original, well thought out and progress in difficulty. There was only one puzzle near the end that I had to look up, but I was close and I would've gotten it with a bit more time. The puzzles involve four different ""areas"" where you can place an orb to accomplish something:- Night, which allows you to use gate ""portals"" to teleport to other ""portals"" and allows you to use a second orb that's only available in night ""mode""- Storm, which raises platforms to allow you to access higher areas or cross gaps- Past, which rebuilds broken structures- Fog The Scenery is amazing and almost every level is screenshot-worthy. I was really blown away with the visuals.Here's a list of pros and cons:Pros:- Amazing visuals- Pretty good story line- Original, fun puzzlesCons:- A couple puzzles may make you feel lost like you don't know what to do next. obviously it's a puzzle and it's expected, but I can think of one level that was somewhat large and I felt lost for a bit.- Somewhat short. Obviously playtimes will vary based on how fast someone can solve the puzzles, achievement hunting, looking at scenary, etc, but I was expecting more.tl;dr: Awesome game - unique and fun puzzles with a great story and narration, but somewhat short. If you're on the fence about this game, pick it up on sale.			"

												This is a fantastic puzzle game with an engaging story and fantastic voice acting, especially for an indie game!  The visuals were seriously impressive (I would often stand around looking at all of the details) and the puzzle mechanics are creative and just plain old fun.  There is the occasional glitch (for some reason, I had a hard time keeping a grip on the nerve clusters.  They would just fall out and roll away.  I would be doing certain puzzles over and over just because of that issue) but it's hard to tell if it was just my computer being a turd or an actual gameplay issues since other people didn't seem to have the same problem.  Regardless of the glitches, it's a fantastic game and I HIGHLY recommend it to people who love story-based puzzlers.			"

												I recommend this game to puzzlers, and people who can appreciate the good moments without being dragged down too much by the... lame ones.The puzzles are brilliant - top class in my opinion. They get steadily more tricky, and will have you thinking how to solve them for a few minutes (at least). The ""four mirrors"" in the desert, especially, were just gorgeous. Art in puzzle form, elegant, confusing, mind twisting. (but not at all frustrating)The puzzles though, are not in every level. Sure you have to ""solve"" a few levels, but mostly they're rather pathetic puzzles of the form ""find the ball"". About 1/5 of the levels are good puzzles, the rest are walking simulator/find the ball.Art varies in a similar way. Some of the levels will take your breath away - espcially on load, when the ""viewpoint"" is so perfectly chosen it could be a painting. The other levels are interesting/pretty, but not in the same league. Once again, it's a mixture, some of the levels look superb, some are boring. I'd maybe say half-half here, so more consistent art than puzzles.Level-character interaction is probably the weakest part of the game. Some points have you walking excessively long boring tunnels or grasslands for no real benefit, or ""exploring"" fog because you chanced to miss a fog ball. These long dry patches detracted and ""bordered on boredom"" at times.Music is passable, narration is... weird. It's an intersting story (kind of cliche but it works, and that's ok), and it ties things together... a bit. Come for the puzzles and the occasionally breathtaking artwork.In summary, the game is partly superb, and partly dull. If you can gloss over the dull parts (and make no mistake, they're not bad - just boring), you'll be left with excellent memories of pretty environments and aha-moment puzzle solving.[Oh, and this isn't a walking simulator. It's certainly a puzzle game (too). Gone Home has a better story but zero puzzle solving. It has some things in common with AntiChamber, and almost nothing in common with Stanley Parable]			"

												MIND: Path to Thalamus is a narrative puzzle experience.Design & ArtThe most obvious strongpoint of this game is its design and art. When I first played the game, it really drew me in instantly. I have never seen more beautifully crafted worlds and places in any game I played. Fitting color palettes, light and ethereal music support the visuals of the game positively.ControlsThe controls are pretty straightforward; if you played any shooter in the last century, you’ll have no problems whatsoever. You play from First-Person-perspective.Sound & MusicSounddesign is well managed and fitting. The music supports the game, feels well placed in concordance with most of the visuals and enhanced the gameplay.GameplayThe puzzles (which are the fundamental basis of this game) are forgiving enough at the beginning and get procedurally harder during the game. You can solve them with pure wit, sometimes you need trial and error (which, in my opinion, is rather a last resort than a viable solution to a problem). I have to note that most of the puzzles also require a LOT of walking. Solving a puzzle for the first time will take some duration and tenacity, since there is no running option in the game.WeakpointsThe game seems rather simplistic in its design and gameplay which positively supports the game, but that same simplicity also mortifies “Path to Thalamus”.The narrative part of the game is a very interesting topic (human psychology of loss and grief), yet its execution feels shallow and amiss. During the game, you rather scrape than plunge into said topics. The narrative picks you up at the beginning, but loses itself during later parts of the game. The voice acting feels cringeworthy at times and didn’t make me feel immersed enough. I guess the common disliking of the narrative part of the game lead to its near complete removal of the story in the “enhanced version” of the game (it is optional now, you don’t need to listen to the story). One of its weakpoints is fairly common among story-driven games: Replayability is completely out of the question, just like in Frictional Games’ “Amnesia” and “Penumbra”-series.And speaking of the devil, the “enhanced version” of the game (which was introduced recently) is the biggest thorn in my side. Holy hell. I bought and played the game before the new version and liked it to a certain degree. The “enhanced version” really ruined it for me. The game now runs more badly than before, I get way less Fps than before on the same settings, yet my hardware hasn’t changed. My PC fulfills all of the recommended settings. Not only that. At the same time, the graphics are now worse than before! How could this happen? The game is now more colorful than before, contrasts are higher (to a degree in which I couldn’t even see in the darkness, where before I could), my native resolution is now not supported by standard (What the frick?!), handling of objects feels worse and the ending and certain puzzles have been completely reworked.Concluding ThoughtsI really enjoyed the journey through someones elses mind. I can toss aside bad storylines by simply ignoring them. If you are a person, who enjoys beautifully crafted worlds and light puzzle solving, I urge you to get this game and install the old version of it (game options under steam -> betas -> old_mind). I cannot and will not support the new version of the game, since it feels worse than the unenhanced version. Don’t let yourself get fooled by this game's looks, while being beautiful, its narrative feels unstructured and messy. A real shame, because I want to love the game on both of these aspects. Yet I still enjoyed the game to a certain degree. Enjoy with caution. Do not play the new version if you want a decent experience with the game.			"

												Mind: Path to Thalamus is a fantastic example of what the indie development scene is capable of producing, from the gorgeous visuals right down to the engaging story. Whilst a story-driven indie puzzler might not be everyone’s cup of tea I feel Mind: Path to Thalamus would stand well just on its mechanics alone, with the inventive mechanics requiring more than passing glance to understand fully. It might not be a perfectly polished gem however Mind: Path to Thalamus expertly delivers on the goals it set out to accomplish and is definitely worth checking out if you’re a fan of the genre.Read my full review here: http://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2014/08/15/mind-path-to-thalamus-how-many-times-will-i-kill-her/ "

												Story:This is game about a guy in coma suffering from guilt. He wanders a surreal place in search of the thalamus reminding me of Dali, Myst or Inception at times. Gameplay:You walk at a rather slow pace through a pretty landscape and solve easy-medium puzzles (never took me more than 15 minutes on one) where you basically drop balls on switches that change day to night or sun to rain and so on. Some balls only appear at night, some bridges can only be crossed by rain and balls roll down when placed on a slope etc.I estimate the game takes around three hours to finish.Execution:The visual presentation looks gorgeous though in detail the foliage on the trees is somewhat flat. Piano music is serene and fits very well. Script and voiceover have been criticised by others - I think it's decent, he's in coma after all. The puzzle elements and the surreal setting sets the game appart from simple walking simulators like ""Dear Esther"" (which bored me terribly). Can recommend to friends of casual ambient puzzle games.			"

												This is a game that lets your fantasy run wild. For a little while. Mind is on its way to become something great and memorable for years, with stunning visuals and breathtaking surroundings. But this is sadly where it stops, as the story is not only forced on you, but it is, at best, mediocre. And the narrator that keeps nagging in the back of your head as you try to enjoy the mystical world full of brilliant puzzles feels a little like a b-student at a seemingly failing theatre school, trying his best to maintain a pretentious plot with feelings that just dosen't seem true. But despite this, the game has the makings of greatness, and is a must-play for the visual brilliance that Coronado has achieved. Its like exploring a painting in depth, literally.			"

												At the risk of using trendy terms, I guess this is a walking simulator. It's not quite a point and click, as you don't interact with too many objects with the exception of an oversized ball that looks like a dendrite and axons.The ball is used to change the environment to solve puzzles.Overall, I really liked the game. Any sense of tedium is killed by the truly awesome visuals.My criticisms echo some that are in the negative reviews: i.e. cheesy voice acting and the brevity of the music.Overall the sound is exellent, but I think the game could have benefited from a full soundtrack.

												I can absolutely recommend this game as an incentive to fine-tune your PC. To get it working, I had to fix a long-lasting issue with Windows update my PC had for several months now and install 2.5 GB worth of patches. Some of them manually, piece by piece. My Win 8.1 is now fully up-to-date, protected as best MS can offer and double-proofed against Win 10 spam.The game itself is ok but not extraordinary – interesting landscapes, sort of original puzzles, ok-ish sound and average graphics. It has a story, not particularly deep, but better than some Hollywood movies nowadays. Pretty impressive for a game developed by 3 people, who still check the discussion boards and seem to be doing their best to fix the bugs. More than can be said for most AAA titles.All in all, I found the installation process more engaging and offering a broader range of emotions. It lasted longer than it took me to finish the game, too, give or take 30 minutes that I wasted because an orb was stuck in my hands or something like that.			"

												Absolutely beautiful game, beautiful soundtrack, challenging puzzles. Only negative was lack of direction for some of the puzzles and when it would ramp up in difficulty suddenly. But enjoyable and with the graphics being so pretty, I didn't really mind when I was stuck.			"

												Aesthetically, this is a superb game - the visuals and the OST are astonishingly outstanding. In fact, the MIND world was so immersive, I wouldn't mind if it were a pure walking simulator with no actual gameplay at all, because what the environment and the atmosphere of the game delivered had already exceeded my expectation and impressed me thoroughly. It's so beautifully crafted that it can potentially relieve stress and anxiety, just as it did for me. Imagine walking on a vast meadow along a clear stream, listening to the sound of pouring rain, accompanied by the gentle thunder every now and then...nothing beats this kind of feelings my friend.However, if I have to comment on the gameplay, I would say, it's far less satisfying as the aesthetics. After all, this is mostly a puzzle game, whose genre relies heavily on level design and mechanics, but sadly, it falls short on these very aspects in my opinion. The levels feel like kind of a mess - some are very short, just go through a couple of portals and you're done, while some are fairly challenging, you might need to figure out a specific sequence of actions and time your moves as well. Normally, you would expect the difficulty and the length of a level to gradually increase, instead of being random or taking leaps, but in MIND, the pacing does feel a little bit off. As for the mechanics, they're interesting and quite esay to grasp. The problem is, there're only 4 main types of puzzles throughout the 4-5 hours of experience, which could get a bit repetitive as you progress further, and there's not much of out-of-the-box thinking involved, besides following the rules and control your timing. Overall, the gameplay is alright, it's just not that impressive. When it comes to the story, I don't have much to say - you'll find fragments of memories or thoughts of the main character in the game which slowly unveil the whole plot. In short, the story follows the protagonist's journey through his uncousious mind and his inner struggle of finding peace and forgiveness which awakes him from his coma and brings him back to his counsiousness. There're also some technical issues I want to point out. First of all, it's the optimization. My PC has no problem running other much more system demanding games but it gets a low general fps on this one and some frame drops from time to time. Another one is the subtitles, some disappear too quickly, some have no spacings, and there're also some being complete nonsense. It doesn't affect the experience but it wouldn't hurt fixing them right? I also found a bug in one of the extra Halloween levels, in which an element needed for solving the puzzle kept dispawning, making it impossible to progress, and eventually I gave up trying.That's all I have to say about MIND: Path to Thalamus. Despite its flaws, I did enjoy it and I recommend it to those who care for an atmospheric, light-hearted experience.			"

												This was a neat, if fairly pretentious, puzzle game.The puzzles themselves were somewhat clever, and I enjoyed the environments. I didn't encounter too many bugs, although I did manage to get myself stuck one time behind a portal with no way to finish a level because I had moved one of the ""night"" balls to the wrong spot and accidentally got it killed with no way to get it back. I was able to restart the level from the menu, however, and that cleared it up.One minor complaint is that the first proper level of the game is not entirely intuitive in that the mechanics of how things work and what you're to do are never explained, so it does take a bit of futzing around before you figure out that you're supposed to drop those balls inside the tree ring to progress.My biggest complaint is, I suppose, the writing and voice-over work. The dialog is that of a super-bitter cynic, and it starts to grate fairly quickly.That said, I'd definitely recommend this both for the visual presentation and the puzzle aspects. Once you get into the mindset of how the puzzle mechanics work, things start moving along at a pleasant pace. If you can ignore the pretentiousness of the narrator and his babbling about the tree of Thalamus, you'll have a pretty good time.Recommended: 4 out of 5. "

												MIND: Path To Thalamus feels rather deep at times. It dares to reach out and touch you on an emotional level with brutal honesty and harsh realism. And even long after you’ve walked away from the screen, the experience resonates within you. By living through a single man’s never-ending nightmare, you learn that the path to redemption lies not in walking backwards through a path covered with eggshells, but in looking inward.

												Gameplay (7/10)This game has really well done puzzles. You have a relatively small set of game mechanics, combining them in creative ways to get through the next gate. This makes it similar in spirit to Portal's design, minus the dexterity. Puzzles tend not to be all that difficult, but are set up in such a way to be solved by honestly figuring them out and not by the frustrating trial and error that plagues many similar games.Story (3/10)The story is told through periodic monologues with a heavy dose of melodrama. It never really feels like it connects with the game itself until the end, which hits very suddenly and awkwardly. This isn't really a game to play for the story.Graphics/Sound (6/10)The environments look pretty cool, especially from a distance, but don't tend to hold up on closer inspection. The sound is serviceable.Overall Impression (6/10)Recommended, but with reservation and only for fans of puzzle games.			"

												Honestly the game goes on too long and the playthroughs weren't thought out very well. I'd messed the game up a few times by solving the puzzles backwards or wrong and instead of safeguarding for this I just run into glitches and am unable to continue forward..The amount of times I basically do the same thing which is essentially ""move the block to the peg it should fit into"" is not worth it..the story is also incredibly dull and the environment doesn't have enough to keep it interesting or even all that pretty. Sorry I don't really see how this was..put onto Steam? It feels rather amateur even compared to the usual fair and I am an indie fanatic. The deeper story that they're trying to go for eventually makes sense but doesn't really have that much of a deep meaning. It felt like teenagers trying to write poetry, it could have it's moments but.. nope not this time.TLDR: A game that is much like it's environments, a bit sparse and lacking in the depth it's trying to portray.

Either too loud or too low. Bugs in various places, some will make you restart areas. Past two updates have made the game worse for non VR play (I do not play in VR so it's useless to me). Today alone I had the game crash three times and sent two crash reports. Even made my monitor lose signal to my pc. Given I was able to play the fourth time I tried, there's a 3/4th chance the game will crash.			"

												This game is gorgeous, and at times extraordinarily creative.  The stylization of the world and flavoring is lovely.  But two words: Empty and imbalanced.The handful of good puzzles were clustered at the beginning and end, with empty maps as filler in between.  They reduced to the player trudging around in search of a ball.  Coupled with the lack of a sprint option, it became painfulAs for the story, it tries to take a stab at high-reaching ideas and does so cleverly in a world of neurons.  Yet it fails to actually engage with these ideas and develop/change the player's understanding of them, which is integral for a game that is trying to be this artistic.  And, like gameplay, the story clung to the head and tail of the game.  The poor voice audio (and mostly poor voice acting) only made it that much worse.Graphics and atmosphere - 9.5/10.   Total game - 5/10.			"

I don't object to setting a pace for the story/game, but sometimes the movement speed feels very constraining.  I struggled with puzzles in a couple parts of the game, and found the lack of direction (and narration) frustrating.  Once I broke through, though, seemed fine.Overall, I like the game.

												First and foremost this game is a surreal experience. Secondly, it's a puzzle game.The puzzles are self-contained and you must solve each one to move on to the next, in a completely linear manner. Most are fairly straight forward and solving each overall puzzle isn't as satisfying as it should be. Instead, every few puzzles you will need to identify a new mechanic, and finding these are what make the experience rewarding. These are your eureka moments.As other comments have said, the story is way in the background somewhere and I wasn't engaged enough to look forward to the conclusion: I just wanted to solve each of the puzzles and see what came next. To unravel the story you don't need to do anything special. Even if you miss some of the sound bites, which can be found scattered around in some of the puzzles yet most of them right in your path, you will understand just fine what's going on.The length is quite short but fitting at 4-5 hours, and there is enough diversity to keep you interested until the end. For VR (I don't have a VR headset); given the limited selection of games right now, limited controls and the surreal landscapes, as well as the price and length; If you like puzzles this is one you should probably consider.

												A pretty game, but a little too disjointed for my tastes, like a dream sequence from any other game, but drawn out with so... much... walking...Puzzles increase nicely in complexity, but tend to repeat a lot of the same basic principles.The scenery can be stunning when not clouded in fog, particularly the last section. There's also a really great bit about 2/3 through that was executed beautifully, and I added a whole extra point for it.Voice-over and story are a little too emo, too self-indulgent. It's a linear sequence of rooms and not a patch on Myst let alone Riven.If you're really into this kind of puzzler and are patient, it's might be worth a try, but otherwise you can do better elsewhere.[5.4]			"

												Positives:-Your first look at an area is quite pretty-Some inventiveness with respect to the puzzlesNegatives:-An entire area will have a single uniform look-Slow walking speed, large spaces-Basic puzzle format is ""put ball A in slot B""-Awful story and voice acting-Wonky collision detectionNow, there *is* a certain amount of variation in the puzzles. Occasionally, you'll need to roll a ball down a hill so that it'll enter a slot after a certain delay, giving you time to get past an obstacle. At other times, you'll need to consider the interaction between the different effects slots have on the world--putting a ball in slot 1 will get you a second ball to put in slot 2, but it'll also raise a barrier; removing the ball from slot 1 again will remove the barrier, but also make the ball in slot 2 disappear. That sort of thing. There are a handful of interesting puzzles in the game. Unfortunately, there's a tremendous amount of tedious trudging you need to go through to get to these puzzles, and the world just doesn't sustain interest long enough to justify that. The environments are pretty enough, but really only when you first see them, because there's no variation within the environments to give you a sense of progress, apart from the various ball-and-slot macguffins scattered around. What seems initially like a lovely hilly meadow quickly becomes the frustratingly enormous meadow where you keep getting stuck on tiny bumps in the terrain, which makes you drop the ferschlugginger ball again. Dropping the ball is a pretty major issue in this game. It's really easy to accidentally lose your grip on a ball. You don't lose much progress when this happens (if any), but it gets tiresome quickly. You'll drop the ball when it gets caught on terrain, and you'll also drop the ball when you run into one of the myriad invisible walls. This is particularly frustrating, since you pick up the ball by walking into it, so if you walk into an invisible wall and that makes it drop, it drops right next to the wall, so when you walk into it again to try to pick it up, you'll often just walk straight into the invisible wall again and drop the stupid thing. Having your puzzle-solving interrupted with sessions just wrestling the collision detection is not fun.The game also insists on bludgeoning you with a terrible story. The plot, and I'm not making this up, runs like this: Father is a storm chaser. He takes the protagonist and his sister Sophia with him to pursue storms; Sophia drowns in a tsunami as a result. Protagonist never forgives his father for this, and expresses this by...becoming a storm chaser, and naming his own daughter Sophia. I think that's enough right there to give you a sense of the quality of the writing involved. It does not improve.Definitely not recommended, unless you thought Dear Esther's story was terrific, but needed puzzles, and also thought the best puzzles in Portal 2 were the ones designed by Wheatley.

												This game is beautiful. The puzzle mechanics are actually pretty interesting. I did have a lot of issues with this game. The puzzles seemed to be random in difficulty, as you will get a few easy ones ten suddenly a more difficuly one then back to an exceptionally easy one. The tone was kind of all over the place, early on there were some creepy environments and spooky atmospheric moments, then there are a lot of moments where it is calm and relaxing, almost zen-like. Most of the music is very nice, but some of the sound design is a bit odd, as in there is a wind rushing noise that sounds the same as rain starting to fall, which can cause issuse with puzzles. The story is very predicable, but has some nice moments. But, the game spends most of the time being about solving puzzles and learning about your character, then suddenly decided it needs to have an ill fitting boss fight. To me, I don't feel it was very much worth the time or frustration I experienced at times.			"

The puzzles didn't take much thought at all, (except in the final area, but even then it was primarily ""use logic to put steps in order across a large space"") and were definitely not the focus of the game. Sometimes they were frustrating because they were unclear. Sometimes they were frustrating because they took more work executing than figuring out. Sometimes they were about running everywhere in a huge map hunting for something, and next trying to find your way back in dense fog. Sometimes they were about putting something somewhere and then running to another location before you run out of time. That being said, the puzzle elements do some really amazing meshing with the graphics/atmosphere, and other games could stand to learn from Mind:PathToThalamus's clever designs in that regard. To spend more time harping on the graphics: Of the fourteen-or-so locations, I have vivid recollections of every one. the variety was staggering, and my favor ranges from merely ""pretty"" to ""some of the most gorgeous landscapes I have ever been in in a game."" I was able to run it decently on an older computer as well. The pacing in the game was alright, but the random difficulty spikes were not welcome, and didn't add enough to the game to justify themselves. Neither was the plot worth including. Honestly, the plot managed to detract from the game more than it added, and I don't think that I am being unfair. I found it amusing at times, nicely mellow at others, but overall bland and distracting from the other parts which the games does far better. Some people find it overly obtuse and annoyingly philosophical. Others find it obnoxious, hollow inside, with nothing really to say except to try and be clever for lack of something better to do. The developers listened to the public and adjusted the script since I played it. I liked the game enough to try and replay it to see what they had fixed, but the game crashed repeatedly (.... ..... .... ...) in one area, so I wasn't able to get past it to appreciate their upgrades. They can't have really fixed the plot drastically, unfortunately. I know so because: 1) it lacked depth to begin with 2) they were removing dialogue, not adding last I heard 3) some critical parts of the game depend on whatever remains of the plot they started with.So yeah. Play it for the graphics, atmosphere, imagination, and vastness of scale. Love it for that. Enjoy witnessing the (limited) way you can change the world, but don't expect to interact much mechanics-wise or mind-wise.Similar games: NaissanceE, (similar in puzzle worth, similar in atmosphere impact, similar in plot worth, more platforming difficulty, different surrealism style) Kairo, (slightly better puzzles, worse graphics, different surrealism style) The Path (slightly better plot but more ""poetic,"" worse graphics, lack of puzzles)Better games: Dear Esther (lack of puzzles, better plot, similar striking environments worth, stronger atmosphere, deeper meaning/experience)Journey (better/less puzzles, better plot, similar striking environments worth, stronger atmosphere, deeper meaning/experience)The Void (Extremely tough mechanics to master, slightly worse visuals, stronger atmosphere, deeper meaning/experience, less fun (a lot less fun) )			"

												Uh, meh, mixed feelings on this one. The graphics are gorgeous, love the skyboxes, wide landscapes and emptiness of the world. But graphics are unfortunately the only thing I can be truely enthusiastic about. The puzzles are often, even in its short playtime, extremely frustrating and require way too much walking around aimlessly wishing you could move quicker and just trying random configurations until it works. They often don't feel very satisfying or at all tied in with the story either. The story itself is... unimpressive, to say the least. I'm not sure how to describe the funny feeling I got. It was like they tried to make something very deep and metaphoric half of the time, and just said ♥♥♥♥ it the other half, making it feel very disjointed and pretentious. And ugh... the voiceovers... Especially at the end the voiceovers ruin any sense of immersion into the story with a seemingly bombastic ""boss fight"" that tries oh so hard to be epic but just made me sit in wonder what the hell they tried to do. The vague and unconvincing narrative makes it very difficult to get immersed with the character. Never have I actually felt ""sorry"" the problems he faces. The ending is apparently supposed to explain that the game is satirical to other ""pretentious"" games like Portal that also have very vague narrative, but it's done very unconvincingly: Nowhere else is this sentiment obvious than some voice overs there, making it almost seem like the developers realized how weak some of their writing was that they decided a day before release to just call it satire, giving it a real ""holier than thou"" feel.Buy it if you love weird, curious environments and great graphics, and can put up with sometimes frustrating puzzles and mediocre narrative or if you are a game designer (it does some interesting things you can learn from), otherwise I can't really recommend it.I'm feeling a light 6			"

												Imagine an angsty 20-something, in love with Stephen King and Silent Hill, writing a story that he thinks is sooo cool and philosophical about loss, obsession and finding himself. Then trying to turn it into a mix of Dear Esther, Myst and a bit of Penumbra: Requiem while having some good ideas and some fantastically looking levels. Then add some nice music and absolutely horrendous voice acting that makes some free horror flash games sound amazing. And you get Mind: Path to Thalamus.It does look unbelievably great and some of it's puzzles are actually good and smart. But, at the same time, a lot of puzzles are either boring, or frustrating or just ""really?!"" and there's no real motivation to keep going. There is a story happening, but given the horribleness of the script and the acting with which it is read, it's hard to care. Especially, when game suddenly decides that it needs a ""boss"" which works in a rather bs way or just drops you in an almost zero visibility expansive area and expects you to care to find the way.So - visuals are great, some music is very good, but everything else usually ranges from ""why do I care"" to ""no, seriously, why do I even bother playing this?!"".

												I bought this on the steam sale and I'm impressed with the level of emotional enagement the environments elicit in VR.  There was a crazy electric ball that jumped out at me indiana jones style in a cave level and I felt that damn thing go right through me.  My skin was buzzing.  My body felt pentrated by a ghost.  I'm a bit freaked out by the way the mind produces physical sensation in the limbs in VR.  I'm super samplling this to 1.5 on my Vive with a 970 and it keeps 90 fps in the graphics screen.			"

												Meh.I was looking for an open wandering puzzle game that doesn't hold your hand and player reviews suggested this was it. And it looks nice.None of those reviews mentioned this game is boring and uninteresting.You find the ""Hoberman Expanding Sphere Toy"" in each section and drop it on a very specific -- and not always clear -- spot to make fog go away or activate something. Then the character you're playing quips about regret or disappointment vis a vis his behavior in the past which you don't know anything about and have no context for. (But he never mentions how I regret purchasing this game.)I kept coming back to this in my earliest Vive-owning days because of a lack of other pretty games. Until... finally I decided I wasn't having any fun nor wonderment. If there's a big story pay-off at the end, I'll never know.PROSPrettySurreal sceneryCONSBoringNot fun			"

												I'm way into these types of games, but I just can't recommend this one.  The story is both very generic and very lacking.  The little snippits of dialogue you'll find throughout the game are just not acted well, and the writing is the usual ""novice writer trying to sound poetic and smart"" that plagues the genre.  The puzzles were fine, with one or two good head-scratchers, but for the most part they were overly-easy or kind of tedious.  Visually, the game's backdrops often looked quite pretty, but everything up close was extremely simple or even ugly.  This wouldn't be as much of a problem if the game didn't suffer from performance issues despite the simple graphics.Really the whole thing just wasn't worth much; there are just too many games out there with better stories and better puzzles.  So unfortunately I've got to suggest you skip it.  I do think the dev has potential though, and I look forward to seeing if they improve with their next project.			"

												The puzzles are uninteresting and frustrating. A lot of the puzzles can't really be figured out, you just have to trial and error your way through them. The scenery is pretty from afar, but really quite bland and repetetive after a while. The ambience feels similar to playing through something like Myst, but without creative artistry or game design. If you were sucked in by the surreal promotional material like I was, do what I wish I did and just enjoy the screenshots.			"

												first, id like to give the game a positive recommendation, but when i look at the full package, i just cant. if there would be a neutral rating then id chose that coz it doesnt deserve a thumbs down, nor a thumbs up.the game is beautiful, the music is good and fits to the game. it also has an, lets call it, interesting atmosphere. in the beginning i had a few wtf and wow moments, because i also didnt know what to expect from the game i always felt a bit uncomfortable. i always had this ""horror game"" feeling and was waiting for that one scary moment, which ofc never happened, but for me the game built up some tension in the beginning.now to the most important part, the puzzling. i expected interesting puzzles, not with a very high difficulty to solve but just decent puzzles. i found this at the start of the game but soon i had to notice that all puzzles are the same. after the second level it was no challenge anymore. you know exactly what you have todo, you search the ball(s) and you just need to figure out the order/combination on how to use em. its all very logical, you may get stuck sometimes coz its a bit different than the previous puzzle or you cant directly find the way you have to walk to advance. but it maximally takes a very few minutes to figure it out. so after 2-3 levels you kinda just walk trough.next thing is, if you take your time as casual gamer and dont rush trough, you will have finished this game in max 3 hours. the only reason to use more time is when you look at the beautiful sceneries or when you hunt the hidden achievements or challanges (like completing a level within xx seconds).its really sad nowadays, theres rarely any decent 3d/first person puzzle games with a real challenge (not talking about pure puzzlers). im thinking about games like myst was back then. a game with a very interesting story and many different puzzles. puzzles where you needed a notebook to write stuff down and puzzles may take hours till youre able to solve em.the story in Mind is weird, the protagonist, which you are playing, is an idiot, a very annoying character. the protagonist is always talking to you, explaining you things and telling you about the past and future, so hes kinda talking to himself. but not only did his character annoy me, so did his voice. with every level ive got more and more annoyed of this♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥the game has absolutely no replayability at all and with the fact that the character annoyed me that much im quite happy that i never have to hear his voice again.ive paid 5€ for this game on sale, if i remember it correctly. the actual price for the game is 13€ which is by far too much. even 5€ is too much id pick this game up for 2-3€ if id be you, its not worth more. i think this game was created by artists and not game developers, at least thats how it feels. thats also the main reason why i just cant rate this game positive, the value for money is just purely bad and overweighs all positive aspects.another negative point is, no key bindings. theres only WASD and LMB/RMB used, but not all keyboard layouts have WASD on the same position and there are also lefthanded people which may be uncomfortable with those settings.so to sum it up; a very short beautiful game with a good atmosphere, non-challenging puzzles and absolutely no replaybility plus an annoying protagonist for an overpriced 13€.

												Normally, this kind of game drives me wild. I love these strange, artistic, narrative explorations but I have to be honest and say, for me, Mind: Path to Thalamus was disappointing.I found myself constantly comparing Mind to Dream, another game along similar lines, and in comparison I found Mind wanting. The voice acting is poor, the story is bland and contrite, and the puzzles are largely trial-and-error.Something that annoyed me was the evil-looking red shadow people, which we're led to believe are personifications of something dark within the protagonists mind, likely trauma from the events which unfold.This is one of those moments where Dream shines; Dream shows the darker elements of the protagonists psyche with symbolic and clever imagery, all based on dream theory. Things like mannequins and mazes, things with meaning.In Mind, however, the shadow people are just cut-and-paste representations of blanket ""darkness"" or ""evil"".In short, I feel that, so far, Mind is a real let-down, which is a shame because it has buckets of potential and some really stunning environments.To summarise, Mind is a game designed by a team of artists. Dream is a game designed by a varied team, and the end result shows great superiority to this.			"

												No - not even for Three Bucks in a saleDon't let the visuals on the screen shots fool you as these are few and far between. I am all for story driven walking simulators but all we have here are what were evidently a few short projects that have been awkwardly stitched together to try and fool us into thinking this is an actual game.  Add to that some Pretentious Hipster Gibberish that is meant to be a ""Story"" but don't let that fool you either because it isn't.  Aside from an extremely short opening scene that was obviously stolen from Life Is Strange there is in fact no story here at all, it's literally just Hipster Gibberish. This has to be the most boring ""Gaming"" experience I have had in years.Oh - and it's a complete bug-fest, but even if it were not I wouldn't allow this to take up valuble space on my hard drive.

Heavy-handed and innappropriately meta dialogue entirely shatter the pacing of the game, not to mention the final boss. It would've been better if the story was symbolic and/or metaphoric and left it at that instead of failing at trying to be clever. The story is partially incomprehensible due to poorly balanced sound, and what's beneath the shoddy design isn't worth digging for.			"

												I will update this game when I beat it, but I've only played a few hours and I've spent at least 30% of the time dealing with bugs.First, the ball is constantly falling out of my hands, rolling down hills, etc. Not pushing any buttons or anything, just pops out of my grip and I have to turn around and chase the damn thing.Then after spending an hour wandering around the same foggy/rainy hills, I decide to look it up and discover that my game is broken and I am stuck, and the only way to fix it is to RESTART the game. So now I get to play the entire tedious, frustrating thing again.But I'm going to do it because if it worked properly, it'd be nice....but so far, it hasn't left a good taste in my mouth.EDIT: Honestly, I don't think I can finish it, I'm just so sick of chasing my damn ball around it's like the characters hands are covered in oil.

												From the outside, everything about this game looks gorgeous. The scenery is breathe taking and the trailing... ""How many times will I kill her?"" I was hooked right off the bat with that one powerful yet intriguing sentence. The game starts extremely strong too; the opening scene is up there alongside Half Life 2 or Portal 2 when it comes to catching your attention.After that, it all breaks down. The puzzle system, which is the core of the game, isn't really flawed itself. It may not be introduced the best way possible, but it still is a decent and original idea, and the mechanics are well explored throughout the game. What bugged me the most is how slow and tiring solving the puzzles felt. Yes, the vast and exquisit landscape is awesome, but having to walk across it back and forth trying to solve a puzzle is not fun. Most of the time, you know exactly what you need to do, but doing it is just 10 minutes of straight walking, with no music or narration to keep you occupied. I do enjoy just looking around, but at some point, even that doesn't do it anymore.The narration is also another aspect they would've benefited greatly to have stepped up on.Overall, the game had a lot of potential, but it fell short in a few key parts, which ruined the whole thing.

												MIND: Path to Thalamus might be described as a ""Walking simulator"" type game, but I'd place it more in the ""Puzzle Platformer"" genre; that's fine, not exactly what I was expecting, but still a style that I enjoy. The problem is that it doesn't do much with either element of that genre: barely any platforming, and the puzzles--for the most part--aren't very puzzling.The game manages to have beatiful environments, that you can't explore, and a nice ambient soundtrack, that you don't hear often. This kind of makes sense within the constraints of the plot, because (SPOILER that's given away by the title anyway): you're withing the main character's mind. I'm not sure about most people, but I don't hear music 24/7 in my brain; the invisible walls with lush scenery is still irksome--I'm not free to visit all the beauty that I see behind these narrow walls, and paths so obvious they could almost be described as ""on rails.""By far the most egregious transgression of the game, though, is the narration. The story is actually quite interesting: it has good character development, wonderful visual representations of the plot (all the visual metaphors and motifs are excellent), and an intriguing concept (representing the subconscious mind of the character). The narration ruins all of this; the exposition is helpful, but felt rushed at the end cutscene (as if not enough had come through during the game) and most of it was telling the audience how to interpret the gameplay or cutscenes as part of the plot instead of just letting us make those connections.If this was a free game that I played on some website while I was bored, I could forgive it and say that it's worth a play as a kind of timewaster. On steam for $9, I can't in good conscience recommend it to others and say that it's a good investment. I see a lot of potential in the devs and want them to receive the support, both financially and motivationally, to continue honing their skill, but I'd rather fund a new game than misdirect people to support them through this one.

												From the outside, everything about this game looks gorgeous. The scenery is breathe taking and the trailing... ""How many times will I kill her?"" I was hooked right off the bat with that one powerful yet intriguing sentence. The game starts extremely strong too; the opening scene is up there alongside Half Life 2 or Portal 2 when it comes to catching your attention.After that, it all breaks down. The puzzle system, which is the core of the game, isn't really flawed itself. It may not be introduced the best way possible, but it still is a decent and original idea, and the mechanics are well explored throughout the game. What bugged me the most is how slow and tiring solving the puzzles felt. Yes, the vast and exquisit landscape is awesome, but having to walk across it back and forth trying to solve a puzzle is not fun. Most of the time, you know exactly what you need to do, but doing it is just 10 minutes of straight walking, with no music or narration to keep you occupied. I do enjoy just looking around, but at some point, even that doesn't do it anymore.The narration is also another aspect they would've benefited greatly to have stepped up on.Overall, the game had a lot of potential, but it fell short in a few key parts, which ruined the whole thing.

												Table of Contents:- Foreword- Graphics- Gameplay- Sounds- Controls- Quality- Overall Experience-ForewordI got this game for free and didnt look at anything before starting. I didnt expect it to be what it was.-GraphicsThe graphics are insane! Its all soooooo pretty. Everything is so well made, its just amazing. I dont know how to describe it.-GameplayThe gameplay ... Its basically a Puzzle Walking Simulator. It was pretty boring.The only thing that somehow kept me was the Story, i still dont know if i'll continue to play the game though.I really got bored. Also, some parts which are not even supposed to be scary were really creepy imo.That musicbox-music and the footsteps, the creepy dark cave. Im usually not scared by horror games, but this one slightly did. Even though its not supposed to.-SoundsSome of the sounds sounded pretty poor and bad, the music was really really good though!Really, the music is insane! So fitting and perfect.-ControlsThe game supports Controller, Mouse/Keyboard and those VR Controllers. Its made for VR i guess, so, yea.You basically use WASD and your mouse, if you play on the Keyboard. Mainly Left-click, the other 2 buttons are just for VR.-QualityThe Quality was great. I didnt experience any bugs or anything. The game ran smoothly, is greatly optimised (i mined Ethereum while playing on Ultra, which is not possible in any other game really, and still i had 30+ FPS)-Overall ExperienceBoring. I think the story could defiently be the main reason to keep on doing all the puzzles. I dont really enjoy puzzle games, i think they are insanely boring. Its probably just me. Well, for 8,99€ its definetly worth its money though. The graphics are amazing, the story seems pretty good and the music was just perfect.			"

												Very glitchy, puzzles with no clues, such as invisible paths and invisible objects. No objective that I could see. Not great looking either. You're given access to all chapters right at the beginning, but the chapters have no name when you start them, so you have no idea where you got up to. My character kept dropping the items he was holding for no reason. It's a shame because it had so much potential to be a great atmospheric puzzle game, but no I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												Artsy-fartsy visuals and music are nice but gameplay is very lackluster - especially when it comes to badly designed puzzles, not at all suited for the limited controls availabe in this game. I'm guessing that the developers aimed at creating something very immersive (and for a team consisting of only three people that's pretty ambitious) but the results fall flat due to inept design and lack of polish. I really wanted to like it but after about an hour and a half it was only putting me to sleep.Not recommended, unless you're really baked and want to look at some trippy surreal landscapes.			"

												OK. I'm only like 1 hour into the game, aaannnnddd... sense is not being made. I walked into a tunnel with water and got stuck. Literally, I fell into some kind of hole half way between two levels of the tunnel and couldn't get out. So I went to the menu to see if I could restart that section/chapter, but I selected a chapter I hadn't seen yet/before. I was under water(?) but couldn't move or anything so I started mashing all the keys on the keyboard and ...stuff happened. Gonna see if I can completely start over tomorrow and see where that gets me. Oh. I already earned achievements; for what I have no idea.Gonna give this a thumbs up only because I have to give it something and I'm not far enough along to definitively dislike it.PS. I bought the game because of the music in the trailer.-----UPDATE-----So, I finished the game. More or less. I think I might have skipped some of it, but I can't tell because of the interface issues. I don't recommend this game for the following reasons:1. It makes less than no sense. No rhyme. No reason. Although the puzzles are interesting and many are challenging, apparently you don't have to complete them. Like, any of them.2.  There's no reason for the game not to launch in fullscreen mode. I had to find a discussion thread to find out how (Alt+Enter).3. You can't tell what ""Chapter"" you are in at any given time. If you pause the game (bring up the menu), I saw no indication of my current progress/position in the narative. Pressing ""PLAY"" returns you to the beginning of the chapter you are in.4. There's no cursor/reticle so you're just guessing if you have a tumbleweed within your grasp or not, and the tumbleweeds are the *only* thing you can interact with in the game.5. They introduce game mechanics in a bad way. I skipped one chapter because I couldn't figure out the puzzle's mechanics or what to do, but in a later(?) chapter the mechanic became obvious.6. The subtitles are too freaking small, out of sync, and sometimes jumbled and unreadable.7. I spent at least a quarter (if not a third) of my time in the game staring at a blank screen wondering if the game had crashed.8. I encountered very little music. Although, I must say I actually bought the game because of the music in the trailer, and when/where that music appears in the game I found very affecting.After a few hours it became obvious I was traipsing through some shmuck's inner psychological problems. Personally, I found that irritating. But that's just me. So I don't hold it against the game. What I do hold against the game is that I just didn't care about anything. I had no motivation to complete any puzzle, and completing a puzzle didn't give any reward I could discern.I bought the game at 75% off for $2.24. Essentially I bought it for that one piece of music. Don't buy this game if you're looking for some kind of story to motivate you and tie everything together. There isn't some great revelation at the end where ""everything suddenly makes sense.""Interesting puzles/mechanics. Poor execution. 1 awesome song.			"

												Sadly, very sadly, I cannot recommend this game. It's buggy and playing with Vive and its motion controllers -this is the way I've done- becomes a nightmare: problems with falling off the wooden  bridge pannels on one level, problems with invisible colliders that doesn't allow you to move freely on another, and such. But even not playing in VR, there are situations in which you can get into deadlocks, impossible to finish the level. It has happened to me two or three times (for instance: a ball was respawned if I failed some puzzle, but after a few tryings, it won't be respawned anymore; or because of certain balls are only active if you're at night, you can do something on the level to become this kind of balls unreachable).And I've been able to see the end of the game due to you can select the chapter you wanna play on the Main Menu, because on some of the last levels ('Lone Hospital', 'Hallowed Sands') the end of the level and loading of the next one is not triggered; at least, if you play at room-scale with Vive.Without any of these flaws, it would be an OK game; but it's been too much. At least, I can play (as I saw at the forums, many people weren't even able to do so).In conclussion: a ""sadly, very sadly"" mess. One of those games that you'd really wanted to like, but... too much flaws.			"

												I've never been so conflicted when it comes to a game of this genre...The best part of this game is the art work, like many have said before, it is absolutely gorgeous and I wish I could walk there in IRL.And that is, unfortunately, the only thing that keeps me playing...the story is, for me, not compelling nor interesting.I can see what they want me to feel and get from the story, but the voice actor and the writing is not good, not even after the update. (This could how ever be colored by the amazing storytelling from ""Ether One"" that I quite recently played, so keep that in mind.)So to sum this up, if you are looking for a puzzle game with amazing art work, then this is for you. The puzzles are good and difficult at times. However, if you want to play a puzzle adventure with a compelling story, then I recommend that you try to find another game.			"

												This is the first game I've owned so far that I've ever felt the need to write a review for.Long story short, I'm very disappointed in it.My disappointment comes not just from the sparse environments and the annoyingly bad puzzles, it's also directed towards the people who crafted this game. I'm confused as to how they could have felt that this... 'game' (if you can call it one) was worth releasing in such a state.Yes, several other users have mentioned that there is a narrative of sorts. But I for one cannot seem to see, feel or understand what on Earth they were trying to present to me. 'Reflections contain the truth' perhaps? It's a mechanic that's used in the puzzles in the opening hours of the game and one that I simply find annoying.While I can understand that many indie devs are eager to tell their tales and make their mark, this is simply not the right way to go about it as it will just leave people with a bad impression and overly cautious of your next product.Maybe future patches and updates will improve the quality of the game and reduce the spareness of the environments. But for now... it feels more like a proof of concept than something I've call a real game.			"

												A beautiful indi title, some interesting puzzles, but also some horrible level design when your progress is limited by jaggie unfinished terrain, the sun on some levels is very irritating, some levels are large open spaces, which is cool, but this makes progress slow as you have to find where things are to progress which really slows down the pace of the game. There are no sound options for this game which is odd, so you can't play it with sound and no music. You can skip to any chapter you like from the main menu which is good as it helps players circumvent some of the more troublesome levels.It is difficult to be harsh with a game that was produced by such a small team and one that is sometimes genuinely very beautiful, but some of the levels really needed more playtesting and reworking.2/5			"

												First VR game to make me motion sick...  That aside, not sure what the game really has to offer.  I started off in a street apparently yelling at someone I never saw, telling them to stay inside.  Clearly they were, since I never once saw or heard anyone, but I apparently felt the need to keep yelling that out every few seconds.  I played for maybe another 5 minutes before the movement methods started making me feel nauseous, but I am honestly not sure how much gameplay is involved here as it really just felt like ""walk down this path and stick your hand into some glowing area to hear the next bit of dialogue.""

It has happened to me two or three times (for instance: a ball was respawned if I failed some puzzle, but after a few tryings, it won't be respawned anymore; or because of certain balls are only active if you're at night, you can do something on the level to become this kind of balls unreachable).And I've been able to see the end of the game due to you can select the chapter you wanna play on the Main Menu, because on some of the last levels ('Lone Hospital', 'Hallowed Sands') the end of the level and loading of the next one is not triggered; at least, if you play at room-scale with Vive.Without any of these flaws, it would be an OK game; but it's been too much. At least, I can play (as I saw at the forums, many people weren't even able to do so).In conclussion: a ""sadly, very sadly"" mess. One of those games that you'd really wanted to like, but... too much flaws.			"

												I played through the first four areas and only for a short time.  By the fourth area, I did not find the game to be engaging.The story is of some guy who loses his sister and daughter, and copes with their loss by way of a series of esoteric imagery puzzles.  Of the puzzles I played, they were very simple, and not challenging, and most egregiously, relied on the player to guess the solutions.  If the developer provided hints, they were too subtle (although this may not be a bad thing, depending on who you are).This game appears to be poorly optimized.  I got a jittery and inconsistent fps (mid-20's) on the low settings.  For context, my hardware is not that great, but I've seen better preformance on more hardware intensive programs.  Your milage my vary.The controls were sluggish.  This may possibly be related to the above.  A grabbed object moved at a different rate than the camera did, creating a naseating and disoreinting experience.In summary, I did not like this game.  I thinkn it may be intended for a totally different audience than average PC gamers (note that this game has VR support).			"

												Ehh, it seemed pretty good at first, but the further you get in, the more you won't like it.   It's kind of cheesy, and even though they could, they don't explain too much at the first part.  It need's more story line, and could definetily use some kind of outside force, for example in the Portal series, they have to solve puzzles, but with a portal gun.   Thalamus is doesn't seem to have anything to do with any outside force, other than the 'elements' of nature.  And still even then these 'elements' can be and are very, very cheap.  Though the graphics are pretty good, and you'll tend to admire how thorough the game is when it comes to graphics, you will not admire the game play, or the story, too much.  Don't be overestimating this game.    I define this game around 3/10, mainly cause of the graphics.   I hope this review helps you.			"

												Mind: Path to Thalamus is a beautiful game with some of the worst gameplay I've ever experienced. Imagine yourself as a physically handicapped snail covered in molasses. In order to solve any given puzzle, you must walk roughly a marathon-length of open space, in the fog, at night, while it's raining, wondering if you forgot to pick up a ball before you started your trek.The game could be amazing if the movement speed wasn't stupid and the expanses were visible but didn't require to constantly cross them back and forth for no reason other than lack of clear game design. Really disappointed and wanted to love it.			"

												I got about 45 minutes into this game and had to stop. I can't really say much about the narrative beacuse as of yet I feel like I've learnt nothing and I feel no connection to the protagonist and his daughter whatsoever. My main fault is with the gameplay itself. So far the puzzles have been annoying rather than challenging, forcing you to search a large area (at a painfully slow pace due to the lack of a sprint option) in order to find a ball or where to place it. This, added to the artistic/abstract way in which they're presented makes the puzzles longer but no more enjoyable. Either that or challenging for all the wrong reasons. I just found them entirely tedious.Another thing was the size of the area you were allowed to roam in - it is much larger than you need in some places but with no reward for exploring that I've seen so far. This is made all the more irritating by the slow pace at which you're forced to travel. There's no interesting information, just more views. The visuals are stunning I do admit, to the point where I have screenshots in amongst my computer backgrounds. However I was expecting more of a relaxed atmosphere - there were several points when I just felt kinda creeped out :PAll in all based on what I've seen I wouldn't get this again - and I essentially paid pennies for this in a Humble Bundle. Though I will try to play on and will edit this review if I ever complete the game as the many positive reviews give me hope that it might pick up.			"

												This game is just frustrating to play. What's up with the narrow white road that only appears as you walk? Then I get into a courtyard where I apparantly can't do anything. I get back on the path and encounter worlds with hidden paths and mirrors but it really is not apparant what I'm supposed to do with these. Maybe I click this stuff and figure out what to do but it would have been just dumb luck. Can you say walking simulator? I don't want to walk for 100 hours just to get 1 hour of some non-thinking puzzle. UGH!			"

												This is an uncommonly gorgeous game - the art direction is fantastic.  The sheer scale of some of the things that happen in this game is breathtaking.  (Visually, this might be the best use of the Unreal engine I've ever seen.)  Without being too specific about the puzzles, once you figure out that backtracking is a thing, they strike a decent balance between fair and challenging - they're mostly fun and totally solvable if sometimes a bit cryptic.  The narrator is a prick - but I think that's part of the point.  He's a deeply flawed guy - and while the game's journey does represent a maturing process for him - he's still kind of a prick with loads of baggage.  It's as if he's searching too hard for meaning - calls himself out on it - and keeps doing it anyway.  If you can get past the imperfect character, the game is amazing - worth playing for the art direction and execution alone.  It may not be as polished as Portal 2 - but it's made by a much smaller team, and the artistic aspect of the game really knocks it out of the park.  If you like surrealism - this is for you.  Dive in, and get lost in another world.  8/10 highly recommended.			"

												Mind is a curious game. But also absolutely brutal at times with its puzzles. But due to it being so curious to play, you're driven forward by what you might see next.In terms of presentation, art-style and content it is fantastic. What it struggles with it leaving you wondering what you are supposed to do at times. It doesn't happen very often, but when it does you really end up being clueless for quite some time before you have those 'ah ha!' moments. That may be in part due to the surreal environments where doing one thing triggers something completely unexpected, so that detatchment of cause and expected effect in itself can be a hinderence. But at the same time, its like someone put you in an empty room filled with buttons and you've just got to push one after another to satisfy your curiousity.And that is what makes it hard to say if this is a good game or not. Replay value is absolutely zero, because once you've been through the game the driving force behind why you kept playing has been lost. But, it does a good job of keeping you playing... somehow.. it just does. Hypnotic, but in an intellectual way. Mind Candy rather than Eye-Candy.There's not many games I could even describe as Mind-Candy. So, yeah. Buy this and experience something quite unique. There is certainly not enough games which can claim to be genuinely unique these days.			"

I'll say it first thing: This game is short. It took me about 4 hours to beat, in which 1 of those 4 was just being stuck on multiple puzzles.Can I ask for a soundtrack? I'm sure we'd all like one.This is what I have been waiting for. From the first day I saw it in greenlight. Just as surreal and dreamy as I thought. I wish it would have gone on forever, though. I probably should have waited for it to do on sale, but I was too anxious to try it so I bought it immedeately.While it was short, I will play these levels again just to relax and walk around in the fantasy dreamscape land that is MIND.

												♥♥♥♥♥poor puzzles and mediocre story telling. The main character (I don't recall if he has a name or not) is chasing after his daughter, Sophia, in the world's most boring dreamscapes.  Exciting fun is to be had, as you walk on invisible pillars through the power of trial and error, carry tumbleweeds around aimlessly, and wander blindly in fog thicker than pea soup.  The only thing more thrilling than that gameplay is the ambling narration of the main character, as he puts about at a constant jogging pace.  I may have only gotten to three different ""elements"" (Fog, Night, Rain), but after an hour of play I think it is pretty safe to say that there is little to interest players who want more than a walking simulator.Some of environments are pretty (when not covered in fog/darkness) at least, but you have about as much effect on them as a ghost would, leaving neither footprints or shadow.  No visible legs either, which is pretty great when you're platforming about.			"

I don't really feel like I'm in the environment... I just feel like I'm a floating spectre going around. Some weird stuff happened during the opening too... some general bugginess. It might be an alright game on mouse and keyboard on a standard monitor... maybe...but there are better games like this.The other VR Adventure game I've played is The Gallery: Call to the Starseed... which was a substantially better VR experience. I loved THAT game... and I was honestly hoping for something at least somewhat similar... not here...Sorry, I appreciate the native VR implementation... but it could use substantially more work before it's even fun... but it might not even be worth it.

												Leaving negative feedback on account of no supersampling support for Vive. It doesn't even seem to be using the default VR resolution multiplier of 1.4, which makes this game look significanlty blurrier than any of the other Vive games. And for those who are used to playing at higher supersampling multipliers, amount of blurrines here will likely make this game unplayable. Supersampling is not even a feature, it's just disabled here for no reason. Dev isn't listening to the community, as complaints about this have been steadily coming since the VR release. Everyone was hoping for a quick update that fixes it, but dev has just been staying silent and ignoring the issue for many months now, hence negative feedback. Picking the game back up and changing feedback to positive as soon as dev enables supersampling.			"

												""Video games aren't art"" Cetainly this one isn't and it's just as pretentious and shallow as this quote I found the game.I can tolerate ugly graphics, bad sound design or even poor UX, but not if it's combined with bare bones gameplay, uninspired level design, unoriginal plot and even worse storytelling.Corners are cut all over the game. The diffenrence between asset quality is staggering, the game mechanics are poorly explained and inconsistent/glitchy, and you will find yourself constantly bumping into invisible walls or falling through visible ones. (and I'm not talking about the levels where this is part of the game mechanic) They keep covering your vision with fog, sand storm and low resolution rain (how can you f*ck up rain?!) as well as gorgeous Unreal Engine particle effects to mask the pre-2004 quality textures and original models.If you want a pseudo-interactive tour through recreactions of your favourite Windows XP stock wallpapers this game is for you! If you are looking for a puzzle game with an engaging story get Talos Principle instead because this will disappoint. Same if you are after walking simulators. Wheteher you are after environmental storytelling (like with Gone Home) or involved nattarion (as in A Machine for Pigs), you won't find what you are looking for in this game.			"

												This game was never detected by my radar. It popped up among the suggestions some day, after I played Ether One.The game is in fact a little bit in the same style of Ether One. It involves puzzles, that may actually look a bit dumb at the beginning, but they are quite cool throughout the game.The unreal engine is perfectly used in this game, both graphically and for the level design part. The game is very artistic and mostly immersive, with up and downs.The major flaw is the narration and voice acting. The game does not combine much of the gameplay with the narration, and the narrator voice is just too quiet compared to the ambient sounds (you can't adjust them), and the acting is IMHO very poor. I would have rather read the story written on the level's walls (a bit like Dear Esther), than hearing it from that annoying voice.Some moments will leave you with your jaw dropped, but some others (eg while the guy speaks) will make you want to close the game.Game is very short so if you are one of those that relate price and gameplay hours, know that the game won't ever last more than 5 hours (I got all the trophies and played most chapters twice).75/100			"

												Mind: Path to Thalamus is another entry into the narrative focused art games. This one struck me as having been highly influenced by Dear Esther (especially in the tone and pace of the narration, as well as some of the areas), coupled with a more puzzle-driven experience, not unlike Portal (its intent being completely different, though).Unfortunately, the writing was weak, in my opinion, and the game seems very incoherent in its quality. Some parts of the game were truly good, blending its audio-visual design very nicely with the puzzles, while others just fell flat on their face, with far more generic looks, and puzzles whose pieces were simply hidden, leading to a frustrating experience.PresentationThe first thing that strikes you in M:PtT is its visual fidelity. It has high quality textures and shaders that are very well used, especially at the start of the game. The skyboxes are  majestic -- that's the best way to describe it, very detailed and often chaotic, in a good way  -- paired well with the lighting effects. It's just an awesome looking game, if you like wandering around and sightseeing. Doesn't quite hold itself the whole way throughThe only complaint I have with it is that, while the beach areas seem are brilliant, with a bit of classic architecture and nicely reflecting sand, some of the other areas are far blander. There was a cave almost identical to the one in Dear Esther (which is unfortunate, because it's certainly beautiful, despite losing the unique factor), and there are some cannyon-esque areas that are not that awe inducing.The plain areas are also very well done with their use of color and foliage, very cool! There are also some more other-wordly realms that look pretty good.The only technical problem with it was the popping that happened due to the low draw-distance with some objects, even with everything maxed.The sound design was also very much alike Dear Esther. It's mostly very quiet and relaxing, with the occasional piano piece, and calm narration. It's certainly very atmospheric, and while not particularly memorable, I think it helps  carrying the experience!I have a few problems with the writing. Presumably, it was too esoteric and pretentious when the game launched, so they've rewritten the script, making the story more clear. Unfortunately, they've completely removed the old script, as it seems. I wanted to try it out for myself, but I don't think that's possible. What's left, is a perhaps too direct and concrete script about the story of the game. So concrete that it lacks identification with the player, unless you were in a similar situation... Which deals with running from a tornado. Not something many people have ever been involved with, I'd say!This is perhaps not 100% fair, as there are aspects with which one could identify himself, but they're also so prevalent nowadays that it's a bit tiresome (related to guilt and family issues).This story is given between the puzzles, during otherwise dead time. Since two of the characters share the same name (for story reasons) it can be a bit confusing at times to know who exactly the game's talking about, due to the fragmented exposition.Regardless, I don't think it's bad, just felt a bit underwhelming, taken the rest of the presentation. I think I would have liked to at least play through the original script.General MechanicsThe game's puzzles revolve around ""manipulating weather"". However, it's not as cool as it sounds, and it's only so metaphorically speaking. The main characters (from what I understood, a family tradition of sorts) studies weather phenomena. There's the connection.However, how the weather changes affect the game's mechanics is completely untied to actual weather, working just as a mechanic. With which there's nothing wrong, but it feels like the developer tried a bit too hard and in the end dropped the ball, for the most part.The puzzles are a mixture of conception and execution, the latter relying on the physics system, which is not very well explained at all.You have a neuro-something sphere, that you place in an element circle, to activate it. You can also stand on those circles yourself to activate said weather mechanic. You can control Fog, Day and Night, Rain, and Time. Night opens up portals, and something gives you a ball that only appears during the night, Rain rises platforms, Fog gives you access to small area (and propulsion -- where the physics come in), and Time reconstructs some buildings. -- Looking back at it, there's connection between the mechanics and the actual story, though very subtle.Generally, you wander around the levels, find the pieces, and then place the sphere and yourself sequentially, following a very linear path to the end of the level.It certainly sounds good in concept! And sometimes, they were nicely designed, on other times, not really. I'll now discuss the particular points that made this game frustrating, to me.1.Invisible and/or Artificial WallsThis is a big sore spot, to me. The game features these very fast, ever expanding areas that look absolutely amazing. There's also an almost perfect ballance between empty space and ""landmarks"" in some levels. However, once you try to go off the path, the game blocks you path with an invisible walls. On the first levels, this wasn't really an issue, as it seemed to give you quite a lot of freedom. later on, though, it revealed itself as something different.For such an atmospheric experience, letting the player wonder would be far for enjoyable -- perhaps having an improved Dear Esther influence, maybe even giving some of the more esoteric script passages to the player during those moments. The biggest issue with this, though, is how they place a single pillar or tree off in the distance, isolated from everything else. In any other game, this would be like a beacon, something for the player to investigate! Of course, once you walk 5 steps, you'll encounter an invisible wall. It feels so counter-intuitive... If there's to be a wall there, don't place those beacons. I mean, since so obvious that I'm not sure I'm missing some deep metaphor, here... Oh well. It could be much more by changing this simple aspect.2.Puzzles are most about finding the pieces than putting them togetherSounds cute, but what exactly do I mean. Aside from being very limiting, exploration-wise, the levels can be quite large -- which may sound contradictory, but stick with it.While somewhat large, they're very linear in where you can go. However, since the various pieces are so spread, every solution you might think of, will often take more time than it needed. Moreover, if it fails, you'll have to wander around for some more time, because it's not very clear, most of the time.For example, one puzzle was literally about taking the sphere and walking in a very defined path in front of you. You would finish the level in 10 seconds. However, that was only due to its initial conditions. If you took the sphere and went somewhere else, you would break those conditions. I felt rather lost, to be honest. The problem with that level was that you could not see the consequences of your actions. This happens more than once.This is very frustrating. You could solve the puzzles by pure luck quickly -- otherwise, you'd have to rely on guesswork and trial and error.ConclusionEnough rambling. I think I've written about my biggest problems with Mind: Path to Thalamus.It's a very beautiful game, and the first level really impressed me, even from a puzzle standpoint. Unfortunately, the rest of the game doesn't seem to have as much work and polish put into it, and ends up having some very frustrating puzzles, hurting the rest of the experience a lot.			"

												This game is soo easy it actually suprised me when it came to me with some logic. I have already accpted it as a walking simulator based on atmosphere and I was poorly wrong (Well it is walking simulator based on atmosphere but it includes something more). There are actuall puzzles. Problem is that autor obviosly belives he made some deep story so he tries to set you in his world rightly. Because of that you will get in to the real puzlle time after a lot of boring walking while listening some whining dude. Thing is even my homeworks from elemetary school are more complex than this. Desing is something different. Game really looks great in some points. Unfortunately there are also few moments when game looks awfull (Prolog is deffenetly worst location you will see.)After all I can't say this is bad game. I enjoyd some parts. But it Isn't something I would recomend.I would rather buy only the soundtrack than the game. That is my verdict.5/10			"

												3 minutes into the game I encountered a crash.  After restarting and ""adjusting"" things I played the game for several hours.  When I say ""played"" I mean I walked.  To the game's credit the art direction is very nice.  The story is lacking and attempts to be elevated by being ""in the mind"", but is mostly drawn out.  The graphics are not actually that impressive which is covered up by bloom.  To the game's credit it does have puzzles, but all the puzzles are walk into mirror, move a ball somewhere or just walk forward.  Apparently walk forward is in fact a puzzle. I did not actually complete the game because on one of the later puzzles the ball I needed glitched out during a fateful teleporter incident.  There is no ""restart puzzle"" (can't put enough quotes around puzzle) option so the game expected me to redo an entire chapter.  I know there are people who will play games purely based on concept and art direction; this is the game for them.  For people who want something more than a first person game with a collection of bugs I'd look else where.			"

												Disclaimer! I haven't completed the game, as, quite simply, I got too bored playing it, to continue.But, based on the about hour and a half I have played, I can't recommend it, the game, or, experience, as I don't think there's much game here to be had, is tedious and long-winded, with no real sense of accomplishment or narrative.Calling this a puzzle game is quite a stretch, as the ""puzzles"" I have played up until I put the game down consisted almost entirely of ""search level for item"", ""search level for place to put said item"", rinse and repeat, coming hot off The Talos Principle, a true puzzle game, this one underwhelms catastrophically.The story is delivered by voice, but they should just have kept it to the on-screen text, as the narrator sounds both bored and completely unengaged, leading to the voiceover being annoying, more than pulling you in.About the only positive thing I can say is that the game is very pretty, great use of different weather to create moods in the levels.Also, I should probably mention that I really like Dear Esther, which clearly have been an inspiration for this game, so its not that the genre doesn't appeal to me.

												5 years from now a hipster will ask you on a date. They have a few pieces at an art gallery event. You say sure, that sounds like fun. After walking down wide white hallways with hanging paintings and finished floors you get to an Oculus Rift. ""Try it!"" they insist.You put it on. You walk around this linear path for awhile. Some things happen that seems exciting, then you're stuck. A narrator takes over and you're just walking forward. It's the interlude of a game when your character is dreaming or drugged that you have to get through before you get to the main game. Except this is the main game. You don't need explosions and guns to entertain you, and you certainly don't need a tutorial to hit you over the head, but this world seems pointless and empty. You keep walking around in the virtual world so as to not disappoint your date. After enough ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting, you take off the headset.""So? What'd ya think? Pretty cool, RIGHT?"" they say all proud of themselves.""It was. Interesting,"" you say.You indugle in the wine at the gallery to try to make the best of your time while your artist date drones on and on about the state of art today with other artists and connoisseurs. You're drunk and bored so you just stare at the enormous  statue in the middle of the room that you swear looks like a woman ♥♥♥♥ing a dog, yet everyone insists is abstract art. You say goodnight and don't ♥♥♥♥ them because you don't want to have to sit through another date with that person.			"

												I'm usually fan of these ""walking simulator"", but dear god, this is boring as hell.First of all, there is no narration to pass time (like Dear Esther). You have zero clue what is going on, why, where you are and why should you even care and bother. It's also really really slow. One of the ""puzzles"" consist of you moving a ball over big countryside from one place to another... in a thick mist where you can barely see anything. You have almost no idea where you are aand where you are going... ""fun"". I finally gave up after ANOTHER of these ""puzzles"".Performance is horrible, at least the game looks decent. I had frames dropped below 25 for sure, which is unacceptable for this ""empty"" game. I'm NOT recommending Mind: Path to Thalamus at any price, even if it's 1 €. It's pointless and it's going to be one of a VERY FEW games I bought that I'm not going to finish.Go and buy The Talos Principle instead.			"

												Playing this game is the equivalent of dating a gorgeous airhead.  I'm intrigued by its visual beauty but trying to find meaning or interest in the shallow wastelands of this looker's mental landscape is a chore.  This is so unfortunate, because this game has so much promise. Though uninspired level design and visually obfuscated terrains spent searching for one useful item turn the game into basically a 3D pixel hunt and is such a slog I can't bring myself to finish it.PROS:+ Truly imaginative and awesome visual design+ Limited, but effective music+ A somewhat intriguing storyline (so far as I can tell)CONS:+ One note puzzle system gets tired quickly+ Objectives are often obscured by annoying atmospheric effects+ Searching expansive environments at a bone-crushingly slow speeds is UBER-tediousI bought this game after watching the truly impressive opening sequence in a Giant Bomb Quick Look.  I turned it off early so I wouldn't spoil my experience by seeing too much.  But in the end I should have watched the rest and exposed myself to the simple yet often-times obtuse puzzle system and saved myself a few bucks.  If you’re interested in MIND I’d suggest you just watch a YouTube playthrough like I'm about to do.Dangit, I really wanted to like this one too... "

												Invisible platforms and ominous uninteresting puzzles. No aparent story.Just a boring walking simulator through a desolate land solving weird puzzles. Also, you are teleported to other areas with different odd puzzles because it's more convenient than to have a progression that makes sense.Graphics look either ""oooh, nice environment"" or ""what's with the crap textures and low polygon 3D models, I set the graphics to ULTRA"".Setting video quality to Ultra also sets ""screen percentage"" to 200% which result in 60fps in-game but 1 FPS in the menus and invisible menu labels in the Graphics menu.Setting back ""screen percentage"" to 100% took over 5 minutes due to the unexplicable 1 freaking FPS in the menus.Game run in 4K but after Alt-Tab it switches to 1650*1080 for some reason, makes no sense to switch from 16:9 to 16:10Pressing Escape in the Graphics menu will exit the game instead of returning to the main menu, or, to the freaking game I was just playing...It also auto-created a category called ""Steam VR"" in my games which I neither want or care for.Lifeless Planet is MUCH better in all aspects.

												it would have been an ok game as walking simulator: pretty, light and slow story, but it's a puzzle game so it's really bad at that. The puzzles are either straightforward or very obtuse, when they don't need blind experimentation. But Mind commits one major, fatal flaw, one that should never, ever be found in a puzzle game: the areas are waaaaay too large. In all popular puzzle games, puzzles are self contained within eyesight, here it's possible to spend a few minutes wandering around, only to end up at the starting point, because the game abuses visual effects that makes it unreadable.

												(Update!) While I have to credit these fellas for making changes and listening to us, I am still unable to sell this to you. YET, FOLLOW THESE BOYS! THEY HAVE LEARNED FROM THEIR MISTAKES AND NEED SOME SUPPORT! Unlike most developers out there, once they are wrong they give up! This is not the case here and to be honest... I want to give it a thumbs up, but I paid for the original release and that is what the following review is based upon. Enjoy, your life. Now before we get started, I know a lot of you here are going to buy this regardless of what I write and while you shell out your cash, you will probably be thinking that I just don't get it. That is not at all correct, I spend most of my time on puzzle and/or story driven games. This is a product aimed at those of us that love surrealism and storytelling, but don't let that be the only reason you want to spend hard earned cash on it. I for one love anything that gets me thinking or asking questions. Sadly, this game had me asking all the wrong questions and came across as an ego trip.I don't want to be only negative, so I will point out that this game is not hard on the eyes when the screen is not tearing from time to time. Also, the music when playing is decent, it just always seems to fade away or get cut off before being allowed to really go anywhere amazing. Now let me get to why I am not able to recommend this product. It has a lot to do with the poor writing being about as good as the voice acting and the game design making you wonder, 'was that a bug?' For example, in the prologue I came to a point where the puzzle had me wondering, was that even suppose to happen? I do understand this was intended to be a cool little illusion type puzzle, but it seems sloppy and lazy. For some reason, the game makers think having you use reflections to find your way is fun. Followed by some trial and error puzzles that involve placing things in the right areas, that quickly become more of a chore than entertainment. By now you might be thinking, 'If I smoke some bud it has to be cool, right?' WRONG! If anything, you are going to find yourself cheesed out by the terrible writing that has such a hard on for itself. The screen tearing really is ugly when it does happen, it's not a lot but it does like to pop up; just could have been avoided all together. There is too much walking from one point to the next making any back~tracking that much more painful. The bad design has the game come across as rushed and broken when really these choices are on purpose in order to throw you off. The story is pretencious, with the main character going on and on about himself. The amount of times I heard the players character mention his daughters name in the first few minutes became annoying and way over written. It seems as if the developers made this in a bedroom, while the voice actor sounds as if he just wants to go home. I would be more kind if this game was not so full of pretentious bull$hit. The writer seems to be patting himself on the back the entire game, forcing words into the script out of nowhere as if he just learned them and wants to show off. The worlds seem forced, as if trying to be strange instead of mind~blowing or awe~inspiring. We have seen this all before and I don't see why there is any reason to choose this over some of the other 3D puzzle games on the market. I came across a lot of invisible walls, something I thought no longer existed in games these days. After awhile I just stopped trying to explore the worlds, since I was always stopped, keeping me stuck walking across fields knowing that it looks open, but is really linear.I understand this is suppose to be art and that I should have an open mind, (which I do) yet if that is how you want to look at it, then the art here is far too self indulged, closing your mind and making you see what the developers want you to see. The price is not so steep that I feel robbed completely, still I did pay enough to where I am let down by the product. If it was written better and the voice actor for the main character was not so off, I could put up with the level design and other problems. Everytime I hear the main voice actor speak about his daughter, all I can think to myself is how he does not sound at all like a strom chaser/father, and instead a game developer who really wants you to admire his work. It also comes across as if he is reading his lines right off a piece of paper for the first time. I really hate to give this a thumbs down since it could have been something, yet there are other games out there better than this. If you really must play something new and have yet to enjoy, A Story About My Uncle, then try that first. It is far better than this on all levels and if you need more surreal worlds and 3D puzzles, then maybe this is for you, just get ready for a character that loves to hear his own voice. I'll end this review with a quote from the game.""All this sounds pretty cheesy and lame, I'm sure. And it is.""			"

												Unfortunately even with teleportation enabled, something about this game's perspective / scale still made me feel a bit naucious. That combined with a fairly weak story and evnironment means that I cannot recommend this game. Maybe if the narrative was a bit stronger, I could have pushed past my mild nausia.			"

												The guy who said ""walking simulator"" ... that guy was right. I also find the sound effects to be too loud - extremely loud, especially in the beginning, when you're still trying to figure out if this is just a cheap looking action adventure or a horror game. Apart from that, I basically lost interest after I fell three times through the only two stairwells standing in a desert; stairwells that I apparently was not supposed to use after all. The game is not beautiful enough to make up for that crap.			"

												Visually very pretty first-person puzzle game that attempts to tell a deeply emotional story and falls flat on its face in the process. There's no denying the technical prowess on display here, but both gameplay and story leave a lot to be desired.Puzzles start up promisingly and introduce a couple of nice mechanics but then get stuck in a rut, rehashing the same few elements over and over again for the rest of the game. You'll be hauling tumbleweed balls (that inconveniently block a huge chunk of your vision) made out of synapses until the cows come home, or rather until the pretentious story finally reaches its disappointing conclusion.Annoying voice acting and story, puzzles that frequently require hefty doses of trial-and-error and some extremely dubious gameplay elements (ultra-thick fog, anyone?) really made this one a drag. I was hoping it'd get better towards the end, but it actually got worse.			"

												This game is absolutle beautiful, the atmosphere is stunning and the music sets the mood very well (Bar one moment where it sounded like my character was eating a bag of chips for ~5 min.). From an aesthetic point of view I'd easily give this a 10/10.The meat of the game was surprisingly fun as I progressed through, although I will admit I only encountered mild difficulty at best, beating the full game in just under 2 hours. Not worth the $11 on spent on a game that offers hardly any replayability. It seems that much of the difficulty in this game is traversing the large spaces these puzzles take place in, which leads to me to think of it as a difficulty substitute, granted the final few puzzles took me a while to figure out despite the walking back and forth, and I did feel a sense of accomplishment when I completed it.The dialogue and plotline are really where this game falls flat for me. There is too much prententious dialogue which I felt would make for a cerebral ending, something that would make me think if even for a minute. I was wrong, the game wrapped it self up leaving little to be desired.I suppose I'll play through again for the steam achievements, maybe I'll find some fun easteregg, by my hopes are nigh.Overall I have to give this game's:Story 4/10Dialogue 5/10Audio 8/10Graphics 9/10Atmosphere 10/10			"

There are few clues to make progress, and I can’t find connections between puzzles and game’s theme. It’s hard to understand puzzles on this game cause puzzle has no the context with the story. So if you want to feel some trendy visuals, buy it. But I can’t say this game offers deep gaming experience.			"

												This is NOT a puzzle game! This has more in common with Dear Esther than any puzzle game.While there are a few inventive puzzles in the game you spend the vast majority of your time walking through the environment listening to story exposition or even worse walking through the environment listening to nothing at all.The few puzzles in the game are barely integrated into the story. While they are inventive and well designed they are needlessly drawn out by the incredibly slow walking speed that makes it a chore to solve them. You'll be spending what feels like minutes at a time doing little more than holding down the W key.No game ever needed a sprint key this much.There are far better puzzle games out there that tell better stories and get the balance between story and puzzle right:Quantum Conundrum, Papo & Yo and Portal 2 for starters.

												Mind: Path to Thalamus is a contemplative first-person puzzle game about loss and guilt. Set in a truly breathtaking dream-world, the main gameplay features are some light platforming and puzzle-solving.The puzzles are not very challenging, taking a little time to figure out the first time, but mostly just there to drive you through the narrative as well as making you explore in the beautiful world.The biggest criticism of the game at release was the voice-over narration which just felt distracting and annoying with its near-constant presence. However this was later toned down quite a bit, but the ending part still has an extremely annoying voice-over that just runs on repeat and completely destroys the mood of the game.The game seems very well optimized and runs perfectly fine on my 5 year old machine with a GTX580 card.Apart from its minor flaws, I really recommend this game for fans of slow-paced contemplative games.

												This game is very short. I think I spent about an hour looking at the scenery, so it took me about 3 hours to get through the game. It's a very ethereal experience though and completing a puzzle feels rewarding. I normally don't like to play through games I've already completed but I'm looking forward to doing that with this game once the experience fades away. Since it's so dang short but like being inside a dreamy photograph, there's not much to get in the way of just sitting back and exploring the scenery again.One con is that you'll need a decent PC to get the full experience since lowering the quality slightly to get more FPS kind of ruins the visuals. Also, low frame rates will kill your ability to run forward with the tumbleweeds for some reason--another trade off for running the game on higher settings with a not-so-great computer.			"

												Mind: Path to Thalamus has a lot going for it.  The graphics and visuals are great, even though they occasionally appear as though the game is artifacting rather than showing you a beautiful particle effect.  The sound is great, and the puzzles are really the highlight here, with enough to keep the best puzzle enthusiasts busy for quite some time.  The whole game has a nice somber story with a relaxing/mellow mood for the most part, which really brings the games story to life.  For the price, I would recommend this game for its experience, and its puzzles but not really it's mechanics.I do like the games story, and the visuals and sound, but there are two big downsides, that only the price of the game and the quality of the puzzles keep me from downvoting it from.The voice acting of the game is horrendous, but I never expected much from a small indie game like this.  The bigger issue is that the gameplay controls are terrible.  They're clunky and at the same time float-y.  Your character feels heavy and hard to move around soemtimes, and then other times, it feels like you're hovering off of the ground when you're moving through the levels, which really took away from the experience for me.In short, I would recommend this game, but mostly because the story is interesting and the puzzles are challenging, but the game controls and the voice acting really break the immersion for me, but the game is still worth a shot for those interested.

												I have played many puzzle games at this point... and this one is definitely a fairly unique take on the genre.  At least where the ""setting"" is concerned.  Most of the puzzles started out pretty simple and I was beginning to fear that the game may just be too repetative and confusing, but it got better as I progressed further.  The puzzles near the end were definitely a bit more challenging.Potential Gameplay Spoiler:  There is one section of the game (the colossus) that is a bit more frustrating as it is less of a puzzle and more of a ""dodge the giant foot about to step on you"" level, but with the right technique it actually wans't as difficult as it appeared to be at first.  Hang in there and it gets better again.That said... It was indeed a weird game and I'm still not quite sure what I think about the storyline... it left me feeling a little bit uneasy at times but I suppose that was its intent.Overall I think this game was successful in entertaining me for a few hours, and for that I will give it a thumbs up!  Not much replay value though, and it is fairly short, so I would recommend buying it on sale.  I got it as part of a humble bundle myself so I don't feel like I overpaid, but the full price on Steam does feel a little bit high to me for only 5 hours of gameplay.			"

												This game was interesting to say the very least.The visuals were nothing short of stunning, and while my computer wasn't quite up to snuff (15 fps in outdoors, 30 in less complicated areas), it didn't keep me from being able to enjoy the scenery. I personally compare the gameplay to that of Portal - a simple concept, but used in different ways that kept the same rules while still managing to add something new at each turn. The story was one of self-reflection, among other subtleties. It wouldn't stand out very much on its own, but it ties in with the environments to create a symphony of symbolism. There were a few things worthy of nitpicks, such as subtitles not quite matching the spoken lines and a single texture issue, but despite all the small things, I cannot deny I had an absolute blast the whole time.Whether you simply want to enjoy the view, give your brain something new to figure out, or hear a heartwarming story about forgiveness, I'd highly recommend this game to anyone.

												As a game and an interactive experience, Mind: Path to Thalamus succeeds in being one of the more successful attempts to bring logical puzzle play to a surreal environment. As a metaphorical narrative, it leaves something to be desired.The game play of Mind is simple, in order to proceed you have to bring these blue tumbleweed things to various locations in order to manipulate the environmental aspects of day/night, weather, and time in order to unlock the path forward. Utilizing a gradual learning curve that still offers a challenge, Mind starts you off with one element at a time - for instance: teaching you that sometimes an object you need may be visible only at night and then having you figure out how to acquire this object without sacrificing some other aspect of your progression - before introducing multiple elements at once By the end of the game you're very much thinking 4th dimensionally about things, but even the head-scratchingest of puzzles were logical in the end. Even at my most frustrated, I never thought ""that's a stupid solution"" and instead was more apt to berate myself for not having noticed it sooner.More than just eye candy. Mind utilizes its surreal environments to full effect, with puzzles involving everything from reflections to portals, and gravity. Sadly however the story seems virtually divorced from the game play aside from the its heavy handed ending levels. Unlike Papo & Yo (another surreal adventure puzzler) Mind says too much too often and relies too much on narration and all-too-obvious symbols to achieve its metaphor. The gameplay could easily be read as part of the main character's coma-induced journey, but it rarely relates directly to the subjects and experiences the narrator talks about. Add to this the fairly amateur voice acting and VERY uneven dialogue volume (with no option to adjust) and Mind's narrative experience fell a little flat with me, feeling extraneous at best and pretentious at worst.Overall the game was an enjoyable experience however and for the environments and puzzles alone is worth checking out. There are some interesting ideas at work here that I felt justified my time spent with the game.			"

												A simple journey into the center of the mind.  A screwed up and guilt wracked one, sure, but a mind.  Beutiful visuals, simple mechanics and a difficulty just hard enough to feel rewarding when you figure it out.  The narrator is just a bit annoying at time, but thankfully he doesn't talk much.			"

												I've got to be honest - I put off playing this game for a while due to some negative reviews on community boards, but I finally broke down and decided to buy it and give it a shot for myself... and I am actually REALLY glad that I did. The game is downright gorgeous. It runs well even on my Intel HD Graphics Card laptop. The puzzles are actually simple in design, but complex to solve at times, which is a great balance. While the mechanics themselves are simple, it's the order of the puzzles which provides the challenge - it requires you to actually use your brain! The story was pleasing, and I actually found myself emotionally effected at times, be it fear, sadness, awe, terror or joy. Few games can cycle a player through those emotions, and Path to Thalamus did a fantastic job. My only criticism of this entire game is a repeat of what others have said, that at times the voice acting can be a little ""dry"". It's not that it was terrible, but there were many times that I just didn't fell immersed by the narration. IE: It wasn't believable. That said, it was not a bother at all, and without the voice overs, the game would have been less, so I am actually glad that they were there. All in all, if you are looking for a challenging yet relaxing game, with beautiful visuals, great music, a pretty well though-out story, and a satisfying conclusion, this is probably something you will enjoy. Definitely recommended.			"

Only play this game if you enjoy a series of decent puzzles and can overlook things like bad writing and dialogue.Mind: Path to Thalamus shines in its visuals and puzzle design.  I just wish they had applied the same amount of care and devotion to the story, writing, and dialogue.  Everything about the story feels like a very rough draft, written and recorded in one take on a lazy afternoon.  I can't help but wonder if the writer was trying to work through some of their own personal issues by shoe-horning them into this game.  It works well enough as a game.  A series of mechanics that a user must manipulate in order to reach the next level.  The puzzles are challenging and will consume a few hours of your evening.  But as an interactive story, it barely reaches mediocre.And the ending... god the ending. I won't spoil anything for you, but... maybe just shut the game off and uninstall it before the ""final boss battle"".  Yeah, an emotive story/puzzle game about coping with death ends with a stereotypical final boss battle.  If that doesn't clue you in to how disjointed the last chapter of this game feels, then I assure you your money is better spent elsewhere.  Reaching the final boss put me over the 2-hour limit to get a refund.  I'm going to request one anyway just to test the waters.Like I said, the puzzles are expertly crafted, and the maps are stunning to behold.  I found myself taking several screenshots throughout my play session.  For these reasons I do recommend the game.  But only with the caveat that everything else about the game felt like an afterthought.  I would suggest playing the game on mute, with the subtitles turned on.  Any voice you can conjure in your head will be miles ahead of the recorded dialogue in terms of quality and believability.			"

												This game.... I just fell in love with it. It's totally different from other games. This had some feels in it and I liked the story. I've just entered the indie part of video games and if I may compare this to many of the AAA titles this game beats alot of them. I might just have found myself my favorite game. Loved every second of it. Even the times when it scared the crap out of me.			"

												This game is a visual masterpiece! No matter how hard you try you cant make it look bad. Also the soundtrack (being a composer myself) fits perfectly. There are moments when the music entered and i just got chills up my spine. Everything seems perfect till the narrator enters. Not to say it spoils the game, but it can ruin the mood. It's not necessarily the voice actors voice, as much as it was the storyline and script. To be honest, having no narration would have been more inspiring to me and go for more of a Shadow of the Colossus approach.Overall I would recommend this game. I think it exemplifies video games as art. Oh and the puzzles are there more as reason to wander and explore the beautiful world as oppossed to really challenging you. "

												First Impressions:This is one truly visual masterpiece...I wanted to stop and enjoy the scenery but couldn't help but keep going in order to continue the story.  There are some puzzle elements to the game so it's most certainly not a ""walking simulator"".  Folks who enjoy visually stunning adventure games with puzzle elements will enjoy this.  I myself picked it up during a Humble Bundle sale (6 games for $4), so grab it cheap while you can!

The puzzles are satisfying and the game is a decent length (my playtime is not indicative of game length as I played most of it in offline mode). The game does have its flaws - the writing is poor and the voice acting is awful. Ignore the story and play for the atmosphere and puzzles, I still wholeheartedly recommend this despite these flaws.			"

												This puzzle game takes you through some of the most stunning and awe-inspriring alien landscapes; and yes it is an indie game!  The concept and the imagination that went into this game is truly inspiring.  Most video games don't take you to the same headspace as ""Mind"" (except for the ""Myst"" games).  The creators successfully take you to a place that gaming has never been to, out in the cosmos or in your mind is all up to you.  9/10.  If you love the Myst games (I'm a Myst freak) you MUST PLAY THIS GAME!!!			"

												I have played many puzzle games at this point... and this one is definitely a fairly unique take on the genre.  At least where the ""setting"" is concerned.  Most of the puzzles started out pretty simple and I was beginning to fear that the game may just be too repetative and confusing, but it got better as I progressed further.  The puzzles near the end were definitely a bit more challenging.Potential Gameplay Spoiler:  There is one section of the game (the colossus) that is a bit more frustrating as it is less of a puzzle and more of a ""dodge the giant foot about to step on you"" level, but with the right technique it actually wans't as difficult as it appeared to be at first.  Hang in there and it gets better again.That said... It was indeed a weird game and I'm still not quite sure what I think about the storyline... it left me feeling a little bit uneasy at times but I suppose that was its intent.Overall I think this game was successful in entertaining me for a few hours, and for that I will give it a thumbs up!  Not much replay value though, and it is fairly short, so I would recommend buying it on sale.  I got it as part of a humble bundle myself so I don't feel like I overpaid, but the full price on Steam does feel a little bit high to me for only 5 hours of gameplay.			"

Even without the stunning graphics (which were really easy to drive with a pentium G3258 and GTX 650 surprisingly) the basic game mechanics were very well thought out. It was simple but still managed to be pretty challanging.

												I liked the game, but hated the story. The narrative theme feels like it was MAYBE too mature/complex for the writers and the voice actor. btw: I hated that voice actor. Beeing taunted for 10 minutes by someone who sounds like a teenager/young adult was just too much for me. And i didn´t believe a word of his ""i had good times with my daughter"" lines. While some levels are closely designed around the narrative, others feel like ""unreal engine experiments"".Puzzles are rewarding/fair, graphics are nice and immerse(I love the ""night"" and the rain sounds), pacing is fine, controls are great.

												As a game and an interactive experience, Mind: Path to Thalamus succeeds in being one of the more successful attempts to bring logical puzzle play to a surreal environment. As a metaphorical narrative, it leaves something to be desired.The game play of Mind is simple, in order to proceed you have to bring these blue tumbleweed things to various locations in order to manipulate the environmental aspects of day/night, weather, and time in order to unlock the path forward. Utilizing a gradual learning curve that still offers a challenge, Mind starts you off with one element at a time - for instance: teaching you that sometimes an object you need may be visible only at night and then having you figure out how to acquire this object without sacrificing some other aspect of your progression - before introducing multiple elements at once By the end of the game you're very much thinking 4th dimensionally about things, but even the head-scratchingest of puzzles were logical in the end. Even at my most frustrated, I never thought ""that's a stupid solution"" and instead was more apt to berate myself for not having noticed it sooner.More than just eye candy. Mind utilizes its surreal environments to full effect, with puzzles involving everything from reflections to portals, and gravity. Sadly however the story seems virtually divorced from the game play aside from the its heavy handed ending levels. Unlike Papo & Yo (another surreal adventure puzzler) Mind says too much too often and relies too much on narration and all-too-obvious symbols to achieve its metaphor. The gameplay could easily be read as part of the main character's coma-induced journey, but it rarely relates directly to the subjects and experiences the narrator talks about. Add to this the fairly amateur voice acting and VERY uneven dialogue volume (with no option to adjust) and Mind's narrative experience fell a little flat with me, feeling extraneous at best and pretentious at worst.Overall the game was an enjoyable experience however and for the environments and puzzles alone is worth checking out. There are some interesting ideas at work here that I felt justified my time spent with the game.			"

												Beautiful scenery and enchanting environments make this puzzle solving experience on par with the Portal series in its own right.  What it lacks in story and humor it makes up for with atmosphere and wonder.  The puzzles weren't too complex - with some dedication and careful thinking one could eventually proceed to the next puzzle without becoming too flustered.   The story was hard to follow, mostly because I didn't realize someone was talking until about halfway through the game - the voice audio by default was extremely low, and all other audio extremely high.  So I attempted to check the in game menu and start menu, but neither of these have options for audio at all - but they do offer an option for subtitles.  But honestly there is no point in the story being there.  From what I could understand it was rather cliche and the voice acting was in need of improvement.  But you could have just told me I was in a fantasy world and had to solve puzzles with absolutley no purpose and I would have been happy.  I hope they make a sequel and leave out a story.			"

												Epic, Entertaining, Enjoyable:It helps to have a video card. That said, after I turned all the effects down to minimum standards, the game operated quite smoothly with only moderate drops in frame rate.Also while carrying the blue tumbleweeds, you will occassionally have to hold a tumbleweed up above your head while you walk forward with it to avoid tripping over said tumbleweed and have it roll away on you. Picking up and manipulating the tumbleweeds is a core gameplay mechanic and I just wished the developers had smoothed it out a bit more. The game is well designed but just gets choppy every once in a while. It is also helpful to remember that this game was crafted by just a handful of dudes.Overall, the flow of gameplay was very organic and the environments were forgiving enough to allow the player to get creative in their problem solving. That is not to say that there are multiple solutions to puzzles; I don't think there are, just that the game will frequently require you to think out of the box and understand how the blue tumbleweeds might interact with the level. Intuitive, logical and very fun to play.			"

												This game was interesting to say the very least.The visuals were nothing short of stunning, and while my computer wasn't quite up to snuff (15 fps in outdoors, 30 in less complicated areas), it didn't keep me from being able to enjoy the scenery. I personally compare the gameplay to that of Portal - a simple concept, but used in different ways that kept the same rules while still managing to add something new at each turn. The story was one of self-reflection, among other subtleties. It wouldn't stand out very much on its own, but it ties in with the environments to create a symphony of symbolism. There were a few things worthy of nitpicks, such as subtitles not quite matching the spoken lines and a single texture issue, but despite all the small things, I cannot deny I had an absolute blast the whole time.Whether you simply want to enjoy the view, give your brain something new to figure out, or hear a heartwarming story about forgiveness, I'd highly recommend this game to anyone.

The over layered story didn't cause too much distraction until the last level...where at it just goes bonkers on top of more bonkers script...quite the cheezy ending in gameplay too. I enjoyed all the puzzles & levels other than the last. The 'Big Boss' vibe here was so out of character with everything that had gone before, odd.

												Mind: Path to Thalamus is visually stunning and worth playing for that reason alone. However, some of the puzzles are tedious such as searching a large area when you can only see about 3 feet in front of you and others are frustrating, such as slowly moving while trying to dodge objects from the sky only to get repeatedly crushed. Also, the story isn't great and the voice acting is worse. The game appears to have been deeloped by a Spanish game studio so presumably this is a translated version, but it feels like someone's buddy volunteered to do the voice -- it just doesn't match the professional value of the visuals. Still, it is one of the prettiest looking games I've played in some time.			"

												The story is quite confusing, the intentions of your character not very clear, and the voice acting is, to be honest, not that convincing.But when the narrator isn't talking? Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this game is breath-taking. The visuals are absolutely STUNNING and the soundtrack is simply the best video game soundtrack I have ever listened to. The BEST. I could've stayed forever listening to the main theme while gazing at the skies. It really is very easy to lose yourself in those grand, soothing and colourful sceneries.The puzzles themselves are nice. Far from being difficult, they mostly involve a lot of walking which gives you the occasion to admire the landscapes, so it was perfectly fine to me. Their only flaw would be how little they relate to the overall story and are just an excuse to delay the storytelling.In the end, if you can put up with a failed try at a deep and cynical introspection of a tortured man, and want in on a game that will make your ears and retinas ♥♥♥♥♥♥, you can give a shot to Mind: Path to Thalamus, and you won't be disapointed.

												This Game is a reall masterpiece, all about it is just dreamy and poetic, you can play it for hours and wake up at a moment saying to yourself ""ho god i wasn't dreaming, i'm still playing this game !"". There is very few music but it's even stronger when it plays out of nowhere and it is a beatifull track. All the game is perfect, the gemplay is nice and intuitive, and the story telling is verry good.I recommend so so badly ! And for those who as me are in perpetual searching of this kind of immersive and narative games, go look after ""the vanishing of ethan carter"" and ""Allan wake"", please do it :)			"

												Mind is a pretty straighforward first person puzzle game.  There are only a handful of mechanics, but the puzzles increase in difficulty relatively smoothly as the game progresses.  I played this game hoping it would be similar to Myst, but it isn't.  Mind is very linear.  The logic involved isn't quite as engaging as Myst or Kairo, but you probably aren't going to get stuck due to a disconnect between how you think and how the developers want you to think.  The game boils down to find a ball, put the ball where it's supposed to be, advance to next puzzle.  A lot of people compare this game to Dear Esther.  That is a pretty fair comparison.  I would consider Mind to be 70% Dear Esther, 20% Kairo, and 10% Myst.Mind has a lot of very beautiful scenery and magnificent lighting.  Just looking around is a lot fun,  Unfortunately there are huge amounts of empty space that ultimately don't add much to the experience.  There is a desparate need for a sprint function.  Early on I would explore to see more of the environments, but you have to slowly wander back to where you were supposed to be.  At times, the only difficulty in progressing is trying to find the ball in a large environment.  Still, a lot of the environments are pretty cool, especially the ones that are more surreal.  It may sound kind of droll, but the game is still pretty engaging.  There's a somewhat decent story as you progress.  It's not too long, which I consider a plus because it doesn't overstay its welcome, and I never got stuck for significant time until the last main puzzle.Overall, Mind is pretty simple but incredibly polished.  I love the small details, like rolling the ball if you hold it close to the ground as you move, or the effect of light shining through the ball's holes when you hold it up to a light source.  I would recommend playing it if you're looking for an artsy eyecandy game with semi-casual puzzle elements. "

												This is a short game (3 to 5 hours, depending on how stuck you get on the puzzles) that has the advantage of not needing a walkthough and being just difficult enough to be interesting. I thought about looking something up twice and in both cases I was able to *think* my way through the puzzle.I never played the original version, but this ""enhanced"" version is quite well paced and very often looks like a living sureallist painting, without becoming overwhelming about it.Recommended if you like ""thinking outside the box"" puzzle/exploration games.

												I liked the game, but hated the story. The narrative theme feels like it was MAYBE too mature/complex for the writers and the voice actor. btw: I hated that voice actor. Beeing taunted for 10 minutes by someone who sounds like a teenager/young adult was just too much for me. And i didn´t believe a word of his ""i had good times with my daughter"" lines. While some levels are closely designed around the narrative, others feel like ""unreal engine experiments"".Puzzles are rewarding/fair, graphics are nice and immerse(I love the ""night"" and the rain sounds), pacing is fine, controls are great. Check it out! "

												There's very little options, and I found myself having to edit my mouse sensitivity with the console to get the right mouse speed... and editing config files to rebind my keys.If you can put that aside, and deal with the sometimes tedious puzzles I would recommend this game for certain.It's an interesting, visually impressive ride through a strange world deep inside the protagonist's mind. You walk slow, you take in the scenery, and you solve some pretty decent puzzles. That's it. The fantastic environments are the best thing about this game, and if you have the patience to deal with the slow movement speed, it can be a very good game. I found myself taking more screenshots than pretty much any other game.. it's just impressive.One boss fight in particular blew me away, and I think it's worth the game for this alone. Just buy it and play it.			"

												This game is absolutely beautiful.  It is so incredibly breathtaking that I suffocated and blacked out multiple times from the pure majesty.  On a serious note, the puzzles are extrememly unique; unlike any puzzle game I've played so far.  The game logically and gradually introduces new puzzle elements slowly throughout the entire game.  You master one puzzle element at a time, and then in the end, have to use all of your combined knowledge to solve the later puzzles.  The story telling is cryptic, yet also intriguing enough to keep you going.  It is a very unique story where everything comes together in the end.How many times will he kill her?

												Gorgeous game. Great story, very engaging. There were plenty of times it made me literally jump - it startles you after lulling you into a sense of calm.A word of warning to those who get motion sickness: This game may give you motion sickness if you play it for a long enough stretch. I found if I took it in short sessions, I was okay, but if I played for hours I'd get nauseous. Seems to happen to me with atmospheric games like this and Kairo. My theory is the lack of HUD and/or hands/guns in front of me makes it harder for my brain to find a good reference point, so it gets confused by the visual motion cues when there's a lack of corresponding physical motion cues.

												Being a fan of puzzle and thoughtful games most of my life, I am recommending this. The puzzles are well thought out, some challenging, some not. They are varied and are not always the same thing over and over again, which is definitely a plus. The scenery and atmosphere is absolutely beautiful. In this game, you need to ""think outside of the box"" on more than 10 occassions. Replay value is there, if you enjoy puzzlers.10/10 would Path again.			"

												The story is quite confusing, the intentions of your character not very clear, and the voice acting is, to be honest, not that convincing.But when the narrator isn't talking? Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this game is breath-taking. The visuals are absolutely STUNNING and the soundtrack is simply the best video game soundtrack I have ever listened to. The BEST. I could've stayed forever listening to the main theme while gazing at the skies. It really is very easy to lose yourself in those grand, soothing and colourful sceneries.The puzzles themselves are nice. Far from being difficult, they mostly involve a lot of walking which gives you the occasion to admire the landscapes, so it was perfectly fine to me. Their only flaw would be how little they relate to the overall story and are just an excuse to delay the storytelling.In the end, if you can put up with a failed try at a deep and cynical introspection of a tortured man, and want in on a game that will make your ears and retinas ♥♥♥♥♥♥, you can give a shot to Mind: Path to Thalamus, and you won't be disapointed.

												It's amazing to me that a game so beautiful in its design and creative in its puzzles can be so deeply marred by the writing and voice acting. Earlier on in the game, I had dismissed the comments in reviews that detracted the voice acting, thinking ""it's not so bad"". But now, having finally finished the game, I understand. While I think the story itself is very interesting, the way it is told and not shown ruins the execution. The narration seems to assume that the player is not clever enough to understand what is going on unless it is painstakingly explained by way of pretentious voice-acting. At times, it even seems to be self-deprecating, as if aware of some of its own flaws. The ending is particularly guilty of this, which very nearly robs the player of any satisfaction to be found in the resolution of the story. In particular, the comments about the ""evil ball of death"" and the voice-swapping were sheer moments of face-palm for me. So despite the fact that I found this game incredible on several other levels, it left me on a sour note. Am I implying I could have done a better job with the writing? Absolutely not, and I have to stress that I commend the creators of this game for such an excellent story and concept. I just feel that the game would have nothing to lose and everything to gain by simply removing the narration entirely. Perhaps this could even be a settings option to just disable it. For bonus points, the game could ""show"" a bit more of the story along the way in place of telling it. Now that my complaints are out of the way, I can get on to writing about what an amazing game this is, on every other level. Based on the concept, design, and gameplay, it could have been the ideal game for me. I was overjoyed to find a game based on the intersection of the exploration of consciousness and psychology with fantastical landscapes and locations - something like that is right up my alley. And indeed, that's what this is, and it's executed wonderfully. Many of the level designs, art concepts and effects that you'll experience here are truly stunning, and I found this to be even more true as I approached the end. While the puzzle mechanics could have used a bit more diversity, the different ways they are combined in the more challenging puzzles keeps things fresh and enjoyably mind-bending. The gameplay is at its most satisfying when it nudges you to think in new ways in order to solve different types of puzzles. And the locations are perpetually screenshot-worthy, always vast and mysterious, a joy to explore. Each of these elements are incredibly well-executed and provide a unique experience.I spent about 5 hours here and would gladly enjoy another playthrough someday. I don't feel the flaws in the game come close to eclipsing the things it does well, so I can only click the recommend button, and hope you enjoy this game with appropriately adjusted expectations for the narration.

												Mind: Path to Thalamus is a not very hard puzzler with a good story and interesting mechanics. It looks and feels amazing to play, but the narration is likely to get on some people's nerves if they're not into narration. Even so, the game offers a unique experience, which is something very hard to do these days. Looking forward to getting an Occulus rift to try this game out on - as it supports this device, and would definately use it to it's full potential.			"

												I have played many puzzle games at this point... and this one is definitely a fairly unique take on the genre.  At least where the ""setting"" is concerned.  Most of the puzzles started out pretty simple and I was beginning to fear that the game may just be too repetative and confusing, but it got better as I progressed further.  The puzzles near the end were definitely a bit more challenging.Potential Gameplay Spoiler:  There is one section of the game (the colossus) that is a bit more frustrating as it is less of a puzzle and more of a ""dodge the giant foot about to step on you"" level, but with the right technique it actually wans't as difficult as it appeared to be at first.  Hang in there and it gets better again.That said... It was indeed a weird game and I'm still not quite sure what I think about the storyline... it left me feeling a little bit uneasy at times but I suppose that was its intent.Overall I think this game was successful in entertaining me for a few hours, and for that I will give it a thumbs up!  Not much replay value though, and it is fairly short, so I would recommend buying it on sale.  I got it as part of a humble bundle myself so I don't feel like I overpaid, but the full price on Steam does feel a little bit high to me for only 5 hours of gameplay.			"

												The game stumbles at times... the dialog rarely lives up to the truly breathtaking visual design, and the truly clever and intellectually gratifying puzzles are occasionally interrupted by areas where it is not even vaguely clear what one should be trying to do.In the end though, this game really should not be missed.  It is not a perfect game, but it is composed of enough perfect moments that it will linger in your memory long after the credits have rolled.			"

												One of the most complex, beautiful puzzle games I've played. There were times where I would stop and look at the gorgeous textures that seemed to effortlessly weave with the game's soundtracks. If you like abstract puzzle games kinda like portal and other puzzle indie creations, I highly recommend this game. Ends pretty cool too ;) 9.6/10			"

												First of all, this game is gorgeous. Absolutely stunning. The soundtrack is exquisite and used effectively to enhance each individual atmosphere. The puzzle solving elements are not overly difficult, but do still require good thought and planning to pass, especially towards the end of the game. The only things ""negative"" I have to say about the game is that the storyline is a little weak and the voice acting isn't great. All in all, great game if you like games with a great atmosphere, good game if you enjoy puzzles, mediocre game if you're in it for the story. Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  :)			"

												Being a fan of puzzle and thoughtful games most of my life, I am recommending this. The puzzles are well thought out, some challenging, some not. They are varied and are not always the same thing over and over again, which is definitely a plus. The scenery and atmosphere is absolutely beautiful. In this game, you need to ""think outside of the box"" on more than 10 occassions. Replay value is there, if you enjoy puzzlers.10/10 would Path again.			"

												Interesting puzzle game. No explainations or hints. Just problems in your face. Deal with it.The story makes no sense and is completely irrelvant to the experience, which is a bit sad as I think it was trying to be deep and mysterious. It seems deep and mysterious, and it is, but the visuals carry it, not the story.It glitched out on me once, making a puzzle impossible to do. I came back later to make one last attempt and it was different. Strangest glitch ever. And it wasn't just me seeing things I didn't see last time. Weird things that were there last time were gone, and a broken thing wasn't broken any more. Was it part of the game? Was I meant to give up and turn it off to solve the puzzle? Who knows.To make it stranger still, having now completed the game, I realise there's a way to get through it without even going to that gltiched out room. Bizarre. There seems to be a few ways to progress sometimes, though there may only be one way the leads to progress and the others send you backwards. I had one instance of that, which sent me through the glitch room. I get the feeling there was probably a handful of time I could have gone the ""wrong"" way and ended up going backwards. Funny thing about this game is you're never sure about anything, which both adds to and takes away from the experience. Mostly it was a good thing. Adds to the dream like quality of the experience.However, having said that, it's not as dream like as it could have been, but again, there's no explaination going in about what's happening, what should happen, or what you should do about it, so it's hard to say what they were going for.It makes slightly more sense by the end and is an interesting journey. I made it through without a walkthrough, which is the only sense of accomplishment you'll get out of it. If you cheat, the experiencce won't be worthwhile in my opinion.Overall I liked it, and I do recommend it, however having just finished it, the experience wasn't as rewarding as I was hoping. [Slight Story Spoiler! I don't say what the story is, I just say what it isn't, which may ruin the mystery of it]I think it's mainly the story that ruined it for me. It tried so hard to have one, and while it's easy to understand, it's hard to understand how the game is related to it, or why it was a story worth telling.In my opinion it would have been a lot better if they went for a trippy, hard to understand story. Something that can be interpreted in a lot of ways. Something that makes a point and leaves you nodding slowing during the end credits, rubbing your chin, thinking about love, life and the space time continuum. But no. I think that's what they wanted me to be doing, but it wasn't happening.			"

An indie humble game made by a one-man team, I mean, don't expect a huge game with lots of innovative features. So far, the game showed me it was made with both, love and great care, It also challenges players to explore and figure out how to solve puzzles set in a stunning 3D environment.			"

												This game i do recommend, IF you like puzzles. Yes, the visuals in this game are quite amazing, very nicely done and awesome to just look at, but still if you're not into puzzles it is not worth it. If you do, there are some challenging puzzles in this game, some took me a while to solve. The hours shown are not actually the hours played, since i sometimes leave the game on when i do something else in the meantime. I do think it took me around 6 hours. Fortunately most of the time the puzzles are challenging but logical. Some puzzles did not make sense to me at all which i think is a bit annoying.One very bad aspect was the narrating. The game is narrated by the main character but the voice acting is absolutely terrible, and so is the writing. Even though the story is ok, i could not really enjoy it due to the annoying narrator. However, he does not talk often.So summing up; if you like puzzles: play! If you do not like puzzles, look at some screenshots to see how awesome it looks and for the rest leave it.			"

												There's very little options, and I found myself having to edit my mouse sensitivity with the console to get the right mouse speed... and editing config files to rebind my keys.If you can put that aside, and deal with the sometimes tedious puzzles I would recommend this game for certain.It's an interesting, visually impressive ride through a strange world deep inside the protagonist's mind. You walk slow, you take in the scenery, and you solve some pretty decent puzzles. That's it. The fantastic environments are the best thing about this game, and if you have the patience to deal with the slow movement speed, it can be a very good game. I found myself taking more screenshots than pretty much any other game.. it's just impressive.One boss fight in particular blew me away, and I think it's worth the game for this alone. Just buy it and play it.			"

												This game is utterly exquisite, a visual feast, I found myself completely captivated from the very first second of playing.  A massive congratulations and huge thanks to the designer and the entire development team, the ethereal quality and abstract puzzles make for a challenging experience in compellingly beautiful landscapes.  Making full use of the Unreal engine to create dreamlike vistas that guide the player on a entrancing journey with a well crafted narrative and dreamlike soundtrack driving the player and giving subtle hints as to how to progress.  I applaud any development team who are willing to take the risk with something different than the normal games. This is one of the best, most creative games I've played in years and cannot wait to see what this team of developers bring us next, I hope it will be more stunningly designed games to spark the imagination.

												Mind: Path to Thalamus is a first-person, exploratation, puzzle game that focuses on changing weather and time to shape the environment around you.  The story, not so much engrossing, is interesting to a point.  Voice acting was more or less average.  Soundtrack was serene and elegantly composed.  What made this little gem worth playing through was the scenery and overall atmosphere.  Excellently done on the graphics, simple but beautiful all the same.  Puzzles range from fairly obvious to moderately difficult depending on your experience.  My big peeve with the game is regarding one of the last levels.  I can't really explain it without spoiling anything, but you have to execute the puzzle a certain way or else you can't finish it.  I spent over an hour without making any progress because after I solved part of the puzzle, the level no longer let me change some of the weather.  It's also important to note that in this particular level, after having solved a portion of it, I could not reverse it.  I had to start over after watching a walkthrough.  Furthermore, this level from what I gathered was the ONLY one in the game where if you messed up, you had no choice but to start over.  I understand and appreciate it when puzzle games don't take you by the hand and help you every step of the way but with this case, it was incredibly frustrating not knowing a mistake you made in the puzzle was irreversible. 7/10			"

												I came here to see beautiful scenery and came back awestruck!Mind is a game about exploration and wonder driven forward by a bittersweet narrative.  The puzzles were pretty obscure at first, but once you get the hang of the puzzle mechanics they were a welcome challenge to pace the game.  Only a few times did I find myself a bit hung up in one place.  Ultimately what kept me moving forward was wanting to see the next gorgeously surreal landscape.I can't speak to the VR experience, but I would definitely replay this game in VR just to see the these scenes through (my own) eyes.I would recommend Mind to those who put graphics first.  If you're looking for a pretty game, you've found it.  The puzzles were fun and the story was a welcome addition, but to me this game is primarily a surreal art piece.			"

												Overall, I really enjoyed this game.  The puzzles are rather simple, but based on interesting mechanics - changing the weather, seeing the unseen, etc.  But beyond the gameplay, the soundtrack is beautiful at times, and the skies... oh my, the skies are breathtaking.  On the downside, the voice acting wasn't great and the story line was rather formulaic, but it's even possible to avoid all that.I may or may not come back to the game, but the experience of standing in the middle of shallowly flooded plain like an endless shore at low tide with a sweeping swirling pastel sky soaring overhead... that will stay with me for a while.  (It must be overwhelming in VR!)			"

												Mind: Path to Thalamus is a pretty game.  Sadly, that's about all it has going for it.In terms of puzzles and mechanics it has a nice array of ideas and tools, even given it's one-button gameplay.  However these are sometimes inconsistent and sometimes only used once.  It would be much nicer to see a definitive set of rules that the player could learn to exploit and understand.  Notably: The reflections don't always tell the truth and The night-orb is only ever used to light things up once to name just two.The game's story is also a little bit all over the place.  Its beginning and end seem like completely different games, and the game which caught my interest initially, with a strong opener and an amazing sequence a few levels in, turned out to flop by the end.  Oddly, the final level is one of the best, most interesting, and most thematic, but when you solve that level the game changes back to it's new style, which just isn't very good.The landscapes are very pretty, and the terrain and objects are well rendered.  The music goes along well with the piece and has a few great tracks.All in all, if you really want to see something great while you walk around it's an okay buy, but I feel you'd probably be better off buying something more coherent.

												+Puzzles are often pretty good and conveyance is good (i.e. they aren't just frusturated banging your head against a wall until it breaks)+Environments and (most) assets look really good, especially at night, where they get downright gorgeous+Music is quite good, if a bit forgettable+Since it's supposed to be set in the mind or something, parts of it are appropriately surreal+There's a boss fight (in a puzzle game, yeah) that's pretty intense and fun-Story is kind of silly and overdone, doesn't match the setting, and gets pretentious and shoves its head up its own♥♥♥♥♥at some points-Only one voice actor kind of kills immersion (There's some kind of self-referential line about this in the game, but I don't think that excuses it)-Gameplay is kind of inconsistent, at a certain point the mirror-deflection stuff just gets dropped for the main puzzle mechanics and never shows up again-Price is a smidge high, used to be a lot worse though (Also, why is it the ""Enhanced Edition""? I don't see any other version)I really wish Steam had a 'mixed' recommendation, since Thalamus has some pretty good puzzles and looks good, but it seems like a game made by an art team with one solid gameplay member. By that I mean the game looks damn good, the music is good, the puzzles are good, but the story is lame and forced and only one person stepped up to do the VA work (which was admittedly not terrible). I also have the suspicion that the devs worked on two different concepts for their puzzle system and rather than taking one and going with it or blending the two together, they just split the game up and gave each mechanic one part with just a jarring switch in the middle.5/10, buy it if you really want it, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone who isn't interested.

												[Edit] After the release of the ""Enhanded Edition"" (a monikor I do not agree with in this case) I felt the need to return to this game to see what all changed and I'm very not pleased. First off, there is seemingly only 2 new puzzles, both are astoundingly easy and primarily used to teach you how certain mechanics work (one of which never actually appeared to come up again). But the real disaster here is the completely altered ending sequence, with the original final level being removed. The part of the game that I really enjoyed. Now it's just a middle of the run, less than super interesting environmental puzzle game.[Original write-up]MIND is pretty short all things considered, and most of the puzzles along the way are pretty straight forward until the last 2 chapters, and has a few odd collision and geometry issues, but none of that matters. What matters is the interesting story of redemption of a man longing for forgiveness for letting his sister die in a disaster. Story is simply well done, and all comes together in a brilliant last 20 minutes when the entire game is turned on it's head and borders on breaking the fourth wall.In those last 20 minutes, I went from merely enjoying the game, to absolutely loving what MIND has done here.

												A truly amazing game with interesting story. Gets you confused on the start. The confusion goes up during the game. Only at the very end will you realize what's this game's story about. Truly unique as far as I'm concerned.STORY: 8/10This game is all about puzzles. Some were super easy, following the same pattern you might have discovered in the previous puzzzles. Then there were some which were quite challenging. So, overall a very fun experience. It's quite a shame there aren't some enemies who chase you or something. I'm not that much into walking simulators.GAMEPLAY: 8/10The graphics were absolutely marvelous! Not really high quality tetures like Witcher 3 or other AAA masterpieces, but it had it's own charm to it. Such a shame I couldn't play it on Ultra settings. A real eye candy really. Plus, it should support VR, so if you got one of those, be sure to try out this game! Beware - if you're playing this game at night, there are some super bright lights which gave made my eyes hurt.GRAPHICS: 9/10There were some bugs at the time I played this game. I.e. the ball I was carrying was continuosly falling from my ""hands"" due to lower FPS. It was very frustrating.OVERALL: 8/10P.S. This review was written shortly after I finished the game.

												This game scared me far more than it should have. I think that it has made me realize that I am scared of the dark. It's the ghosts. They are everywhere. They can get me when the light are on too, but the light serves as a false canvas of protectionf or me. The game is pretty. Then it rains. I run around wiht my balls as fast I can so I can throw them in the not rain circles. I just want to sit in the fields while it's sunny so I can pretend like I've traveled farther east than Mississippi or Chicago. The ending reminds me of a Silent Hill ending... you fight a stationary monster that shames you. I can take it. I'm ashamed of a lot of things and the world can just deal with my horrible self.  Ghosts are scary. Your mind and fears and guilt are not. You just have to deal with those. Your guilt can't make spooky noises and murder you when you turn the lights out. You can ignore your guilt, but you can't ignore ghosts. I think the game would get a 5 our of 5 if there were more ghosts. It gets a 4.7 out of 5 for the red balls. I love the game and want less rain and more ghosts in the  next one please			"

												This was a refreshing cerebral (pun intended) puzzler that, for this gamer, defies comparison. Imagine a game that has the atmosphere and surrealness of Myst combined with platform-puzzle elements that make use of logic and exploration, as well as manipulation of the elements. The narrative is the driving force behind the game but it never overshadows the gameplay itself, instead complementing it, moving the player forward as he unravels the mystery. And make no mistake, you will want to get to the bottom of it. The graphics are otherworldy and beautiful, immersing you in this inner world. I would highly recommend this game to any fan of puzzlers and to those who appreciate a narrative-focused game.			"

												Mind: Path to Thalamus is a first-person, exploratation, puzzle game that focuses on changing weather and time to shape the environment around you.  The story, not so much engrossing, is interesting to a point.  Voice acting was more or less average.  Soundtrack was serene and elegantly composed.  What made this little gem worth playing through was the scenery and overall atmosphere.  Excellently done on the graphics, simple but beautiful all the same.  Puzzles range from fairly obvious to moderately difficult depending on your experience.  My big peeve with the game is regarding one of the last levels.  I can't really explain it without spoiling anything, but you have to execute the puzzle a certain way or else you can't finish it.  I spent over an hour without making any progress because after I solved part of the puzzle, the level no longer let me change some of the weather.  It's also important to note that in this particular level, after having solved a portion of it, I could not reverse it.  I had to start over after watching a walkthrough.  Furthermore, this level from what I gathered was the ONLY one in the game where if you messed up, you had no choice but to start over.  I understand and appreciate it when puzzle games don't take you by the hand and help you every step of the way but with this case, it was incredibly frustrating not knowing a mistake you made in the puzzle was irreversible. 7/10			"

												+ Beautiful+ Original development of the story+ Music and sound effects perfectly fits the atmosphere+ Short enough not to be redundant or repetitive+ Great voice acting- Morbid death-centered background story- At first, hard to understand what affects the environment around you and how it works- Not to be played if you're already subject to depression, guilt and self-loathing			"

												Haven't completed this game yet, but I can say already that it's a must-have for every puzzle-FPS lover. An indie humble game made by a one-man team, I mean, don't expect a huge game with lots of innovative features. So far, the game showed me it was made with both, love and great care, It also challenges players to explore and figure out how to solve puzzles set in a stunning 3D environment.			"

												Very pretty and rather fun. Voice acting is annoying but bearable.For some reason the game is set to 62 FPS max. which created issues with screen tearing... only to fix it and have it happen again at 60 FPS... Not quite sure what happened there.If you can pick this game up cheaply then it is definetaly one worth playing.			"

												A simple journey into the center of the mind.  A screwed up and guilt wracked one, sure, but a mind.  Beutiful visuals, simple mechanics and a difficulty just hard enough to feel rewarding when you figure it out.  The narrator is just a bit annoying at time, but thankfully he doesn't talk much.			"

												I've got to be honest - I put off playing this game for a while due to some negative reviews on community boards, but I finally broke down and decided to buy it and give it a shot for myself... and I am actually REALLY glad that I did. The game is downright gorgeous. It runs well even on my Intel HD Graphics Card laptop. The puzzles are actually simple in design, but complex to solve at times, which is a great balance. While the mechanics themselves are simple, it's the order of the puzzles which provides the challenge - it requires you to actually use your brain! The story was pleasing, and I actually found myself emotionally effected at times, be it fear, sadness, awe, terror or joy. Few games can cycle a player through those emotions, and Path to Thalamus did a fantastic job. My only criticism of this entire game is a repeat of what others have said, that at times the voice acting can be a little ""dry"". It's not that it was terrible, but there were many times that I just didn't fell immersed by the narration. IE: It wasn't believable. That said, it was not a bother at all, and without the voice overs, the game would have been less, so I am actually glad that they were there. All in all, if you are looking for a challenging yet relaxing game, with beautiful visuals, great music, a pretty well though-out story, and a satisfying conclusion, this is probably something you will enjoy. Definitely recommended.			"

												PROS:- Surreal visuals. Kinda reminded me of Salvador Dali.- Calming music and sounds. Matched with the visuals, they create a relaxing atmosphere.- The puzzles aren't too difficult.CONS:- The levels with the colossus seem out of place. Like steak in your cake.- Handling the balls can be a bit frustrating sometimes.9/10			"

												This is very ""specific"" game. It is like [Story-Driven-But-Hidden] and [No-One-Explains-You-Anything]. Really, in the first level it took me a lot of time to understand what I have to do to proceed. I like the visuals a lot (though some parts are beautiful but some parts also ugly) but I don't like the voice acting.  Overall puzzles are easy to not-so-easy but not very challenging.Pros:- Beautiful visuals (mostly).- Good music.- Interesting journey through various landscapes.- Very good atmosphere.Cons:- Voice acting (That guy who voiced the narrator is hard to listen to - it is somewhat silent).- Stupid nad unintuitive movement in the menu - I'm used to press ESC when I want to return to menu one level up but in this game it just kill the game and you have to start it again (an that happens when you press ESC ANYTIME in menu).- It is not possible to change graphics or whatever when you are playing - you have to leave the game to the setting menu, change what you want and then start chapter again.

												Beautiful game. It returned me to the days of Myst.Pros:*GORGEOUS environments to get utterly drawn into.*Intriguing puzzles concepts*Amazing VR experience, one of the best VR games I've played.*Haunting music and sound facilitate moments of bliss, melancholy, and terror.Cons:*Voice acting and or script could use some work. *Some puzzles are pointless when in VR - you must actively decide to try them without teleporting to get the full effect.Bottom Line:If you have VR and you are not immediately turned off by having to use your brain to play a game, buy this.

												This game is pretty, but SLOW and BORING. There aren't enough story elements to keep my interest and the game has a smothering feeling of being extremely pretentious. After turning mirrors for what felt like an hour, I turned the game off.			"

												I really thought that a lot of this game was very well implemented with nice ways of finding out the solutions to the puzzles however I feel that the last puzzle was stupid because of the visuals that they ususally would use for puzzle elements were not shown for that element to indicate what area it covered therefore it was not a lack of thought but of design that made it abstract to finding how to do it thus I was very dissapointed in it (why do so many last levels in games have to downright suck)other then that last puzzle though I thought it was worth checking out			"

												Mind: Path to Thalamus is a puzzle game whose main mechanic involves neuron-like orbs being placed into circles which change the environment. For example, standing in or placing an orb in a rain-circle will raise all piers to a higher level and the time-circle will restore parts of the old ruins. With a limited amount of orbs, this makes for some quite tricky puzzling at the latter levels.The best part of Path to Thalamus is without a doubt the expansive, gorgeous vistas present in it's level design. Never have I felt such a sense of scale from a game. It's got beautifully realized infinite plains of sand covered in a shallow layer of water, grand hills stretching everywhere, a fascinating crystallized representation of neurons in a brain, magically floating islands and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing frozen tsunami. It feels like walking inside of a particularly expressive art installation. Mind's story is serviceable, but perhaps not it's strongest point. It's a shame they settled for only using one voice actor, because the emotional impact suffers a lot when the dead relative have the same voice as you, even if it has an in-universe explanation. The ending is interesting, and I can appreciate what they were going for, but the story as a whole is not one of Mind's strong points.In conclusion, if you enjoyed Dear Esther's visuals, but wished it was much more spectacular and involved a challenge, then I'd recommend Mind: Path to Thalamus to you.

												Frustrating and a bit broken. I'm sure I would love it if I could get past the annoyances... Here's how my ""0.2 hours"" went.Load it up, want to play fullscreen... no idea how to do that. I had to check the Steam forums to find you press Alt-Enter to go fullscreen, which is mentioned nowhere. A small issue, but one that has no reason to exist.Start, OK, looks good! Except, the controls are shown but only the movement controls are labelled in English, the rest are in some other language... Never mind, continue.Little while later, I decide I want to turn the subtitles on so I don't miss things. Took a while to figure out you have to HOLD Escape, not just press it. That's another little issue. The menu helpfully shows a preview of the subtitle text, except it displays in the wrong size until I fuss with it for a while. OK? I go to resume... but it doesn't resume, it puts me back at the start of the chapter I was in. Again, not the end of the world but all these little things are adding up.I get to some voiceover, and... the subtitle is broken. It doesn't show what the voice was saying, only the first line in a really broken way.At that point, I gave up.			"
