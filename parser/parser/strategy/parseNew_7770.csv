												Screw whatever anyone says about this game. Most people only hate this game cause they played 30 minutes and assumed that the game's never picking up, or just know it's a 3rd person shooter of a beloved strategy game, which means it'll automatically be bad. Enforcer is far from that.You haven't lived till you've gone mach 5 around a mall, launching grenades everywhere in a fountain of death, obliterating all in your path. There are countless weapons and powerups in this game to please you (do not unlock the freeze gun), and the upgrade system allows you to improve just what you want. This upgrade system is key to the game, as it's what turns a rather simple character into the super sonic, destructive Enforcer he should be. The main objective of about every level is ""Murder Every Alien"", and that's all you need really. Beautiful death and carnage for the sake of it.The levels are generally very open and allow for exploration, which will let you unlock bonus levels and get more points and more upgrades. But they never feel mandatory, so you're free to just kill to your heart's content. The game allows you to check at any time where the next enemy spawner is, so that you can go there to kill things without having to get lost, allowing the flow of the killing to proceed unhindered.The game does suffer from some flaws, as any will. If you take too long to go to an objective, your scientist ally will persistently annoy you to continue onwards. A few of the guns, such as the aforementioned freeze gun, will be useless and since the only way to get rid of a gun you're carrying is to use up your ammo or find a different one, it can create a problem at times. Beyond those, the rest are insignificant upon this beautiful creation. The game isn't really complex or as deep as its predecessors, but it doesn't have to be. The game succeeded in being a well-made, over the top, insane shooter, and it succeeds well.			"

												X-com Enforcer has a reputation of being bad. A bad shooter, a bad use of the X-com IP, and aging badly. However, for this review I will assume you've got it in the X-com Complete Pack rather than spending money on it (Please don't do that, it's not worth 5 Euro/Dollar/monopoly monies in my opinion)As such, I will actually recommend you play it, after all, you have it from the complete pack so the only thing you can lose out on is time.It has a lot of bad, and yes, the reputation is kind of deserved. After X-com Interceptor has you beating aliens in space, there really wasn't much else to do in the X-com story. So we're not really getting a story here.The story is: You're a robot. You wake up. Aliens are attacking. Go kill aliens. And...That's about it. There does seem to be an idea of a story in there but it's kinda hidden.Simple, but it works. It's slow to start, but you'll eventually unlock bigger guns, the ability to go faster than many projectiles and even more guns, and even more big guns. Did I mention you go fast and have guns? I think I did. Taken as a continuation of the X-com franchise, it fails. Hard. But if you take it as just an X-com based shooter you get as a bonus with the rest of the X-com pack it is less painful, and at times it becomes fun. After a while it becomes an amusing shooter where you slaughter entire hordes of aliens while flying from one end of the room to the other launching spinning disks with blades attached to them. There's the standard (For the time) hidden secrets to find, big levels in which you can explore a whole lot, and a lot of aliens to shoot at.It also takes a little from bullet hell games, as your bonus points(And I think maybe super speed too) resets when you get hit. You won't die from just one quick hit, but you will find yourself actually trying to dodge things so you can keep going fast. It doesn't make the game great. But being completely honest, I wouldn't say it's awful and bad either. Don't take it as a hardcore serious game, take it as a casual amusing shooter narrated by an amusing scientist who seems to enjoy watching his creation(You) wreck the alien invaders.It's not good, but I wouldn't call it bad either. And since it's in the X-com pack you may as well give it a go.At the least, play a few levels before you decide whether it sucks or not. It might surprise you			"

												First of all, X-COM: Enforcer has almost nothing to do with the X-COM series aside from reusing some enemy designs and backgrounds, and even that connection is tenuous at best. So forget all notions of turn-based strategy and base building and all that. This is a simple run and gun TPS.You run through loosely divided sections killing absolutely everything you come across -- in this case, enemies that spawn from generators. You only wield one weapon at a time and can pick up others as they spawn in the level (and they respawn after a while). Killing enemies makes them drop points (literally) which you gather and can trade in for upgrades to your weapons, health, speed etcetera. It's all kept as mindless as possible -- run around for too long without direction and you get a gentle reminder of where you're supposed to go, in the form of a big blue blinking arrow over your head, so that, in theory, even the biggest idiot can find his way around. Even so, I managed to get stuck at level 3, where you're supposed to go up somewhere but I could find no way of getting there -- the game has no mini-map or mouselook. Whether that says something about the game or me, I wouldn't care to say.It reminded me a little of Painkiller (there's even a weapon that shoots blades), except that Painkiller has more variety, better graphics and higher difficulty. This game is by no means a classic, but as far as mindless fun goes it does what it sets out to do. I'm giving it a vague ""not recommended"" based on just the half hour of play I had with it. I can't really recommend buying it on its own, but as long as you don't go in expecting strategy, it's an inoffensive addition to the X-COM Complete Pack.			"

												This game feels and plays like the original unreal tournament. Having alien as enemy doesn't means this is an X-Com Title.The game is old and somehow in default it doesn't run that good.The first tip i have for everyone is go to option. Turn screen resolution to highest with highest detail. Then this game will play and runs much smoother on higher Resolution then lower resolution.IT's actually a really fun fast pase run and gun FPS with a find and discover upgrade system.If expecting an X-Com game.. you will rate this game 1/10.If you just want some shoot up fun.. it's 7/10.

												Negatives_______- No vertical camera control- Weird camera angles throughout the game (Limited vision infront of you)- Have to change from 'Direct3D support' to 'Software rendering' to change to widescreen resolution, and then change back to 'Direct3D support' again to be able to play in widescreen with the Direct3D (Better textures, lighting etc...).- Automatically picks up weapons (which replaces your current weapon), can result in you getting replacing a superior weapon with an inferior one.-/+ Voice-acting, the professor is just awkward, but the enforcer is badass.Positives______+ Arcadey style action+ Lots of alien gibs+ Hidden secrets that unlock weapons and bonus levels+ Good variation of weapons+ Really fast paced action if you upgrade your speed to max (I recommend it) "

												This game is bad, it completely deviates from the turn based and strategy foundation that made ufo defense, terror from the deep, and apocalypse so good. All you do in this game is walk (or run so fast you cant see what you are doing) around these maps holding down the fire button as enemies and weapons spawn randomly all over the place. When you complete the mission it tallys the points and you upgrade your weapons and boosters etc. to become even more invincible than you already are. I dont really see any story line to it, its just collect as many points as possible and on to the next level. I bought an x-com 5 pack for like $3.27 on sale so i cant say that it was a waste of money beause it was less than $1 but i definitely wouldnt recommend this game. 2/10.			"

												Plays like kind of a more Gauntlet-y MDK2, or something (vaguely proto-Mass Effect, which I suppose would make sense since Bioware developed MDK2).  Looks and feels like chunky polygonal PC games circa late '90s and 2000, e.g. Deus Ex, Quake III, Unreal Tournament — and maybe a little bit Dreamcast-y, even...!  Instead of UT's bellowing HOLY SH!T, you've got a nasally lab geek cheering you on as you mow down aliens and gather upgrade points.  Mainly worth a look if you've got nostalgia for the era, and fun with a controller.			"

												Before the bureau was a thing,There was X-com Enforcer An arcade third person shooter and one of the few spin offs of the x-com series aside from interceptor(space sim) and Alliance (which wasn't good enough to be finished apparently). As far story goes it's pretty much the same as the original, but you play as a robot and must save the human race(taken from the most annoying scientist you'll listen to).  visuals were ok for 2001, at the time unreal engine 1 looked dated at the time. Music is pretty forgettable, actually I don't think there was music at all. Because throughout the game you only heard a bunch of obnoxious noises. Each level of the game is this kill aliens,destroy transporters, and rescue survivors......for 5 hours. it's pretty fun....untill you Realise how insanely boring and tiresome it is. not even over the top weapons can save how absolutely Teadious Enforcer is. there is a crapton of enemies making trying to be like a third person smash tv or something. there is also a pacman minigame for some reason and even that's boring. It's pretty short as I said before, But Really it felt more like 10 hours and I just Wanted it to end.  Bottom line X-com enforcer has to be the most boring shooter I've ever played. It's nothing broken but with how annoying and beyond teadious the game is, I just can't reccomend this game unless you're really curious. overall 4/10 Insanely Monotonous			"

-Quick Review-X-COM: Enforcer is a third person shooter developed by MicroProse and released in 2001. The controls can be a bit of a pain in the butt, the way you move the camera is changing the way you face, this game has a serious case of the early 2000's. It's still playable, but there are a lot of negatives about the game which will drive away most to far better games within the 3rd person shooter genre.

			My screenshots aren't working for some reason, so I'll upload them into the art section. This Screenshot is simply a screenshot where I atempted to capture some of the early combat.		


-Detailed breakdown review-Story/NarrativeOh if only I had a bit more time to finish this review, Enforcer, hello Enforcer? Can you hear me? You are trapped in my simulation and need to listen to my obnoxious voice repeat the same 4 lines of diologue throughout the whole game. Enforceeeerrr are you liiistening? Go that way Enforcer! Follow my transponder Enforcer, it's why I created it!There ya go, you can turn off dialogue and sound now, because I basically gave you almost all recorded voice dialogue. This is a game where I was actually praying for an option to put on subtitles so I could spare myself the agony of his annoying voice.You play as the Enforcer, basically an android-robot-thing which has been programmed for one purpose: the eradication and destruction of the alien threat. you will fight your way through the hordes of aliens, all of which are very familiar seeing as many have been seen in the previous X-COM games.GameplayControls:The camera stays at an almost always fixed angel behind the main character; you cannot tilt the camera up or down, but you can turn your character. so it works. However there are a few levels where the camera is at a stupid angle where you can't see anything in front of you.General movement was fairly straightforward, as with the previous x-com games I played them on my windows 7 laptop which has aged, but that means I played completely without a mouse, I rebinded the keys to let me strafe with Q and E, and turn with A and D. Pretty standard movement controls for most video games. The game would move most smoothly with a keyboard AND mouse though (but hey, I'm saying you can play this game with just a keyboard and a lower-end laptop!).The rest of the controls are inconsequential: you move, you shoot, you adjust depending on your gun, you grab data chips, upgrade your character after you complete the mission, it's not rocket science most of the stuff introduced in this game is very straight forward and explains itself.Progression:There are a couple ways to gauge your progression through the game, the first and least effective way is to judged it based on the levels themselves... That's not very effective, since I felt like they were all bleeding into eachother.Next you can kind of gauge how far you are into the game based on the Aliens you encounter (I keep fighting back a subconscious drive to call them ""demons"". Can you tell what I'm used to fighting?). This is fairly effective because you can kind of get a handle based on how far you are into the game once you start fighting bosses and regularly see larger and larger Aliens.


Another Boss much later into the game - Uploaded for Review 
Community Created Artwork for X-COM: Enforcer
By: Atratzu

			My screenshots aren't working for some reason, so I'll upload them into the art section. This Screenshot was taken from a boss fight much later in the game.		


Lastly and the most effective way is by seeing the various upgrades you unlock throughout the game. As you progress you will find special items, when these are collected and brought back to the nerd who is constantly repeating himself in your ear, you unlock new upgrades, weapons, and power ups. As you progress you will unlock more and more of these, and this helps you get a feel for how far you are into the game. (because the empty slots mean you haven't unlocked it yet)


Completed level score tally - Uploaded for Review

By: Atratzu

			My screenshots aren't working for some reason, so I'll upload them into the art section. This Screenshot was taken after finishing a level. You then use the score to purchase upgrades to make your Enforcer more powerful.		


Conclusion:Here's the real question Should I get the game or not?, that's very difficult to answer. If it's in your steam library you should definitively give it a shot! -- And don't give up after the first few levels. If you're considering purchasing the game I'd suggest getting getting an X-COM bundle deal.The game's reception is very mixed, and for good reason. The game isn't even close to what the original IP stands for (which is obviously, highly detailed strategy gaming) It's not a particularly good looking third person shooter, and who likes being shouted at every 5 minutes ""ENFORCER GO THAT WAY, ENFORCER GO MAKE ME A SANDWITCH"".But here's the funny thing... I really enjoyed playing this game. I don't really know what it was, but I think part of it is that I just wanted to play something different, and this game was just that; different. I played through and beat the whole game once, and after beating the game I could probably play through a second time and try to find all the secrets to unlock more weapons. (But I don't have time for that nonsense, there are more games to play and review!)As always, thank you for reading my review, and hopefully it has been some use to you. If you have any question or comments feel free to leave them below.			"

												The real appeal of Enforcer is it's awkward place in the X-COM setting. The game sometimes has some Serious Sam-style moments where the fun shines through as you're using speed boosts and jump jets to dart around the map, using the absurd weapons to gun down hordes of aliens. Unfortunately these moments aren't all that frequent. Some of the voice acting is entertaining in a fun-to-cringe-at way. Overall, you can skip this one unless you're an X-COM fanatic.			"

												I recommend this game BUT... if your looking for a xcom, squad, turn based, tactical, base building, research doing, equipment building game this is NOT the game for you and you will probably hate it. I bought it a few months ago and it was as all the old xcom game 1 game for 5$ or all 5 games for 15$ (3$ each). For 5$ there are probobly better steam games but for 3$ as a bundle how can I say no even if you only get a few hours of life out of it. The game suffers similar problems to The Bureau but more so. The Bureau as least has many of the classic parts of the game just the semi turn based part throws it off. Any how...Yes I recommend the game and its meta score maybe and over exageration of how good it is. If your looking for a quick, simple, ""shooter"", alien blasting and an awesome robot that takes devestates robots as well as a sectopod 1v1 any 1 of your soldiers this is the game for you. Take vengance for all those times in all xcom games where the alien dominate you becauase now your the one doing the dominating. The hardness setting do not make the game much harder. You 1 shot with your laser rifle which has unlimited ammo as your would with a mid tech rifle in any game most basic humanoids. The power ups and ammo based weapons some are lack luster and some are game breakingly awesome. As in getting tactical nukes that can have multiple shots or time stoping all enemies for 10 seconds. Your robot named Enforcer... can be upgraded which is the only tactical part of the game as in what to upgrade when. You can upgrade your speed, jumping, max ammo and hp. You also can upgrade a variety of buff items to enhance them and also your limited ammo weapons (which is everything except your basic attack). My favorite weapon and I recommend maxxing it out first is the Mass Driver. It combines decent firing speed and accuracy of a rifle with the minor splash, aoe and penetration of say a grenade launcher. 1st upgrades to your robot I suggest are improved jump and some speed. To be fair it as an ok attempt to make a ""shooter"" but when ever a game series that is well established changed game play like this it usually turns out people hate it. People want same but different not different but similar.Pros:Game is short, can win in a few hours once you have done it beforeLevels are short, about 5-15 minutes, good if you have short timeUpgrade self as say enemy withinAwesome statsNo hit locationsFairly mindless playingSemi hidden bonus money and bonus level items (1st play through found 90% of them and 2nd time them all)Bonus level (they are sort of mini games to earn more money after every level if you find the hidden bonus level item. Some are annoyin some earn tons of money. Most are fun enough and have a 60 second timer. Such as 1 is pack man with you in place of pack man and 1 is frogger like ect)No psionics! As in you are a robot so basicly immune in all games to it. In enemy unkown there are a few exceptions that can hit robots and the High ethereal do have some that can hit you. But not mindcontrol or panic! The enforcer to fight aliens is a great idea.High defence probably too much making it too easy vs standard aliens when you have 400 hp and they are doing less than 5 per shotSome replay valueSkins!Multiplayer (for the perpose that you can still play it with out an other player but start on any level for fun)Cons:Too easy most of the time except a few bosses which can be quit toughNo hit locationsFairly mindless playing, getting sort of repetative objectives for most levelsVery little story line besides intro, near ending and endingWay too many items spawn for you to use making it almost laughably easy most of the timeNot a strategy game as said above!

												X-Com: Enforcer is a game where you run around in an exosuit, looking at the ground a few feet in front of you, killing aliens and trying to dodge the hail of inferior weaponry spawned constantly around you. If you're unlucky enough to accidentally grab one, you have to stand there holding the trigger until you burn through your ammo to switch back to your default weapon, which is infinitely better than anything you can pick up or buy. Occasionally you pick up hookers who say ""Woohoo!"" and fist punch the air.			"

												Trademark abuse at it's very worst in that this game would have been much better received had it dropped the X-Com label. The game has barely anything to do with the X-Com franchise anyway.The fixed camera angle is a little annoying and you can't choose not to pick up a weapon if you run over it but the game is perfectly serviceable as a budget title. The game does get a little repetitive, though it does have the occasional special objective to spice things up a bit; but I didn't notice because I was having too much fun blowing up aliens!One blemish is the voice acting of the Professor. He's rather annoying and his voice does chime in when ever you're lost (Followed by an arrow which will tell you where you need to go), but ONLY if you get lost so only the most wangsty players will find it an issue.Pros; - Fun - Lots of aliens to shoot, lots of (unique) guns to shoot with - In game help doesn't completely lead the player by the nose - Bug free! (Something you don't see anymore)Cons; - Repetitive - Fixed camera can get annoying at times - Voice Acting is horrible - Quite possibly the ugliest game I've ever seen! - Why is it even called X-Com?My suggestion would be to get this with the X-Com: Complete Pack. Probably not really worth it on it's own.			"

												Considered by many to be the worst of the X-COM games (I don't think it's as bad as X-COM Interceptor!), I don't really consider it part of the series at all.  When you look at it on its own, I don't mind it as a fun FPS.  Heaps of different upgradeable weapons, with other upgradeable stats and pickups available, the difficulty can be ramped up to make it more challenging.

												A poor attempt at milking the XCOM brand for some extra money, this game is a bland third person shooter with few redeeming qualities. It is, however, included in the XCOM classic bundle, which is given away like a door prize with everything, so chances are it's in your library already.			"

												I'm giving a thumbs up to this as an old school blast fest, but sadly I will never finish it as the fixed view and POV gives me a migraine in under 30 minutes. As a big fan of the entire X-Com series I may be biased but this si a fun romp for time.			"

												Disregard the fact that this game is related to the X-com series, and remember that it only costs a few dollars!!With that it mind, this game is so much fun!  If you ever get tired of meticulous strategy and just want and endless romp, this is the game for you!!  Honestly a ton of fun!!(Also, disable dynamic lighting.  Otherwise your frame rate will drop to almost 0.)Definitely worth the dollar I paid for it.			"

												4/10The unreal engine have never had a game hide it's potensial as much as in this game. Locked vertical sighting with optional full surround sighting only belonging to the x-box console era and oblivion 3rd person shooting.Would work better as a top-down shooter. Reminds me of flash-games. Upgrade-system and bonus levels were fun.The only good reason to play this game is so that you can hear the funny voice actor playing the professor.			"

												It's kinda like Doom, though, maybe not as good, is near as good. But, For some reason, music in my itunes started playing, thru this game. was music bu the band AFIFrom their grunge days to their latest album. and while it freaked me out how it was playing. Gotta say, made playing this alot better. Turned the first level of a few enemies, into a fast paced game of don't die (even though it was still the same)Some decent music with this game, some kind of rock of your preference, and this games isn't to bad. I wouldn't say out right buy it, but if you have it, its not the worst.That being said, It this game even though old, is pretty much the same thing over and older.			"

They got to visit all kinds of historic sites, see beautiful scenery, eat awesome food, and relax like never before. And by golly, Sid had earned it.The day he comes back, he sees an email from his employees in his inbox. Curious, he opens it.""hi sid, wile u where gon we desided 2 com up wif this awsum x-com game n we think ull luv it n b soo pruod!!!1 noe need 2 thx us""Sid played it for 5 minutes.He's been an alcoholic shut-in ever since.(Until he made the epic XCOM reboot)			"

												Different from other X-Com games, so if you dont like it, still try the other ones. Although probably not worth the price when it came out, now that you can buy it on steam for less than 5 bucks or part of the entire package for 15 (actually as I right this there is a special for only 2$) it is definatly worth it.

Controls are tricky and confusing.Even though I gotten this game as a gift... sad to say I didn't like the game.Not only are the controls tricky, but so fricken sensitive to the touch! ARGH! NO! I don't want to dodge to the left off the cliff that I'm trying to use to get those damn bonus tokens!Update: Finished the game. FINALLY gets fun and challenging about 2-3 levels from the big boss. Still don't recommend it though.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.			"

												I have to start off by telling you not to buy this unless you got the X-COM: Complete Pack or if you really appreciate crappy games. Before The Bureau: XCOM Declassified was Enforcer, and...There just isn't any strategy involved at all. It's really quite mindless. Basically, all you do is listen to the annoying scientist guy who made you (the enforcer robot) while killing every alien, destroying every teleporter, and rescueing every civilian. That's literally what you do for the majority of levels. The gameplay is just so monotonous. You can unlock weapons and stuff, but there still isn't much variation. I don't remember hearing any music. It's just overall... a really crappy shooter. It's so bad, it might even seem good if it wasn't so monotonous. For $4.99 USD, it's not even worth it. There are better XCOM games to play (both new and old).			"

A completely different game from the other X-COM's, taking control of an Enforcer to shoot all aliens on your planet in a third-person view.Game starts like a sh*ttier Halo: Combat Evolved, and left with a nerdy scientist with the most annoying lisp voice.You main objective is to destory the certain amount of alien transporters in every stage, with new things added on-top later.You gain data points when you kill aliens with a wide variety of weapons, which you can use to upgrade your enforcer.It's pretty fun at first, but gets kind of tedious.4/10 "

												To date, one of the most boring and generic shooters I've ever played.Loyal fan of the XCOM franchise?  Want another high-quality TBS?  Maybe an interesting tactical spinoff involving flight simulation or RTS elements?  AH HAHAHAHHAA... no.  Get out.  That's right, screw you.  And you.  Screw all of you, and myself, SCREW EVERYTHING!Three enemies (some kamikaze droid, the sectoid, and what I'm guessing was supposed to be a chryssalid) are spammed at the same reactionless drone that does random crap like touching civilians to beam them up to the enterprise or killing the same transporters.  Yes, every map, every objective-- it's all the same.  Three weapons total that you can't switch in and out of but instead just get whatever you picked up last and roll with it, three enemies types constantly spammed at you, two possible objectives.  Zero variety whatsoever.Also, its graphics... I know it's an old game, but were they even trying?  The animations themselves are absolute garbage, everything in the world feels static and bolted down.  Unlike Half-Life, Unreal, or any other ""classic,"" the environments feel like nothing more than cardboard cutouts spread along a graph.Then we get the annoying announcer.  Judging from the repetitive gibbing of Sectoids I guessed this wasn't a kids game, but I was probably wrong.  The announcer is the same poorly acted scientist that makes sure to compliment you in a childish way every time you shoot your gun at a transporter that you were supposed to take down.I wish I could say ONE good thing about the game, on the fact alone that it has the X-COM name carelessly stapled onto it.  But no, that only makes me hate it more; this game KILLED X-Com to begin with, and it has NOTHING going for it.  It fails to be an RTS at all, it fails to lack ANY kind of cohesive thought, and worst of all, it can't even pull off its shooter mechanics competently.  It's a thoroughly lifeless MDK clone that deserves to be buried in a landfill and covered up.Final verdict: 3/10.  Generic, worthless, low-budget shooter 'game.'  I've seen better in free unity games.			"

A bug prevented me from getting any further and having used only one save slot I ended up quickly uninstalling the game.The limited exposure I had to this game though gave a strong indication that there's really no reason why this game was ever made. Got it in a larger package though so I never expected a darn thing of this particular title.			"

												I love old 3rd person shooters and the X-Com serie: my favourite game is Max Payne 2 and I enjoy the crap out of tps games. But this is one of the worst: in my opinion, I find this game boring, with an uninteresting story and not much challenge. I'm sorry, but that's what I think. I recommend more the new ""The Bureau: XCom Declassified"" than this one.SCORE: 42/100			"

												Few people remember that the unfortunate X-Com spin-off, The Bureau, wasn't the franchise's first FPS; that honor belonged to Enforcer. Released in 2001, Enforcer was an even more ungainly fit to the franchise, being little more than an action-shooter that owed almost no similarity to the earlier titles of the series. But ignoring its unfortunate connections with the earlier games, the game was surprisingly fun.Enforcer utilized the Unreal engine and - remembering this game is now 16 years old - quite good looking. It lacked any spectacular set-pieces -  featuring instead rather humdrum locations such as trailer parks and city streets - but provided a good amount of detail and variety. I particularly enjoyed the number of things - cars, propane tanks, signs, garbage cans, doors, windows - that I could blow up with my guns. Even more impressive was the sheer number of enemies available to kill. While most games of its day struggled with five or six enemies on-screen at once, Enforcer managed twenty to thirty at a time, and by the time I reached the end of a level I usually had slaughtered my way through four or five HUNDRED of the villains. In many ways, the game was more akin to modern ""horde shooters"" than the scripted adventures of its contemporaries. Similar to horde shooters, killing enemies earned you resources (""research points"") with which to upgrade weapons and abilities. While this encouraged ""grind"", I didn't mind that much; the weapons were suitably overpowered and a well-placed shotgun blast could take out five or six enemies at a time. (The AI wasn't too deadly on its own, but their numbers could quickly whittle down my health if I wasn't careful).The game's biggest flaw - aside from its XCom lineage - was that it was played in third-person, and it had lousy targeting and camera control. The latter was even more problematic when it came to the occasional jumping puzzle or navigating narrow ledges. It also was uneven in tone, never quite sure if it was an action-adventure, a horror game or a tongue-in-cheek poke at the whole UFO genre. Still, as a quick pick-me-up shooter it was enjoyable, if simplistic, fun. I can recommend it to anyone under the caveat you ignore its unfortunate connection the other games of the franchise and go into it with the understanding this is a cheap shoot-em-up focused more on racking up huge kill-counts than offering sophisticated gameplay or world-building.

												X-COM: Enforcer is the third person spin-off of the popular X-COM series. The game has you playing The ""Enforcer"" a robot made to face off against the aliens of the X-COM franchise.Now this game would be enjoyable it feels good if you change the controls and mouse sensitivity. However the game really starts to fail when you realise you can't change the camera angle. Instead of, like modern Third Person Shooters, changing the camera angle with your mouse, the game instead keeps it static. The camera is pointed down making it near impossible to hit enemies at an angle of elevation. This will probably be first noticed in the second level, set in a mountain range you're moving both up and down rocky terrain.Between levels you can upgrade and research or increase the power of weaponry (e.g. range of the flamethrower), upgrades  (e.g. extra damage) and improve yourself (e.g. ammo capacity). This, while not unique, does add in an X-COM vibe and add more to the game.Whilst I wouldn't recommend this game to the average person, or many X-COM fans, I feels it is quite harshly reviewed it isn't the worst game to have ever been created, for one thing it does feel quite good to be in the shoes of a non-incompetent X-COM operative. I found it enjoyable however it's flaws mean I will probably only ever play the game in short bursts, if I play it again.			"

												Enforcer is the game that X-COM fans love to hate. It breaks from tradition by being a 3rd-person shooter in an era where the game type was not popular and by changing up the way lots of the classic aliens are handled. For all the complaints about it though, it actually is a fairly fun game, if you approach it less as an X-Com styled game where tactics reign supreme, and treat it more like an arcade style run and gun game. In that respect, this is a highly entertaining game where you're granted a wide variety of weapons, upgrades, and equipment to slaughter hordes of aliens that oppose you. The nature of this game simply demands that you do not take it too seriously, which is admittedly out of place for an X-COM game. Given that you start off with a simple laser rifle and work your way up to nastier toys like rocket launchers, plasma cannons, and an entire turboprop fan grafted to your arm, you can imagine the kind of carnage you end up wading through to accomplish your missions.

Enforcer is a 3rd person shooter set in (3erd alien war?) earth the enemays take the desine and difuclty arc as the original X-Com. That was the good part but ... for a game that was made in 01 it lackes any of the wormth of the period. control is a issue no Z axis means going down hill means you will only shoot above enemy heads, that is ok you can soake the damage (on normal) turn around and mowedown the badguys you ran past. with plenty of health pick-ups (that is a thing) and sicence pionts erned threw kills and end of level performance screens. you can cary one wepon at a time but no big deal ""IF"" you run out of ammo for what ever you picked up you have a infinate ammo pistole in back up . why . borng combate every lvl has the same objectives play any thing else			"

												Shallow third-person arcade shooter - just run and gun. That said, it reminds me of years gone by in the city arcade tossing quarters into machines with friends and having a good time. Enforcer is really easy to pick up and play at any time because of its simplicity. Missions are short, which can be seen as a benefit due to the low time commitment required.It's a fairly nice game. I'd give it a 6/10 for its simple fun and not much else. I don't think I'd drop the five dollars on it alone as asked on Steam, though (I got it as a bonus in the 2K Humble Bundle).			"

												I've no interest in the X-COM series and haven't played any of the other titles. That said, ""X-COM: Enforcer"" has nothing to do with X-COM from what I read. So what is ""Enforcer""?Well, it's a very dumb old game with a story that can be summed up in one sentence, non-existent A.I., abysmal voice acting, horrendous cutscenes, and the most basic of gameplay where you run around as the titular Enforcer robot through a hefty number of poorly-designed, blocky and short levels and destroy aliens to save mankind. You are overpowered even as you start, and as you progress you gain even more upgrades and weapons and boosts and you become effectively invincible.The enemies are all the same with a different skin, and they will simply rush you in the straightest line possible and attack you. You can carry only one weapon at a time; after you run out of ammo you will default to your fairly weak basic weapon. But the weapons are teleported in front of you at a constant rate with an interval of about 5 seconds in between. So it can get annoying when you have the awesome Nuker and suddenly a lame Flamethrower replaces it because you couldn't help NOT picking it up since they spawned it inches from you. Well, whatever... each weapon will get the job done and will pile up your kill count pretty fast.Variety also doesn't exist in ""Enforcer"". Each mission is basically ""Kill all aliens"" with a few very minor deviations like, ""Save the humans... then kill all aliens!"" Despite it's utter stupidity, ""Enforcer"" carries about 7-8 hrs of pure brainless mayhem, where literally all you have to do is press and hold left mouse button to win.I like.			"

												I actually wasnt expecting this game to be a thing. I got a a lot of X-COM games in a humble bundle, and I never expected one of them to be a third-person shooter. And a fun one at that. The gameplay is simple, and that works in its favor like you wouldn't believe. All you have to do is run with WASD, shoot and turn with the mouse, and press space to jump. That is all, and it works beautifuly. The game consists of 38 missions, which have a few different styles of completion. It could get repetitive if not for the gameplay and some fun levels thrown in here and there. As far as weapons go, there are only as many as you collect and research, as all weapons and power-ups are collectable. So on to enemies. There are plenty of types of enemies, and when bosses start showing up as regualar enemies, you see just how far you've come. The story is the weakest point, as it is basically there to string together the levels. The voice acting is great, the game sounds pretty good, but there is a lack of soundtrack, though I suppose it is made up for due to the insane amount of shooting you will do. My only major gripe with the game is that since enemies just run towards you, it can force you into a corner, and with bigger enemies, that basically means death. My final score: 7/10It was a fun little journey that I think you should play, but thats it. I have no strong feelings toward replaying it like other games, but its still fun, for at least one time around, and with different skins and neat weapons, there is some more fun to be had.			"

												This game is dumbI'm talking turn-based-strategy-gone third-person-shooter dumb.Despite X-Com being in this game's title, it plays more like a 3D Doom clone than anything else. You sprint through levels shooting anything that moves while uncovering hidden rooms and power-ups. There's really not much depth to any mechanics outside of a simple upgrade system, but why should there need to be? This is a dumb shooter about killing aliens and absolutely nothing else.This is not an X-com game, but it's a fun game in it's own right, especially given its cheap price tag.I'll play this over The Bureau: Declassified any day of the week, but hey, that's just me			"

												You point and click. Not very hard. Ok if you just wanna destroy a bunch of aliens from 2001. Decent upgrade system. That's literallly the entire game. Wouldn't recommend you buy on its own, buy it as part of the xcom pack or something. Also wtf is this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥freeze gun. Don't unlock the freeze gun.			"

												Not really an X-Com game, it's only tangentially related, this game is a freakish frankenstien's monster of mashed together resources from cancelled X-com games of the era. They gave them to a few unrelated developers and said, make something we can sell out of this.I don't recommend you buy it as a stand alone, but if you bought the complete pack you might have some fun with this if you don't look at this as a serious X-Com sequel.What I recommend in this game is the shear sense of excess and abandon. This game is like the master levels in Doom II, except more so. At some point the level bosses become the regular enemies and they begin to fill up the smoldering remains of humanity in areas the size of the parking lot at disney world, and then they take more than one shoulder launched nuclear missile to kill. Don't get me wrong, critically speaking, there is no story to speak of, the mechanics are basic, options limited and the exploration is limited to trying to find glowing letters that spell out B-O-N-U-S in semi open levels, but this game is like Smash TV meets Contra meets Doom meets Chex Quest.When you're running 120 mph laps in a shopping mall with a helicopter blade strapped to your arm vertically, the aliens flying apart in front of you as if they've been thrown into a blender on the liquify setting, an effeminate lisping scientist is yelling something about ""BIG BONUSES"" in your ear and your robot avatar says ""Back off space freaks"" and you're only to the half point in the game you'll understand what I'm talking about.

												Such a disappointment.  It's so frustrating that this game's failure was pinned on the franchise, rather than you know, it just being a bad game.			"

												While the traditional X-COM games offered people amazing turn-based strategy games that were deep and incredibly tactical, Enforcer took the IP and made it into an action-shooter.It wasn't that good back then, and it's certainly not good now.If you have some great memories of this game, maybe you can try trudging through it again, but the vast majority of gamers are probably better off not playing this game today.3/10 ""Bad""			"

												Buy the complete pack in order to acquire this game.  This game has a special spot in my heart, otherwise I wouldn't be able to recommend it.   It's a generic FPS that's crisp and clean on the graphics front but just ...  image Serious Sam with 2000's graphics, X-Com enemies (loosely), and enough lispy scientist yelling in your ears to last you a life time.   If that's your bag, this game is for you.   Go Enforcer!!!  Seriously though I only recommend this game to people who buy the Complete Pack and like Serious Sam style FPS's AND X-Com.			"
