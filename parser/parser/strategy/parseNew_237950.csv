												Don't listen to Veggie, there is a tutorial. It teaches you the basics of moving in the tactical map... Which is... You know, pretty standard RTS fair, you know, Right-Click to move/attack.... Wait, that's it.As for the base part... Once again, dead simple to understand, perhaps if you've never ever played RTS's before you'd get confused, but it's not that hard at all. You put Researchers (Green Stat) into Labs and such, Technicans into Workshops and such, while using your Soldiers and Soldier + Tech/Research to fight.If you've ever played UFO/XCOM/XCOM:EU you're going to understand the entire thing from the get go. You set research, you set production, you then let time run. You then defend your territories (many of which hold resources, which, once again, is so simple, each node = 1 resource, so if you have 2 Metal Mines, you can build anything that requires 2 Metal Mines as many times as you want) and attack others. At which point you go into the combat mode. While it isn't turn based, you can pause the game to issue orders, similar to other games like Dragon Age: Origin. You then gather loot, which opens up more research options.Your NPC's all level up, Techs and Researches included. This is done by Soldiers via fighting battles, while for Tech + Researchers it is done by researching and producing/building. Every time a Soldier levels up, he gets a point to put into attributes, like Strength and Willpower (there are several) these stats in turn affect skills, like Aiming, Snap Shots, Manipulation, Charisma. Each attribute, when clicked, tells you want it improves and each skill tells you want it does. You also get Training Points to spend on various abilities, such as being able to Equip Heavy gear. As for non-combat NPC's, you can train them with Training Points too, these points go into things which help them speed up or improve various other things. Such as Research Speed or Production Speed.Hybrid's are interesting, such as Soldier + Researcher, as while they are not as dedicated as others, you often need Researchers/Techs to go with you on combat missions in order to get various things. Which of course give benifits. Not to mention, you're not only getting human NPC's, but Alien's too, which have their own Training Point abilities.The Conquest Map is pretty simple. You click areas to capture, then build stuff, which is all done automatically once ordered. If you get attacked, you're warned and a Red mark appears so you can click it and enter a fight to free it. If you expand far enough, you'll bounce into other races borders, at which point, you'll be able to invade their area and get their resources and such.Overall, it's a DIRT CHEAP game which has lots going for it. Combat is decent, lots to research and upgrade, specific NPC's talk and argue with each other over stuff to do. It's enjoyable for the price and I recommend it to anybody who likes XCOM:EU/XCOM/UFO series, or perhaps Xenonauts. For £5.50, it isn't bad at all.I also believe there were two prequels to this, UFO: Aftermath and UFO: Aftershock, both set in the same universe at different points in time.Aftermath is fighting the AliensAftershock is the rebellionAfterlight is truce and leaving for MarsI think. Can't remeber this late.			"

												I've never played any previous XCOM or UFO game before XCOM: Enemy Unknown / Enemy Within which I DO love! But compared to this one, the latest XCOM is a little bit more board-game like and Afterlight is a little bit more complex without overstrain the gamer.You'll like this game, if:- you liked the most recent XCOM but looking for a more complex XCOM/UFO game- you like strategy games generally- you like squad-based strategy games with RPGs elements such as Jagged Alliance, Fallout TacticsYou'll probably don't like this (so I was told), if you're looking for an first hour XCOM successor or can't overlook the outdated graphics.Let's get more detailed:Afterlight is ""more"" real time like XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Let's say there is an enemy attack on one of your territories you have e.g. 3 days to react. In the mean time you can keep on training or squad (which takes time actually), keep on with the production and so on if you need to do so. The opportunity of the attack doesn't vanish if you ignore it just to do one day more of research or you need additional time for producing a item (that is instantly ready in XCOM: Enemy Unknown).Also your scientists and technicians you take on a mission (which is quite a good idea because of some bonuses) are not available at your base and since getting to an attack spot needs a bit time it is important to manage well your base, squads and as well as the equipment.In combat it reminds me a lot to Jagged Alliance. You just can't spray and pray on an enemy if one of your squadees is in line of sight because the travel distance is actually calculated instead of simple numbers on hitting a target or not hitting like in the latest XCOM. The odds are showed to you so you know what are the chances of hitting own soldiers, in such case, or the enemy.The combat system is very transparent and is comparable to Jagged Alliance Back in Action (pausable real time with each individual plan for any squad member). I don't want to bad mouth the newest XCOM. I still love it and it features much better graphics, innately better customization possibilities for your soldiers and it is more user friendly (interface, micro- & macromanagement) and feels just ""more modern"".This games got me hooked right from the beginning that many games aren't able to nowadays so you probably should get it.

												Here's a simple bullet point list on the pros and cons about the game:Pros:+ Great Soundtrack+ Unique, timeless artstyle+ Very versatile engine, runs like butter even on the ♥♥♥♥♥iest machines+ Hard as ♥♥♥♥, encourages use of actual strategies to outmaneuver the enemy+ Unforgiving as♥♥♥♥♥♥ one guy dies, you'll never get him back and you can't hire new personnel, makes you value your               resources even more+ Good variaton of maps featuring three dimensional combat+ Research is actually a sophisticated procedure+ Terraforming has global effects on the entire playthrough+ Great variation of gamemodes, including base infiltration and target assassination+ Multiple, personalizied factions, bringing great variation and competition, even letting you trade and negotiate peace with aliens+ Great array of equipment which can also be customized and upgraded+ Can have aliens/beastmen/drones/martians as your own soldiers, each with unique abilites+ Extremely well made geoscape, let's you construct things like mining facilites, terraforming sites, etc...+ Laputians are bro-tier+ One of the most realistic simulations of terraforming and humanities last stand I've ever experienced+ Usage of mods further improves experience+ Base management is very complex and in-depthCons- Animations are pretty rough- Voice acting varies in quality- Camera in combat mode can be a pain (fixable with mods)- Certain enemies seem to have ridiculously good aim- Beastmen hate you, even though you're helping their assesIf you come along some reviews that aren't recommending this game for completely nonsensical reasons (with like 0.3h playtime), ignore that garbage. They're just some casual kids that don't know how to play a genuinely good game. This review right here is the way to go, coming from a true XCOM and UFO fan, telling you that this game is the real deal. One of my favorite games of all time.			"

												I've played both XCOM:EU/EW And UFO:AL for a significant ammount of time now, but I like Afterlight better overall.The depth of the game easily rivals if not outright defeats XCOM. The weapons can be modified with various attachments and ammunitions, and there are dozens of weapons, most of which are still useful by mid-lategame. Equipment loadouts range from weapons to inventory including spare magazines and more weapons or tools. It also does not burden you with pre-selected classes and equipment restrictions [Which cost me quite a few XCOM:EW playthrough attempts] since all your crew are capable of the same training and skills [Though alien teamates have different training from humans], which are also more indepth than XCOM. You can train military personell to run faster, damage specific species better, use heavy weapons/suits, or handle weapons faster to name a few categories.In XCOM's strategic play, you have to manage your money, alien resources, and research projects while scanning for alien ships. In Afterlight, you also have to attack and seize territory, and decide who to be friends with. Will you create lasting friendships or do eye their territories, looking for more land and resources?The game also has lasting consequences and effects. Team members aren't generic soldiers who happen to be a notch above the rest of millions. You've got a colony and a couple-dozen people to staff it, and those who die are gone, they aren't cloned or replaced, just dead. On that topic, terraforming [Because thats an obvious goal, right?] has visible overtime effects that ever-slowly escalate visibly on both tactical and strategic play. As terraforming carrys on over the days, you'll see the world turn green with blue slowly, and tactical maps will gain plants and grass graphics too. On top of that, more overgrown areas tend to have lower environmental hostility ratings for tactical battles.The biggest upside it has, Afterlight's action is real-time with pausing and planning rather than XCOM's turn-based action. Running head-on into previously undetected enemies or missing a shot is no longer a death sentance for your troops, though avoiding the former is still advised. Realtime action and positioning all play a role, where a sniper lying prone on a cliffside can spot enemies and clear them out quickly, and cover is less important and less of an invasive mechanic [though when you get the chance, use it]. Stealth is also an option, with smaller suits, stealthy movement training and silencers all present and accounted for. In a rescue mission, I snuck into the camp, and extracted my target without having to kill more than 2 or 3 enemies patrolling that area.Although Afterlight is in many respects more realistic than XCOM, it still has downsides. The graphics aren't up-to-date and the dialogue switches tones and word-accents [You'll see what I mean if you watch videos with story dialogue.] The most invasive bugs such as the ""Green Grid Error"" as I call it where most of the map in tactical battles covered with green grid squares. [There is no explanation at all for these grids. Could they have something to do with graphical errors related to terraforming? I think it's an unknown error with my settings but who knows?]			"

												this is a highly innovative but low quality member of the X-COM family of games. It has pausable real-time combat like X-COM: Apocalypse. You aren't able to recruit new team members so you basically have to do a mission restart if one of your guys gets killed (although you can have robots on your team and build more robots). Difficulty spikes a couple of times as game throws larger numbers of increasingly powerful enemies at you, but they basically just rush you with no special tactics or real coordination between enemies. The game also generates TONS of tactical missions, there are about 100 regions on Mars with missions to capture every one, enemies counter attack generating defense missions, and the tac missions are fairly repetitive with you taking the same squad/equipment on a dozen or more missions between upgrades. The game does a poor job of keeping you updated as to where you are and what you are doing and the tactical camera went nuts on me a couple of times in the Martian underground. Also the game sometimes hangs for 1-2 minutes while pathfinding in the tactical game.			"

												Best of UFO series, possibly even best from all UFO\X-COM series.Very interesting story line, alive characters with history, that you can actually read. Nice overall gameplay, even bad scripted camera cant spoil the game. Without spoilering I can say, that you wont regret a minute spent in this game. Its a jewel, that must be in your collection, and jewel, that must be played till the end at least once.

I have played it multiple times, also outside steam, and have never encountered any problems.There is plenty of research, items, skills and weapons upgrades available. There are no nameless engineers/scientists presented as a count, but every member of your staff has its own skills so you have to manage them carefully - one may be good at researching certain technologies, the other at constructing outposts.The game is really good.

A worthy successor of the XCOM series. Most of the negative reviews are due to the different gameplay style, but when you get past that you get a very, very intriguing offspring of the XCOM series.

												This game is an interesting one to say the least. I thought it was a XCOM : Enemy Unknown knockoff but I got something different, and different was good to me this time.This game I would consider real-time, however it has it's moments of turning into a turn based game. The difference here there is no set square you have to go on, and you are in control of when time stops. Being in control of time at first was annoying, as I didn't know why the game kept pausing on me. When I figured it out I found it brilliant : the game pauses after you have moved one of your players/gunners into position. Why is this neat? Well this ensures you have COMPLETE CONTROL over tactical positioning - literally ensuring that you know what enemies are in site or when someone is in position. The neat thing about this game is that you can tell your gunners exactly where to proceed. This is phenomenal when you want your gunners to stay and move near cover instead of cutting through the middle of the map (which easily ends up being spotted, getting shot at just for trying to get to cover). That was just the battle portion of the game, there is a strategy portion to it. They tried to nail every single detail they could and it seems they have. When you move your players and try to shoot at an enemy, it shows the chance % you have of hitting the target. You have a limited amount of gunners/civilians you can use and assign them to different positions (research, resources, military etc...). You are bound to a planet in which you may take certain territories which contain certain resources. From this tactical perspective you can build or add modules to your main colony building, allocate resources, choose what to research, modify and customize your assault teams, attempt to take a new territory, or send your military units off in your UFO spaceship to go deal with conflict (be it controlling new territory or defending a sector you have. One mission consists of defending your water supply line for example. Upon finishing missions, you are able to take back spoiled goods. Careful though, you cannot over cumber the UFO as it can become too heavy to fly. Keep your fuel levels in check as well or don't expect to get to the fight! For future UFO Afterlight Developments : having a few varying maps would be nice. It was sort of refreshing to see the glacier tile on one of the maps, but generally looking at orange got a bit boring. I know we are on a big red planet but don't be afraid to add something! More importantly, I hope that some sort of ""reaction"" button is added. Watch sort of works but doesn't trigger the characters to fire on site. What would be even cooler would be adding a FPS camera in which you could control a unit. The game is extremely efficient in it's planning steps that I could see potential for FPS to run smoothly. This game is bigger than I anticipated when I first bought it and am still exploring what it has to offer. So far of what I see I like as I've never played something like this before. For that reason it gets a .1 addition to it's score from a 7.9. If it had a multiplayer feature, the rating would have increased again.RATING : 8.0/10.Gameplay B Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability B- Overall  B-Generally staying at a higher ground gives you an advantageOne thing you need to be aware of is friendly fire. This drove me nuts at times. Placement of units is extremely importantThis screen shows the people at your disposal and what their availability is regarding each stationSome action up closeYou can set up paths in sequential actionsWhat building your base up looks likeThe globe and territory viewEven though the terrain is sort of bland as it is Mars, they have added a few gimmicks into the game such as underground basesThe camera was brilliantly done. You can manoeuvre it wherever you'd like and very close to the characters You'll be surprised seeing a few unique characters throughout the game "

Posted: November 21, 2014
												This game has a pretty sweet overall concept. The core gameplay is future combat RTS with a pause button. A bit like Knights of the Old Republic, which, in my opinion was good because of this dynamic, just as MassEffect2 was unmade by loss of it. IT has a lot going for it but ultimately I would recommend it only as a steam sale curiosity. PROS:The gameplay mechanic is the strongest aspect of the game. It lacks a little polish but I love the idea, and I think it has tremendous potential. A compelling concept, with an albeit slightly rough around the edges, but unique and distinctly old-school art style that more than makes up with freshness wht it lacks in polish. A likeable cast of characters  that gives you that Sci-Fi novel feeling. CONS:Unfortunately, while the art and core gameplay are very good, the metagame in most of its aspects lacks the element of strategy, and becomes a tedious afterthought. The technological and base-building progression that is such a satisfying and powerful drive in games like X-COM: Enemy Unknown, has been designed and balanced haphazardly. The important aspect that makes it strategic and good is that you should understand what your goals are, and what paths lead to them, so that the choice you have to make are meaningful. UFO: Afterlight has a pretty byzantine management game which just kind of drags on and you have no idea how well or poorly you are doing nor are you given any clear objectives. You research stuff, make stuff and aside from guns and medpacks you have no idea what you should be doing. Also after a little while you encounter enemies that are completely unbalanced , which kind of destroys the inmersion as you run around for an hour kiting a single enemy with your whole team, after every other type alien had been killed long ago ibn a more or less fitting tactical fashion.  I'M LOOKING AT YOU, GAME ""DESIGNERS"". In short, like I said, Steam Sale Curiosity			"

Unfortunately, the addictiveness of the game is much more powerful than all of the drawbacks combined, hence 84 hours of gameplay (got them on the old version, released before Bohemia, so they don't show up here).

												the graphics are dated but somewhat ageless.intuitive resource management (mainly assigning peeps to different tasks) works great.unless you set up your camera options it has a very annoying habit of bouncing everytime something happens, recommended to disable autopause and center on all after first 10 missions or so.you can set priority on what your terraforming vehicles do their missions on, but good luck finding the tiny thing on the map with no way to jump to it. also everytime something happens, there is a button to ""go to event"" but you cannot click it, it only shows up during the speech, and disappears afterwards, and you cannot click anything during the speech. so expect to look at the map of mars for a while trying to find stuff, clicking all areas to see if anything is missing etc.newer graphics cards tend to freeze often (3-5 times / mission specially towards the end) quicksave and quickload fixes this tho.and the worst part, savescummin. towards the end the difficulty ramps up.  your dudes die way too easy considering there are 6 reinforcements overall during the entire game. a full group armed with miniguns and best armor ingame can still lose a dude or 2 to one matriarch who dodges almost everything at close range and hits everytime. or alchemists who attack with grenades from range before anyone can see them, more or less. savescum again untill you learn where they come from.the battles towards the end you pretty much have to micromanage and pause for strategy every 3 seconds or so or your guys will die.  after a while expect to savescum after almost every kill and still start over a battle every now an again (thank goodness for autosave) this on normal difficulty.i will probably finnish this eventually but it is already leaving a really bad aftertaste.

												UFO: Afterlight is like XCOM. You manage a base, researchers, engineers, and soldiers, along with the various constructions you can make in the base, and send out squads of soldiers/drones/aliens to deal with attacks, or attack different factions, waging war and taking their territory. You can acquire territory much like Galactic Civilization II, and can build structures to utilize it's resources, and provide utilities. As for the ground, it's semi turn based, or exactly like Knights of the Old Republic, Baldur's Gate II, Dragon Age 1, etc.You don't really have 'money' in the traditional sense. The various territories have Mines, which produce resources like Metal, Fuel, Chemicals, Crystal, Noble Metals, etc.. When you build a 'gatherer' on one, you gain one of the resource. So if I have 2 Metal Mines, I can make all buildings, equipment, weapons, and armor that require 2 or less metal as much as I want without limit, so long as I still have the requirement.All your people/aliens can be trained in their fields, some specializing in 2 fields. The fields are Soldier, Scientist, and Technician. The gain experience by doing things in that field, so fighting for Soldiers, making items for Technicians, and Researching for Scientists. You can train them to produce/research different categories faster, or make the more accurate or quicker with a weapon, train them to use armor better and use heavier weapons and armor. Of course, they can't be used while they're training, but that should be obvious. If you start training with a soldier in Alpha squad, and then send that Squad out to a mission, that Soldier will temporarily stop training and do the mission, and then continue training when they get back to base, so no need to worry about managing them THAT much.As for the tutorial, it covers ground combat(Tactical Mode as it's called in-game) very well, but the map/base screen(Strategic Mode) is not covered very well. It goes into many Strategic Mode aspects to a degree, but some aspects it doesn't cover enough, such as managing base construction, and the people who build mines and capture territory. Those aspects have their members assigned from the start, but it doesn't tell new players that, and if you accidentally move someone who was needed there, you can mess up some features, and since it doesn't tell you about those, you'll have to click around until you figure it out.For reference, the people who build mines, excavation sites, radars, etc. on the territories work in the Technical Bay, and the people who build Geosode(capture territory) work in the Scientific Bay. So make sure there's at least 1 Technician in the Technical Bay and at least 1 Scientist in the Scietific Bay. Also, when you start building things in your base, make sure there's at least 1 Technician in the Civil Engineering building. You can do all this in the ""People"" Tab of the Strategic Mode view.You can conduct Diplomacy with the various factions in the game, like waging war or signing peace treaties, and trading and requesting resources, though it's nowhere near as in-depth as the Civilization games.Overall, it's a great ""XCOM-like"", and if you like Xcom, you'll love UFO: Afterlight.

												Played through this game 3+ times (1 vanilla, rest with total re-balance mods). Fun every time. Limited ammo that you have to manufacture or scrounge, limited man-power, sneaking enemies, and hazardous environments gives this game the best survival feel in the genre.			"

												If X:COM Enemy Unknown/Within can be considered the spiritual successor to the X:COM franchise.... this game is pretty much the direct sequal to X:COM Apocalypse. It feels more of a direct decendent rather than a modern reinterpretation. Maybe that's just me, maybe that's meaningless verbage, but it was my impression. The only negative mark I would put on the game is the voice acting for the H.R. manager. Barring that tiny gripe, this game is WELL worth your money if you are a fan of the genre.			"

												If you need an X-Com fix bad, this will do the trick.  It has lots of polish issues (minor bugs, unclear info, pacing issues, sudden ending, clunky interface in places, camera glitches, AI inconsistent, etc., etc.) - BUT the combat,  character development and micromanagement chores are just right level of complexity.

												Twice I played the demo for this game and twice I hated it, but I broke down and bought it on sale because I love these types of games.  Take your time to get used to the controls and you'll never regret it.  There is so much research my head is swimming.  You can control sections (many) of Mars and actually get them back if they are taken away from you.  Unlike other games...			"

												i played this EONs ago and I'm so happy i picked it up again. I missed playing a game that opens with a sucker punch, hits below the belt then proceeds to kick you while your down. its old, but massively fun. I am enjoying this much more than the newest xcom and all of its updates etc. but thats my opinion.hope to see something like this or Emperor of the Fading Suns in the future... but doubt any company will take a chance like that even though there are rabid fans waiting for it.so if your thinking about it, check this game out on youtube. that will let you know if you would like it. enjoy.

												Great game for those loving strategy, resource management, and tactics.It is a slow, strategic unit-based game when on the battlefield, and you have infinite time to come up with your optimal strategy to destroy your enemies. You are never stressed because of lack of time to think.When on the world map, you get to decide which trainings to assign to your soldiers, scientists, and technicians and where to allocate them to be most effective. You perform research, make weapons, etc. There is not a whole lot of buildings to be made, unlike alot of strategy games, and they only perform specific functions.The game is slow at the start, but it picks up the pace after the Inter-galactic gate opens (don't quit playing until this point, because that is when it gets good).The map variety is somewhat lacking on the generic maps, but there is more variety once you get into the different races and their specific maps and structures.Same thing with units. You will only see 2 different types of enemies until the galactic gate opens, at which point 3 or 4 more types will be available.There is also a cool RPG element to it, in that each of your soldiers/scientists/technicains levels up every once in a while, and you get to distribute Attribute points to help them perform better. Sadly, you cannot create your own character, although that would be cool to see in a DLC or future expansion.Weapons come in good variety. There are melee weapons, old firearms from Old Earth, new firearms that can be researched, scientific lasers used by scientists, and then alien weapons of many different kinds.Although gameplay is somewhat linear near the beginning, as you go on your research and production decisions will have more impact on how you are able to deal with certain challenges and such.Generally a good and challenging game. Very rewarding feeling when you complete each mission. (especially if you've lost a soldier before :P)Also, bit of advice: Your UFO can carry 7 people maximum. CRAM AS MANY PEOPLE IN THERE AS YOU CAN. If you don't, then it can be easy to be overwhelmed by enemies, and then everything gets messy.			"

												I played UFO: Afterlight in the time between the announcement of and release of XCOM Enemey Unknown. When I first purchased it, I treated it almost like a surrogate. But as I played it, and even more now after having played the new XCOM, I really feel that UFO: Afterlight has some points that distinguish it and make it a good game in its own right. That said, it's not a perfect game. The interface is annoying, and the pausable real time combat can be frustrating at times. I hate loosing an important character to an interface misclick, a pathing issue, not being able to navigate levels effectively, or not being able to react to enemy fire in time. But, when the chips are down, Afterlight was the most memorable of all the X-com-ish games that I have played. Why? Character. When you start the game, your roster of characters isn't randomly generated like in XCOM. Instead, you have the handful of members of a mars colony on the edge of survival. Characters have family relations, friendships, and history. Loosing a character on the battlefield means so much more when you know that that characters brother was right beside her, or that her mother is waiting back at base. The stories that unfold as you train your characters and send them on missions has much more impact when you see them as real poeple. The focus on characters extends to base management as well. Base management is an important part of the game, and much more developed than in Xcom: EU/EW. But in order to construct buildings, explore new territories, or do research, you need characters. Need to send a character with engineering skill to repair a pipeline? Do you send your best engineer, or do you hold him in reserve because he has combat skills? Do you reserve your quickest rover pilots for ferrying combat missions or explorations? That sort of thing. And while there are ways of getting new characters as the game progresses, this system means that losing a combat medic in the field may have drastic side effects for your research efforts at home. Technological development also feels more substantial in comparisons. Weapons have attachments, and there are many varieties of space suit that you can equip your people with. Space suits effect movement and stances, meaning that people in large, heavily armored suits may not be able to run or go prone, and people in light suits will be faster and stealthier. Overall, combat is the area that I think the game is the weakest (besides the voice acting. Its not the worst in the world, but it can be annoying at times). It is real time pausable, which sort of works, but because characters have very little in the way of AI, it means that inattention can be very fatal. There is a good enough variety of enemy types, equipment options, skills and maps to keep me interested throughout most of the game, but by the end I was starting to feel that it was a bit repetitive. Worse, sometimes failure feels cheap and frustrating, especially when you grow attached to characters. To conclude, I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for something like XCOM: EU/EW but with a little more depth and character. As I said earlier, its not a great game, but it was memorable and fun. And at less than 10 dollars for a full games worth of playing time, its worth a try. "

												This game is quite nice. It definitely looks too much anime, but plays nice.You comand a human colony on Mars and have to face of few types of enemies each coming with various ranks and gear.As most XCOM/UFO it is divided to base comand and tactical comand.On base comand you manage people and what they are doing (healing, training, building, researching etc). You have few resources to manage.On tactical level you take team to action in real-time with pause combat. Combat is quite detailed. Your troops have some limited space for gear depending from armors you have, you have few weapon types (heavy, assault rifles, sniper rifles, shortguns, etc). You can also build and operate drones which can mount an impresive amount of weapons (like up to 4 miniguns / rocket launchers) or be very tanky with like 80/90% resistance to all kinds of damage.Tactical combat is nice up to the point when you start running into Beastmen Matriarchs as they have like 90% of dodge of everything coming their way while packing masive guns themselves.While training your squad you will create some classes of troops (some will learn to use heavy guns, some sniping and some will learns to use explosives and repair/healing stuff).This game is 5 years older than XCOM, so there is no cover, but your troops can hide behind terrain to ambush enemies (or be ambushed), they can change stance to kneel or lie down to increase accurancy and reduce chance to be hit.I can recommend to all waiting for XCOM2 to to get on some discount or a bit more bug-free.

												It's decent.  To issue orders you stop time repeatedly and address all soldiers at once.  I prefer providing individual unit orders in turns rather than the ""stop time and give everyone orders"" strategy.   The game can drag on so I find myself making decisions based on how long it takes to give out orders rather than what is tactically smart.Initially the tech tree was incredibly confusing.   I had to research and find detailed descriptions for how to produce sniper rifles and shotguns.   In-game you have no idea what you need to be able to research something new.   (Which might be realistic)  There is very little activity on forums or walkthroughs.  The most annoying part of the game was that when I finished a technology the game doesn't tell you what you researched or how it would help you.  I couldn't remember what I was researching so I wasn't sure if I needed to reequip or build something new.After 35 hours of playtime I got to the point where the missions were getting harder but the remainder of the tech tree wasn't going to help me.

												If you're looking for a decent Xcom-esque game, then Afterlight certainly fits the bill. Although the innovations are outweighed by a number of annoyances this just means that it's not as good as one of the most beloved strategy series, no real shame in that. It is the third in the UFO series after Aftershock and Aftermath and focuses on a human colony on Mars attempting to fend off alien encroachments. So lets see how it stacks up in various categories important to squad based tactics.Squad Personality: B. While it lacks the customization of Xcom (if you loved this, change the rating to a D), I found the hardcoded team had enough personality to carry me through. Uta (aka BattleGranny) was a highlight but the others were distinct enough without being (for the most part) grating. This is furthered by some people having dual roles, so your scientist/soldier could be medic and your engineer/soldier could be driver/bomb disposal. Nowhere near Jagged Alliance goodness of course and unfortunately voice acting in the base was at times painful and repetitive. Sadly, the aliens you can get onto your team have limited usefulness due to their slow speed so a bit of potential variety is lost there.Tactical Combat: D+ The lack of squad AI (other than average pathfinding) really hurts here. The game is crying out for opportunity fire, without it you need to pause every few seconds to change targets. This becomes less of an issue as the game goes on, but other problems emerge. Due to factors I'll get into later, combat is quite repetitive and there are annoying quirks with having multiple stances (eg. kneeling/ standing) in the one selection. There are fun moments and the first few times of charging in is great but it all becomes one toned once you reach the mid game, other than hazardous expeditions where you need robots. Even though my squad in Apocolypse and Terror From the Deep all ended up with the same weapons, at least you had useful psych attacks and plenty of variety before the endgame.Research: C Similar sort of fare to any other game of this ilk, you bring in your war trophies and the eggheads find exciting new ways to splat the enemy. There's a bit of text detailing your results (as long as you go to look) which is well written and interesting and there are a good variety of research paths, it's only towards the end that you'll run out of techs. It is baffling however that there are no pictures. It sounds shallow as I type this, but I loved seeing the aliens/ weapons up close on the research screen. If you don't care about that, by all means bump the score up to a B but for me that was the biggest letdown of the game. I mean the previous UFO's did a great job on this, would've it been so hard here?Sense of Progression:C+ I was going to rate this as a D, but that would be ignoring the fact that your soldiers (and basebodies) go from wimps to superheroes stat-wise during the game and there is an marked difference in performance. The perk system is well implemented and the lack of any cap means your people improve right to the end. My disappointment stems from the trouble that, after midgame, your weaponry can stay the same, with the exception of the heavy stuff. The katana is ridiculously good and dual wielding pistols or a shotgun also rip through enemies and other than some addons these are not upgraded at all. So rather than stuffing around with snipers or midrange weapons (the latter of which do improve but not enough) you're best off charging in and killing them before they can fire. As I said, great fun the first few times but gets old. On the less visceral side of things, terraformation is very cool and has a noticable impact.Enemies: C The idea of having four different races split into various teams all competing with you and each other for Mars is great and the diplomacy, while shallow, is at least a distinctive feature from the X games (kind of, Apocolypse did something similar but differently). The reason for the average rating is the variety within those races. For some reason, the Robots- resident pushovers of the Red Planet- seem to have a lot whereas the more interesting ones have only 1 type, oh, and a harmless pet. At least the red faction (who I spent 80% of the time fighting) had a decent number of different units but after mid game you've seen them all and only two require slightly different strategies. Compared to the number of units in the first game of the series, Afterlight is a letdown in this regard.Storyline: C+: Honestly, I find the tech progression more interesting than whatever kooky stuff is presented in these alien encounter games. There are a few twists and it's pretty well told (though you may want to familiarise yourself with the preceding games in the series). Although you can choose who to ally with, this doesn't impact the story. So, solid if unspectacular.Polish: B+: This is what saves Afterlight from the ignomy of being worse than its prequels. While Aftershock has better enemies and both have pretty pictures with the techs and better progression, Afterlight boasts a vastly improved interface. I think I only had to look on the forums twice, most things are intuitive and aside from some nitpicking, hassles are few. Also the later release year really shows in the graphics. Again, modern games largely outdo it but it's not a huge jump.Overall C+ So this gets a recommendation from me, with the following proviso. Play the Xcom series (as far back as your primitive UI/graphics tolerance allows), Jagged Alliance 2 (hey, there's aliens on one map) and the underated Spellcross first. After that you may want to play the older UFO's for the plot (I didn't and it was fine though) and if you're still finding that you have an alien zapping itch, particularly if you like your combat up close, I can happily recommend this to you.Tips- You can bind 3 groups of soldiers to a key. Don't attack yellow until you have a hazardous area team in place. Don't get too attached to your aliens soldiers, they can't compare with humans in the long run. Thanks for reading!			"

												Don't buy this.1st, let me say that if you're looking for another XCom style game, this isn't it.Buggy missions make it extremely easy to break your game completely if you miss a capture mission.I wiped out one of the factions completely before getting a key capture mission for research later on.non-intuitive tech tree navigation.  You have to guess what you need, in what order, with NO IDEA what it will unlock.the NPC's in the base NEVER EVER SHUT THE HELL UP!!!!And it's even worse on missions.After 2 hours, I played the entire rest of my 50.8 hours with the headphones off.Squad member nametags are always in the way when you're on a mission.horrible camera control/angle - FPS style view is a joke, don't even bother with it.And there will come a point, if you're a masochist and buy this even though i'm telling you not to, where you'll be left wondering WTF do I do?*hint* make sure you do the 2 moon missions, and click the Laputian's in diplomacy and request supplies/reinforcements.and you'll have to check that alot.

												I have mixed feelings about this game, having just played it start to finish on ""normal"".It has many of the elements necessary for a good sci-fi squad-level tactical game.  The strategic game is entertaining -- you always feel like you're short on something.  Base management, research, and manufacturing is cleanly done.The tactical game is poorly developed.  The first few missions are nearly identical, and overall the challenge is to find a good place to stand while the bad guys charge at you.  There's a wide variety of armor, most of which you won't have a use for.  It seems like they tried to accommodate a wide variety of play styles, but the tactical game isn't really deep enough to warrant more than stand-here-shoot-there.Overall it was interesting enough that I wanted to get to the end, but I have zero interest in playing it again.  If you're interested in squad-level strategy games it's worth a look, but there are better options out there.			"

												As a long-time veteran of the X-COM series starting at Enemy Unknown, this game is a nostalgic throwback to the X-COM games made in the 80s, but instead of poor controls combined with below-terrible graphics, it is given life with a new combat system and pretty graphics. UFO: Afterlight runs so well that it can be switched between windowed and fullscreen without any problem, and the game will never crash. This game is a must-own for those who want to experience X-COM before it was good without playing a bad game.			"

												Much better than the recent releases of bigger budget games who are focused on graphics and combat arenas rather than a mix of strategy, management and tactical combat.I like the idea of placing the story on mars, it makes the game quite different with a good reason unlike other games who change their winning recipe for no reasons.I think it is the most challenging of the three UFO After... series (Aftershock, Afterlight and aftermath).Worth taking a look, and buying on Steam, it's quite cheap.

												I thought this would be interesting to play, but the interface feels like it holds everything back. By default, the AI is too stupid to take two steps to the left to move and engage a target. The camera controls harken back to 1997 RTS games. The potential is there for an amazing game due to the available complexity, but by default (PAUSE EVERYWHERE FOR EVERYTHING) it's like trying to drive a car that randomly goes into the wrong gear. By the time I had everything configured to where the game was tolerable to play, I found myself getting messages from the NPCs every five seconds. If you hated Navi from Zelda:OOT, avoid this. This is basically a babysitting sim where every NPC needs attention constantly. Could be great if the experience was cleaned up a bit and some WASD controls were in by default. I think as it stands it tries to do too much at once and falls flat on its face. Recommendations: Clean up the tutorial, extend the missions for the NPCs before going to the world overview. Give time for the player to get adjusted to one concept, and consolidate the interface so that you don't need to issue so many different way-pointed commands for the AI to do anything. There's a such thing as clutter and I've never played a strategy game that has more buttons/options per character in the party than the entire interface of the Sims + Sim City put together.			"

The graphics took a step backwards from Aftermath, they introduced some confusing resource requirement  with Advisers and a Council (trying to borrow elements from the Civilization series I suppose), either way it DOES NOT work. Couldn't play if for more than an hour before I was completely frustrated with it. I am scared to try UFO: Aftershock for fear it will suck too!

If you feel like spending 20+ Hours doing something you were sure you were doing right, only to then find out your whole crew just died because of it, then this is your game.			"

												Utterly boring, it is going to take you in a one way train to boredom. I have 12 GB of RAM memory, and it still takes 5~10 seconds to change tabs in the menu, there is not even a map opened. It tries to make you listen to minutes and minutes of boring cheap chat. Do not recommend.			"

												Well,there is no real Tutorial, the Controls are somewhat strange and my First impression was so bad that I couldnt force myslef to play this game anymore. I guess if you really like this hybridstyle tactical-strategy/RTS and are open to try to figure out most things on your own this game might still be enjoyablr and even good but for me it was to much effort to get in the gameEDIT: Thanks for the comments, I realized, taht teh first mission(s) is tutorial, BUT its no good tutorial. If I play a tutorial I do this to understand the base aspects and mechanics of the game. The game itself could at least refer to a manual (because it is not granted anymore that there is a manual shipped with the game (be it on paper or digital)!)I really enjoyed teh XCOM Games, but i do not need an XCOm on steriods, for me it was a mistake to buy this game! Therfore I cannot recommend it! But Tryhards and hardcore fans with a lot of patience should try this game. I never said this game was Crap only taht you shouldnt buy it within a minute decision. Was my mistake i didnt inform properly about what this game will be like, so all i can do is hope taht no one will do the same mistake!			"

												Note: I've played this game since its release -- time on record is only since I got a new computer with an appropriate graphics card.Frankly I'm stunned this game has mixed reviews. If you enjoyed any XCOM game, this is a streamlined and more intuitive wonder built on the concepts of a great classic.I image the only 2 reasons you would not enjoy this game are:1. Your video card does not support the game, in which case it won't run (upgrading may be worth it).2. You don't like relatively slow-paced games (a fair amount of the tactical game is planning your movements and attacks, and you'll spend time building a base as well as setting up research and production).For everyone else, this game will keep you on your toes, and the difficult levels vary a great deal. In my opinion there is excellent replay value (and mods which I had not even tapped into yet). Characters (and entire squads) are customizable in the skills they learn, weapon, armor and all kinds of customization/upgrade options for your gear. Your squad can be composed of humans, droids and psionic aliens. You'll have tactical gameplay out the wazoo with a good variety of maps and enemies!When I recently got a new computer, I made sure I had a video card that could run this game - and this was the first game I installed.No doubt, one of my favorite games of all time - highly recommended!

												This game is of a specific genre. I never played X-COM, but a friend in high school yeeeears back gave me UFO Aftermath, I was addicted. It was sooo awesome. I played Aftershock and Afterlight, and later played them on Steam. They are constantly driving you to do more, to research more, to plan ahead, strategically and tactically. Specialize your team, train them, lose some of your soldiers and grieve for them. This game... makes it personal. YOU are on Mars, YOUR teams have to research and produce, fight, conquer and expand YOUR territory, YOU train them, YOU take care of them, and it is YOU who lose soldiers in battles.Just those damn Reticulans from Expedition give you soldiers but no armour.

												UFO is the cheap homage to the classic X-COM series, and it plays that way. In this one, we enter a story where the original game was lost; instead of kicking our enemies off Earth, for some reason we allowed our enemies to take over our planet and cover it with some kind of mutant biomass. That's a part of the over-arching story you'll be briefly introduced to as you march your little soldiers over the surface of Mars, cutting yourself out a new home after having been dispossessed of your old one.The graphics are a little old, but each weapon, including the customizations, can be seen in their tiny form during battles, and your soldiers' faces appear clearly behind their helms. The game's tutorials can be annoying, and the constant reminders by the helpers in each screen, giving you information you can't really use, is downright frustrating.Unlike most X-COM clones, this game feels like it's especially built to be played in small bites. Battles are intense, but brief, and the whole thing consists of a lot of peaceful waiting, or tense waiting, as the rampaging beastman hordes threaten to swallow everyone whole.Overall, I like the game. Fun, keeps you occupied for enough hours, and you get to watch your characters improve more significantly than in the original series' entries. There are also a lot of nifty, hidden entries and situations that require a bit of caution, planning, or just dumb luck, and getting a new character under better circumstances than your last playthrough is extremely rewarding.

												You are in command of a group of human colonists attempting to terraform mars in the wake of the alien decimation of earth... but aparently we won that war and part of the peace accord was to drop you off here.Real time tactical strategy combat against various alien factions on the surface of Mars while managing resouces, constructing and defending outlying installations... all in order to make it so you can take off your helmets. Ok, fun times.Word of warning, a friend told me this didn't work on his Windows 8 machine. I have Windows 7 and it works fine.			"

												This is a pretty decent original X Com style sequel game. There are some significantly limiting factors that are removed from game play, such as good resource management and the character handling/advancement is just clunky. Combat is okay but is very steep. The learning curve is high, but completely different from the original X Com. It's worth playing through, and is significantly better than most alien games, but still doesn't live up to X Com			"

												 This game has that special something - distinct from the last two games in it's series - this one is nominally part of the story but definitely a stand alone.  That special something is a mix between keeping a small colony alive, team squad game, people management, exploration... and enough ' what's happening?"" to keep you playing.  It's like several lesser games met and made an amazing whole. One of the most interesting games I have ever played, from  a series that started out not just cloning xcom, but improving it - and that says alot. "

												I am big fan of squad based games and this one was the first series I played after the initial success of the original X-Com. This and the other UFO series games were a welcome addition to squad based games. Although not as atmospherically good as X-Com, it was still a fun game and had great improvements in graphics, research, and voice over. I did two play throughs when it was released pre-steam and picked it up on steam as the original disks would not work on a modern windows based system and have put in time now as well.This game has had some issues with modern systems, even when working through steam. Occasional crashes and issues with some loading can be common so save often. I never had any issues that 10 or 15 of internet help or troubleshooting couldn't resolve to an acceptable level. I expect any game that was made before windows 7 to have issues on a modern system. If your a fan of squad based games and you can stomach the idea of playing an older game far from the graphic and audio masterpieces that use all the current technologies and software available today pick it up. -- Well worth the $1.39, its priced for the autumn sale right now.

												This is an older game so be aware that certain hardware setups may not run this game. Check google before buying to see if any of the major issues will affect your system.Its a good game dispite its age though not as in depth tactically as the older xcom games though like its predecessors it brought a few new elements to the genre that are now in titles more people are familiar with. This title is by far less buggy than the earlier titles in the series (at least for me) though they all offer something interesting.If you think you may be interested have a look at a few playthroughs on youtube and keep in mind it is an older title that is no longer supported so issues may be encounted on some systems (I'm just lucky they don't affect my setup). Also look through some of the negative reviews as there are some good negatives to keep in mind. For me though I recommend this game.			"

												Now I'm sitting here writing a review for UFO: Afterlight, a real masterpiece for the year 2007.UFO: Afterlight is a game, which has it's similarities with XCOM, but also very strong differences. The features of the game are very similar to Aftershock and Aftermath, so if anyone had played those, you won't have any problems with the Interface. To the resolution problem there is a clear fix, if someone has problems with it, but I am not here to tell you how to fix stuff, but rating the game. The game might seem VERY difficult, but if you know how to play (For Example setting up Killboxes, hit & running and many other interesting tactics with the help of Technologies helps you out a lot) it ain't that hard anymore.UFO: Afterlight has some very new features which the games before didn't have for example building stations, and not gather resources with ♥♥♥♥ing roads, which had my rage counter held up in UFO: Aftershock and Aftermath. Also here you have to assign Scientists and Ingeneers to their buildings in order to even do something.The fights haven't really changed, you use the same Techniques like in the previous games, but the enemies can make you change your way of fighting with knowing where you are with devices, which you can counter by technologies. There are enemies, which can wipe your squad out, when you're rushing them without certain weapons and Level of the Peeps.Here is another new Mechanic, called Terraforming. You see, before you start a mission you can see how dangerous would it be for suits, and If your terraforming progress is far up, you don't really need to worry about the dangers for them.Now the only problem is Savescamming; you can play without it, but I had more fun with Savescamming than with normally playing the game, as i could Design Strategies to Finish one mission and Complete another one Much easier knowing what can happen from the previous experience.The difficulty is also at it's highest point at the 3/4th of the game, it's the point where NOTHING can happen anymore if you could handle one mission from there with ease without savescamming.So Altar games had done a VERY good job making the game differ from the Previous parts of the game.The game was well worth it's money, It was worth each Cent I've spent on the game, I don't regret any second that I bought the game for 7€9,5/10 (as the game has SOME points where i had a bad experience from it, however after a time i think those would've not been if i would've played better)			"

												One of my Favoritt games in the entire tactical combat / Management games. A tactical RPG in some sense with a great story that even uses the mid to end of the second UFO game as referance for this third installment of the series. Overall a great game for those that enjoy the UFO or X-Com inspired games and series.the graphics are nice and enjoyable, with funny characters as well as a rarther challenging combat/management system if you increase it so. It also have the option to modifiy whats hard: so in a sense you can make the combat impossible but management easy or opposite to suit your taste,Single Base with automated stationsYou have 1 base where your characters live, they can improve the base, train, manufacture items and research new technology. However you need to build Automated Stations, Terraforming Plants and more to increase your Sphere of Influence on the map, enemies can attack these stations if they succede you lose your area or even die if it is a vital location like water.Enviromental ThreatThe planet is very hostile to human life and the humans need Suits, Light or Heavy armors to surive. The Enviromental threat is very important if this threat is higher than your suit or armor has in enviromental protection the suit will break and you will take damage over time. Either you abort the mission or you hurry to compleat the mission. In the start of the game my suggestion is to get metal 3 and get the first heavy armor as it has great enviromental protection, overall combat survivability the only downside is that it requires a total of 3 soldier talent points to learn how to wear it.EconomyThe game has no income of money or possibility to buy like other x-com or ufo inspired games, however instead you build automated mining stations that give you the resources you need. To build items you require a set level of the resource, so if you have Metal 3 you can make Heavy Armors that are great to face trouble at a higher enviromental threat.DiplomacyThe game has a very easy diplomacy system and several factions, some are constantly hostile, others require the proper research or being hostile to a rival faction. Having Alliances will give you access to non-human allies that can among otherthings use Psionic Powers that can stun enemies for easy capture, but so can the stun grenade so it isnt the end of the world.Class SystemThe classes are divided in 3, The Soldier, The Scientist and The Engineer. Some characters has 2 classes.To use in combat they have to be soldiers, It is important to quickly take a Soldier Scientist and Soldier Engineer into your main party to make them have a good soldier level for later. The Scientist Soldier is the only one that can heal in combat with the First Aid tool and the engineer gets access to powerful weapons that no one else can use aka Warp Cannon, this weapon has a wooping 999 in damage output and anything standing infront of that blast is dead. In addition the engineers can repair suits or armors (and droids if you choose to use them)Pure Scientist or Scientist/Engineer are used to research tech and construct some of the various overworld buildings.Pure Engineer or Scientist/Engineer are used to produce weapons, armors and ammo, overworld resource buildings and base buildings. Scientist/Engineers work best as scientist in the start and get used for manufacture and such later in the game when you are done researching or lacking things to research.			"
