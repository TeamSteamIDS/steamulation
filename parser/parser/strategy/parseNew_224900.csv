												Iron Sky Invasion creates a trashy, funny atmosphere, like the film does. However, it has a simple and slow gameplay with really boring missions.Iron Sky: Invasion isn't a bad game. There is a chance, that some fans of space flights and fights will enjoy it. But you need to remember, that it's a simple game that looks more like a complex indie game and if not for the movie tie-in, no one would have heard about it. The politics plays no part in the gameplay, the fights are slow and have a bad difficulty balance. A good idea is not enough to make an interesting game.I'm sure there are Iron Sky fans who will enjoy this game but if you like complex, tactical space battles, Iron Sky Invasion is not the right game for you. Overall 6/10.			"

												Despite all the bad reviews on Meta Critic and other platforms, I've got to say that I do like Iron Sky: Invasion.I mean, the graphics are very well made, the small cutscene VMF's are of a very high quality and actually very entertaining.The gameplay is just right; not too easy and not too hard.There's even a bit of character development in the form of ship upgrades and the option to change the type of vessel.The sound effects are of a very, really, very high quality.The controls; basically just like with Freelancer. Mouse flight and keyboard system management. (Energy, weapons, etc.)I give Iron Sky: Invasion thumbs up, because it IS a good game that's all about the space battles in the movie.			"

												While Iron Sky: Invasion (and its add-ons) is not the end-all be-all of space fighter simulators, it probably doesn't have any right to be as good as it actually is, especially for a video game based on a movie. The whole of the game took a fair portion of the latter half of the film - basically the entire space fight and Earth fleet reinforcement segment - and stretched it out without making it boring. The tone of black comedy and ""just run with it"" silliness from the movie is preserved, from the mission briefings with Madame President Totally-Not-Sarah-Palin, to the political shenanigans of the various national representatives, to the over-the-top voice acting from the various pilots in the fleet.The controls are keyboard-and-mouse, primarily mouse oriented. On screen contextual tips do show up from time to time, which can help if you go a long time between having to use a specific feature of the ship. The learning curve for controlling the ships is very short. There are some technical problems - while I haven't noticed any crashes or freezes, it doesn't like my graphics card and the mission briefing videos lag the entire game as often as not. They can be skipped with no penalty and watched later, it's just distracting.Unfortunately, once the tutorial is over, the difficulty curve spikes pretty hard; it's all but impossible for a new player to know what to do and how to do it. There's a certain amount of flexibility - if a squadron of Nazi ships makes it to earth it just applies a penalty to reputation, which is a score by any other name - but there's no option to turn down or postpone side missions, they get added to your to-do list automatically when you head to a friendly station for resupply and repairs. When you're running all over near earth orbit trying to play space tag with the Fourth Reich, something's gotta give. That said, you can buy yourself time to fight the smaller fighters and do side missions by taking out the engines in the big ships, leaving them adrift - but the only mention of this strategy comes up once during the tutorial on sub-system targets. It's very easy to miss.Having said all that, if you liked the movie, you'll probably like the game. And even if you didn't like the movie, you might still like the game. After all, it's a game that lets you fight Space Nazis. I'll repeat that: You get to fight Nazis. In Space. And who can honestly say they never wanted to do that?			"

												At the time of writing this, I have played through all but the very end of the 2nd chapter of the game's story.  More on that later.If all of the following conditions are true, you will have a great time with this game:1. You have enjoyed Space Combat Sims such as X-Wing, Tachyon or Wing Commander2. You have an X-Box controller3. You do NOT have a flight stick (Caveot: See end of review)4. You grab it while the price is discounted5. You do not mind that it uses 3rd party DRM ""Reality Pump""If you have a flight stick you will face-palm at the missed opportunity and this will probably erode your fun factor of the game.The game's control set up is optimized for a 360 controller, or any controller that is XInput-compatible such as the Logitech F310.  Many features are logically crammed into the little controller.  No keyboard use required.  It feels like this game was designed from the ground up to give some arcadey space-combat fun to gamers who do not have a flight stick.  Marksman-like accuracy is not required.  If the target is ""close enough"" to your crosshairs, you will hit it.  No sweat.  The emphasis leans more towards management of your shields, weapon energy and missiles.  -as well as making sure you are at the right place at the right time.  When you are up against larger capital ships and targeting their various sub-systems, feel free to wail on them with your missiles.  Don't worry, when you run dry one of your allies will thoughtfully drop a box of missiles for you to pick up.  Did I mention arcadey fun?The game has a 2D map of the zone of space you will play in.  Pick a location then warp to it.  This reminded me of Star Raiders on the Atari 8-bit computers.  Whoops.. Just dated myself.The game is based on the movie ""Iron Sky.""  It is about Nazis from the moon who invade Earth.  I did not see it, but I would like to.  And yes, it is as tongue-in-cheek as it sounds.  The game has ""FMV cutscenes"" (remember them?).  The production values are small and the quality of acting varies.  Fortunately, the voice of the main character you control is well-acted and likeable.  The quips he makes when taking out a baddie will never make you cringe.  The graphics are quite good for a lower-budget title.  The outer-space skybox is very pretty.  I don't expect to see much variety in the environment as this is about nazis from the MOON who invade EARTH.. Not too much variety of scenery between these two locations.  I wouldn't expect the game to venture too far from this area either.I don't know if I will continue the game any time soon.  Why did I stop playing it?  Two reasons:1. At the very end of the 2nd chapter I hit a game-breaking bug.  Reading in the forums I found that other people have experienced this same glitch.  Sometimes playing the entire 2nd chapter again from the start resolves the issue.2. I got myself a new flight stick and this game doesn't support it.  Makes it difficult to muster the will to play this right now when I could be bringing hot plasma death to my digital enemies in other space combat games that rightfully DO support flight sticks.Having said that, I still recommend the game for everyone who meets all of the conditions stated at the start of this review.  You'll have a great time and if the game glitches out remember; you only spent a couple of bucks on it! :)EDIT: X360ce Vibmod will let you map your flight stick axis to the XBox 360 control axis.  I just tried it and it works!  So there is hope for games like these where the developer wants to force you to use one type of controller.  Check out a YouTube video on it here:

												The game is not bad. It have good cinematics and good visuals.But it seems like unfinished game. Its very short, very easy, very repetitive and have bug that makes some archivenns undetected. All you do is killing, killing and killing. After few hours it becomes boring.Why not making some different type of misons like stealth, disguise, escort, more side missions, etc.Why not make the game  have two endings? The player should chose if he want to continue fighing nazi or he will join them to stay with Renate. So half of the game could be totaly different. The game could have big potential but developers failed.Two DLCs add some things that original game missing like ability to give orders to earth fleet or to fly nazi craft, but it can't save it.I would not recomend this game unless it sold with discount (like when i bought it).5/10			"

												AUNTIE SARAH WANTS YOU!She wants you to fight against the evil Nazis from the Dark Side of the Moon.Question is: Do you have the guts to not only fight Haunebus and Zeppelins in Space, but also to help Madame President in her election campaign or give the Indian people their beloved music broadcast?If you can answer with: YES, MA'AM! ... Or at least had some fun with the movie 'Iron Sky' then this is for you.This game is a nice addition to the movie as it focus on the figth in space between earth and moon, with some cheesy characters giving you mainly weird missions (only in terms of reason ... the goal is mainly jsut to destroy or rescue something) to fullfill.It has some nice gameplay elements like a more or less real time battlefield, the possibility to switch your ship at space stations during the missions and deciding which battle you like to join. The two available DLCs give you some real time strategy element and the opportunity to play as a Nazi pilot.			"

												First off, I say watch the movie first before buying this and you would have to like the movie somewhat in order to like this (that's my opinion). Don't expect anything too serious though because it's about... well... Moon Nazis... Anyway I love the game even though it may be ""repetitive"" to some or not a big title game like♥♥♥♥♥♥CoD. I recommend the game if you want a decent action/shooter IN SPACEEEE...! P.S: I do believe that it is a bit expensive, I was able to get it because I randomely got a coupon for it when I created a badge for 90% off. So the total was $4.00. Also I do wish that it had multiplyer because I REALLY want to shoot friends in Walkyries. Or shoot them down with friends.			"

												Before even looking at the screenshots or the video, please, pretty please watch the movie ""Iron Sky"". It's a bland funny movie, you watch it once, laugh with all the weird comedy, and then return the movie back to the rental. Now, if you really loved the movie, the ships, the setting, the story plot? Then, and only then, consider getting this game. It's a generic (albeit well made) space simulator following the story of the movie. Not much more than that... Oh, and Renate Richter is there too.

Get a pad!I can't emphasize that enough. This game is pretty much unplayable without a controller. And even then the control scheme is bad. No, you can't reassign keys, so you're stuck with them. And no joystick support by the way, in this space sim.But once you get over the bad controls, this is actually pretty fun little space shooter. Especially when considering that it is a licenced game and the movie it is based was a huge disappointment. I think it was James Rolfe who said something like: ""A good movie makes a bad video game, and a bad movie makes a not so bad game."" Luckily you can skip all those live-action cutscenes.I especially like how the ships you get to fly look pretty realistic. Like that's how they would be when they start manufacturing spaceships in real life. And I think one of them is Normandy from Mass Effect -series.Just wait for sales.			"

												(Steam says I've only played 10 minutes, but I beat the entire campaign in offline mode)Overall, it's a decent game with a few flaws that mean it's best bought on sale. The biggest flaw by far is the controls. Keyboard and mouse is next to unplayable, no joystick support (although I couldn't test it myself), but an Xbox controller makes it pretty fun. They're also mostly unconfigurable (you can invert the Y-axis, but not remap buttons). The game's two other main flaws sort of exist in a delicate balance. They don't introduce many new mechanics outside of newer, larger enemies, but at the same time it's short enough (the campaign kept moving, but the ending felt sudden and rushed) that I didn't get tired of it until I was trying to get through the DLC. Same goes for the music. There aren't a lot of tracks, but it's short enough that they didn't repeat enough to be annoying.There are many ships you can play with (some are forced in missions), but upgrades are stuck in the ship you buy them for, so you'll probably be sticking with one ship for almost the whole time. This is a minor flaw, combined with how the upgrades are purely better numbers. Having upgrades that actually change the ships be purchasable (or just the different ships having a real variety of features) would've made it a lot more fun. The actual designs of ships and stations are pretty nice, just like they were in the movie (the cutscenes are practically out of the movie too).For a movie game, it's exceptional. Flying was fun, and for the $2.49 I paid, I expected a lot less than I got. I have to give the game credit for its scale, too. When a mission told me there was a 3 mile wide asteroid, I expected it to be just a slightly larger version of the normal ones, but instead they genuinely made me feel tiny next to the thing.The DLC isn't really worth it. One is a more hectic version of a campaign map where you command the other nation's fleets. It's not bad, but it doesn't give you any indication of progress (I was playing for an hour and no end was in sight, so it might be endless). The other lets you play as one of the enemy ships, tasked with fighting the other side of a battle, where you have to hold out for 20 minutes. They're both nice new gamemodes to have, but even for the tiny price I paid, I'd expect something more. "

												Based on the movie Iron Sky, which is like Spaceballs + Mars Attacks + Team America + Moon Nazi UFOs + Julia Dietze, the game is pretty much only interesting if you have seen the movie and are kind of craving that little bit more.Keeping in mind that I basically got this for $2 during a sale and the $2 was free from steam market stuff, it's not bad.  However, nothing about it is worth full price.It's a fairly casual shooter with auto-aim and generic mission types.  It was designed to be a fully cross platform iOS/Android/PC release and it shows though it's quite acceptable graphically, being pulled up by the usage of assets from the movie such as the soundtrack, ship models, cinematics and live actors. It has live action mission briefings which are acceptably corny in that Westwood Studios way. Despite it having auto-aim, they manage to make the combat intense at times due to the number of enemies and incoming missiles you need to accelerate away from or dodge. It lets you redistribute energy to your shields, engines or weapons, which adds a nice layer to the combat. Collecting salvage in order to buy upgrades is a central aspect of the game and becomes more interesting as salvage only remains in space for a short time, so you often want to use your booster to get there faster.  This can make you give up shield or weapon energy to redistribute it to engines to collect salvage, increasing the risks in combat for a time.  A catchy mechanic.The keyboard/mouse controls are supposedly pretty bad, but I never tried them.  It plays ok with a 360 controller, though aiming is a little sensitive.The Second Fleet DLC doesn't really add anything of value to the game, so there's no reason to get it.  Meteorblitzkrieg is 20 minutes long and not bad for the 74 cents it cost, so if you still want 20 minutes more then there it is.			"

												Worth buying with 90% discount coupon. Other than that the price is too big for this simple shoot em up in space game. It has nice graphics, but nothing spectacular. The humour and actors from the movie, but maybe too much humour (Madam President is annoying as hell :)). Nice acting, though all storyline is presented in a small video chat window at the top of the screen. It's ok though for a game costing a few bucks, not 20. One bad thing about dialogs is that they often run during the combat, so you can't really concentrate on them. And nazi general speaks German and there are only subtitles translating it. So you have to shoot enemies and read the text at the same time. Bad, bad design. Dialogs should be out of battles or battles should pause or something. Gameplay becomes repetitive fairly quickly, though sometimes you have to defend or capture something, but most of the time you have to blast enemies. There are several types of enemies, some are tougher. Some require to shoot at the right moment (like Zeppelins, you should shoot into opened docks, but they stay open for such a short time..). There is some strategy to the game, as you should first destroy all the smaller annoying ships, before going for the big ones. You should watch your shields and energy and transfer energy to shields, weapons or engine according to the situation. But if playing carefully you probably will never die. Even if you do, you will go back to the latest save (every major space jump creates auto save). You are also allowed to change ships sometimes and buy upgrades. Other ships are interesting and have different purposes, like Canadian bomber carrying nukes to destroy asteroids, but most of the time you will fly Dundee australian bomber. Another annoying part is that you have to gather salvages of the blasted enemies to sell them to buy upgrades. You blow the ship, you fly to collect the salvage and you do these hundreds of times.. Well, at least there is an achievement to collect 500 scraps and buy all the upgrades for a few ships. All achievements are rather easy (just don't forget to visit all the stations to get all the side missions), but one should try to get them on the first run collecting as many money, kills and salvages as possible, because trying to replay chapters after completing the game will make achievements glitch and not register.All in all, i was pleased with the recreation of the atmosphere of the movie (music, characters, space combats). Last mission was too simple, short and a bit awkward (to fly inside the big ship). The ending was shallow. But it was fun, short game, which doesn't require much skill. For the price i got it i'm satisfyed, and maybe even try some of the DLCs. One of them let you fight for the Moon nazis, and another one even introduces RTS elements of commaning the fleet.P.S. one can always try a demo to get an impression.Update: don't buy DLCs, they are total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t..

												I enjoy this game quite a bit. First I am a fan of the film so the fact they got several of the actors to come back and do their rolls again for the fmv portions just brigns back all the sillyness of the movie. Second the space combat feels very much like it was inspired by freespace...though very watered down. If anythign I have to say this game only has two real flaws 1. many of the side missions given will appear randomly and are timed with no way to re attempt them with out replaying hte chapter. and 2, this game is insanely easy. As long as you are in range and kinda sorta pointed in the right direction you will hit your target. Other then that, See the movie first, expect horible silly story, embrace its intentionaly awful nature. This game is just meant for silly fun and is a decent reminder of the space combat games of old. Seriously all the guts for a great Freespace style game are here, it just needs to be polished the right way. Oh, and pretty much just ignore the game bullet points on the store front, most of it is prettty much either wrong, misleading, or exageration.			"

												An intriguing space shooter that ultimately dissapoints. It's pretty good for a movie tie-in game and even somewhat fun to play. It's just enough like a proper space sim to constantly remind me how awesome it could have been if they added some complexity and control options. Really frustrating. It's also full of protection and escort missions, but so easy that they don't really annoy. Also I don't know if it just me, but the final boss fight didn't happen to me at all. A lot of hype about it, a cutscene from the movie and then just victory message. That's odd. Unless you really like shooting Nazi UFOs, I recommend you stay away even at discount. I hear this game uses some questionable DRM too.It's a shame, really.			"

												This game is simply outstanding for it's size, as the missions are HUGE, with Nazi UFOs zipping about while getting hit by multi-national teams of satellites-turned-gunships, whilst guarding a MUCH larger (SPACE) Zepplin which is in turn towing a FRIGGIN GIGANTIC asteroid, when, all of the sudden, a wild Mir Space Station appears with several fighters in tow.Essentially, this game is a blast to play, with great cut-scenes reminiscent of the old-school Command & Conquer games where each one is live-action.-------------------------In Depth Analysis-------------------Tons of upgrades ingame, with a good amount of ships to use, each one bringing it's own distinct ""flavor"" into the battle.Enemies are quite agile, and are not Dark-Souls hard, but they will punish you for really derping about, but there are no Insta-Kills to be seen.The actors are quite funny, ( winks at Madam President ), and convey differing views and morals as to the Nazi Invaders, and are potrayed well thanks to great acting. Of note, the Nazi invaders DO speak full German, but there are subtitles to help those who do not speak German. 9/10Gameplay Overall:  Fun, hectic, and full of accentuated international battle-chatter, with intense b***s-to-the-wall dogfighting. 10/10Graphics/FX:  Great for a game of this size ( under 1 Gig even with all the DLC O.O  ) and the larger enemy Capital Ships take dynamic damage to engines, turrets, hangars, and, when aforementioned component(s) are eviscerated, leave behind nice sized chunks that will rip apart any unaware pilots, be it AI, or the more likely Player. 8/10 "

												I picked this game up in a BundleStar game bundle, and have finished the game before writing this review. I have used a controller for a majority of my playthrough, and have entered this game without watching the movie.Let me start with the postive- 1> The graphics are subpar to good; they look 2012-2013ish with decent lighting effects.2> Some of the charachters such as the Indian diplomat are memorable and funny3> When used with a XBOX360 controller, the game handles itself very wellHere are why I cannot recommend the game-1> Like others have pointed out, this game gets very repetitive very fast- there are barely 4 enemy types, and there is no introduction of any new mechanics after the tutorial itself. Sure, you get to fly a ship with nukes, but they can only be used on asteroids; and even if an enemy is RIGHT next to the asteroid, it takes ZERO damage with the nuke explosion (you get this ship for only one mission, and the ship is pretty bad compared to the regular ones, you have NO reason to use it)2> The ships cannot be upgraded in a meaningful way or in a way that would impact how you play the game. Your weapon upgrades essentially deal more damage, but you cannot pick buy any more weapons other than the 4 default ones- 2 types of lasers and 2 types of missles. There is a distinct lack of an ingame economy, and aside from 2 missions of 5 minutes each, you have only two ships to chose from. A multi target missle system would be welcome, considering that you have to engage each enemy one at a time, and in a level with over 30 enemies, it can get cumbersome. Moreso, the ships have no special abilities, and aside from cosmetic differences, the only other difference between your main ships are hull and speed tradeoffs.3> The pacing is awful, the first one hour were very enjotyable with plenty of videos and dialogue, after which things crawled to you essentially receiving a notification that you have a new mission with a distinct lack of dialogue; this combined with the limited ship variery and limited enemy types made the game repetitive and boring. 4> The way how the game mechanics work- a>when you destroy a ship, you get scraps which is converted to money at a space station which you then use to buy things- the scraps fall 5 seconds after you destroy the enemy ship since the fireball of the ship needs to explore- if you are darting through an enemy fleet, you need to take another round to get the scrap, assuming the short timer before the scrap explodes doesn't tick out. There are no abilities to attract or auto collect the scrap.b> For all the weapons to get a kill efficiently, you need to target an enemy- the game doesn't select the enemy closest to you or the one nearest to your reticule, but rather cycles through each enemy; this means if you have a zepplin with its dock doors open, and you need to quickly get a missle in it to damage the ship; you need to press that next button an infinite number of times before the zepplin is selected, by which time the doors would have closedc> The game relies on a small text notification at the end of your screen to notify you of mission critial information such as whether a zepplins doors are open or not, or in the tutorial for buttons; I found it easy to ignore that and not know when an event was happening; a more noticable place would be nice; or a flash across the screen or something more visually noticable.5> The game is unplayable with a keyboard and mouse; the defaut bindings are very awkward to play with, and the mouse has some weird slowing down after I stop moving it; it feels much more refined with a controller.6> The story is very nice initally, but midway, it gets boring, and the ending is just awful- if you are playing this for the story, don't- it's very threadbare to non-existent, and the ending really ruins it; you have a 15 second video  after a 5-6 hour playhtorugh.

Yes the voice acting is off, and the story is strange, but it looks beautiful. Some people have said that it controls really badly, but for me the mouse and keyboard controls are brilliant. If you don't take the acting seriously, it is a funny and brilliant game.			"

FIghting an aircraft carrier solo in a bomber by mission 3. 5-10 shots to kill enemies and only 3 to kill you. Ship upgrades are insanely expensive right off the bat. Sluggish and poorly mapped controls. Definitely not worth the $20 price tag.			"

												I think this game gets overlooked as another quickly knocked off movie tie-in, when it is in fact a very competently put together arcade space shooter.  Gamepad required, definitely.  The FMV scenes are hokey but fit the tone of the film, I tend to skip them.  I like that the enemy armadas move on the game map in real time, meaning you have to make quick decisions about what to attack and when.  Diverting power to shields and weapons also makes the combat a bit more interesting.  Graphically the game is quite nice to look at, backgrounds rotate and scale really smoothly, reminding me of late 90s space shooters like like Colony Wars.  Recommended, esp. at a discount!			"

												At first invading space nazis sounds really stupid and not thought through. You would be right, but playing this game makes killing space nazis really fun. It has fun reliable gameplay that keeps you playing. The only downside to this game is that there is no checkpoints mid mission and missions go for about 1-2 hours. At full price it might not be worth buying this game but at half price or with a coupon it would be a good price.			"

												I'm not sure what to think of this game at all. It's unclear to me whether or not the pilot was intended to be as obnoxious as he is, but he definitely irritates me. Space battles are confusing and I frequently get blown up for no apparent reason. However, you definitely get to shoot space nazis in space zepplins. I would definitely not buy this game for 20$, but on sale at 2$ might be ok. I honestly don't know.			"

												If your a fan of odd ball humer and like the idea of fighting or playing as a moon Nazi then you will enjoy this. The acting is good and the characters stay true to the film, only bad bit is it can become repetative. All the ships from the film are included (I love the British Spitfire) and the Nazi forces are reinforced with new ship types. I would advise getting the Meteorblitzkrieg DLC with the game and get the Second Fleet DLC after playing through the game once, as it realy changes the pace of the game.			"

For me, game is actually 8/10. It's also nice trophy for Achievement Hunters. Achivs. in this game are pretty easy, on my 1st playthrough I did 27/30 but you can do all 30 in 1 run!

												This game is a lot fun, even if you haven't seen the movie. While 75% of the plot of this game is tied with the movie, I will say the need for it to play this game is still negligible. Game-play and graphics are pretty solid for requirements. It even works on Windows 10. Music is great too, and weapon upgrades for each ship are pretty decent. Whats great about that is docking in order to upgrade. Docking is pretty fun, as well as the ship to ship battles which for game-play requirements you do not see a lot of. I recommend purchasing all of the DLCs with rest of game. That being said, for optimal value you should only buy this game when it is at least 50% off the sticker price. Movie is amazing. Go watch it.			"

												Do missions, shoot space nazis for scrap which you can sell to upgrade your ship to better shoot space nazisPros:+ Love the modern spaceship design - these things look like real spaceships instead of the organic hippie crap typical of sci-fi+ Game is casual and forgiving - it is arcadey and ships fly like airplanes, but its relaxing to play like COD campaign, ie. you don't need to be 100% to enjoy it. Its pretty easy to learn and ship controls aren't overly complicated+ The graphics are good - the spaceships look pretty and overall gives the feel of a professional title+ Who doesn't like humor - like the film, the game is satirical and funny, although don't expect the same quality of acting as the filmCons:- Mouse control is bad - it lacks the fluidity of games like freelancer and war thunder, so you won't get the same precision from the controls as you do from freelancer - maneuvering and aiming can be frustrating on occasion. Play the demo to see if you can cope with that.- Lacks strafing and drifting - this along with the clunky mouse controls kinda makes me think that this aspect of gameplay was perhaps an afterthought. - Not very challenging. What the game lacks in difficulty it makes up for in bad controls- The briefing videos are awkward and slow in which your character and whoever is briefing you seem to not be communicating in the same time frame - conversations like the ship designs are unorganic, and there's always that extra 2 seconds after each transmission in which the actor just stares at the camera waiting for someone to yell cut. Obviously whoever was in charge of editing the videos did not bother to cut out that bit- The game doesn't save after docking to a space station, it only saves every time you warp into a location.- No adjustable performance settings - not a big deal if you have an average rig but there is no way to perhaps lower the graphics in order to play the game on your haswell tablet - ironic considering this game is also a mobile game- No first person view - again not a big deal but lacking first person makes targeting a bit difficultOverall however the faults are mostly ignorable, and you can enjoy the game for its humorous missions, unique ship designs and arcadey experience, that is of course if you catch it on sale.

												short version: an average, semi open world, space shooter with repetitive gameplay but a nice cheesy story that should last you 5 to 7 hours. Recommended on salesLonger version:what I liked- over the top,  almost nonsensical story- cheesy live action cinematics. (beware lots of Satirical use of ethnic stereotypes)- decent number of ships ( paying about 2 dollars I had very low expectations)- different enemy ships have different week spots on their hauls adding a bit of variety to the fighting- the overmap gives the game a bit of sandboxy field- I liked the designs of the ships very muchWhat I did not like:- enemy variety. I remember about 6 enemy types which is not too bad for a budget title but still repetitive for 7 hours- lack of veriety in weapons- upgrade system is linear and is mostly stat increase rather than adding new unique abilities- game play is repetitive- game does not explain itself well. For example , I don't remember the game mentioning the concept of week points- some Setpiece are very buggy and clunky (specially the last mission)			"

												I bought this game cause Steam gave me a -90% deal on it, only 4€, so why not I thought. The game is somewhat entertaining to play, and it works suprisingly well. I do have some issues with the bullets and where they hit or not, but that isn't really something of a problem until you are some meters away from something. The game started off refusing to start cause it was sure that Steam was not running, that I tried to launch the game from inside of Steam, was apparently not proof enough that Steam was running, so after restarting Steam, it launched nicely. As I play this game, I just keep wishing more and more that I could get an option to join the natzis and rather help them invade earth and kill off these blasted incompetent leaders that send me around on monday errands in space while treating me worse than dogsh-it, the natzis does at least acknowledge me and actually want me to join them, but for some reason, my character seems to enjoy being pushed around on petty errands and treated worse than sh-it.... this, combined with the fact that I learned that Steam had stoped giving me my achievements after the 5 first..... gave me a pretty bad taste in my mouth.In light of me spending extra time in the game, doing everything to get the game 100% completed.... have made me change my mind about those 4€ it's not worth itand you shouldn't even consider buying it, if you do however, don't expect the world... it is what you would likely expect of a game about spaceships and moon natzis. Remember to skip every video there is in the game, watching them may get you into a loop where you have no choice but to go back to the start of a chapter to not lose the objective ( which is tedious at best ).If you still want to buy this game, buy it when steam is having a -90% off sale, if not, you will get legally robbed. Personally if given the offer to buy the game for the first time again ( with the knowledge I currently have about the game ) I'd rather light up a fireplace if i was cold, or donate the money to charity I were warm.( to set it into perspective how bad this game is, X Rebirth is giving me less issues than Iron Sky Invasion have, and X Rebirth is the abomination that killed off the entire community for the X Series, and I'd rather buy X Rebirth again if I had to choose between the two )( and if anyone wonders, I kinda liked the movie, in a way that it was so horribly bad that it was entertaining to watch )			"

												I picked this up on a steam voucher, but upon spending a little time with it, I’ve certainly wasted more than the full price of many games far worse. If you liked ""crimsons skies"" or even the newish 'war thunder"", as in simplistic mouse controlled flight combat sim style 3rd person gameplay, you will get into this as one of the in game quotes say ""quicker than a French surrender"".  (First person view is a little like wing commander)Nothing deep here in either the story or gameplay, just a good fun shootem up with zeppelins, Nazis, and space pew pew with a near perfect crust of gaming pop culture, cheese, ham and sprinkles of racism.  Summary: FUN! Casual gameplay  "

												I gotta say I am impressed with this game. I found it more entertaining than I expected. Although I've only played a couple hours or maybe it wa 3...  this is a pretty fun space combat game. Reminds me of a couple very old PC DOS games (wing commander) I can't even remember the title. I just played a little of the extra DLC senarios (Second Fleet & Meteorblitzkreig) and they kicked my butt. Pretty challenging to stay alive to victory..oh well maybe another time. I especially like the ship explosions as it feels satisfying when one is destroyed. Although the character acting during the briefing videos is really a joke, (guess it is supose to be a bit  humerous) it still seems like a decent quality game. I loved the music too at the beginning, and during the game. For the sale price at under 4 bucks for the game and DLC's, how can you go wrong. If it was 10 or 15 bucks I'd still been happy. I give it 2 thumbs up!			"

												Please for the love of all things good,DO NOT GET THIS GAMEWhat is bad about this game:1) The controls; mouse to steer (it is impossible) the slightest movement and your spaceships doing loop da loops quicker than you can say loop da loop.2) the cut scenes and dialog; i come back from a mission where you have to destroy THREE fleets of Nazi's which I do with surprising ease, and in comes a cut scene where the sodding commander is having lunch and asks if it was ""alright""; I have just killed tens of Germans on a death defying mission where the odds were against me and you asking if it was ""alright""!!! WTF.3)  The stereotyping; throughout the game there is continuous stereotyping, calling the Australian spaceship f****** DUNDEE-O-1, Australians know other words than DUNDEE like IDIOT'S. and when you go to speak to the german woman who is helping you, what does she look like? oh yes.. like you average stereotype german (google images will give some indication).4) not all German’s are peace-hating, beard wearing idiots who have stupid long names and talk about how there grandfathers would be proud; when the game tells you to try and negotiate with the German commander who’s called studflandasautotecnan poplestout Himmler (something like that) and is an angry old man with a white Hitler moustache in Nazi uniform. We can all guess what happens next..... HE SAYS NIEN, NIEN and NIEN again (basically). To be fair there would not be much of a game if he said yes, but still have some more surprise. What’s good about the game:1) You can nick energy from different parts of the ship to supply different parts of the ship2) You can delete it from your libraryConclusionIt is time i will never get back, so please DO NOT GET THIS GAME get KSP instead!

												Ouch... this is a game that seems to have a too big budget for making videos and not enough money for development.The controls are not well designed... Using the mouse to move your space fighter as well as doing mission log and other stuff is a bad bad idea that can almost lead to barfing due to uncontrollable spinning.  That is said, after watching bunches of stupid videos (trying to be in line with the movie with a shortened name than this game), you die again stupidly because of those poor controls... The game is not playable as is... and that is probably too bad because the game had some potential for anyone that like the wing commander series.  "

												Madam President Palin-lookalike is back.And so are the Nazis to take over the earth using their spaceships to invade the planet.Your mission is a simple one...Kill all the Nazis... That's it.But that is easier said than done, as you are just a simple pilot, with a crappy little vessel of your own.Some of the characters you have come to love from the movie are back.The humor that made the movie successful is back as well, but there are a few misses from time to time.The audio is great, and the graphics are very well done, but not the greatest.The cut scenes are of good quality, and for the most part, funny, and entertaining.They could've worked on the combat mechanics a little more.The controls can be sensitive, and the aim is not the most accurate.All and all, it is a fun, and humorous game to play, that I would recommend you get on special, if possible.Don't take my word for it, and check out my video by clicking on the link.

												Iron Sky: Invasion, could be best summed up in the phrase 'wasted potential.' At it's core, it's an arcadey space shooter. You fly around in space while aimiing your cursor at painted targets. What stands out about the game is the  various, neat, little systems it incorporates. A large map covering the space between the Earth and Moon is filled with various space stations and allied ships. Enemeis are marked as well, travelling in groups. Quests dot the map and while some are critical path, others are completely optional. Ships travel in real time, meaning that while you're completing one mission, a seperate quest may have passed by, or a set of enemy ships may have made their way closer to Earth.Reminiscent of X-Wing, shields, weapons and engines can draw off each other, giving combat a little depth. It's deepened as well by how you can individually target cannons or engines on ships, wearing them down in chunks instead of slowly draining them with imprecise fire. Heavier fighters have weak spots, and the game has no fixed plane, allowing you to flay around in any direction you want and line yourself up to take those weaker points.What drags the game down is the repetitive nature of the game. Once you know how to approach a situation, combat becomes rote as you first target the light ships then start chipping at the bigger ones. I only ran into one or two scenarios where I was genuinely engaged in executing a strategy.While it's novel that they used the actors from the movie for unique in-game FMVs, the acting is unbearable. It's dull and unfunny and the game's plot is lifeless as well. The mission videos are also badly timed, as it seems they were recorded at a different time than when the game's voice actor recorded his.It's evident that someone at the development studio cared about this game, which makes it stand out a bit amongst terrible movie tie-in games. It's not enough to rescue it though. That said, I would be genuinely interested in seeing Reality Pump further develop the ideas laid down in this game; there's some genuinely talented designer(s) over there and they deserve the chance to make a great game.

I won't even touch the fact your only real ship looks like a satellite collided with a giant alien anal probe, instead I would just list some better things to do with your time:-Go for a city walk down allyways and poke yourself with every random needle you see in the streets.-Clean a toilet with only your tongue-Kiss a poisonous Reptile-Stab your right leg with a rusty fork. Do not get a tetnis shot.-Play ET on the AtariThese activities may prove to be much more enjoyable, and at a lower cost.			"

												Do yourself a huge favor, never buy this game. The actors are terrible, i only got 10 minutes into the game before i realized that it would be nothing better than a cheap game with nothing good about it. I couldn't find any tutorials, or controls, I didn't know what my missions were, the story line (if you could call it that) was obviously written by a two and a half year old blind child eating glue while hes doing it. Put in short, this game will do nothing more than dissapoint you if you buy it at full price. with a 90% off coupon, maybe, but i would still reccomend the binding of isaac for that cheap rather than this.

												In the near future, mankind faces the greatest threat to its posterity ever in recorded history: an invading Nazi horde, reborn in the depths of space! An armada of Fourth Reich ships, built in secret at a hidden base on the moon, descends upon the Earth to rain terror and destruction. But this is not done without resistance. A cadre of crack space pilots have stepped forth to defend Mother Earth from becoming the new Fatherland of this twisted regime. A lone pilot, entering the hangar to see three state-of-the-art, prototypes ships awaiting him, knows he is the only one who can save Planet Earth. It is up to him and his brothers in arms to ensure that humanity stays free of the yolk of Nazism for good and all... Set during the main conflict of the movie, “Iron Sky: Invasion” puts players in the cockpit of an advanced new starfighter, to test his or her might, flight and dogfighting skills against the forthcoming Blitzkrieg-on-high. The main objectives are to defend Earth and its space installations from enemy attacks, blast as many Nazi ships into oblivion as humanly possible, collect and skillfully manage necessary resources, and make it alive to the final confrontation… where the ultimate secret weapon of the Fourth Reich awaits those foolishly brave enough to take up the hammer and chisel of heroism and attempt to carve their names onto the tablets of history.

												Hello ladies and gentlemen, Boys and girls are you looking for a patriotic nazi killing space warmachie game! WELL CONGRATULATIONS, Iron Sky :Invasion offers NONE of this (except for nazi killing). The graphics are well designed, the soundtrack is pretty cool and the cutscenes are decent, sure. But what ruined it for me was the actual gameplay itself...LIKE WTF! You just go around on long missions travelling into a dark abyss of space and then find out that your in the middle of no where. You'll find out you're using the fast travel option more frequently than you are playing the game.The atmosphere in space really has no variety at all and feels really dull and empty.This game is a piece of crap avoid it at all costs....

												Biff Benedict Pocoroba (born July 25, 1953 in Burbank, California) is a former Major League Baseball catcher, who also played a few games at third base. He was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 17th round of the 1971 amateur draft.As a rookie, Pocoroba got attention during spring training in 1975 by throwing out 11 straight would-be base stealers. [1] He made his major-league baseball debut on April 25, 1975, as a defensive replacement in the Braves' 5–3 loss to the San Diego Padres at San Diego.His best season was in 1977 when he achieved career-highs with 123 games, a Batting average of .290, 8 home runs, 24 doubles, and 44 runs batted in. In 1978, he made the National League All-Star team, finishing the season with a .242 batting average, 6 home runs, and 34 RBI in 92 games. A torn Rotator cuff injury slowed his career [2] and he played his last game on April 20, 1984, at the age of 30.			"

												Ever wanted to fight against the evil Nazis in space?Well then Iron Sky Invasion is what you are looking for.Based on the corny Finnish comedy sci-fi movie Iron Sky, you play as a brave pilot who has to fight against the huge armada of Nazi spacecrafts that are heading towards the earth, after you tried to negotiate peace with them of course.Of course, you're not alone as there are allied spacecrafts that will assist you in the battles that await you.You can also gather up scrap either left by the destroyed Nazi spacecraft or just floating around in space that you then can use to upgrade all the ships' abilities.And if you've seen the movie, then you won't be expecting a serious plot here as it doesn't take itself seriously, especially with the design of some of the Nazi spacecrafts.

												If you love the movie and space shooters, and you don't mind games crashing while you try to exit them, or click on leaderboard related buttons, don't mind achievement systems not working properly, etc, then this game is for you!Actually, that's not quite fair. The game is addictive, true to the movie and fun as hell. You get to fly several spacecraft that look like they could have existed today in an epic battle against the return of the Nazi threat in a game that has stunning graphics (though those get old real fast), includes subsystem targetting (a must that seem to appear more and more these days), multiple weapons and upgradable systems, and with the expansions allow you to play on your own with no story line and control allied fleets as well as play as Nazi in saucer that seems to fall apart at the first sign of trouble.The biggest problems include crashes while trying to quit, leaderboard options that don't stop looking for a non-existant leaderboard and seemingly crash the game THAT way and buggy achievements (to say the least. Played out the game, which requires you to fly the canadian bomber: Canadian handshake achievement not ticked...). Add to that in-flight briefings that completely disrupt the gameplay (as funny as they may be) and WILL cause your near death experience you would do best to wait for discounts.Still a recommendation is in order I think, judging from the time I've been playing it for the last 3 days ;-)			"

												This game had great potential. The story is great and it has everything needed for a great space shooter.Now what went wrong? Well, most of it.My first problem was that my joystick did not work. What kind of dimwit skips joystick support in a space shooter??Now, it does have support for the Xbox controller for those of you that has one of those.What else is wrong with the game?Well, the acting is the worst I have ever seen in a game of movie ever, bar none. It is painful to watch.I was kind of hoping one actor would do something right, but alas.The only thing that really shines in the game is the two cutscenes from the movie. Almost gave me goose bumps.The only part of the game ""worth"" playing is the invasion, the orignial story. It is the only one that has some kind of narrative.The two DLC:s I got with the game was not what I consider DLC at all. They are just minigames based on the game.The first one lets you fight all crooks in a map and suddenly without any warning it just says ""Victory"" when you have killed them all.The second DLC was the only one I did not finish so far and that is because the only ""mission"" is to survive for 20 minutes in a huge battle, well, technically it is protecting zeppelins.I got this game at a 80% sale and I still do not recommed it. Sure if you get it for 1 Euro, maybe, but there are way way better space shooters out there.Too bad really for I really like the story of the move and think it would be great in a game.			"

This is, there is a big map where you can in real time choose where to warpthis is fundamental, as you are expected to protect earth while completing your main objectivesthere are side quests too, but they require you to stop by a space station (warp close to it is enough) to start the dialogue with each nation, so if you don't stop by them you'll miss out thoseEDIT:after reading many negative reviews, let me make some points staright- upgrades are ""expensive"": well, they are at mission 1, but trust me, once you get doing missions and collecting salvage (they sell at a fairly low price, but their drop rate increases sharply in o time, and big vessels drop from 3 toup to 15, so well, there's that), there is no problem. After long battles which happen to be a mission objective you'll end up with more than enough to buy a few (maybe 4 or 5) upgrades. Considering that you have 2 ""full time"" ships (the rest being temporary for certain chapters), i think that's pretty fair- combat is difficult: as i said, the game is not easy enough taht you can just stay stationary and shoot enemies. It requires you to keep a good micro on your energy, and transfer energy from engines to weapons or shield or from weapons to shields, or whatever you need, all the time. If you think you got blown up ""for no reason"", let me iluminate you (let this be word of advice): capital ships, frigates, and some fighters shoot missiles. Some are guided, which you can dismiss with flares(kepp an eye on the count, they are limited and you need to recharge them at a station or with an ammo box). But some are not guided, and these are the most dangerous, because there is no warning that they are coming. Most of the time they will blown up most of your shield and hull, and if you happen to be in a fight with already low shields and/or hull, well, bad news my friend. Remember, always keep an eye out on capital ships BIG cannons, they do very high damage too, so you should prioritize them before attempting to destroy the rest of the subsystems			"

												Brilliant! Picked it up for £2 + all DLC today and have put about an hour in so far, on and off over the course of the day and I really can't recommend it enough.It's not Elite Dangerous, it's not deep, but it is hilarious, over the top and pure fun. I'm sure it will get repetitive, but this is not made for long stretches. "

												Iron Sky: Invasion really captured the feel of the film. The gameplay and humour had me gripped from the get go and the reasons behind some of the side missions had me laughing and asking myself ""Why me?"" I does a great job in expanding the story, ever so slightly, and actually protecting the Earth from the Fourth Reich had me feeling important.			"

												Hi, if you are old enough to know Tie-Fighters  and you loved this Star Wars game than you will enjoy Iron Sky pretty much, and this is guaranteed-guarandamn-teed.But be careful, if you playing it with the mouse and keyboard it will be terrible, so just get an Xbox 360 Controller and you will have some real fun. Highly recommended at all !			"

												First time I played a space genre game and  I kinda like it. It's not that detailed, the missions are the typical, shoot this and that. But that is where it captured me actually. I like the simplicity of it and I guess  anything that involves space ships and shooting asteroids is always fun. The graphics is pretty decent and the soundtrack is pretty intriguing. Intriguing in the sense that they incorporated a ""space-like"" theme on it, throw in a couple of beats and dub step mixes. It's actually pretty decent in the ears. The missions are pretty absurd sometimes but overall it's ok, I like the simplicity. The cutscenes, well, not full cutscenes but you'll get like a comm interface where you'll get your missions from live actors are pretty well acted. Actors looks like they know the characters they are portraying and they look like they enjoyed it. The game overall is more aimed to fun and not of a space sim not saying that space sims ain't fun. If you like space ships, and shooting without getting into a simulator-ish theme. And if you're a fan of the Iron Sky movie, then this is a game you must check out.			"

												Deep down i know this is not a great game. But as a Wing Commander enthusiast I love shooting space ships WC style. Only real downsides are that I keep lifting up my mouse trying to get on some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s tail and the wait before a victim explodes. If I don’t wait for it and it drops some loot I start lifting my mouse again to turn around.-	You like Wing Commander? Buy it!-	You don’t like Wing Commander?

												It is not necessary to have seen the movie to enjoy this game.  The idea of the movie was kinda cool but was poorly executed.  This game makes up for that a bit.  Personally, I found this game much more enjoyable than the movie.  There are numerous fmv style messages that your character receives throughout the game and they reminded me of some the early 90s fmv games.  I bought the game for a laugh (it was on sale with all dlc for $3) and was not disappointed.  The game plays very much like the old Wing Commander games.  If you're looking for a fun little space sim type game or just want to blast off and defend the Earth from the ""Space Nazi"" invasion then give it a go.			"

												If you are looking for a hyper real space flight sim, this is not it.  If you are looking for a fun space arcade game, then this is for you.  It is well done and plays smoothly, the controls are simple and easy to learn and it is a blast to play.  It is based off of a movie but it is not required to see it unless you want background information and context of the game.  The game is relatively short, you can finish in a few hours so don't expect days long play to get through it.  The DLC is fun and adds a couple missions to extend your playtime including one that lets you play as the Nazis.  So if you just want a quick arcade style space shooter that is fun to play, look no further.			"

												With the debut of Star Citizen, I was reminded of this game which is seriously kick♥♥♥♥♥(especially if you love sci-fi space stuff). Flying the space ship is intuitive and feels 'real', upgrade system is nice, killing stuff is nice, navigation is nice. Basically everything you could wish for gameplay-wise. HOWEVER, what this game lacks is the ability to play co-op, and more of an 'open galaxy' to explore... I wish it had more options to scavenge and travel. However this isn't what the game is 'about' so it is understandable, but disappointing. This game could've been so much better.Also the story line is... there aren't any words for it really... the webcam conversations you have with the President and so forth are extremely cheesy and don't fit the atmosphere of the game at all. Overall... this is a decent game for fulfilling those star-fight cravings.			"

												This game is not a masterpiece by any means but it doesn't need to be. It's tongue in cheek style and simple gameplay which is more or less the same for this genre for decades works as intended. Gameplay is smooth, graphics are little empty even for a space simulator though. But it's still a fun shooter. Only negative thing I can mention is it has no multiplayer.			"

												It's not a bad game if you like trashy ski-fi movies (i.e. LEXX or movie the game based on) and simplistic dogfight sims, like TIE fighter. Only downsides I saw was  somewhat short plot story, relatively easy last battle and really..lack of joystic support in dogfight game. After some practice (that involved memory how I played X-Wing using mouse only before I fetched a joystick) it is manageable, but some nice things that could be possible in combat are just out of reach			"

												This game had great potential. The story is great and it has everything needed for a great space shooter.Now what went wrong? Well, most of it.My first problem was that my joystick did not work. What kind of dimwit skips joystick support in a space shooter??Now, it does have support for the Xbox controller for those of you that has one of those.What else is wrong with the game?Well, the acting is the worst I have ever seen in a game of movie ever, bar none. It is painful to watch.I was kind of hoping one actor would do something right, but alas.The only thing that really shines in the game is the two cutscenes from the movie. Almost gave me goose bumps.The only part of the game ""worth"" playing is the invasion, the orignial story. It is the only one that has some kind of narrative.The two DLC:s I got with the game was not what I consider DLC at all. They are just minigames based on the game.The first one lets you fight all crooks in a map and suddenly without any warning it just says ""Victory"" when you have killed them all.The second DLC was the only one I did not finish so far and that is because the only ""mission"" is to survive for 20 minutes in a huge battle, well, technically it is protecting zeppelins.I got this game at a 80% sale and I still do not recommed it. Sure if you get it for 1 Euro, maybe, but there are way way better space shooters out there.Too bad really for I really like the story of the move and think it would be great in a game.			"
