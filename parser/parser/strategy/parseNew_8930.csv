												50 Hours into your latest save, all is going well. Only 3 leaders left Gandhi, Caesar and Washington.you draft an 'end game' plan in your mind, you will make friends with Gandhi (for obvious reasons he's chill) then procede to befriend Caesar.Then you will take out Washington because he is a♥♥♥♥♥♥and did not accept an open border agreement 3000 years prior HE MUST PAY. 20 turns later all is going to plan, we are now on Washingtons doorstep, Gandhi and Caesar appear to love and probably fear your superpower nation. All we need to do is eliminate the pesky Americans and ith all our military now on American soil this should not take long.Then after the swift invasion of America we will make a vote for world peace at the U.N (in rome of course) with our new found Indian and Roman brethren it is a sure win!But all of a sudden the distant droning of nuclear sirens start, quickly they become louder and louder, ""what is this!?"" you think to yourself, a false alarm? You shrug it off maybe Caesae bombing a city state.The game pauses... Gandhi appears on the screen, with a sinister grin he shouts ""WAR"" in your face. Only seconds after you see a gut wrenching sight. The camera focuses on a nuclear submarine stationed just off the coast of your pride and joy, the capital of your glorious nation.You then hear a rumble, just seconds after a nuclear warhead emerges from the previously hidden submarine, you realise it is too late... you can only watch as the missle closes in. As your city goes up in a giant cloud there are short lived screams from your beloved people, then silence. Before what had just occurred had sunk in, before you could make rescue efforts to save your much loved citizens the  humming of quiet engines fall upon your ears. Suddenly countless 'stealth bombers' appear seemingly out of no where, soon the sky is blackened by planes, the game falls almost silent only the whistle of falling bombs remains. You faint from the shock of what is unfolding.You awake shortly after, Gandhi is still flattening what remains of your once prosperous empire, now with 'giant death robots' making the most of his seemingly never ending turn. As Gandhi clinically and relentlessly razes what's left of your broken nation all you can do is weep, your people hacked down in their prime and  your glorious nation so mighty just minutes before has just been been all but eliminated in 1 turn. Why oh why did you turn of autosave? did it really speed your game up? was it worth it?Ghandi is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, he acts like your friend but WILL nuke the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you if even the slightest oppurtunity presents itself. 10/10			"

												I am the peaceful nation of the Celts.We shall be the nation of religion, and of diplomacy.This went well; we ended up next to the Babylonians, and we expanded nicely in peace. However, I have always believed in ""dibs"", so I placed down Glasgow onto the land between us, to provide a little buffer. They seemed annoyed by this. A few warriors glared at each other across our borders for a few hundred years, but otherwise, nothing too bad happened.In order to spread our religion further (because we were known for our Confucian beliefs which helped us grow our borders and spread our religion faster), we begin to invest in boats. Soon we covered the oceans in missionaries, Inquisitors, and warriors to help defend our religious allies.Babylon was making friends with a local city state, Genoa. However, they were trying to spread Zoroastrianism; those heathens! Despite both our religions being known for their peace, we passive-aggressively sent missionary and Inquisitor to Genoa. Over the course of about 700 years, we had probably burned a few thousand people for swapping religions; those same Warriors had been given spears now, but they continue to glare at each other from across the borders.I offer Babylon some sugar for their spice; they wanted my sugar, iron, coal and all of my money. I then asked Germany if they wanted sugar for spice; they accepted.North of me, Rome had begun a war with France. Due to my time of peace and massive amounts of trade, I found myself with a huge amount of money. Everytime France and Rome made peace, I knew that Rome was beginning to look on my relatively peaceful country with greedy eyes. So I bought... I gifted many city states my religion and gold, and then I bought... gifted France and Germany enough money to declare with with Rome.While they fought, my Spearmen (now Musketmen) continued to glare with Babylon's, and we continued our 1500 year religious passive-aggression over Genoa. They said I was spying on them; I said I wouldn't. When my spies returned, I sent them back to Babylon. A squad of 5 Great Prophets charged into Babylon, converting left, right and centre. Babylon complained I was being a bit aggressive. I apologised. I then sent more missionaries to Babylon.I had now found every single Civilization; we decided to have a United Nations meeting in 1600A.D. I, as the host, gave everyone a single vote. Except myself. I gave myself 16, due to my popularity. I declared my religion to be the world religion. Every one opposed. I listened to their opinions, and then passed it anyway. When Rome got angry about this, I then paid France to declare war again. When Babylon got angry, I then paid Rome to declare war on them.My civilians were amazingly happy; hugely more than any other place. But because I was an Emperor, they declared me Declis the Terrible; despite my universal healthcare, happy citizens, peaceful religion, not a single war in my entire history and massive popularity in the word. My army consisted of mostly my friends, my city states, and my Musketmen (now Great War Infantry) continued to glare at the Babylonian Great War Infantry, after 2000+ years. A great duty to my nation, their descendants shall continue to frown at the Babylonians until the civilizations of the world fall.Eventually we reached a grand United Nations meeting; I sat on one side of the chamber with my 12 City State friends, and the other 7 nations glared at me from the other side. I said that the People's Confucian Republican Empire of Scotland was the best nation in the world.They all voted against me. I smiled, and then declared I won anyway.Democracy is overrated. Freedom of religion only applies to my religion. I don't need to be stronger when I'm more popular (and my people are probably more beautiful). And if you don't like me, I'll pay your best friend to backstab you.Through this, I came to understand American foreign policy. So Civilization is if nothing else, an educational tool.			"

												Civilization V is the thinking man's game. It doesn't require lightning reflexes, speed or precision, however it is probably one of the most complex games ever created.You're able to pick one of many civilizations to guide from 4000BC to the Present, allowing you to shape their culture, military and economic structure among others. You control everything, from where to build a city, how you allocate resources, scientific research, religion, espionage, tourism, corporations, and more.The game has an extremely intricate diplomacy system as well which allows for you to befriend or antagonize the other civilizations. There are multiple ways to win a game, allowing for multiple play-styles.As someone who has been playing the Civilization games for over 20 years, I strongly recommend Civilization V with all of its DLC.Civilization V has also made our list for the top 35 games of the generation. To see where it ranks, here's the video:

												CAN'T.....STOP.....PLAYING......ARRRGGGG!!!!Very addictive and deep!  It has grown wonderfully over the years and has GREAT support from the Steam Workshop.  Endless replayability!If you are new to the series, have no worries.  Good ol' Sid will do you no wrong, as the tutorials will have you conquring Mongol Hordes and smacking down Washington's smarmyness in no time flat!  Hours will fly by and your social life WILL suffer!!  If you are a vetran of the series and have been holding out, check out the two expantion packs which add many interesting dynamics to gameplay easily making this the most exciting and in depth of the franchise.I've had several friends sit down at my screen and start a new game, dispite them groaning about it not being an action game or something like Candy Crush (We all know the types!).  Needless to say, coming back and seeing how they were doing 3+ hours later and noticing that they havn't changed position on their chair, has always been a moment that makes me smile.  I have spread the addiction!!!  Huzzah!Do yourself a favor.  Play this game.			"

												Having not a great deal of experience with previous Civilization games, I was expecting myself to find this installment of the series hard to get the hang of, imagining myself spending hours trying to work out how to start up a civilization that will ""stand the test of time"". Instead, I found the game to be extremely helpful and newbie-friendly. Like other strategy games, you learn the basics then gradually build up a better understanding of the game and its mechanics, feeling more and more like a pro with every minute gone by. After about four hours playing I felt pretty confident, but even today I am learning things I never knew or had any comprehension of in the game. The simplicity which has been introduced to help newcomers coupled with the fact that the game maintains the same look and feel with older generations is a really positive thing that was pulled off very well.The game offers serious levels of depth due to the vast number of playable races, multiple methods to seek victory and the ability to play on completely randomly generated maps every game, with available templates to choose from if so desired. I have only played a handful of games right to the very end since they can last for many days, especially if each session isn't particularly long. Every game feels very different to the next, providing this title with a lot of replayability.The AI is sometimes criticised but I think that it is well done in this game with a large range of difficulty levels to choose from, ranging from literally zero experience to the grandmaster level. They can often be somewhat unpredictable but I personally see that as a good thing, I mean, what's the point in playing such an in-depth strategic game like Civilization V when you can anticipate what the AI will most likely do? Part of the magic of this game is that it immerses you into the position of a leader, facing situations where you have to make decisions on the spot with no idea what your opponent is going to do.Overall this is a great game worthy of your money, but I would advise waiting for it to come on sale as it frequently does, it isn't the newest game in the world either.

When you attempt to fight back you are labeled a warmonger, and obviously the only way to stop getting warmonger penalties is to slaughter all those that oppose you right? If you destroy 1 civ might as well destroy them all because they will not let you live that down.

												Gandhi declares war on Bismarck's German Empire. Soon after, Gandhi strikes Berlin, Hamburg, and Essen with Nuclear Missiles.The Ottomans, concerned with Gandhi's warmongering, denounce the Indian leader.They soon lose their capital.Bismarck, his economy and army in ruins,  pleads for peace with the Indian Empire, but Gandhi will only stop with full annexation of the German Reich.An alliance of Poland, Gengis Khan's Mongolian Empire, and the Aztecs turn on Gandhi in hopes of stopping his rampage.Warsaw falls.Karakorum falls.Tenochtitlan falls.Gandhi reins supreme. The world is in his grasp. He is on the verge of doing what men, for thousands of years, have dreamed of: Conquering the world under one banner.But none of that matters, because the Babylonians have just won a science victory by launching a single little rocket into space. It makes too much sense.10/10, but be warned:Gandhi will find you.Gandhi will kill you.And GandhiAlwaysGetsHisKill.			"

												I can never forget that day.The day when my grandpa died.I was only 8.He called me to his bedside and whispered to me, in a voice feeble yet somewhat unsatisfied.He said to me, ""My lovely grandson, I have nothing to give you in this life, as I have been poor and unfortunate,""""Money and fortune, women and sex, lush and class, I can give you none.""I wasn't feeling any bit of dissapoint, as I knew very well of him, of his life, of his potential, of the legacy he could leave to his descendants.And then there was, as I remembered correctly, a short silence.""Except for this.""My hand was tightly grabbed and, the next thing I remembered, was a 4-GB-black-Kingston-flash-drive-like object being secretly put in my hand, so secretly that not even the people around me had noticed.""Finish my life's work."" Those were his last words.After years and years of attempting to figure out just what that only file in the flash drive was, here I was, sitting in front of my laptop, Civ 5 was released.The next thing happened can only explained by me as providence: I copied the file to civ 5 save folder, opened civ 5, attempted to load the file.It loaded.It was a Marathon game, on its 284th turn. There was only one city left, and it was surrounded by enemies' scouts.The city health bar was already depleted, and I had 23 workers that were, even the closest ones, at least ten tiles away from my city.........................................Years have passed.There is, like the beginning, only one city left.Except that one city, is the only one not owned by me.My right hand trembled as I reached the ""Annex the city"" button, never knowing the cause of the tremble being either years of non-stop playing, or the fact that I am now only one button away from fulfilling my grandfather's wish.I looked out the window, tears in both my eyes formed two vertical lines across my face.Noticed the image in the window, the reflection of yet another old man with eyeful of tears, crying, yet satisfied.I stared at the blue sky, whispered:""I finished your work, grandpa.""

												So finally nearly 600 hours in Civi V and finally I believe I can give it a fair review.So lets get the obv out of the way is Civi V good ? Yes otherwise I wouldn´t have spent 600 hours in it and still booting it up now and then.Civi V lacks nothing on graphics or gameplay, it is top of the line and there it is 100´s of mods for those who wishes to change their gameplay in anyway possible. Civi V is not as detailed or brutally hard as the former games in this installment, however that is a great thing in my eyes as it gets a lot of new players to test out the series that the rest of us have enjoyed for so many years.The DLC`s Gods & Kings and Brave New World adds a lot of the things we are use to from ealier series and is diffenetly worth getting for anyone who likes the more complex version of the Civi series, that beeing said the other DLC`s is mainly just new maps or new nations to play with and really only something you should pickup if you are a huge fan or on sale.So Civi is as it always have been, you start with a settler and one more unit and here you go form a nation that will stand the test of time. There is multiple ways to achive victory and it is important that you play to your nations strenghts and use your enemies weaknesses through the different time periods of our planet. This is classic Civi after all.Tho do not let it fool you, Civi is a game that takes a long time often 6+ hours pr map and often one nation is just gonna hate you more than anyone else, in my case it was Poland wich wanted to nuke and kill me no matter what, they did a good job sometimes too.All in all a great game and a great installment of the Civi series that brings a lot of new players and a lot of life into the series, so if you like complex games that takes time and patience then make sure you pick it up!

SID MEIER'S CIVILISATION V - Just one more turn?  || 9 || Score Comment   Graphics 8 Visuals are simple but pleasing, good textures on the landscape tiles, nicely detailed units with lots of variety, good animations and an intuitive unobtrusive UI.  Zooming in and out on units, cities and terrain allows you see all the little  details while also giving you the ability to see the ""big picture"" strategic view. Graphics are vastly improved from previous games in the series. If I had one wish I guess it would be to have your cities and their buildings represented better visually. Cities grow and spread with population and advance with technology/era and have several different styles depending on the nation you select, and the building of wonders will add the wonder to the area surrounding your city but it would be great to have further customisation of your cities so you could really make them your own. The Civilopedia (like an in game wiki) is a little difficult to navigate and while informative could use some work.  Audio 8 Game Music is relaxing and fitting, from the dawn of civilisation, the age of exploration or the grand age of empire building it just seems to work well and I very rarely feel the need to turn down the music volume (as I do with other games). The ambient sound is excellent, move your screen to a coastal area and you will hear the wash of the sea, select your boats and you will here the crack of oars or ring of their bell. The little touches and details like these really make the game a joy to play.  Gameplay 9 Civilisation is a turn based 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) game, a game of grand strategy & micromanagement, a game where the objective is to grown your civilisation and eventually conquer all through Technology, Culture, Diplomacy and Military might. This is by no means a simple game, it takes time to truly learn and fully appreciate but once you get into a game your hooked. Civilisation is by far the most addictive game (maybe with the exception of certain MMORGP's) out there. The ""just one more turn"" is a running joke because you will often find yourself planning on playing just one more turn to build something or win a battle and then you will look to the clock and find several hours have past. The start of the game is exciting, turns move quickly and you see your planning quickly realised, mid game you must continue your expansion and put in place what you will need to win. The only place where I feel this game falls down is late in the game, by this point sometimes there will be a clear winner, technology advancement will slow and your empire will often be so massive and units so numerous that just taking your turn can take quite a lot of time. Overall though gameplay is outstanding. The AI can be a little quirky at times but for the most part is challenging and tactically sound. Relationships between civilisations are all based on their predisposition and events which occur throughout the game and can therefore be somewhat predictable.   Story 8 The Story of history rewritten, the story of civilisation, so many details make up this game and so much background history on every aspect (via the civilopedia). The DLC add's on (amongst other things) quests which add to the story but in truth these add little to the game. The narrative is really what you make it, the interaction between the leaders of the other civilisations, all struggling for power, the alliances and conflicts mean there is very rarely a time of true peace or a dull moment.    Replayability 10 Fully customisable random maps, different scenarios, different civilisations and leaders. Make your own maps and scenarios, full integrated into steam workshop with hundreds of brilliant mods. It all adds up to a different experience each time and near infinite replayability.    Multiplayer 6 This is not an easy game to play multiplayer, the nature of the game means that you will all need a large amount of time to play a game through to completion, which may be problematic (especially with friends in different timezones or for people with connection issues). The most enjoyable aspect of multiplayer I found was the hotseat mode. In this mode you play locally and multiple players take the game in turns (like a boardgame), once again the time required to get near the end means you could be in for a very long (but very enjoyable) game.   Overall 9 While some purists will prefer the earlier Civ games in the series, I feel that Civ 5 (and especially with the main DLCs) is a worthy successor. It has the right level of difficulty and depth, much improved visuals and solid gameplay which will make you wonder where the hours went.  More reviews by Fancy FishAgree / Disagree?

												Germany.... America.... India.... Poland....Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when India attacked. Only the Polish, masters of all four victory types, could stop them. But when the world needed them most, they vanished.A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered a new Polish nation, lead by a king named Casimir III. And although his domination skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.But I believe, Poland can save the world.			"

First of all, you should definitely buy the Complete Edition of Civilization V to fully enjoy the game!The game has great graphics, many improvements compared to previous Civilization games, but unfortunately it lacks some stuff that I miss, like the Palace and Throne Room. Fortunately, they can be brought back via  mods  :D I have always loved Civilization V's motto: ""Wait! Just... one... more... turn..."" and I can confirm you that it's true haha, I always play a few more turns after I beat the game :)All in all, it's an extraordinary game and I give it a solid 10 out of 10!~ ""I found Rome a city of bricks and left it a city of marble."" - Augustus Caesar ~			"

												Let me tell you a story folks, how I became the ruler of the world, by accident.I started a normal game as Bismarck, to get that sweet sweet bonus on barbarians. Everything goes normal, I meet caesar, the queen and the siamese♥♥♥♥♥♥ you'll see later why I call him a♥♥♥♥♥♥ He offers me to become allies, I, the friendly chancellor that I am accept, not knowing what the siamese had in store for me. Few decades later the siamese start a war against caesar, he expects me to join in and help against caesar, since I had problems with caesar before(That♥♥♥♥♥♥was ♥♥♥♥♥ing about my cities being too close to his borders...I saved so many settlers of his godd*amnit, be thankful!) I joined in. I steamroll caesar and capture every city. After that everything continues going fine,...until the japanese declared war on me and the siamese. Steamrolled the japanese. Following countries to perish is england. After this, world peace was achieved, or so I thought. How wrong I was. Around 1930 the siamese declare war on me, my allies that I deeply trusted used me to wipe the earth clean to get rid of enemies. He uses his nuke I gifted him on my nearest city, (rip Hamburg), so i start a fully blown blitzkrieg and get rid of him. Might've nuked some of his cities. After the war was over I looked at the ruins of what once was europe, asia and africa. Suddenly, another civilization pops up. Montezuma. He was stuck in the medieval age on the american continent. I am now taking care of him and his people so they can become a great civilization. I'll still be the greatest tho, science win wohoo! Great game to create stories, 10/10. Best played with friends.

												Civilization V: Complete Edition is an excellent 4X strategy game developed by Firaxis Games and published by 2K Games. The base game was released in September 2010. As a new fan to the Civilization series I was hesitant prior to purchasing this game but having done so, I adore this game. The idea is you build your nation with buildings, build military, conduct diplomacy with other nation states to provide advantage, and research technologies to improve your capabilities. Excitement surrounds this game because as the game progresses the landscape alters, as a nation that is strong early game may be weak in the late game. This review will discuss the gameplay mechanics in regards to strategy and the notable features within the complete edition.I found it fairly easy to learn the basics of Civilization V, however the difficult aspect was the strategy to building your empire. The overall theme is strategy and positioning. For instance, all 43 nations have a different unique ability, unit, and building. Germany's unique abilities is that it can destroy barbarian encampments with a 67% chance that they join your nation. This strategic component allows you to play each nation as you see fit because if you want to play as a strong economy you can, if you want to be an aggressive militaristic nation you can. All actions such as building a unit or building or moving your unit has consequences. For example, a monument can provide a culture boost but cost one gold per turn to maintain. A unit on a hill can defend better than on flat terrain, and sending your melee units to attack a city can have disastrous outcomes. Therefore, strategy is crucial and I love the strategy and positioning theme within this game because it does not matter if the enemy has six units compared to your two, you use strategy to win. Furthermore, the game is not overly complex and I can testify because as a new player to the Civ series I understood the basics of the game within a few hours and this is because of the easy, simple, and user-friendly interface. The interface does not overload you with information, instead provides the most important information on the screen and all other information through buttons on the top right of the screen. Lastly, the map is split into hexagon tiles. You form cities on tiles and through cities produce workers. These workers build on tiles connected to your nation which they can build quarries, mines, farms, and so forth that contribute to your resource intake that I will mention in a moment and your overall productivity and growth of individual cities.The game incorporates an abundance of features. As said above, the game utilises research and diplomacy. Research is straight-forward as the more you research the quicker you progress into the following era. You open the research screen and research a technology. Each technology has up to five unlock options, for instance, iron working can unlock swordsman and other things. Researching technologies require science that can be gained through diplomacy with other nations, trade and buildings. Diplomacy allows you to talk with another nation or city state which means you can trade resources, exchange embassies, become friends, and so forth - there are a ton of various options. Speaking of city states, these are independent small political entities that can provide benefits to your nation in return for gifts or protecting them, basically helping them. Resources play an important role in Civ V because strategic resources help your nation build things that require those resources and luxury resources increase your happiness and trade opportunities, which both are significant in the growth of your nation. For instance, building a quarry on a marble tile allows you consume one marble which helps improve your happiness. Similarly, if you build a mine on an iron tile it allows you to build things like swordsman, which otherwise could not be built without it. Resources are important because they allow your economy to function by building things that require a particular resource. Furthermore, happiness is pivotal because the happier your nation is the more chance a golden age occurs, which is a boost in all productivity levels. If your nation is at minus ten happiness your cities revolt. Lastly, a social policy provides bonuses to your nation and social policies are split into different tiers that aim for different things. For instance, you can use a social policy to improve your military or your happiness and so forth, reflecting the strategic part of the game.So two paragraphs of pure information and not much analysis. Well, all these features complement the other and add so much depth into the game. It is not a basic game, rather it's an easy to learn and depth game with tons of content. Nation placement changes with each game so there is always variety and lasting appeal within Civilization V. Another strategic element is within nation relations because I have been attacked countless times by enemy AI that I was friendly towards and it represents the saying of 'don't trust anyone'. In other words to summarise the 'circle' of features, all features are balanced and make for an extremely enjoyable experience because it all depends on the strengths of your nation. For instance, if I am Rome, I would research a social policy that improves my productivity and trade and research technologies that accompany this stance like a market.And to finish it off, the multiplayer portion of the game is very stable and extremely fun.Civilization V: Complete Edition is a phenomenal game. I love the features, the gameplay, the map, and just the core mechanics complement the nature of the game. It promotes strategy through the strengths of a nation and your actions within the game depend on a variety of factors such as city and terrain, military and growth. The game features an abundance of nations to decide from, meaning the game has lasting appeal. Firaxis have really nailed down the core game and reinforced the factor you are running a nation to how you want to run it, but the idea is you must conquer the world in some way or form. I highly recommend this game.Ratings:Gameplay: 10/10Overall: 9.75/10Thanks for reading my review!

												/If you're new to Civlization, this is where to start. Everything is simplified for the better, even if you're new to stradegy, it has a lot of difficulty settings.This is one of the best, most complete stradegy games once you buy its 2 expansion packs, Gods & Kings + Brave New World (Not needed but recommended)There are 5 different types of victory, they are Cultural, Domination, Space misson, Time and Diplomatic. They are all fun to go for.This is a stragey with some thinking involved and a lot of map/game options and great mods are on the workshop, so you could end up with hundreds and hundreds of hours eventually withnout noticing.Basically, you start in anicents times and settle your first city with nothing, you have to then guide your Cilization to stand `The test of time` right through to 'da future!Only ONE Civilization can be victorious. So aim for victory ahead of everyone else.There is Multiplayer but I prefer not to stick to that 'due to people not finishing games.A standared game can last litterly a full day. Recommended to anyone who hasn't played Civlization.			"

""It's time I told the world of your sins."" - proclamation of denouncement, once a game Sid Meier's Civilization V is the latest game developed by Firaxis of the main Civilization series and one of the best examples of the 4X genre. Since release, many DLC have been released, but most attention goes to 2 expansion packs, Gods & Kings and Brave New World, each adding much needed content to the somewhat lacking base game.* GameplaySimilar to the previous titles in the series, V gives you the leading role of a civilization starting in 4000 BC with a Settler to found your first city and a military unit. From there, you must guide your civilization to glory using diplomacy, war, culture, trade, religion, science and espionage. Each civilization is based on a real world culture and appropriate advantages, unique units, buildings and so on. The goal of each game is to emerge supreme in one of 4 victory conditions: Diplomacy, Domination, Culture and Science. If neither is fulfilled by the year 2050, a Time victory is given to the civilization with most points. Opposing you are, depending on choice, from 1 to 15 rival civilizations with fairly decent AI, regardless of difficulty, although they sometimes make questionable choices. Strategy and tactics are thus important, whether is it in city placement, unit position or expanding cultural options. In each game, several resources have to be taken care of:  Gold (pays for the upkeep, instant building, as bribe in diplomacy)  Happiness (prevents revolts and enables Golden Ages)  Strategic resources (allows powerful units and buildings)  Culture (for Social Policies that give empire-wide boosts, further expanded with Ideologies) All of this leads to many hours spent in intricate detail planning of synergies. And of course, if you ever get stuck on a question, the ingame Civilopedia is a vast source of information laced with many sarcastic remarks.*  Expansions, scenarios and custom contentAs mentioned, many DLC have been released for V, ranging from new civilizations, maps, scenarios and game overhauls (Gods & Kings and Brave New World). Personally, I believe having both expansions and new civilizations adding content are a must for anyone looking to invest a significant amount of time in the game, although the map packs are fairly redundant and can be downloaded for free from the Steam Workshop. There are also many scenarios based on historic events, with many changes from a regular game and there are also many mods for download, ranging from simple UI changes to adding completely new content and civilizations (often fictional).* Closing commentsSid Meier’s Civilization V is an excellent game which offers many hours of enjoyable gameplay, but I recommend having most DLC’s as the base game is lacking in content. However, prices are rather high, thus it is best to wait for a sale. The game also offers at least 4 hours of beautiful made-for-the-game soundtrack. A must-have game for anyone who has an interest in history, strategy and micromanagement and a lot better than Beyond Earth.			"

You need an excuse (I couldn't go to your wedding man, I was denounced by Gandhi and I had to form allegiances with the Huns to protect myself!)4. You want to say ""I wish I could play with Hitler"" without getting several concerning calls from a nazi fetish groupDO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF:1. You plan on going to the gym2. You wanted to go out tonight3. You have homework4. You want to maintatin your relationship with your family5. You want anything beyond the walls of your room to acknowledge your existence6.

												This game is one of a kind. Well, along with Civilizations 1, II, III, and IV.If you enjoyed other Civilizations games, it's highly likely you will enjoy this one as well.There are a few things that are notably different from other versions of Civilizations. The most obvious is the units per tile restrictions. In Civ 5, there is only allowed 1 unit type per tile, meaning only 1 combat unit can be on any tile. In some ways it's better, in some it's worse, but it does lend itself to strategy of positioning of your army being much more important than in earlier versions.Another is that cities, when attacked, take damage themselves instead of any unit defending. I believe it's related to the 1 unit type per tile, because it would be odd if you only had to kill one unit to take a city.These two differences from earlier versions does give the game a different feel from earlier versions, but it does still feel much more similar to Civilizations than it does to a game like Colonization/Civ4Col, although not that it would be a bad thing if it was similar to Colonization, another great Sid Meier game.Overall I highly recommend it to anyone considering, just make sure you have time to play because you will be hooked.

												My civ was only 6000 years old. I loved Gandhi so much, I had traded all my resources to him. I prayed to Gandhi every night before bed, thanking him for the civ I had been given. Gandhi is love I said, Gandhi is life. Russia hears me and publicly denounces me. I knew he was just jealous, of my devotion to Gandhi. I declared war on him, he attacks me and forces me to sign a peace treaty. I'm crying now, and my city is hurt. I lay in defeat and its really cold. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch my civ. Its Gandhi. I'm so happy. He whispers to me: ""this is my land."" He grabs me with his powerful Indian army, and puts me on my hands and knees. I'm ready. I spread my army for Gandhi. He penetrates my border. It hurts so much, but I do it for Gandhi. I can feel my army dying, as my eyes start to water. I push against his force. I want to please Gandhi. He roars a mighty roar, as he fills my civ with his nukes. Russia walks in. Gandhi looks him straight in the eye, and says ""It's all fallout now."" Gandhi waves through my borders. Gandhi is love, Gandhi is life.			"

												What else to say than: ""Just... One... More... Turn...""The legendary series/franchise/time-consuming-void, that is Civilization, continues to conquer the hearts of all us would-be world leaders who lacks the ambition, and are too lazy, to strive for power outside of the digital realm.To ascertain whether or not to play Civilization, there is really only one question you need ask yourself:             ""How many days off can i afford before getting fired?"" If the answer is below five, you should probably leave now. I'm serious. Leave!Anyhow. If you have never before played Civilization, you owe it to yourself to try it. You will not regret it. (except for when you get fired, of course.)It is simply awe-inspiringly brilliant. An epic journey through history. Rewriting history.			"

												Too bad I'm not completely fluent in any other languages yet, because English certainly doesn't have the words to describe how epic this game is. I'm currently playing my bazillionth game, and I've played nearly 750 hours, but every game still feels like a brand new experience. The UI is probably the most user-friendly in any game ever, and the music is just plain awesome, plus every game is randomly generated. There's a demo; download it and you'll see what I mean. So when you DO get hooked, and you DO dish out 80 bucks for the Gold edition plus Brave New World (as you should!), don't get upset when you start failing your classes or missing work because you played all night and didn't even notice, because trust me, your time is better spent here.

												I'd appreciate it if you checked out my blog, where I do reviews, giveaways, and more:https://gandhigaming.wordpress.com/*NOTE: This review includes the Brave New World add-on, it makes the game alot better. Trust me!*Alexander the Great (Greece) reviews the components needed to make the Spaceship. He notices that he needs the engine, but doesn't have the proper technology to obtain this piece for a Scientific victory. Angered at this, he asks his remaining friends for some research agreements to get the tech he needs to win. He gets two from his friends, Ramkhamhaeng (Did I spell that right? Anyway, Siam) and also Pedro II (Brazil) but it wouldn't go into effect for about 30 turns. Alex just groans and begins to switch up his productions and his science so he can aim toward getting that engine. Oda Nobunaga (Japan) then begins to take down Ramesses II's (Egypt) last city, which was his capital. Siam gets angered by seeing that Oda is taking down all of their allies, and attempts to charge at him. Japan was able to sweep his army and destroyed all of his cities with his deadly ability where wounded units still fight at full strength. Pedro II sends a Spy to Oda's capital to see where he will strike next: Him or Alex. Alex and Pedro set up some defenses and attempt to build a wall to defend themself from this unstoppable force. Oda decides to hit Pedro first, and slowly takes down all of his cities, one by one, and took down Rio de Janeiro. The Greek forces began to hold the enemy Marines and Paratroopers off. After a successful ambush by an XCOM Unit, Alexander had some time to finish up the engine technology. The next turn, Sparta and all of the other cities besides Athens were destroyed by Oda's unstoppable force. However, right when Oda was about to charge in and destroy Greece, both Research Agreements were used and got the technology needed. Alex quickly moved all his units away from Athens and used his remaining gold to purchase the engine. It was pricey, but he was able to attach it to the Spaceship. Japanese units were closing in fast, and the Greek soldiers started dying quickly, but right when the artillery was about to fire, they all see the glorius sight of a spaceship flying in the sky and going to space. Oda looks at the spaceship and starts yelling in defeat, knowing that he lost to Greece with a Scientific victory, right when they were about to get a Domination victory.In Civilization V, or Civ, those events are actually pretty common. It takes a little while to get used to, but once you get into it, it becomes very addictive to the point you haven't slept in days. Yep, days. My head is pretty rotten right now from playing this, but god, you NEED this game. If you got to purchase any game on Steam for free, make it this. Just buy it. You WILL love it, and I guarantee it. Even if the AI can be annoying... But yeah, just friggin BUY IT. Why are you still reading this!? Why haven't bought this game yet? Gandhi is going to NUKE YOU SO HARD, he could just- *whack*Hello, Gandhi here. You better buy this game or else I'm willing to nuke you and your cities. And your family. And your friends.

												Fireaxis has managed to pull off a fantastic game here - Civilization V has a very in-depth play system that is easy to understand for beginners, and yet complex enough to keep even the most advanced user thinking. The turn-based system is quite fair, though a little bit does rely on luck if you're playing multiplayer (Who gets to host is 1st player, and thus gets ""Priority"" on wonders, so if both you and player 1 have 1 turn left on The Great Library, Player 1 will get it first), but I personally play a lot of singleplayer. The bot difficulty level increases at a high rate as you go up - 1 is basically playing against yourself, 2 may be challenging for someone learning the game, 3 is an ok difficulty, though still a bit easy, 4 is the equivalent of a moderately skilled human player, and 5 has the tactic of a skilled player, plus extra science/food/production, so I personally play on level 4. I won't go into details about levels 6-8, because I've never tried them, nor do I plan to in the near future.The UI is quite user-friendly - If there is an action that needs to be done, it will show up in the lower-right corner just above the minimap. There are 4 ""advisors"" that help new players understand what to build, and how it will benefit them, as well as whether or not to attack an enemy unit, and even who you may stand a chance against in a total war!Spies also add a new level of strategy to the game, as you must decide whether you will try to steal technology from other people, or if you will protect your own technology. Then you add spy promotions, in which Recruits will almost always be beaten by Agents, who will almost always be beaten by Special Agents. By changing spies around that have different promotions, you can achieve a different level of defense and offense in espionage. For example, if you want to steal from a country that has lots of tech, but you just want intrigue about another nation that has little tech, you can send your Special Agent over to the country that has lots of tech, and your Recruit to the other nation.Overall, this is a really fun game, the only drawback is it's price, but if it ever goes on sale, it is definitely worth picking up if you're into strategy games.

												Germany.... America.... India.... Poland....Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when India attacked. Only the Polish, masters of all four victory types, could stop them. But when the world needed them most, they vanished.A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered a new Polish nation, lead by a king named Casimir III. And although his domination skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.But I believe, Poland can save the world. "

Well Civ V is for you.Been playing Civ since its first installment, and have enjoyed this game very much so. Although I wont brand this the best of its kind. I will say the game defintely polishes and adds things that were non-apparent in its previous installments. This game is for you if you enjoy city builders, and management.			"

 The following is a very Bias review, You may disagree Civ V, is the best Civilzation game Hands down.Civ VI cannot compete.Okay now let me explain.Civilization V is a balance of good and mediocre to make a relitivly good game. The barbarians may not be threatening but you will certainly want to get rid of them.Civilizations will attempt to backstab you or denounce you and cause you to want to slaughter them all.And the AI has a bit of a brain, being able to adapt and build nukes against you or you can even provoke a World War and have all AI try to murder you, I've won against this Various times. As Germany. Yes.The Mod support for this game is amazing as some modders like the modder of ""Future Worlds"" can add in amazing content to the game which makes it extremly better, fun, and all around more intersting to play.Now as for cons,Well I'm sorry to say but I just cant list an issue. They fixed every issue.You used to be able to steal all your friends cities if they sent you a trade deal, but they patched that.I just cant list a con.If you like strategy (preferably Turn Based) and Civilization, You'd be better off getting this over Civilization VI. As Civlization VI is a joke compared to this. But I'm sure the developers might, Enthisis on Might fix that.Im sorry for this bias review, I just find more content and fun in Civilization V over Civilization VI. But that may be due to the Patches and Various fixes. I still recommend this like someone would recommend Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 2 over any other call of duty. Its because some old games are just damn good.			"

												Nuked Japan while Germany watches, grabbing a hold of Rome as their precious ally turns into dust before their very eyes. Germany looks to Rome and asks them to push their Giant Death Robots towards my capital, dubbed ""Temple Prime (obvious reference)"". The robots march their way into a mountainous area where a wall of mountain protects several missile launcher platforms (MRLS basically) who launch a barrage at them. Rome pulls back the robots but then, what's this? An army of XCOM soldiers rip the poor robots to shreds.The robot survivor reported to Rome that Russia has taken over the middle-eastern regions and pushed toward Europe, with Rome being the meat shield of Germany. Caesar looks at his ally and goes ""Wait, what?"" and was suddenly silenced when a reign of nuclear warheads wipe out his only defending army. Cities tremble under Russian troops who then surround the German capital. Germany goes and askes if there can be peace. Catherine then gives out a ""lol nope"" then proceeds to demolish the capital with it's main army on the OTHER SIDE OF THE CONTINENT...Great game, nice AI, interesting terrain, awesome gameplay.			"

												I've done the 1000 hour mark today, it is time for a review now: This game is just fantastic. The game is easy to learn, but in the end it will surprise you with its complexity.I must not only pay attention to how I set up my cities before the war begins to rare luxury resources. I have to take care of my religion and culture, while Wonders of the World built and new technologies are explored. Incidentally, my population is dissatisfied and my neighbor is spying me. In the end, it's time for the atomic bomb! In addition, there are numerous scenarios, each with their own requirements. In short: With my previous 1000 hours play time, I'm not done yet.Please don't forget to rate my review if it was helpful ;)Edit May'15: I am playing with mods from SteamWorkshop now and ... I am suprised! I am using circa 100 mods which add new wonders, new units, new buildings, new resources, new religions and reliefs and new techs. Sometimes I don't want to play this game but it's too much fun. I really like it - I think I will hit the 1500 hours mark soon.Edit July'16: I hit the 1500 hours mark last month and I am still playing this awesome game. I am using more than 300 mods now to get a better gameplay. I don't need additional maps or civilizations I just want to get new wonders, units, buildings, religion reliefs, techs and resources. In 2016 they will publish Civilization VI, maybe the new version will stop me playing this.			"

Your friends and family will be wondering if you're still alive. Your dog will have died because you forgot to feed it. A week later you're still playing that marathon game against 11 other civilizations, trying to get the nukes before Gandhi does, researching faster than the Babyloniers, getting a better navy than Queen Elizabeth, not noticing that in the real world, outside your new overlords the alien race of s;jf;fgajwnr ncxas;laj have taken over. All your friends have died by now. Your family has been taken as slaves. But that's okay, cause you live in a brave new world now. You don't care about those wacky aliens. You're your own master of the world now. Why care, when you can play just one more turn.			"

												Well, what can I add to those 100,000 reviews? Nothing, I suppose.It' s one of the most addictive PC game ever. It's the best grand strategy in Steam and still better than Civilization VI.You'll like it for sure but don't forget about your family :-)They say you won't stop playing Civilization V until you want to stop playing.

												The first time i tried Civ at a friends place:The smooth start, followed by a rush of adrenaline and a wave of pleasant warmth washing over my body.The mouse trembles between my fingers and drops to the floor with a tink, rolling away from my feet as my eyes pull back into my head. Thoughts bounce around the inside of my skull at a madman’s pace. “You alright, man?” I hear somebody whispering behind me. They might as well be worlds away.For just an hour or two, I was God. And just like that, a cold snap of clarity whips across my consciousness and brings me back to the world of the living. My vision has not yet adjusted to the darkness of the room. A feeling of emptiness swallows me whole. “I..I want more.” Laughter echoes off the grimy stucco walls. “You’ll get another. Wait your turn, friend.” I am standing, opening the door, walking out of the room, but my body remains in that chair. A shell of myself will always be in that chair. As I passed through the doorway and was assaulted by the bright light of an Austrian afternoon, my friends greeted a ghost and escorted him to their car. “How was it man? Is it is crazy as they say? Are you going to try it again? You’re wild dude!” I just stare off into the distance, and think about the sound that mouse made when it hit the ground. Tink. I wish I could go back there and pick it up.Civ, not even once.			"

												To celebrate the release of Civilization VI I decided to make a review on Civilization V. This is by far my favourite game, maybe Civilization VI may top it, if you don't have this gem yet in your steam library just buy it. Sale or no Sale it's worth every penny and even in bundle it's way cheaper than it supposed to be. If you get 'bored' with the  classical game you can always install the many mods from this awesome mod community. They really are inventive and you can almost find a mod for every feature that you would come up with.The game is in single player and multiplayer, which is an amazing feature. Unfortunately single player doesn't support playing with all civs, maximum is 22 and it may corrupt your save after a while with 22 modded civs or a big map with 22 civs (doesn't happen often), multiplayer on the other hand is fun to do. If you do it with friends its hours of fun but playing with randoms is harder because you have to do it in one go. Not to mention the amount of times it may crash or reload in both cases.The environment is one of the best in the games that I have played so far. The introduction always hits me, it's like history class but 10 times more intresting, I always fully listen it unless I already know the leader. The music is very relaxing and switches paces often. Some people call this game slow paced, it really depends, you can finish a game in 150 turns but you can do it as well in 600. Depends on your playstyle more than the game itself. Every turn can be decisive or can deliver a big impact to the game. The dialogues are amazing, the amounts of languages and different interactions that you have. I even know some atop of my head.The gameplay is fun, and always a challenge somehow, unfortunate to me is that the choices of the difficulty goes. The game gives the AI advantages, starting from King, instead of making the AI way smarter. I'd rather battle an oponent that can outplay me rather than outclass me due to advantages. The combat is good, also animation wise, I personally like to go to war around the time of WW1 or so because strategizing is more advanced because both parties have good units and also the artillery units. If I try to go in a very early war, like I tried with Attila, I got far behind in hapiness. Religion is a big part of the game, it doesn't matter which one you have but the advantages do make the difference. City states don't really decide the game, unless Diplomatic Victory is near, but they are a big boost to your empire. If you have any spare money do spend it on alliances. I like the spying system, stealing technologies and couping/ rigging in city states, but I think it is too much of a factor and it needs to be countered easier so that it is less easy to use them.In Civilization V you have 5 victories:- Time victory, the game end at x amount of turns and the player with the most score wins. I dislike this one I always turn it off, it is no real victory to win by score. Score is dependant on how lucky you get in the beginning and your possibilities to expand. Also if you get a religion 1/3ths of your early game score is from your religion.- Science victory, you construct the apollo program and you construct parts to make a spaceship. This one is the easiest but still a challenge. Getting to the atomic and informatic era first is a challenge on its own, then you need the aluminium and then you need to construct the parts which is the same amount of turns for building wonders. I only pity the fact that you can't really counter it without almost winning yourself. When you take over the capital, spaceships are located in the capital, the spaceship transfers to the second biggest city. So basically you need to wipe a civilization to stop them from winning science, or let their spaceship be in a very bad city.- Culture victory, you generate tourism thanks to great people and you overtake other people their culture to win. This one is the hardest in my opinion. Literally one necessary wonder that you can't build can stop you from overtaking someone in culture. And when you are playing versus civs who are trying this victory themselfs makes it even harder because with tourism comes culture too.- Diplomatic victory, you get votes through the world congress when it reaches the United Nations the more city state allies you have how more votes you possess. This one is a good victory to try out, you really need to use your spies to their best to coup every city state, or as much possible, to get votes.- Domination victory, you take every capital that is in the game. This is my favourite one by far. It sounds simple but it takes a lot of effort. You both need to be strong in culture and science to keep up with your enemies so you can overtake them.Personally I like the most to play on Prince, see above why, and I like to let the AI take control of the game and then take control of the game myself. Last game I did , I was with Montezuma, I let Rome gather 2/4 capitals and let him build twice the army I had. I still had the science advantage of course and managed Rome to get to declare war on me and I won that war. Then I built up an army myself and took the remaining not Rome capital. Then I was almost in a constant war with Rome with a smaller to equal to bigger army, building up while at war, and I took the 2 capitals Rome had.

												Having never played a Civilization game before this, i was pretty pleased with this game. I can't compare it to Civ 4 like others, but what i got was a varied turn-based strategy game that was a lot of fun. The first time i sat down and played Civilization V, i played for almost 6 hours consecutively. The game is THAT addictive and i haven't had that kind of hook on a game for years. There are many ways to play and ultimately be the best civilization. The game might look unappealing and boring to some, but the game is really easy to understand yet extremely deep at the same time. This game is some of the most fun i've had playing a game, ever.			"

												Civilization V wasn't played in a day... at least it's good for curing insomnia though!Edit: Truth be told the game can only appeal to gamers with a lot of patience the way the turn based gameplay unfolds, it's just too damn slow and boring. And its that much worse if you want to go aggresive with the grind that moving units around turn after turn is. After I beat it on deity I decided that was it for me. Never loading this one up again, I got other stuff to play.			"

												Arguably, the best strategy game to ever come to Steam due to the amount of content and endless replay value...+ In the verge of winning cultural victory until Gandhi, Napoleon, and Alexander the Great, declared war against me in the last minute. Got angry and ended up wiping out the entire planet with nuclear weapons and (unintentionally) dominated the world with military might. Don't f*ck with me. 10/10+ You may encounter Genghis Khan during your Civilization experience and he'll be your best friend even if your civilization doesn't have the great military strength. Also has a cool personality and usually got your back in the midst of trouble. #BestFriends4Life. 9.5/10+ Want to do a historical reenactment with your selected civilizations? Go ahead. It may be historically inaccurate but you ended up enjoying a lot more than you originally intended. 9/10+ Don't have any allies with other civilizations? You can gift a unit or send gold to city-states to become your friends and allies. At least, you're not lonely in a hostile world where everyone can backstab you like a sneaky b*tch (I'm looking at you Gandhi). Hey, it's a good thing when city-states will fight (and die) for you. 8.5/10+There's something wrong when you have the Freedom Ideology and ended up dominating most of the planet by the Information Era. 8.5/10+ In the middle of war, you would most likely hear depressing orchestral soundtrack...and ended up making peace with your enemies. Not because that you lost interest in war or you feel bad for wiping out enemy units and annexing cities, it's because the soundtrack will make your heart cry. 10/10 + The best political simulator. Ever. 10/10With endless replay value and unlimited ways to deal with your friends and foes in a hostile world, Civilization is still considered as the gamer's cocaine from many owners who own the franchise. Still don't have the game? Go get Civilization V or Genghis Khan and I will declare war against you.			"

												I can say without a doubt that this is the best Civilization and Firaxis game, toppling XCOM Enemy Unknown AND Civilization Beyond Earth(alhough that game wasn't very good). Firaxis and Sid Meier let you travel back in time and rewrite the story of human civilization with a few tweaks. It's utterly amazing. Very good game, ESPECIALLY for its age. Although the complete pack is a tad expensive, you should definitely get it when it's on sale. Without at least Brave New World, the game is very dull. Anyways, storytime!.Played as France.Only conquered those directly in my way of settling.Focused on production,science, and growth.Settled down and placed cities and armies around the capital, protecting it.By then, the only players left were Genghis Khan, Elizabeth, and Gahndi.WAIT, GAHNDI!?!?!.Starts working towards science victory.sees Indian Mechanized Infantry at borders.Gives Gahndi gifts and gold to help slow his conquest down.Gahndi gladly accepts then declares war.Only one part left at Bordeaux.Starts sending it towards my capitol.Halfway through journey, Bourdeaux falls.Indian troops gaining on Shuttle part.Forms Suicide Shield around part.Part gets to Capitol.REALIZES THAT YOU NEED 3 SS BOOSTERS, NOT 2.Forms shield around Paris with army remnants.Starts building.only 5 turns.Last remaining non capitol city falls.Shield falls.Only one more hit needed on Capitol.My turn.Part done.Completes Shuttle.Wins with epic music in the steam overlay playing http://listenonrepeat.com/?v=nEgKXtA8SZY#Auracle_Music_-_Stand_and_Fight.Realizes  that 50 hours have been added since beginning the game10/10 you will lose your life to this game			"

												This game should be treated as a mandatory training simulator for anyone wanting to work in education or run for public office.  Completely serious, here.Now, I'm not saying it's a perfectly realistic simulation.  Far from it.  However, it will quickly demolish any racial and/or nationalistic delusions the player holds and forces them into the harsh reality of why societies succeed or fail - and the fact that most of it comes down to where started out on the map, a few ""minor"" decisions early on that snowballed into major consequences centuries later, and no small amount of plain random luck.It also shows us how technology evolves and the iterative nature of scientific progress.  That is to say it demonstrates how everything is build on top of everything that came before it.   It also demonstrates how the world started off as mostly one big land grab until it ran out of land to grab, and how the timing of our world wars shortly thereafter was almost inevitable.  And, much like real life, how the modern ""stalemate"" has transformed the nature of war into a class of competing cultures and jockying for position, if only because all the players left on the board are simply too big to be taken down directly.As for the game itself, compared to Civ4 the graphics are obviously better.  The new ""one unit exclusive"" hex mechanic took some getting used to, but in the long run it's still doable and does make unit rotation & survival more important than the old ""stack everything to the max"" method.  Most important, however, is that this is the Civ game that opened the door to modding and the Steam Workshop - and that makes a world of difference, trust me.If Civ5 has one flaw anywhere I'd say it was in not getting Leonard Nimoy to come back & do the tech blurbs for them a second time.  I'd like to hear how that decision was rationalized in the board room.			"

												Amazing strategy game. Civilization is one of the best games I've ever played if I want to go casual or have a little thinking. From trade routes to the welfare of your people. From allies with other civilization to building a utopia. And from building an army to starting wars- Wait, those start tears. You play as a random leader (Or pick a leader) with various units and skills and you try to build the perfect civilization or beat the other players (Other civilization) in a war until you are the last one alive. You have to worry about gold income, happiness of your people, and the welfare for the population to go up and a growing civilization. What I really like is the personality of each of the AI playes if you play solo (I think it can happen in multiplayer too). As for the victory, so far, you have to build a utopia (Adopt 5 full policy) or be the last civilization. And that means, you guessed it, war. It is also a game of trust if a civilization likes you or not (Or a player decides).Interesting facts:George Washington adopted communist in the year of 1400 AD.Napoleon Bonaparte was a huge a-hole around other civilizations and declares war after being on their good side.Askia Mohammad is friendly even if he is carrying a sword and has a burning kingdom behind him.Mohandas Gandhi has disposable nukes in his closet.Sources: This game			"

When 4X meets perfectionHaving played all the previous civilization games I am 100% certain that the fifth installment of this franchise is the most well balanced, innovated and addictive of all . Moreover with excellent (for 2010) graphics and music is definitely the king of all 4X games. The variety of the game is unbelievable, more than 40 deferent civilizations with their unique traits, improvements, units and music. In other words every civilization has its own pros and cons, so with every civilization you have to follow a deferent gameplay style in order to win. Adding to all the above a dozen of fantastic scenarios and hundreds of mods and the result is that the replyability of this game is endless.  No wonder why they are players out there with 5.000 or 6.000 hours of gameplay that they continue to play it 6 years!! after its initial release. A must for all 4x funs and the first choice for all the gamers that want to try a 4x game for the first time but also a very heavy legacy for the upcoming civilization 6.			"

												I'm a addict, I not gonna lied I think of Civilization 5 24/7, when I cooking, when I cleaning, when I'm at my job, when I'm having sex, I can't stop thinking of Civilization 5 I crave it, it the only game that I play in my library ( besides Civ 4 & Sims 3 ). I would not be surprised if I died soon and 40 years later my mummified corpse is still sitting in front of this epic, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic game.Multiplayer- I highly recommend not spamming cities as much as I love finding new cities, it can also lead to catastrophe results later on down the road, mostly due to the unhappiness and production of your cities, started two games cause of it. Third game I'm as The Aztecs I doing pretty damn good playing with Nurse, I would like to play more of the match but he offline kind of disappointed by that but I'm patience lol.Single- My current game I'm The Huns, on Pangea, 22 civs and diety ( yes I'm crazy diety being my only choice of difficulty to play, simply cause I love it ). Sometime into the game I gather up my forces and declare war on Venice, oh boy I was wrong being a era behind everyone and being at the bottom of the score, I took a risk, I was hoping to imitade the world just cause you got advance weapons and I having a huge army despite the technogical disavantage but the size didn't matter and that risk didn't pay off sadly, Venetians wipe out my entire Hunnic army, force to retreat to my nearest city I regroup and Venice began the counter invasion. Thankfully I did not lost the city cause I sued for peace like the nice guy I am, a couple of turns later Shaka and Gandhi both declared war on me I lost one city but that it. And you're probably thinking ""why not retired?"" psssttt that what cowards and sore losers do I don't give up or start a new game until I'm completely wipe out from the game. Meanwhile all the other ais in the game are quite peaceful even though it on diety and domination victory but that will change soon.Complaints- I missed units stacking, especially in the late game when you takeover half the map it takes a chunk of time moving each unit individually tedious work.

(Includes Colleges and Universities, you know, the stuff that gets you good paying jobs.)- Be willing to have their parents yell at them with a megaphone.- Be able to handle groundings and other forms of punishment.- Be content with losing friends. (Unless said friends have Civ 5)- Be willing to lose girlfriends and wives. (Unless, once again, said individuals play Civ 5, and if that's the case, keep them for life.)- Be content with losing your job. (You know, the stuff that gives you money)- Be content with the possibility of no sex. (YEAH, you read right.)If you don't fill ALL of the above requirements, please don't buy this game. It will ruin you. It will destroy you. It will age you. It will grab you like sweet black tar heroin and ride you like a dominatrix.And the scary thing is that no matter what, it will always keep you coming back for more. "

												This is the first turn-based strategy game I've ever played, so be aware that this review does not come from a connoisseur. At first, the game can be very intimidating. You have no real idea what to do, and you just go with the flow. You soon realize the mistake you've done, as you get crushed by your opponents. After a couple of games versus the AI, you start the comprehend the way you should go about playing, and the game starts shining. It's very fun to play alone (I've personally never played against another person) and there's no timer or anything forcing you to rush and make irrational decisions, so it's very relaxing. There's a lot of different countries you can play as, each one having different traits to bring to the table, making it refreshing to play over and over to try different play styles. Believe me, you might say ""Just one more turn"", but we all know you're lying to yourself.			"

												As I'm looking forward to the release of Civ VI I'd like to leave a review for one of my favourite 4X franchise of all time.Back in the day, Civ V had rought start. I couldn't really point what it was but I felt there's something missing in the game. I mean, the early age was fun. I welcome the switch from a single death stack of doom to one unit per hex. But still, mid to late game was rather boring.Then the first expansion came to fix the mid game with religion, and the second one after to fix the late game with tourism and a bunch of other stuff. Right now, Civ V is a complete game. Totally fun from the start right to the finish line. The addition of steam workshop extended the already high replayability game further. Not to mention the really well made DLC of all the nations and maps. With the current pricing, especially with a huge discount that often given, you could never go wrong buying this.It's been a while since I last booted the game. But looking back to those hours spent. I've had fond memories of being ganged up, backstabbed, forward settled, nuked, etc.Good memories.			"

Sid Meier's Civilization V sucks hour after hour of your day away, giving rise to plans of global conquest and thoughtful tactics. Of course, you could say the same of Civ games of the past, but what makes Civilization V a praiseworthy successor is how it changes up key elements of the franchise. The game's core values--expansion, exploitation, exploration, extermination--are as strong as ever. But the newer tactical combat and addition of city-states give strategy veterans new ways of tackling their goals, while a friendly interface and expansive Civilopedia help newcomers get up to speed relatively quickly. There are a few aspects of Civilization V that could have used a bit more attention, but even as is, this is yet another classic edition to a series that consistently rewards and renovates. If you have even the remotest interest in worldwide domination, you owe it to yourself to get lost in one of the most rewarding turn-based games in years.Advantages:+ Hours of addictive turn-based glee+ Fantastic new tactical combat system+ Excellent interface makes it easy to keep track of every aspect of the game+ Great automation features allow you to focus on the big picture+ Lovely visuals and classical soundtrackDisadvantages:- Inconsistent, overly aggressive AI- Scattered annoyances, particularly in multiplayer			"

												Whenever a game with as much hype and legacy as Civilization V comes along, it generates a tremendous amount of discussion and debate. Even before the game's release, as snippets and details are discovered, would-be fans are either extolling the virtues of the Greatest Game Ever or decrying the Greatest Travesty of the Gaming World. Some will exclaim that Civilization V is not a Civilization title at all, while others will say it's merely a gussied-up, carbon-copy version of a previous installment. The truth, of course, is always somewhere in between. For me, Civilization V is a very good game, with many elements distilled from previous titles, mixed with a healthy dose of fresh ideas. It's not simply a re-make of an earlier version, and that's not at all what I wanted. It does make some rather major changes to the Civilization brand, and for the most part I found those changes to be solid ones. So what's new this time around? First up are the civilizations themselves. Each civilization boasts two unique units and/or buildings, along with a special ability that sets them apart from the rest of the world. CivV has moved away from the mix-and-match Civ traits we saw in earlier games, meaning the special abilities in CivV truly set a civilization apart. For instance, the Iroquois nation gains the ability to use forests contained within friendly territory as roads, while the Aztecs gain valuable culture points with each enemy defeated. After choosing their civilization and setting up the parameters of their game world, players are transported to a beautiful, hex-based world map. I won't wander into the minefield argument here about hex-vs.-square, other than to say that I like the new layout. Being a card-carrying boardgame geek, I feel completely at home with the move to a more...table-topish feel for the game. Civilization V also boasts an alternate view which makes the map simple, clean, and very ""old school"" in presentation. I prefer to play on the more detailed map, but it's nice to have the option for the other. As always, Civilization V is a game of cities. Once a city is planted, it begins ""working"" the ring of hexes surrounding it. For each level of population in a city, a citizen can be assigned to gather resources from a single hex. Terrain type and special resources dictate how much food, production, and money can be accrued, and each of these are vital to empire expansion. Food determines how quickly a city will grow, production how quickly the city can construct buildings and train units, and money takes care of just about everything else. Through certain buildings, cities also generate Culture to help them expand.Speaking of Culture, this value is treated a bit differently in Civ V. Culture points, useful in expanding city influence, also take players down a social technology tree filled with Social Policies. These policies are a set of ten mini-trees, each of which can focus the civilization into a particular style of play. Some are better for war-mongering empires, while others will give a large boost to technology or additional culture. Each step in each tree confers a new bonus, and researching heavily down the Social Policy path is a new victory condition. If players completely research five of the social policies, they gain the ability to research the Utopia Project, culminating in a game-win.Of course, players still have the tried-and-true technology path toward a space-race victory. The tech tree is the heart of progress in Civilization V, as always. A bit smaller than in previous Civ titles, CivV's tech tree nonetheless offers plenty of difficult choices on the path to victory. Other than offering the player the most powerful units, Wonders, and buildings, the technology path also allows players the ability to construct the Alpha Centauri starship and send it on its way for victory.Of course, a player's civilization doesn't exist by itself in the world. In addition to other civilizations, Civilization V introduces City-States. These minor civilizations cannot achieve victory by themselves, but they can offer some impressive rewards to those civilizations that win their favor. This can be accomplished by gifting money, completing requests for aid or exploration, or even eliminating rival City-States. Each City-State maintains a favor rating for the civilization, and at its highest level a City-State will create an alliance, gifting the civilization with resources and units. Of course, more aggressive players can simply wipe out those pesky upstarts and take the cities for their own.Those aggressive civilizations will need some armies to accomplish their goals, however. Here is where some of the biggest changes have occurred in the Civilization franchise. Players are now much more limited in the number of units they can field at any given time. Not only do units take much longer to train, many of the more powerful units now require much-limited Strategic  Resources in order to build. No longer does a single iron deposit or oil field allow players unlimited building of swordsmen and tanks--each Strategic Resource point now only gives a few of these vital resources. Players wanting to field a vast array of units must control multiple Strategic Resource locations, a feat with is difficult at best. Given the limited amount of units available, each is now much more resilient than before. With a large pool of hit points, units can take several rounds of combat before falling. Ranged units also get quite a facelift--all ranged units can now attack up to several hexes away. Now, attacking an enemy city is much more rewarding than before, with my armies displayed across the fields of battle, each positioned carefully for best combat efficiency. The cities are much more durable this time around, as well. Cities now have a defense rating, depending on size, population, and buildings, and they can hold their own in combat even without a garrisoned unit. Cities can also bombard enemy units, weakening forces before they even reach the walls. Even with these defenses, however, a city cannot withstand a siege for terribly long, and so friendly forces will need to be stationed nearby for quick defense. For those planning a conquest route, that victory path has also been updated. Now players merely have to ensure that no other civilization is in control of its originally-founded city. This is not as easy as it sounds, of course, but it makes for a quicker victory type than hunting down each and every last unit on the map.Expansion of empires is now kept in check with by the Happiness resource. Happiness, now a global value, decreases each time a new city is founded or a city gains population, with additional cities having a greater penalty than population. Civilization V looks, sounds, and plays wonderfully. Everything is slick, polished, and very user-friendly. The map is very impressive, while each unit is easily identifiable. The user interface allows players to quickly locate any information, unit, or city easily and without fuss. I even liked the new Leader animations, with each speaking in their native tongues. Being a veteran of the series, I was able to quickly jump in and get going, even with all the changes made this time around. Plentiful tooltips and a detailed Civlopedia allowed me to wrap my mind around most of the concepts within my first hour of play. Civilization V is, once again, going to consume countless hours of my life in turn-based bliss. With the ""boardgame"" feel and the slick, polished features, I know I'm in for many sleep-deprived mornings. Fans of the series, or turn-based 4X games in general, will have a blast with this for a long time to come. And while it might be a little daunting to newcomers, Civilization V is also a great place for those who might want to wet their feet in the 4X pool.			"

												Civ 5 is a game where you are the leader of a civilization, obviously. You can destroy your foes in a Domination Victory with your army, you can use education and science to win in a Science Victory, or maybe try for a different victory. Whether your more of a warmongering player or a peaceful player, Civ 5 is a great game to play with friends, family or maybe just randoms. You can make allies, enemies, or maybe just friends (that may or may not backstab you!) with other civilizations. You can explore the world and settle more cities to expand your civilization more, research technologies to unlock more features, make money by trading luxury resources and other stuff, and make wonders that will help your civilization in different ways. The game is also newb-friendly, as the guiders will help you grow your civilization through your first and upcoming journies. If you've played the previous Civ's, you're probably going to like Civ 5. The DLC ""Brave New World"" makes Civ 5 a whole lot better, such as it completely changes culture victories which makes it more interesting and fun overall to acomplish a Culture Victory. It adds more civilizations and wonders, and changes the way you make money by actually making you make trade routes with other civilizations or City-States to make money. However, the vanilla game without DLC is still pretty good. I, personally believe the game (and DLC) is worth the money.Overall, I rate this game 10/10!			"

-Quick Review-Sid Meier’s Civilization V is one of the best Strategy games I have ever played, period. I struggled to get into the Medieval total war games, however I’ve been playing the Civilization games since I was twelve-years-old.The game is rather expensive, and to get all the achievements you need to get a fair amount of DLC, I purchased Civ5 Gold edition, so I was forced to also buy the “Brave New World DLC”. So fair warning; if you’re after everything, expect the DLC trick.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  There are three main aspects to Sid Meier’s Civilization V, 1) Single Player Matches, 2) Single player Scenarios, 3) Multiplayer Matches. As single player you may select from a list of nations to play as, you may chose as Rome, Greece, Germany, the United States, Russia, England, and many others. You play against other NPC’s, you can choose your map size, map style, and other specialized options.In the scenarios you are usually given a choice of nations that were in that scenario, often times the scenarios are historic events, such as the conquest of Genghis Khan, 1066 conquest of England, or the Fall of Rome.Lastly, in Multiplayer you can have a battle of wits against your friends; you can play co-op on the same computer, or play online with your steam friends. This mode is definitely an incentive for people whom are more competitive.Game Play:  As I’ve elaborated already, you can choose your country, be sure to read the perks that country has, certain countries are more effective at certain things. Some countries start out with special units, others get bonuses from conquering barbarians, and still others get great benefits’ from city-states.The game has a lot to keep in mind while you play; thankfully the game has “advisors” which help you get used to the game really fast. They always pitch in their opinions and explain what’s happening in the game. Are you an advanced player and tired of hearing them say the same things over and over? No problem! Just disable them in the options menu in game.You start with building your first city which becomes your capital, and then you build armies, settlers to build more cities, workers, buildings, wonders, and much, much more.Achievements: I wouldn’t be consistent and true to my nature if I didn’t add notes about achievements in my reviews, let’s face it, many of the achievements in Civ5 are a grind, win as every nation, play as every map size and type, chop down 1,000 tree tiles… A lot of these achievements aren’t particularly interesting, however I enjoyed them greatly, and many people who might be looking to get away from grinding might prefer to avoid this game for the achievements alone.Many other achievements are very challenging to get, at this time I haven’t started to work on getting Deity (the hardest difficulty) achievements, but many of those achievements are very difficult to get, and often times require some tricks you pick up from playing.Price: As I have already indicated, expect this game to be rather pricy, the “vanilla” (original) version of the game is $29.99. If you are just looking to play a strategy game, I think that’s a fair price for the amount of time you can put into this game. But to get more enjoyment out of your game, the DLC does bring new scenarios, new nations, and new elements to the game that really makes the game just that more dynamic.If you are looking for the whole set, I would recommend buying the Sid Meier’s Civilization V: Complete Edition. It’s standard price is $49.99, I would also recommend waiting for a price reduction either on Christmas or the Summer Steam Sale, or keep your eyes open for a Humble Bundle sale.Conclusion:  While the game might be expensive I have personally put 219 hours into the game at this time, for me that’s the mark of a good game (And having great replayability), if you enjoy playing it enough that you hit the 200 hours mark. I have enjoyed the quality of the game, the game style, playing it with my friends and family, and enjoyed getting the various achievements. I highly recommend this game to anyone who has liked Civilization games in the past, and anyone who is looking for a strategy game to simply try out.			"

												Civilization V is an amazing game!! You choose, build and lead your own civilization, from the first human times until the future technologies! Several advisors are here to help you. You have to manage everything : technologies, social doctrines, armed units, etc... . You can choose to be allied with a civilization, or you can make the war. It's possible to help the other civilizations, or to destroy them and own the whole map, being the last civilization still up. There are many possibilities for your game : you can choose the type of the map, the size of the map, the speed of the game, etc etc.. . The game offers alot of ways to have fun, with friends or alone. It's really a great strategy game, but you need a good pc to run it with high graphics.You can spend hours and hours at making your civilization growing up and at making alliances.. or wars. Indeed, it's a very addictive game that can litteraly ruin your life haha.84 / 100			"

												This game is probably the most realistic, most gritty and serious history simulation game out there. My son is a history student and so needed all the help he could get. Well, I let him play this game and now he's amazing! This game also taught me a thing or two like the war between the Aztecs and Russia in 1952 and the Indian nuking of various cities around the globe. This game also features the cleverest AI I've ever seen and really shows how hard maintaining relations with other countries is and the world leaders are most definately NOT thin-skinned idiots who'll nuke you for entering a war that they asked you to! So yeah, this game is amazing for all people wanting to learn about history. Odd that my son got bad marks on his history exam.........			"

												For some time many of us have wondered just who is Jack Schitt? We find ourselves at a loss when someone says, 'You don't know Jack Schitt'! Well, thanks to my genealogy efforts, you can now respond in an intellectual way. Jack Schitt is the only son of Awe Schitt. Awe Schitt, the fertilizer magnate, who married O. Schitt, the owner of Needeep N. Schitt, Inc. They had one son, Jack. In turn, Jack Schitt married Noe Schitt. The deeply religious couple produced six children: Holie Schitt, Gi va Schitt, Fulla Schitt, Bull Schitt, and the twins Deep Schitt and Dip Schitt. Against her parents' objections, Deep Schitt married Dumb Schitt, a high school dropout. After being married 15 years, Jack and Noe Schitt divorced. Noe Schitt later married Ted Sherlock, and because her kids were living with them, she wanted to keep her previous name. She was then known as Noe Schitt Sherlock. Meanwhile, Dip Schitt married Loda Schitt, and they produced a son with a rather nervous disposition named Chicken Schitt. Two of the other six children, Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt, were inseparable throughout childhood and subsequently married the Happens brothers in a dual ceremony. The wedding announcement in the newspaper announced the Schitt-Happens nuptials. The Schitt-Happens children were Dawg, Byrd, and Horse. Bull Schitt, the prodigal son, left home to tour the world. He came home with his Italian wife; Piza Schitt			"

												Well, I'm not going to say this game sucked the life out of me, but will say it that....Well... Yeah, don't let the 100 hours fool you.Ah Civ. Yes I have enjoyed you since you first came out and asked for the words from the manual as an anti cheat. The game feels like old times, so if you've played Civ before you will be right at home. However, there are some old features missing, like stacking units. The technology tree is still there and amazing as always, you still have the ability to change how many resources you put towards new tech, as well as happiness and other factors.As with any Civ game you can also use and upgrade resource tiles such as Gems, wheat, iron, oil, and so on to unlock new untis or increase the health and happiness of your cities. This is also still turned based however it feels like the AI turns don't take as long to process as they did in Civ III so the game moves along a bit faster. If you like turn based strategy games and want what can be a real challenge then you should give this game a shot. Even though Leonard Nemoy didn't narrate this version of the game it's still a wonderful title, looks amazing, and is addictive.			"

												Civilization V is one of the most interesting strategy games I've ever seen! This game gives you absolute freedom. You can build anything you want, you can conquer any country you want, you can buy everything and everybody (yeah) you want, you can explore new territories, you can create your own GREAT empire. Don't know how to start? Your councillors will give you some advice. Don't want to play it only by yourself? You can take your friends to play with you. Moreover, everything is accompanied by various sounds; figures are not static. And what I found really good is that you don't have to do boring quests like:""Build 10 factories and 5 farms"", because you decide what to do by YOURSELF.I think that everyone, who like strategy games, should try this one. It worth every penny (btw, it isn't expensive at all).			"

												Civ 5 made a bit of a departure in many aspects from the previous Civ game (Civ IV). While the base game does not have enough meat on it for most people's taste, this turn-based strategy game turns into a real gem once you add the very good DLC packages. I recommend getting the full package with all DLC to have the best experience.I would like to see the graphics with a less cartoonish look but, they are effective with high details and fluid animations.This game (with the added DLC) surpasses previous entries in the series by a pretty big margin and I would recommend this game to any fan of past Civ games or strategy games in general.UPDATE 11/2016Even with the newer CIV VI out, this one is still worth a look as it is now much cheaper and afull add-on package for CIV 6 is still a few years out.Once CIV 6 is mature and fully finished you might want to consider moving to it next.

												The year is 2004, and Bismark has just gotten a diplomatic victory, and owns Asia, Eastern Europe, Oceania, and is fighting for the Americas, decides to stay the leader of Germany, and go for all of the victorys. For now, he makes peace with everyone and stockpiles missiles, ships, airplanes and soldiers. Then, right after I become #1 in everything, Ghandi declares war on me. His two city's are destroyed in 3 turns. Then, all the other countries declare war on me. Rome, the Huns, Egypt and England. 100 turns later I nuke every city within range and attack. Ghandi then comes in to our territory with 3 giant death robots, and destroys my capital city. 10/10 beware of complete kills and GHANDI!			"

												Ok. Where should I start? How I'm in love with history of humankind? Or how Sid Meier made a deity of history-based sandbox games? Nope, there are too little space for that. Do we need some comparisons, like with Paradox games or Total War series? Nah, they are distinct. Too many details, too narrative. Those games are awesome, no doubt, but not in an aerial way, like Civilization does.Main catch of this game is in its simplicity. Everybody can rule an empire there. Though, it's a sandbox, it has a different face for every player. You want to rage a war and hold the whole world under your color - do that. Or you want to be in peace with everybody? Oh, you can do that too, in dozens of variants. Dozens? I mean, thousands! The devil is in the details, you know.Civilization V - is a peak of long lasting walk. I liked first and second games, especially second, those fundamentalists are gorgeous. I'm still prefering third Civilization, when I'm going for domination victory. Fourth game feels like Win Vista to me... Overall, fifth Civ game - the most complex and balanced of all. Cultural achievments, market deals, political unions, and religion issue - all are far better than before. If I was supposed to play in one game for life, there are good chances that I'd picked that one.One thing I have to add - no matter what strategy you want to use: make a Louvre and Hermitage full of stuff, build a spaceship, or run the league of nations - you want an army. Your army. Every strong player could tell you that. History tells you that. Today news, like Ukranian story, telling you the very same. If you don't feed own army, soon you're gonna be feeding somebody else. Si vis pacem, para bellum.Peace, people. Make love, not war.Mark? 10/10 of course! Best time-cosuming product in the market!

												This is one of the best, if not the best 4X game currently available. Make sure to buy it with all its DLC content though (complete edition has them all). There are sales for the complete edition pretty often. My game time is actually higher than this, as I owned the title as retail before getting it on steam. This game is potentially fun for thousands of hours. Playing the first 100 you will have no clue of what you are doing, but it will still be fun. After that you will realize what is really going on and what you can and have to do in order to get those desired victory types down.Also, after playing vanilla Civ V for a bit you will want to get the Community Balance Patch (CBP) Mod as it enriches the gameplay so greatly and makes it even more interesting and diverse in possibilities.If this game lacks something, you sure will not notice.Fun alone, even more fun with friends. Though during play you will get to a point where you hate each other and if it is only for the ONE tile you really needed for your build...			"

												One day while I was walking down a serene path I encountered a grave evil that I myself could not have possibly defeated alone. There they were, the great Khan and the great Ghandi marching side by side down a path  towards my empire! I the great Paccal, of course, could not let this great transgression aside. So I talked to my great correspondent Frezdful calfrul and asked him for holy advice. He, by smoking a green plant and drinking the blood of sheep, had great premonitions and then told me only by sacrificing my relatives that I could defeat the great evil headed towards my empire. My unbreakable belief in my correspondent lead me to an awakened power deep within the bottom half of my body and there I was flaying my relatives and sacrificing them towards the great sun king. This, of course, manifested a great power within myself. I became ferrocia the great lizard king. I uttered a few words ""feerotoa aoiasjiogjoiasj"" and by doing those measly acts I increased my kingdom's science output to >9000 and construction to >9000 and built many troops over my 5 city large empire. Truly, it was something to behold.. . as I built an army of xcom and death robots to shatter the power my opponents held. They were at my mercy. And that is the story of me, the great gozz.			"

 All of my reviews are based around my personnal opinion, they're not swayed by a majority of people liking or disliking it.  Release:  23 Sep, 2010 Genre:  Strategy Developer:  Firaxis Games Publisher:  2K Games  Mode(s):  Single-player, Mutliplayer Better than  Sid Meier's Civilization IV  Worse than  Nothing. Maybe going outside? Nah, its better than going outside.  TL:DR What can I say? After almost six years this game still holds many hours of enjoyment. Civ 5 is one of those unique games that can hold the interests of any type of gamer. There are different civilizations to choose from, each with it's own real historic leader. Each map is randomly generated according to the settings you've given it. For example, you can set the map to be split into several islands, or have it all on one big island. There are different difficulty settings to choose one to fit your style. There is a lot in this game that can't really be covered in this review, but if you want a beautifully drawn, strategic and challenging game, this is definitely for you. A must try! NOTE: All of my reviews are laid out in a particular format that fits the game. NOTE: Didn't include Story because there isn't one, and didn't include gameplay because it's more or less covered in the 'About' section. About As I mentioned before, Civ 5 is a turn-based strategy game that puts you in the posistion of a leader of a civilization. You decide everything. You decide where to settle your cities. You decide what to build in them. You decide what to research. You can be a civilization thats all about making wealth and culture, or you can be a civilization thats hellbent on destroying others. All of this is up to you. You have dozens of settings to choose from, all layed out in a way that shouldn't be confusing. As mentioned earlier, each map is randomly generated, all according to the settings you've applied. For example, You can have a small map with only a couple of civilizations inside it.The game is set into a turn taking genre. Each turn, you'll be able to move your units to a certain distance, then the next turn move them further. Building and researching also takes turns. You can also change the pace of these turns, whether they be quick, or longer. As well as civilizations, there are other people in the world with you. You have City States that are smaller versions of civilizations and are bound to only one city, and you have Barbarians, that will move around the map raiding city states and that will sometimes attack you.All of this is only a portion of whats in the game. Your civilization, your choice. Design & Graphics One of my favourite things about this game is the way it is designed. You have beautiful landscapes in every game you load. From plains to hills and even oceans, all designed beautifully. Each civilization you meet sends you to a cinematic page where you talk to the civilization's leader, each with a beautifully drawn background. Units are designed with great detail, and not to mention, the iconic wonders you can build based off real famous landmarks like Stonehenge and The Pyramids. As to be expected, it doesn't take a super powerful PC to run this game. I can run it just fine on maximum settings. The worst you could get is probably the minor stutter between turns. Other than that, its fine as far as I know. UI [User Interface] This is where Civ 5 gets a lot more in-depth. When you load a game you will notice a lot of buttons around the screen. Each one has its own purpose, which might make players a little bit overwhelmed to begin with. But, with tutorials enabled, the game pretty much tells you what this is and what you do here the moment you click on the button. Settings are easy to navigate, should you need to edit anything. If you consider buying the dlc for this game, the UI does change a bit, with buttons moving to different places and new ones appearing. Again this is covered by tutorials so you shouldn't have to worry.  Soundtrack I just had to mention this because this is my favourite thing about this game. Each civilization has their own soundtrack, a lot of which is actual famous tunes. When you're at peace, you have relaxing and calm music, composed of strings and woodwind instruments, and when you're at war you have dynamic and thrilling music composed of horns and drums. There is a huge variety of tunes all right for the perfect moments. If you ever get the chance, I would highly recommend just sitting back and listening to it. Pros - Huge amount of content- Beautifully drawn- Outstanding soundtrack- Plenty of replayability- Educational if you want to learn about the leaders :)- Very relaxing Cons - Multiplayer could be better Final Recommendation I've played this game for years now, even before I came on Steam, and I can say that I still haven't got bored, and I doubt I ever will. The best strategy game and one of my favourite games of all time. It can be unrealistic, like having Gandhi build nukes, but at the same time it can be mildy addicting, playing with or without friends. If you're after the perfect strategy game, this is the one to pick!Final Verdict - 10/10.

												Fantastic turn based strategy game. Not everyone enjoys turn based games however if you do, you certainly will not be disappointment with Civ 5. This game reminds me a lot of Avalon Hill's Civilization board game's concept going through each epoch. Civ 5 is easy to start, learn and understand. It runs smooth without any issues, I was able to run through a bunch of games with friends without a single problem. Game can be rough playing in public matches at times however with a group of friends this game is amazing.			"

												Civilization V is a fantastic turn-based strategy. I've personally have been a fan of the series for a long time and this is by far the best one.  There is many different modes to play and multiple ways to win and no two games are ever alike.  There is also a ton of mods for this game! So check out the workshop. You will easily lose hours to this game and I can't keep track of how many times I say ""Just one more turn"" and never realize how late it is until after the fact.If you don't own this game already you are seriously missing out.

												Civilization: The bread and butter of turn-based strategy games. The absolute pinnacle of eye-needling, back-breaking thousand upon thousand of turns over the course of what I think are the longest ""games"" you'll ever play. The only game that's longer than a Civ marathon game is life itself.As a huge (pirate) player of Civ4 + expansions I must say I am pleasently surprised with Civ5. I though it was lacking the depth the fourth had, but in reality it's just overall better; (everything probably due to the fact that death stacks are no longer in the game)-------------------------------------------------------------9/10 Strategy - if you're a fan of anything that involves tactics, macro-managing, resource-management, general strategy you'll feel at home in this game. Everything is so smooth and straightforward you'll be dying to pass the test of time and try your best to emerge victorious as the greatest civilization. Skill roof is damn high and it's one of those games that's hard to master. Definitely a collosus of the strategy community.Cons: AI in the game is barely potty-trained. It just follows a given route most of the time and it's painstakingly predictable once you played a lot.-------------------------------------------------------------8/10 Multiplayer - Awarded a 7.5 because multiplayer, as a concept for this game,is impossible without dedication and a group of friends to meet-up around the clock at various points during a week to pick up on ""the last save"". It's hard to set up, but boy it's so much fun. Really worth going for multi.Singleplayer rocks a lot if you don't manage to find friends.Cons: Time consuming, difficult to maintain a game or find people who will.-------------------------------------------------------------10/10 Game Mechanics - Combat and tactics are just so satisfying compared to old Civ games. Tech advances are meaningful. Territorial management makes you feel like you own your civilization. Balance is properly set, with the exception of the ""spawn roulette"" that will obviously give random locations with random benefits and resources. Maps are great. Modding community went to space and there's a lot to be imported from their work. Learning curve can go through your regular linear graphs. Everything is intuitive and easy to learn. One game that has a whole lot of depth.Cons: Haven't found any negatives on the game mechanic side-------------------------------------------------------------9/10 UI and Graphic style - Everything is smooth as butter. The Devteam have done a great job with this game and everything is polished. Graphic style fits beautifully with the nature of the game and it doesn't distract you from the important part: the game itself.Cons: I would love to have more data and info instead of this minimalism, but that's just me-------------------------------------------------------------DLCs aren't that great, the only real advantage for me would be the modding community, that usually moves fast towards modding the expansions.Cons: DLC/Expansions. They cost money and divide the community.-------------------------------------------------------------Big fan of this game and the series. Few games have managed to make me wish for ""one more turn"" until the sun rose the second day and my clock showed me 7 AM, and this is one of those games.The great heir to the previous stellar game and I recommend it to anyone with any of the following:- time on his hands- great love for strategy- great love for turn-based games- some playful love of history- friends you can play with- money to spare (check discounts if possible)~  ~  ~  ~  9 / 10  ~  ~  ~  ~			"

												I spent 28 hours, over four days building my empire. I spent every minute I could infront of the screen expanding and fconquering, trading and building, researching and discussing with other civilizations. Every second I was away from the computer this game was on my mind. When I closed my eyes I saw Ghengis Kahn fulfiling his destiny, trying to rule the world. I was fired from my job after attacking a customer that looked like Ghandi, screaming that he was the reason that my people were wearing blue jeans and listening to low quality music. I was driving down to dinner with my girlfriend, when we hit a rabbit, she broke down crying, hysterical, and urged me to get out of the car and help the slain animal, but all my mind could do is turn to her and say ""A single death is a tragedy. A million deaths is a statistic"". After four days I wasnt sleeping, only planning my next move, my eyes were red, my hair was falling out, and I couldn't stomach solid foods, only energy drinks. I lost to Washington of America, who got a scientific victory when I was one move away from taking over his capital city. Now I have no job, no friends, no girlfriend, and my family stopped talking to me, all because of four days I owned this game. All in all 10/10, would suggest to friends/SO/co-workers if I had any.

												Ah civilization. The game where 5 minutes can turn into an hour, where an hour can turn into two hours, where two hours can turn into four hours. This game will leave you thinking ""just one more turn and i'll save and quit"" but you sit for 50 or more turns. It can become a bit boring but at the same time fun as you mess up history by making Alexander the Great of Greece become the world leader in 2750 or Napoleon of France being the first person to launch a rocket into space. One thing i've learned from playing civ v is to NEVER trust ghandi when he has nukes -_-			"

												I got this game because my friend told me this was kind of similar to the Sims 3 (I love this game :3). It is quite fun so far: my people are building houses, learning archery, and getting cute horses to visit their neighbours. However, my asian neighbour isn't really friendly; he always wants to fight with my people (I know he's asian, because he introduced himself, and he said he was mongolian, and i know it is in Asia). Come on, he is worse than a high school girl. >:C Anyway! I gave him a bit of gold and then we stopped fighting and became best friends (forever i hope hihihi ^_^); i wish i could have made my soldier hug him, like in the Sims 3, but i couldn't find this option. Oh well. Lots of adventures ahead of me: i'm so excited! =D			"

												I had a family once. A life. Then i discovered Civilization 5. 'Come outside, daddy! It's snowing!', my child would say. 'In a minute, honey.', I'd reply, 'Monty is threatening me with war unless i meet his demands, and i can't look weak in front of Byzantine!'. Weeks passed. Centuries. My empire had grown large, powerful. I had it all in the palm of my hand. The Pyramids had rose before me. The secrets of the nuclear age were but a click before my command. My people were happy, lively. I had created not a kingdom, but an existence. But alas, all things must come to an end. The wife got sick of me not paying attention to her; The kids had already grown up and started going to school. I checked my hours on steam. '4102 hours on record? no..that can't be right!', i announced loudly. I arose from the chair, my sweat had partially ruined the leather seating at this point, and the smell made her gag. I begged, pleaded. 'Please, i love you! We all make mistakes! Take me back!..right after i finish this last turn!'. One turn. My army was in place for the final strike. All enemies, friends, allies would fall with this one swoop. All i needed was one final turn. It was my legacy, my life, my dedication..Or my family.In the end, looking back, i believe i made the right choice. Civ 5 is a hell of a good game, after all, and love comes and goes much easier than an alliance with Austria that doesn't end in a backstab.			"

												Dwarved by the expectations of feature-hungry fans and a remarkably successful history, the Civilization series is one of the last bastions of traditional, turn-based 4X strategy games, perhaps acting as the sole major life support for an increasingly whittling genre.In retrospect, it is a game that initially failed on many fronts. Upon launch it was rightly heavily criticised for under-performing in many aspects that Civ 4 had proudly refined - trading, religion, and diplomacy, amongst others. However, with the addition of both expansions, ""Brave New World"" and ""Gods and Kings"", Civ 5 recovered most of the features it had lost or underdelivered on. Regardless, issues regarding bugs, illogical AI, poor performance, online connectivity issues and abusively priced DLC remain open wounds to this very day. Firaxis has now had 4 years to deal with at least some of the game's remaining problems, but have instead neglected them, preferring to focus on Civilization: Beyond Earth.Overlooking the aforementioned issues, however, will reveal a deep, rewarding, well paced game in which planning ahead is rewarded with the chance to steamroll enemy civilisations. Victories can be achieved either using culture, tourism, science, military force, or diplomacy, laying the groundwork for day-long matches that can twist and turn whilst simultaneously providing endless intrigue, machiavellian scheming and gargantuan military campaigns. Rushing to build the next World Wonder is often equally as thrilling as pillaging a hostile city's tiles whilst trading with allied civilisations for emergency gold supplies in order to purchase those last few bombers needed to take the heavily fortified city. Should you prefer to take a more Littlefinger-esque approach, spies can steal technology, manipulate voting and even provide political intrigue and military intelligence; embargoes can cripple trade-based economies; even international congress votes can be traded for luxuries, resoruces and cities. Allegiances are frequently earned and lost, ensuring the game is never predictable, and with the seemingly endless policies, technologies, units and ways to turn your initial settlers into a sprawling, international empire, Civilisation 5 provides plenty of replayability to be a staple of your gaming time for years. Just bare in mind that if you want to get the most out of the game, you will absolutely have to read its built-in wiki to make up for the needlessley steep learning curve and often infuriating lack of vital information.

												This game is just perfect, as a Total War veteran I was a bit put off by the lack of TW's real time combat. I thought that I'd loose interest in managing a single map, well I was wrong. This game is so amazing that even if they'd scrap the combat entirely I'd still love it. Being my first Civilization game I found it really easy to get into and enjoy, the expansions are great too, although I didn't have much time to play Brave New World yet.I wholeheartedly recommend this game to veteran strategy fans and newcomers to the genre alike.

												Civilization V is one of the best turn-based strategy games I’ve ever had the pleasure of playing. Whether teaming up with my friends for some multiplayer, or simply losing a whole night of sleep to the game’s endlessly replayable single player, this is one game that any strategy enthusiast, or, hell anyone strat-curious should check out. Sure, I miss some of the deeper inter-civilization relations that the more defined religion and government setup brought in Civilization IV, but that’s nothing anyone new to the series will even think twice about. With all the tips, advisers and tools in place, this is the first Civilization for PC that I feel is worth just about every person’s time. Go forth and create, subdue, and exploit. Do as Firaxis has done, and bring Civilization to the masses.			"

UPDATED 2014Originally, I said in my review in 2011: ""Pretty good, but lacking a lot of features from Civ IV, reminds me more of a remake of Civ II at its core. Still as super addictive as the rest of the franchise with a few new twists.... Lots of DLCs to waste your money on too!""Fast forward to 2014, with more than a few hundred hours played under my belt, the game is officially complete with multiple small DLCs & balance/fix patches plus the 2012 & 2013 feature expansions in Gods & Kings and Brave New World which have significantly changed the gameplay. There are now a massive number of civilizations to choose too, not to mention a massive number of tailored scenarios to challenge you!The major expansions particularly, have really rounded the game off nicely, reintroducing many of the earlier missed features from Civ IV. Introduced more new things like world congress, advanced trade routes, tourism & cultural 'Great Works' to complement previously missing features like Religion & Espionage. Along with this content there was also balancing out all civilization victory paths providing some unique gameplay options to explore. There remains a more simplified approach to all of this, streamlining many features meaning less micro management. This does make the game more accessible to newer players, but in some ways feels perhaps too simplified now. It would have been good to still have more advanced micro management for those that are up to the challenge. Although more simplified game design, you will find more things to keep you busy. More end game content for example to cover those dull periods where things become stagnent. Then there is off course the huge number of achievements to unlock, many of which offer a true challenge (and sometimes a bit of luck!).Overall, even 4 years on from my first game, it is a game I always end up going back to. That is rare in the current generation of disposable gaming.It is the most enjoyable & rewarding strategy game around bar none! Just one more turn....If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations! "

 Not really sure about this one...I played some pre-Civ on console and started playing Civilization from Civ II onwards. Civ is a round-based strategy game, starting in the stone age and progressing up to the modern era. So you might face an archer in a tank battle, if you don't progress on the tech tree. Just to describe it in short.Note, I played Civ5 Gods & Kings but not BNW.All former Civs had something I missed in the later versions, but also lacked exactly what made their successors better - until Civ4 I think. I heard, Civ5 should have a better AI than Civ6 plus generally being the best thus far. I tend to disagree. I haven't played Civ6, but to me Civ4 is in many ways superior over Civ5:The differencesThey tweaked an awful lot compared to its predecessor; as always:- The hexagon tiles are interesting but also a bit confusing, trying to find your way.- Stacking is not possible at all anymore apart from one civilian unit together with one military one. Too extreme for me. I understand that endless stacking is stupid, but 2-3 units would have been ok.- They tried to make culture more relevant, but for me went overboard on it. Culture points now unlock benefits, called social policies, which were in a way introduced in Civ4. It is just unlocked by accumulating culture this time.BNW offers a competitive version of culture, called ""tourism"". Which seems to be similar to the old ""cultural pressure"".- The military promotion system from Civ4 stays in place, but to me got somehow worse. Same counts for the Great Generals and now even Admirals. I preferred the Civ4 GG's. These new GG's are more or less useless and less of a help than in Civ4.- As you may have heard, Civ5 puts greater emphasis on ranged units. Positive, that they got a range improvement, but just awkward for the navy battles.- City states can become a nuisance, whose quests replace the ""events"" of Civ4. - Religion got also bloated up and is more confusing than ever. Inquisitors are a good thing though.- They introduced a ""religious currency"" solely for religious units and one building. Not sure whether this was worth it.- The leader traits are more individual but also less levelled and very specific, if you take Austria, the Ottomans and Ethopia for example. I preferred again the Civ4 system with a handful leader traits and 2 different for each leader. - Graphics are only marginally better than the ones of Civ4, if at all.- Abolishing the production change penalty was a good idea together with the up and down rank function for the production queue. - Last point: Bismarcks ""Blood and Iron"" speech was not about war-mongering but was an answer to the bullsquid parliament of the Vienna Congress. So, he was a genius diplomat and not a warmonger as Civ has always depicted him thus far.The one option which I miss since Civ 2Am I the only one who wants that or is Fireaxis simply too slow to come to it: It is great starting the game in the era I choose, but why can't I finish it in a chosen era???Like for example, I want to start in the Ancient Era, but wanna stop at the Renaissance age tech tree-wise. Ok, space ship victory might not be possible then, but apart from that, it would be so easy to implement and much more fun, if I for once have to dominate a world with knights or even swordsmen and horse archers. I just don't get it, why this option doesn't exist.VerdictCiv used to have a few years in between their sequels, a few years where technology made major strives, which obviously changed now.Civ 5 is not a bad game at all, but compared to Civ4, it got needlessly complicated w/o gaining much benefit of it. There are indeed minor improvements, like the production queue for example, but it comes at the price of all the other novelties. To me, Civ4 Beyond The Sword remains the best of them all: It had all the core mechanics Civ5 has, but was far more straightforward and less tempered with.If you never played Civilization before, I would recommend the Civ4 Complete Edition. Still Civ5 is not a bad buy. Greatest time waster of all time!			"

												Civilization games keep getting better and better!  Civilization V is the latest, and arguably the greatest in the series.  Lots of leaders to pick from, and every expansion has added a lot of depth to the game.  With several victory conditions and different civilizations with their own strengths and weaknesses to choose from, replayability is endless.  Playing with friends in a FFA against AI's civs for hours at a time is also fun.  Highly recommended if you're a turn-based strategy fan.			"

												If you came here looking for a review, you have come to the wrong place, but if you want some bomb-♥♥♥ brownies, you have come to the right place. You're welcome for an actual recipe, not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ copy and paste pie recipe. Trust me nothing goes wrong with nutella.INGREDIENTS:1 c. unsalted butter2 c. sugar1/2 tsp. salt1 c. flour1 c. cocoa powder4 eggs1 (13-oz.) jar Nutella5 Ferrero Rocher candies, unwrapped and crumbledDIRECTIONS:1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.2. Melt butter in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar, stirring until combined. 3. Remove from heat and add salt, flour, and cocoa powder, stirring to combine. Whisk in eggs, stirring just until the mixture is combined into a batter. Set aside.4. Spray an 8""-x-8"" pan with cooking spray. Pour half of the batter into the pan. Spoon or lightly drizzle most of the Nutella on top of the batter, forming an even layer over the brownie batter. 5. 5. Use a spoon or silicone spatula to cover the Nutella with the remaining brownie batter. (If you pour the batter straight on top of the Nutella, it will sink into the Nutella and combine into one marbled—yet delicious—mess.)6. Bake until the top layer of brownies has browned and set, 28 to 30 minutes. It shouldn’t jiggle when you remove it from the oven. (The toothpick test doesn’t work here, since the toothpick will hit the Nutella layer, making the brownies seem uncooked.)7. Let cool for 15 to 20 minutes, then top with a drizzle of Nutella and crumbled Ferrero Rocher chocolates. Cut into squares and serve.-Credits Algau1			"

												This game is ok but im waiting for Sid Meier's Civilization Vl: The Return of Gandhi. In this game you are tricked into thinking Gandhi is a scrub but you find out that he is really just trying to kill you. I really want people to buy this game just so they can feel the wrath of Gandhi. 10/10 Gandhi is actually my great great great grandfather.			"

												Let me tell you a story of love, loss, and nuclear weaponry.I was young, the leader of the Roman Empire. This Empire stretched from Jerusalem, past Germany, and all the way down to Cape Town. . I had constructed the Great Wall, and I had over 30 ground units and 50 Naval Units.Needless to say, I was the most powerful player in the game.While exploring the rest of the Earth however, I met Catherine the Great, the leader of the Russian people.She was the most beautiful person I ever laid my eyes upon.Sadly, I couldn't understand her because she was, well, Russian. But I loved her, and I was determined to make this work.However, she got angry at me because I was too clingy.So I nuked her entire Empire.My dreams of a happy life had been lost, and I, Agustus Caeser, was angry with the world.Soon I went on a rampage, killing every unit, bombing every city, and conquering every Empire.Then my computer crashed. I forgot to save. I realized that I had been playing for forty five hours, and it was all for nothing. Within those forty five hours, I forgot to feed my dog. My mother (who was in the hospital) died. I missed the job interview for a job that would pay me $500,000 a year. Something flew through my window and layed eggs in my freezer. My house payment was due, and I skipped it.But then I realized: Doesn't Sid Meier's Civilization 5 have an auto save feature?And it turns out it auto saved right before my computer crashed.I went on about killing everyone, happily ever after.10/10 like this if you cry everytime			"

												Definitely the most engaging strategy game I have ever played, but it is not for everyone.To start off with the cons: This game will take a couple hundred hours to learn to a decent level, and if you are considering buying it... do yourself a favor and buy at least the Brave New World DLC with it, or you will be missing about half of the game and will have to deal with an unnacceptably broken combat system. Also the multiplayer servers are extremely unreliable, it is very difficult to play out a full game with random players (if everyone in the game is your friend you can save the game regularly, and reinvite everyone when it crashes).Unlike most strategy games, Civilization V is much more than simply military confrontation/combat. Every player leads one of histories civilizations from the start of time, when military combat is limited to club warriors and ancient archers, and your empire consists of a single, small, undeveloped town, until the information era, by which time the players in the lead would have nuclear weaponry, modern armor, helicopter gunships, internet, and stealth fighters, and your civilization could have over a dozen cities, each up to 50 times larger than your original village. The success of your civilization depends not only on your battlefield prowess, although it is a necessary component, but in your ability to build your civilizations economy, science, and culture faster than your neighboring civilizations, and in keeping your civilizations population happy. A serious setback in any of these parameters will affect all of them, and will allow other civilizations in the game to bypass you, and eventually either destroy you or win peacefull through science, culture, or diplomacy. A major positive about the game, especially in singleplayer, is the diversity of the strategies you can use, with each particular civilzation usually suited only to one or two win conditions.			"

												Sid Meier really is a crazy guy. he divided the world into hexagons to make this hexagon warfare simulator. peter molyneux must;ve rolled in his grave when he saw this. anyway, this is Civilization V which is a game where you have a  city and then it expands and you steamroll other cities. it's more of a colonialism game but then only people who look back on colonialism fondly use the word ""civilization"". what bugs me here is that India's leader is Gandhi, so when i built loads of trebuchets and annexed Paris my brain literally exploded into tiny pieces because i couldnt comprehend it. either way, Gandhi's likeness is pretty well imagined here, much better than Ben Kingsley's weirdly long head. good hexagonal tessellation game			"

												With many games more and more emphasizing adrenaline-pumping action, playing a slower paced strategy game like Civilization can be refreshing. Indeed, Civilization V is the kind of game you can sit down, popcorn and soda in hand, and become completely engrossed in political crises, border tensions, and epic battles. While it may not train your reflexes or aiming abilities, you'll certainly find yourself performing insane feats of balance as you try to maintain your Civilization's military defense, culture, scientific advancement, religious development, and economic power. You'll find a game that is admittedly not immediately exciting, but which will involve the player in incredibly complex situations, never playing out the same way each time, always offering a new story.However, there are some valid criticisms worth considering. I will address two primary problems with the game that are connected to smaller issues others have brought up. Firstly, much depth and complexity present in Civilization IV has been stripped from the game, and it shows. In Civilization IV, leaders acted very often according to their historical personalities -- Gandhi would have an aversion to war, wheras Genghis Khan might be attracted to the possibility -- in Civ V, Gandhi will happily crush your entire country to seize your spice resources. The hostility and viciousness of the AI in Civ V, by contrast, detracts from the game's believability. Besides the hostility of the computer players, they are also gloriously stupid, they make insane trade offers, demand whole cities in wartime when they are losing, and capitulate in war when they have the advantage. As deep and involving as the game is, the AI manages to detract from the experience often enough to be worth mentioning.The second criticism worth considering is that too often it breaks the spell of depth and plays more like a strategy game. It IS a strategy game yes, but the game is also about civilization, and how complex and wonderfully intertesting human society can be, and sometimes the play to win mentality that is inherent in the game (especially it's AI) as well as many of the players can weaken the game's ability to absorb the player into the story of human civilization.Beyond these criticisms, the game presents itself well, the interface is much cleaner compared to previous iterations in the series, and the warfare much more interesting. In previous titles, units could be stacked on top of one another, so often the winning of wars came down to who had the most material power to build the biggest unit stacks. As a result of the removal of unit stacking, material power will help, but an ability to position units correctly and actually strategize will win you the battle even in the event you are outnumbered. Thus Civilization V may rightly boast of having the best combat and warfare the series has seen. However shallow the game can be at its' worst, it's intensely engaging and dramatic in the most positive sense at its' best -- every action that is simple or basic in one game is dramatically important in Civilization. For example, moving units close to another Civilization's borders, somewhat tedious and uninteresting at face value, raises the tension as you prepare for an epic war against their evil, imperialistic civilization. In the context of world civilizations, all actions become pronounced and important -- helping the game tell a story of warring global civilizations in crisis rather than simply telling the story of a competitive match between two players, each trying to win. That dramatic worldly context is what allows the game to tell such interesting new stories upon each playthrough and definitely what makes the game so incredibly addicting, involving, and engaging. Despite the admittedly valid criticisms, I couldn't possibly recommend this game more.			"

Sid Meier’s Civilization V – Complete Edition is a turned-based 4X strategy game. From the stone age to the space age, lead your civilization to span the globe, competing against your rivals as you establish cities, research technologies and build your units to stand the test of time. This review is based on the game with all DLCs and both Gods & Kings and Brave New World expansions.Pros: Bringing the game to hexagons and limiting it to 1 unit per tile, are two bold steps away from past versions that completely changed how strategy worked in this game, as you must now plan, prepare and place your units for assaults and sieges. You have a huge selection of factions to chose from, each of their leaders being memorable opponents that may end up as friends or foes depending of which religion they adopt in the early game, or which social ideology they identify to in the late game. Will you use brute force to have your armies march through your enemies, overrun other cultures with yours with the tourism generated by your artists, writers, musicians or artifacts from archaeological digs, use trade routes and influence to have other nations and city states to elect you World Leader of the united nations, or surpass humanity’s science as you send the first interstellar ship to Alpha Centauri?Cons: There is no story or quests in a game, and only a few scenarios. The AI negotiation, although better than past Civilizations, is still broken when it comes to negotiating or reasoning with it. The game itself is a resource hog, and the game will slow down in late game no manner how powerful your PC is.Verdict: ★★★★★ - Play this. Now.I strongly recommend this game! The replayability is incredible, you can play a thousand games and never play the same one twice. The variety of civilizations allow you to try different approach, different styles and different strengths with each play through.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												Sid Meier's Civilization V is a 4X turn-based strategy from 2K Games. Once you start playing this, you can't stop. Civilization V is just a good game. It has one more turn factor which makes you want to keep playing even when you already won.Sid Meier's Civilization V has very deep and challenging gameplay. You start from scratch with only a settler and a warrior, build your first capital city, then keep building up your nation/empire. From the dark age of 4000 BC, the dawn of human civilization to the modern globalization age of 2000 AD, you forge your empire from a single capital city and then expand and build more city, do research to strengthen your empire in all aspect, create military power for defense purpose or go on a global conquest, and manage your national economy, culture and diplomacy with other faction. Every unit can be leveled up just like an RPG games which make every unit is unique and count. You can even rename those unit when they level up to make them a little more personal. Choose your own path for your civilization, war, peace, culture, science, all will lead you to great victory.Sid Meier's Civilization V has good graphics quality overall. The maps are beautiful. Unit and city has quite good detail. The UI is also great, you can switch between tactical and world map view.This game is very great and addicting. Sometimes which is most of the times, even if you already won the game, you still continue playing it. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Firaxis Games, AspyrPublishers: 2K Games, Aspyr Initial release: Sept 2010Genre: 4X, Strategy #Worth/NotWorth: #Worth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationNo one ever said Civilizations were civil. Now, I cannot speak to you in a tone that would imply complete knowledge of this game or of the 4X genre in general. As this is my first foray into the genre. So I will speak to you in a tone that a posthumous contender in the pursuit of world domination or maybe just I want to build a spaceship guy might use. I've found this game to be extremely daunting at first but wanting to break its doors down as so many people seem to have hundreds if not thousands of hours playing this game I decided I needed to finally give it a real shot. After 4 and ½ games or so I can easily see why someone spends hundreds of hours in this game. I tried doing the tutorials at first and despite their contrived nature to teach the games mechanics I found them to be constraining my idea of what these games were about to begin with. So I decided to jump into a game and just see what happens and figure it out as I went. I started on Beginner difficulty (there is actually one below that but it seems that almost seems like a sandbox of sorts.) I found myself understanding more than I thought I would right off the bat. I ran through 2 games  after about 15-17 hours. I progressively started understanding the tech tree a little more each time. Each time getter better and better. Understanding what I needed to do stave off unwanted attacks as well take cities that were becoming a nuisance to my empire. As well what tiles were good for building cities. Luxuries and resources. However, not everything was understood in the beginning. I didn't actually understand what it was I was supposed to be doing to WIN. After all this was a game and not just an exercise in making the map one color. I actually googled what winning exactly meant in these games and so I came across the 5 ways of 'winning' or victory conditions in Civilization V. Domination – This requires you to be the last empire still in control of your original capitol.Science – This requires building a spaceship and having it launch from your capitol (This is my favorite)Diplomatic – This requires that a majority of City States find your empire the most favorable.Cultural – This requires the you complete 5 trees in the social policy branches. Time – This requires you have the highest overall score at turn 500 At this time I have only won using the Science and Domination conditions. I actually turn off Time condition because after about turn 400 every thing feels very rushed and I find I enjoy Civ in a much greater capacity if things are more relaxed.There really isn't much more to say without writing an extensive 1000 page guide should I ever acquire that much knowledge in this realm of game. Its a very addicting game. At no point does someone say I need to go to bed, just one more turn and then proceed to ONLY do one more turn. I now play on Price difficulty which is two higher than beginner and seems to be a nice balance  from what more experienced players have said of relaxing but still difficult gameplay. THE GISTThis game opened me up to a new genre. One of those genres that some people seem to exclusively play stay for the occasional CRPG or something of the like. I remember one game I played when it was 9pm, I had decided I had played enough and needed to get some other things done. The next time I looked up at the clock it was 3am. I never said I was good at moderation.Follow my curation for more "

												My Iroquois country spreads over the world rapidly, being appeared differently in relation to torment by my adversaries. Considering all things, this sensibly little collecting of individuals was everything beside wiped out before the end of the twentieth century, however in my redirection, they are an oblige to be figured with - a country wresting control of the oceans with present day sea qualities, and conveying urban domains by constrain with infantry and tanks. Demonstrate Destiny goes up against a radical new significance; by 2010, I've consistently yet obviously vanquished the Americans and other European countries, controling them to my run the show up... on the other hand essentially blasting their once-haughty countries to singing remains. This is the thing that Civilization V is about. It's a turn-based framework redirection based around working up a picked society into a urge to be figured with. Furthermore, yes, Civilization V can look truly incapacitating to the pleasant passerby, however for the individual in charge of the beguilement every turn can incite a critical choice, giving the player a specific conclusion control that few, tolerating any, distractions mastermind. Human progress has no battle, rather it essentially permits the players to make a universe of their enumerating and bob clearly into it either with no other individual's data or with others in multiplayer. The best decision a player will pick up is the thing that human ground they're going to play. Every human progress is driven by an extraordinary pioneer from history, and gets a couple of uncommon purposes of intrigue and units, so its essential to consider what kind of triumph you're out to accomplish before setting your nationality. For example the French get social rewards that give them a tremendous reward towards a social triumph, while playing Germany will give players access to capable military units like the Panzer tank that can help in expecting control over the world by oblige. Plainly you can simply pick a military-centered pioneer and take them on a course towards a social triumph, yet this will in like way demonstrate a more crucial test. Other than picking a country, players can advance re-attempt their condition by exchanging between decisions, for example, whether the world will be made of a few domains or not, what period they begin in (Civ moves in times, for example, Medieval, Renaissance, and whatnot., which besides impacts the level of improvement you have authorization to), and what number of different group establishments they wish to fight with. It generally makes for unbounded replayability, giving players a vital contraption set to make the test they require in of the world again and again. In like manner, judgment yes, this is the kind of joy that you need to simply play again and again. Like its forerunners, Civilization V is amazingly addictive, with beguilements frequently drawing more than five or six hours out of me in a solitary sitting. The reason? Since win or lose, Civilization V awards players to facilitate a whole society and distinguishing strength their own particular story, taking them from the most punctual beginning stage of history and far into what's to come. I adore taking the Japanese and making them into a serene nation who needs just to make Opera houses and win over their neighbors through their way of life, or take the Aztecs and shape them into a genuine imperialistic country that is totally rightist and concentrated on overall control. Human progress V truly is the thing that you make of it, and for me it's a decent approach to manage relate exchange stories about some of history's most interesting countries. I say Civilization V is basically ""unprecedented"" - and ""wouldn't fret boggling,"" as I would have said as for Civilization IV - at making stories since I feel like the beguilement's taken away some extremely essential contraptions for re-attempting your general populace. In Civilization IV players could oblige things on their nation and discrediting countries as religions and government. In Civilization V, in any case, players get together ""culture"" as an advantage, spending it each such a significant number of turns on ""approachs"" that give their change rewards. For example a player may put approach focuses into the ""Devotion"" tree, giving their country a support to joy and persuading them to perceive a puzzling religion. I truly regard the way the particular framework trees give players a wide gathering of customization choices for their country, regardless I miss the power and strange cheer I got out doing things like persuading Judaism down the throats of my adversaries in light of the way that my Jewish Japanese space was out to win owning the hearts and brains of my neighbors. Human propel V is one of the best turn-based system redirections I've ever had the joy of playing. Whether collaborating with my partners for some multiplayer, or basically losing an entire night of rest to the enjoyment's constantly replayable single player, this is one redirection that any method aficionado, or, destruction anybody strat-inquisitive ought to look at. Irrefutably, I miss a gap of the more critical between human progress relations that the more portrayed religion and government setup got Civilization IV, yet that's nothing anybody new to the approach will even consider. With every one of the tips, assistants and instruments set up, this is the key Civilization for PC that I feel is worth for all intents and purposes each person's time. Simply ahead and make, control, and mishandle. Do as Firaxis has done, and go on Civilization to the masses.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time. In my religion, this is known as Art(TM), but you can call it ""Threewording"")			"

												One of my favorite examples of how you can streamline an experience, make a game more approachable and still keep it deep. Civilization V was my first civ game, mostly because it was the first I thought I could learn to play in a day. Civ V even forgoes traditional tutorials and teaches you as you play with help messages. The game is big enough last you dozens of hours of gameplay before it start getting repetitive and if you get hooked you can play it for years. There's a big and traditional community that produces good mods or stuff like Giant Multiplayer Robot that allows asynchronous play. most of DLC is hit of miss but I'd say Brave New World is a must have and I won't ever play this game without it. I recommend getting the most complete bundle when it's on sale.			"

This game does a great job of teaching you various ways of how to play the game.  I won't spoil too much...but i will say keep an eye on your ""real world"" clock/time. You can lose 6 hours just casually playing this game...which i find a little troubling.

Another really impressive thing is multiplayer option which thanks to turn-based game system is really interesting and well designed.

												Between the original version, the Gods and Kings expansion, and now Brave new World, I've accumulated 500 hours of gameplay, and it doesn't look like that's stopping any time soon. By itself, Civ V is one of the best strategy games I've ever played; with the right mods (of which there are plenty), it becomes truly addictive.Generally, one of my biggest gripes with empire-building games is that your empire supports your military conquests. In CiV, your military supports your empire. I have maybe one game in ten where I'll initiate a war; most of the time, I'm way too busy creating the most dominant empire in the land. And it varies every time: right now I'm pushing a game where my religion covered half the globe; the game before that, my scientific accomplishments were second to none. Every game is different; if you play the same way every time, you're not going to get far.I can't emphasize enough how important it is to get both expansion packs. Gods and Kings was praised for adding the religion mechanic, but its primary benefit is a major revamp of the combat system and technology tree that makes both of them so much more neat and logical. Brave New World drastically alters both the culture and the diplomacy victories, and both are for the better, forcing you to put effort into those victories through the whole game.And get mods. I can't tell you which ones to get, but absolutely get some. As you play the game, you'll start to notice little things you wish it did differently. And 90% of the time, someone's already made a mod to fix that. I'm playing with over a dozen right now. Some make wonders more usable, some add more luxury resources or religions, one of them makes scouts usable past the medieval era and another removes the cap on XP you can get from barbarians, and a whole mess more. I've actually reached a point where I'm mixing and matching my mods based on what type of game I'm trying to run. This game will very likely become my #1 most played game, and pretty much the only thing that's going to stop me from accumulating 1,000 hours in it is Life. Put this game on your wishlist, pick up the expansion packs during steam sales, and get addicted.			"

												Civilization, a series of computer games as synonymous with turn-based strategy as the old tabletop board game ""Risk"".I got to play the original Civilization in its hay-day on an old IBM using DOS to fire it up in wonder. The following seven nights were spent doing nothing but playing Civ, and Civilization 5 embodies nearly all of the same traits and innovations that made the original so great.I've spent a couple hundred hours last year in Civ5 with Gods & Kings and loved every minute. I recently purchased the newest expansion but haven't completely explored the additional game-mechanics much since even after this long, I'm still trying to master to base games mechanics and the religion that Gods and Kings introduced.But over-all, Civ5 is the turn-based strategy game to currently end all turn-based strategy games. If you've never played a Civilization game before, that's just fine, Civ5 can be a perfect introduction to turn-based strategy. Or if you've played all the previous games nearly to death like I have, this game will completely kick-down the door to almost everything you wanted from the other games. The hexagon tiles took a little bit of getting used to for me, but since its something I remember from the first big table-top games I ever played, I don't mind it at all and think it adds a bit of an old school feeling to the board.There are a few hang-ups in the animations / unit movements (aircraft orders need an over-haul because they drastically tie up your time in late game in comparison to any other unit) but other than that, graphically Civ5 is beautiful and the board features and resources are about as detailed and distinct as your computer can handle. The sound and music is immersive and high quality as you might expect from an A-list Sid Meier game.The interface and controls are almost perfect in my opinion. A couple data-charts are a little bit buried down through the menus, but I can't really complain about that since even ""buried down"" in the menus at worst only means 2 or 3 layers into readily accessible options anyway. So nothing is very far away. Testament to the games refined user interface, I think, would be the fact that many gamers have easily played Civ5 with a console-gaming style controller with the upcoming SteamBox ""living-room PC."" And that's definitely saying something substantial when talking about as complex a turn-based strategy game as Civ5.Ultimately, I'd say this would go on my Top 10 of all time. Definitely worth purchasing and supporting the developers who brought it to us.			"

												Probably one of the best games I've played.  It has a lot of great mods to it, which lets me play as the Civilizations of my favorite TV shows/video games.  At first I was a bit unsure on how good the game actually was, but after about an hour of playing it I got the hang of it and it has now become one of my favorite strategy games that I own.  I do enjoy other strategy games, but I prefer this one the most.  Now if you are thinking about getting this game, be warned that it is addicting.  I have played hours upon hours of this game.  After a while of playing you will say ""One more turn.  One more turn.  One more turn.""  and eventually you'll get to about 100 or 200 extra turns.  Is it just me there?  Because that's what I do.  But anyway, this is an amazing game and I suggest it to all my friends (one of my friends that doesn't enjoy strategy games too much even likes this one) and I suggest this to whoever is reading it.  I give this game a 5/5.			"

												This game.. Wow.. It literally consumes you in a game that introduces so many cool and interesting elements, the A.I can act a bit strange at lower difficulty but just raise the difficulty and you'll have alot more fun, however if you're gonna buy i buy all the DLC's they add so much more content which is absolutely amazing, a great variety of civilizations to play as every civ has special abilities which all are different, some may seem more OP but you can win with any civ if you stick to a play style, the game offers alot of history aswell if you're interested in it, the research system is very cool and works great, the same goes for the World Congress which has alot of cool bonuses and such, the game overall is just an amazing add to the franchise and is the best of them all and it's easy to learn, pick this game up if you like strategy games or even board games this game WILL take up alot of time in your life and you'll find yourself playing hundreds of hours, this game is a master piece.

												After playing vanilla, Gods and Kings and finally spending 50 hours on Brave New World, I can finally review this. I was VERY sceptical about CivV. After CivIV, I thought it couldn't be better, and when I first saw CivV, I decided to stick to IV. The vanilla game is....unfinished. There are features missing you'd find in other civ games in the base game, like religion. With Gods and Kings, the game finally becomes playable and is somewhat good. But after buying Brave New World, I can finally say this game is worth it. With all the features it gives you, CivV is a great 4x strategy game offering countless hours of fun. Damn, with all the DLCs and expansions, i can't even say which is better, IV or V. Compared to previous civilization games, I have to mention the new features like Social Policies and Ideologies and caravans, which are great and work really well. Civ V is also much easier to get into for new players than previous Civ games.City states are a new feature as well. Being friends with them brings you various benefits, but you can play the bad guy as well and annex the hell out of them. Religion is very well made. You practically make your own - select symbol, name it and select perks which give you various bonuses. You can also reform it later and add more perks.Despite my initial doubts, the change from squares to hexes helped the game to feel more vivid. Changes to war unit system (no more multiple military units on one field) make the war more strategical and you can actually change the balance of power in the late game (unlike in CivIV where war in late game meant stalemate no matter how much units you pumped in) . I love how the culture is remade. It not only expands your cities but you also buy social policies with it. And what's more, with BNW you also generate tourism which can culturally influence other civilizations and take them over. In short: if you like 4X strategies, get the complete edition of CivV. It's totally worth it. Pros:Looks goodWith BNW, it's a true successor of Civ seriesCity states, social policies and all other new features are very well made and fit together very wellIt's so good it's a timesinker.Cons: AI turns take long to computeCould be better optimized (but no stuttering or lags, rather textures unloading and reloading etc.)Mods not working in multiplayer (although they should according to their description)It's so good it's a timesinker.

												For fans of the strategy genre, Civ 5 can probably be regarded as the Granddaddy of 4X. Pick a historical empire, build your civilisation in anyway you want and win in a variety of ways (from war to trade, to culture and science).Civ 5 is slow paced at the start but is one of the most engaging strategies on the market, with a simple interface meaning that you don't get bogged down by ugly text.Unlike many other strategies, Civ 5 seems simple - but is hard to master.And if you get bored, there are almost infinite number of user modifications available from the Workshop.

												As an experienced Civ series player, Civ V had a rough start initially and was inferior to the expanded version of Civ IV.  However, just as Civ IV progressed, so did Civ V through the years.  This review reflects Civ V with the 2 expansions (Gods and Kings and Brave New World).Once again, we face the ""Just one more turn"" syndrome that this game has always provided.  This 4x turn-based strategy game continues to evolve by enhancing the multiple victory conditions for the game.  Many scenarios are available and the Steam Workshop for Civ now creates easily assessible mods for the game to increase replayability.  The AI still makes strategic mistakes, but evens out a bit at the higher difficulty levels due to AI bonuses/player penalties,  The end-game has greatly improved over previous iterations of the series due to the enhancements to diplomatic and cultural victory conditions.The replayability and replayability of Civ V is so good, that I will nitpick on a couple of areas for improvement (and mods are out that resovle this too).  Those improvement areas are to make the different cultures even more unique (more unique looks between the cultures) and speeding up the preformance on huge maps.  Otherwise, this Civ V with the DLCs is an excellent game that will take up just one more turn.			"

												Finally, Civ 5 reaches it potential with the release of Brave New World (I had to play it for many hours to gauge it all). It is still missing one more expansion to finish fleshing the game out, but it's pretty good. I love the 1UPT mechanic, but despise the warmonger penalty. Overall I'm very satisfied with the game in this state. Plenty of fun scenarios if you buy the complete version of the game. Lots and lots of replayability at the higher difficult settings.			"

The best game ever made! Civilization has been around since I can think (I dare say that start in the late 80ies). Since about 1990 I played Civ 1, Civ 2, Civ 3 and for years I played Civilization 4 and thought it could not get better! But it did!Civilization 5 takes it to a new level! Everything has so much more meaning, is simpler or just makes more fun! Let me give you some examples:Combat systemIn every part of Civ before this was determined by how many units can you possibly stack on one field, march through enemy territory and wreak havoc. Now in Civ 5 tactics really matters! Move your units carefully, organize a retreat of heavily wounded veterans and bring fresh units to the front. Range units finally have a range! Terrain matters! I was sceptic playing a demo of Civ 5 some years back, but I'm converted!Religion & DiplomacyIn Civ 4 religion was only about bringing in some extra cash once you built the holy shrine of that religion. Now it has meaning! You can customize your religion to match the victory you strive for. Heading for a military victory? Give your units a combat bonus near cities of your religion and prepare your conquest with missionaries. Going for culture? Pick a belief that grants you bonus culture from terrain around your cities! Great!City states - first I thought what useless crap they were. Again I'm converted: A diplomatic victory is much fun and you can easily spoil other players bloodthirst with winning diplomatically before being conquered.IdeologiesThe modern age pendant to religion: Again you can decide between three different ways of winning and customize it to your needs. And it's all so easy!!! I have the feeling they ADDED MORE features to Civilization while at the same time making it MORE SIMPLE!ScenariosMy god, scenarios! There's loads of them and the official ones provide an incredibly deep playing experience! Story, historical background, it's amazing! It even pushed me to publish strategy guides on my own blog!___________________________________So if you're still not sure whether you should go for it - trust people who have more than 1,000h play time! Do it! Get it! Play it! Enjoy it! Have fun!PS: Yes, it still has the ""one more turn"" factor - an absolute MUST for Steam Award Nomination in the category ""Just 5 More Minutes”!!!			"

												The first Civ game I've played properly (tried demos and such with the older ones)Always been into stragedy and epic scale empire/war games, but always prefred the TotalWar series as it had the Turn-Based empire building and the Real-Time battles, I just assumed Civ games would bore me or I would miss the real battles to much, as like any of the big Turn based games (EuropaUniversals, CrusaderKings etc..) the battles in Civ's are just on the campaign map, and are the rock-paper-scissor unit V unit fights, always just imagined that as boring and would take away from the feeling of them being your units or being real flights.I was hella wrong. Theres a really nice feel and charm to watching your units fight it out, esp sending bombers to far away cities, or maybe a nuke. Sending some crossbowman to rain arrows down on bandits, or parachuting marines across Islands and so on..The fights just taking place on the campaign maps also lets the game be extremely well polished as its just one genre/area to work on, unlike say the TotalWars which are real-time and turn-based in one, and leads to a jack of all trades but master of none, as we all know how janky the TW series is.Well Civ5 is the fecking master alright, Brilliant game and daftly addicting. Got it in Crimbo sale and I've not played much else since.Buy it, its in humble-bundle right now for silly cheap price. No excuses.			"

												Play the game.Mod the game.Read guides on the game.Play the game some more.This has become one of my favorite games, if you love history or like strategy games (or both like me) than do yourself a favor and pick this game up! Pros+Good graphics, detailed leader-scenes.+Simple enough mechanics to grasp in a few hours, but complex enough to take a few hundred hours to master. I have nearly 600 hours and i'm still learning new stuff and mastering old stuff.+Good variety of (fairly balanced) civs. A lot of Civs have unique and fun play-styles like Venice only having 1 city but double trade routes, Polynesias incredible naval recon and warfare and Brazils amazing mod-game tourism output come to mind.+Good amount of history to learn, it's also made me look at other cultures (Hawaiian and plains-native americans) completely different and made me more interested in them.+Great mods, ever want to conquer North Korea as Beavis and Butthead? Or Patrick Star? You can do that! The modding community is not as awesome as Civ IVs but its still amazing.+Ximicacan! Ximicacan! Ximicacan!-Cons-Serious con: Vanilla Civ V isn't that great, the game becomes truly great with its expansion packs so try to buy the complete edition if you can!-Unit variety could use some major work. It just doesn't feel right using Polynesian trebuchets, Mayan Frigates and Zulu Crossbowmen etc.-Tech tree isn't quite as expansive as in Civ IV.-Some civs are just boring and uninteresting like America or Iroquois. -Game has made me neglect my other games...

												There's no other game quite like it (even EU IV/CK). Has a lower learning curve in comparison, but it's still a sizable beast to conquer; there are lots of intricate mechanics and strategies you can find yourself learning hundreds of hours into the game. Oh, and it takes forever to finish a game even on Quick so if you're the impatient type, this game may not be for you unless you go Duel/Quick every game.MP is fun. AI becomes much too predictable, so introducing the unpredictability of human thinking into the equation naturally mixes things up. The team mechanics for Co-op are interesting at first, but besides sharing beakers for research, there really isn't much to it and you often end up fighting for things like wonders, land and city-states like any competitor would. Also, no achievements can be unlocked through MP (except the one...), which is mind-boggling. As someone who dislikes the AI, it is annoying having to jump back into SP to get the achievements I would otherwise have received through normal play.Balance wise, there are some aspects that could be improved; there are obviously superior wonders, civs, even resources (I'm looking at you, salt), as well as obviously inferior ones like Angkor Wat, Denmark and most of the plantation luxuries. Some units also have pretty crappy ugprade routes -- Pikeman, the most accessible and strongest Medieval melee unit suddenly becomes an at-best situational anti-cavalry Lancer, and the Crossbowman, also the most accessible and strongest Medieval ranged unit becomes a one range Gatling Gun. Range is huge in this game, so increasing the damage in compensation for the lost one tile of range is like cutting someone, then offering them a band-aid. Technical specifications wise, the graphics are a nice upgrade from IV (and for a game released in 2010, it's fair). Some of the music is pretty awesome, but they're easily forgettable and as I already listen to other music while I'm playing, turning off the music hasn't impacted me at all. All in all, a 9/10. I know most of my review has been negative, but anything not mentioned here, I generally endorse. These were some more pedantic gripes and very subjective, so as always, take everything with a massive mound of salt (those OP ♥♥♥♥ers). P.S. Obligatory ""One more turn...""   "

												Civ has come along way from Civ 1 all those years ago. It's good but you could easily get Civ 4 with Beyond the Sword and have just a good Civ experience. Not that there is anything wrong with the changes that Civ 5 brings such as using hexagon tiles, 1 unit per tile, city states, etc. I hope for a Civ 6 which blends the best bits of Civ 5 and 4. You could encapsulate it as Civ 5 for the combat and Civ 4 for the empire management.If you do get it make sure you get atleast the Brave New World expansion. Even better is the complete edition which adds this and the Gods and Kings expansion and all the other dlc. This is often on sale for much less than the base game. So that is very much worth it.			"

Say Goodbye To TomorrowHave you ever had that feeling of ""Wow, summer is nearly over?"" or maybe ""It's almost the end of the month already?""Prepare to have that feeling over and over again while playing the masterpiece of Civilization V. This is the kind of game that almost literally sucks you in and immerses you in it's gameplay. Few games have the ability to keep you so focused that you lose track of time completely. One beautiful aspect of Sid Meier's Civilization V is how the game presents win conditions. In many games today, you're only given one option to finish a job and that's usually the option of killing everything on the screen. That isn't the case with Civ V. While you can fight your way to the top, you can also get through the game using clever diplomacy. Maybe instead of diplomacy you'd rather develop your country's scientific endeavors to win the space race. You might be the kind of person who prefers art and culture, though, so you could also focus on that and become the most cultured civilization ever known.All of these options are completely valid for clearing the game....And you will be clearing the game quite often because the replay value is tremendous. I thankfully bought all of the DLC while it was on sale, but the DLC is some of the best I've seen. After going through the base game several times, the added content took all of the weaknesses of the original game and revamped them into wonderful strengths. Overall, Civilization V has incredible value and it's nearly guaranteed you'll be spending a few nights huddled near the glow of your monitor with a bowl of microwaved food.			"

												Sid Meier's and his team have out done themselves with Civ 5. They have successfully created a game that I believe to be one of the greatest strategy games of all time. From it's beautiful designed map to its incredible well layed out and detailed UI, the game is almost flawless. In Civ 5 you have a range of empires to pick from and options that allow you to change map layout, size and much more. Once you begin you will start with small city set 4000 years BC from here you build up that city and create others over time as they grow you will be jumping from technology to technology beginning with simple techs like pottery and ending in the future with a space race and giant machines. With little to complain about and so much to be positive about this game is a must have for fans of the strategy genre.			"

												I'm finally getting around to playing this after yearning for so long.  When it dropped in 2010, I couldn't play it on even medium settings as I tried out the demo.  Well, being an all or nothing guy, I didn't want it until I had a PC capable of playing it at max. settings with no hiccups.That wasn't the only thing keeping me from the game, but the announcement of the new hexagonal grid and one military unit per tile rule, I was massively sceptical and honestly didn't think I would go for it.Well, after waiting 4 years and playing religiously for the past week after purchasing it, I can gladly say it's the best move the series has made.  I cannot believe I never noticed how mundane stacking 20 units to a tile was, to easily vanquish the enemy without thought.  Now, thinking and tactics come into play, and you have to know each unit's attributes, advantages and disadvantages, and suddenly the game series with extrordinary depth, just became that much deeper and more addictive.It's not without some faults, that even with the most recent patch after years of its release, still haven't been fixed.  Like for instance, if you have no ground military unit in a city, good luck accessing your missiles and other air units.  But these are minor and hardly take away from the yet another incredible addition (or should I say addiction?) to the franchise.10/10, will rack up far more than the current 47 hours I've put into it, when all is said and done.

												Civilization V. I've played it first when it was 2011, brought from si drek's copy of the game. It was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥'s (I think that's the name)  pirated version of the game. I copied it to my Acer Travelmate laptop along with the better (at that time) games: CoD 4, Torchlight II, Borderlands 2 and some other games I can't quite remember. Yes, I got the game because 'alang2'. Didn't thought much about it.After some time has passed, I’ve decided to test the Civ (I’ll be calling it Civ from now on) game because why not. A whim is a whim. Double clicked the executable and the game launched. Clicked quick game because testing was my mindset and I probably don’t need that much time playing Civ. The first I noticed (apart from the terrible fps and horrendous graphics due to low settings) is that Civ 5 is a TURN-BASED game. I chuckled. “Who the ♥♥♥♥ plays a turn-based game this day of age. I swear this is some kind of mobile port”. Nevertheless, I continued playing and looked at the time, “What? How long have I been playing!?”Yes the appeal of the game, ‘ONE MORE TURN’; never have I played a game of Civ and stopping midway through (only on some very special occasions like ISUK SKULAH). It’s fun, it’s addictive, just one more turn.I can’t really say for sure (but I totally can) why I think that Civ is a great game but I’ll just list down some key features and describe my experience from there:It is a strategy game.I’m a sucker for strategy games. Needless to say I have spent vast amount of my time wrecking my little brother in Command and Conquer 3: Kane’s Wrath and Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne (this is how I’ve started playing DOTA 2 but that’s for another time). All the micro-managing, the turtling, the base race, the resource scavenging is fun for me to say the least.The turn-based system is actually good.Yes, I chuckled at the turn-based stuff previously but now I am fine with it. Taking turns managing your empire really makes you think before you press the ‘end turn’ button. Where should I explore? Should I declare a war? Should I create an alliance? Do bribe the small city-state? How much army should I produce? Which technology should I research for after this? Questions, questions. It’s fun when you see your sprawling empire went to the direction you lead it. All it takes is for you to plan before you press that button.Your empire is not bound by the civilization you choose.This means that if you ever chose Gandhi (an Indian civilization) and went for the Science Victory (with population growth) but failed midway, you can change the destiny of your empire with swords and dominate the playing field if you choose your cards correctly. Heck, you can even be a Mongolian Khan era scholar with a belief in Protestantism and ideology in communism.The mechanics is very 4X mechanicsI don’t really know what game mechanics mean so forgive me if I'm interpreting it wrongly. The game is simple (haha, this is a joke). Click on a unit. Click on anything.♥♥♥♥♥♥is done. But really what you do is you find a good spot for your settler to create your very first city (if you turned off start bias or just don’t like where you spawned), train some scouts and go explore the world. The game uses hex tiles that determines what you stepped on. In perspective, your unit is on a tile surrounded by 6 other tiles (hex = hexagon, not voodoo stuff). Notice that each tile can be of different terrain which provides bonuses or really weird stuffs.The A.I. is intelligent for starters.To be fair, it depends on your difficulty. Settler being the easiest, Prince being ‘normal’ and Deity being super hard. Settler difficulty provides you with massive bonuses for you empire and the A.I. is dumb as ♥♥♥♥ (also the A.I. gets a disadvantage). The bonuses lessen with higher difficulty and stops at Prince where you don’t get any bonuses and so does the A.I (the A.I is somewhat reasonable. This is where i ‘calibrated’ at) you’re facing against. Starting after the Prince difficulty, you get a disadvantage and the A.I gets the bonuses with Deity being extreme. The A.I. is hard to beat and get massive bonuses such as researched technologies, happiness ++, etc. whereas you get basically the opposite of that because ♥♥♥♥ you says the developers (joking).All the other stuffI like the graphics (on high settings). It’s nice to look at. It’s nice to see my empire actually evolving with age (visually). Also the addition of faith and spyware (lol) really makes the game feel complete. I like my empire Islam based with communist ideology and nuking everybody one turn before I won the game. The game is not bound by one victory type like other strategy games, where you need to wipeout the enemy with you army to win. You can win culturally, scientifically, politically, timely or the barbaric dominatingly.It feels like I haven’t said enough about this game actually but I’m lazy halfway through so you get what you get what I post what I feel. I need also to mention my gripes with the game. Just one.  THE AIR UNITS ARE SLOW AS ♥♥♥♥. WTF 2K SPEED UP THE AIRPLANES PLS, I LIKE MY BOMBS FAST AS ♥♥♥♥  except the atomic bomb because slow imminent death to my enemies feels good.tl;dr Great game. Play it. Pirates are bad wtf Disney you high ka?			"

												My review is mostly related to the single player part and the AI of the game, which i both consider to be very relevant in this game.First of all: With the BNW add-on the CIV5 game gained new potential. Especially in late-game the game has become a lot better. However, Civilization 5 still lacks a lot of the strategic component of former installments of CIV or Alpha Centauri (one of my all-time favourite games). Especially without GK and BNW the game is very simplistic and strategically non-challenging, offering few ways to win and few actual decision-making. This is a shame, especially when comparing the game to its predecessors.With BNW the strategic component got a lot better, allowing many different paths to victory, exploring new strategies, and finally giving culture an actual purpose and allowing you to win with culture. A downside however is, that the different civilizations and leaders are poorly balanced. For example when playing at the last two difficulties, it seem almost impossible to win (unless you use specific AI and gameplay exploits...). This is mostly the case because it is generally not possible to keep up with the rapid technology advance and army production of the AI. The AI can do this because it receives massive bonusses and you receive a massive handicap. As an effect of the research and construction speed handicap, you will very often find yourself in a situation where you cannot build certain wonders in your game, even with an ultimately optimised building strategy and a perfect starting position - which is quite frustrating and will limit your selection of feasible strategies in higher difficulties, to a small selection - most of which are based on exploiting the overall weak choices the AI makes in wars.The AI also often reacts irrational and seems random, for example the way it changes from being your best friend, to backstabbing you and siding with your enemy, in just one turn, or when they declare war on you despite the immediate outcome being obviously negative for that civilisation as well as already having another enemy at its neck. The options for diplomatic interaction are overall weak.My main point of criticism is that the AI is dumb to the point that it can only be seen as challenging by that it produces a lot of military units and advances a lot faster in technology than you. This also means that you inevitably have to prepare for often long wars against an ridiculously large stream of enemy units that you might often destroy easily due to the AI's weak decision-making while attacking. Often you can only win with perfect start position and by exploiting certain game mechanics and the mentioned lack of AI tactics. This is what makes this game of little interest to me. A strategy game that offers a lot of different ways to win needs a good AI and not one that acts as military-unit factory.For example, games with the difficulty setting at which the AI has the same handicaps as you feel like a pony-ride to any halfway experienced player, even when there are lots of rivaling civilisations on the map. However, once you play at higher difficulties, the AI plays with the exact some behavior and underlying ""intelligence"" but can manage to be ahead of you at all times in matters of creating wonders, researching technologies, producing culture, and army. At the ""king"" difficulty, where you already have penalties, I found it possible to win pretty much any game at any starting position with any civilisations or leaders. But at the last two difficulties the AI advantage becomes clearly unfair, the intelligence of the AI however is still not any better. It is apparent that the AI ""knows"" what goes on on the entire map and will use this knowledge to its advantage. In addition, the advantages it receives are not possible to be compensate using smart decisions. For example, at Deity difficulty, Firaxis basically throws you into a gladiator fight where you play a limbless and ""slow"" person. You fight against dumb, aggressive and cheating brutes that will turn hostile at some point, no matter what. Sounds more fun than it is. I found it to be still possible to win at deity, but you are WILL find yourself limited to a very very small set of tactics and choices and even leaders: The most likely option to win is militaristically: you have to wait for your enemy's rare appearance of a weakness, at which point you have to attack with your limbless body hitting the enemy gladiator continuously, which will feel like cracking a hard nutshell with a rubber spoon, until the target slowly turns into a pudding-like consistency. You will have to forget all the other tactics and playstyles you might have previously liked to use, once you play in that arena you have to stick with what the little that's left, being severly crippled in your abilities and fighting against dumb hostile brutes.Thumbs down for the AI			"

												Some of the decisions made in this game befuddle me. I've played every Civilization iteration since the first (except CivNet), and this one has a lot to recommend it, so I'm clicking the ""Yes"" button. But I recommend it with reservations. Civilization IV is the better game, and feels more like Civ to me. However, the changes made in Civ V (like one unit per tile) provide their own challenges, so there's fun to be had, as long as you don't expect it to be ""real"" Civ. At least, that's the attitude I ended up taking, and it helped me find fun with the game.			"

												Review for Civilization V with Gods and Kings/Brave New World, November 2013:Civilization V may have gotten off to a rocky start.  The streamlined interface, and the removal of staples such as unit stacking were a bit of a shock, and the feeling was different.  With patching and updates, however, Civilization V has grown into its own game that stands apart from its predecessors.  I won't say it's better than previous games.  I won't say the historic immersion is the same (although Brave New World goes a long way to making that come back).  So unfortunately, coming into Civ V after playing a previous Civ game will feel awkward and possibly unsatisfying, but this is a game that rewards you with the time you put into it, it gets better as you play it.  What remains missing however, is the diplomacy.  The expansions have done a lot to repair the broken diplomacy system, and it works much better than before, but there remains a lack of choices for the player.  Many systems from previous games, such as spying, tech stealing, and religion, have been restored magnificently to the game in the expansions, but remain missing from the base version.  With Brave New World, a lot of the community feels that the game is now on par with the previous game, Civilization IV: Beyond The Sword.  I'm not sure I agree, but it certainly is a close call.  Civilization V is far less tedious than Civ IV, but still not as immersive.  Most of the complaints about Civilization V come from older players, familiar with older Civ games, but Civilization V is a great starting point for the series and strategy games in general.  Compared to similar games like Europa Universalis, or even Civilization IV, Civilization V is very easy to learn and has an intuitive interface and adjustable difficulty.  Even on higher difficulty, the game features unobtrusive advice which you can choose to follow.  No matter if you're a newcomer or a Civ-veteran, Civ V still has the infamous ""One more turn"" addictiveness this series is known for.  And overall, this is my favorite game on Steam currently, and I often have recommended it to people.  It's an all-around great game.-----Original recommendation, June 2012:  This is not the most satisfying Civilization game.  It may be one of the most fun, however.  The classic game is still there, streamlined and reengineered so that less time is spent micromanaging, and more time is spent planning your conquest of the world.  The graphics are the best of any Civ game so far, and there are many gameplay surprises that keep you replaying and trying out new things.  It is becoming one of my all-time favorites.			"

												Sid Meier's Civilization V is a magnificent turned-based strategy game. You select a civilization, start a city, and build your empire in many ways. Unlike some strategy games, Civilization V can be won in more than one way. These victories are: Cultural, Scientific, Diplomatic, Time and Domination. With the several different types of victory, this in turn shapes how you play the game, giving way to some unique strategies.While the base game may not come with nearly as much content as it would with the two expansion packs, it's still sufficient enough to have lots of fun with. It would be in your BEST interest to get one, or both, of the expansion packs for Civilization V. They add much new content, ranging from civilizations to changing some aspects of gameplay (i.e traderoutes in Brave New World)I find myself playing for hours on end, even if I play the game on quick. There's no shortage of gameplay here, and you'll always be coming back for just that one extra turn.The modding community. It exists. It's great. Always an added bonus to any game: modding support, and a large modding community. As you may have noticed in the Tools section of the Steam Library, Civilization V comes with its own SDK (Source Development Kit) to assist you in making mods and maps. Maps are very simple to make, and modifying the games XML format files requires merely a text editor. XML is a fairly simple data storing language, and can be modified quite easily. If you decide to get more into modifying the game and get lost, there are many guides online to help you through your journey.I whole heartedly recommend getting Sid Meier's Civilization V for yourself, especially when on sale. It's a bargain you can't beat.			"

												This is a true masterpiece - the best strategy game ever! It's deep, yet relatively easy to learn, especially if you've played any of the earlier games in the series. Every new game in this series improves the mechanism and the gameplay, pushing it further toward perfection. A must for anyone who likes strategy games!			"

												I played Civ and Civ2 a long time ago. It is nice to see in Civ5 that it is possible to evolve the franchise without losing most of the ideas that made you love the original games.We still have Civilopaedia, which is a nice way to learn a bit of history. We still have the wonders, and now they improve lots of stuff. We still have to think 5 turns ahead, because one wrong move may leave your army and cities too vulnerable. We still have the Spaceship and the Conqueror finales, and now have another 3 ways to win the game. The different finales, together with the huge amount of playable civs makes the game challenging for many replays. I finished about 20 games and still have lots of achievements to get.It is also nice that it is possible to run the game even in slow PCs, albeit there is a big loss of visual quality. But still, the fun of this turn-based game compensates.In the Brave New World DLC, there is a major overhaul, because of the inclusion of tourism. I suggest you get the complete edition, so there is no problem when trying to play online. Totally recommended game.			"

												Civilization V is the newest installment in the series and is perfect for someone new to it such as myself. From what I have seen, Civ5 seems much more suitable for newcomers, with a less overly complicated UI and overall gameplay. It's not too simple though as 70+ hours in, I'm still using new tactics by using new aspects of the game to reach my goal. This is THE BEST strategy game I have ever played and without potentially 100s of hours of content with dozens of civs, maps, randomization, mods and more, this is a game I would recommend for ANYONE, strategy fan or not. Easily a 10/10, a gem of a game.			"

Improves in many areas of the old Civ games with updated graphics and music. Cool and interesting DLC just keeps adding to this game to make it relevant for years to come. If you ever wanted to rule the world or turn it upside down with a different dictator now is the time grab this game!Final score 9/10			"

The game gives you that ""just one more turn..."" mentality and before you know it, you exit to desktop and 9 hours managed to pass by.I highly recommend it to anyone who owns a PC, as nobody should have trouble running it. Easily one of my most favorite games on Steam.			"

												Due to the fact i haven't written any reviews for a long time, i feel it is about time i started again with this unanimously magnificent strategy title! What Civilization V constitues is the climax of a renowned series. To begin with ..it looks stunning and its world shines with beautiful and well designed environments. Futhermore when you start immersing yourself deeper inside its universe you will begin discovering more of its many virtues. Not only has this game one of the most sophisticated in-game mechanisms i have ever seen in a strategy title but also it can maintain your interest for years.    Trying to offer a detailed insight into Civ V could easily make me write pages over pages though i don't want to become tiresome. Just keep in mind that this game needs patience in order to unfold all its features. On the whole i have no doubt that especially stategy friends are going to adore it!!			"

												Throughly enjoying this one - I'ts not a total war game yet offers a new type of world domination approach. Main objective is to either out science your enemies, defeat on the battlefield, annex or raise thier cities or go diplomatic and ghandi the crap out of everyone with world peace. Building the effiel tower in Hastings, England & having nuclear subs sink ye olde Austrian pirate boats really will give you a feeling no other game can. Likewise, building nukes and dropping them on your enemies from carriers in the ocean, then moving your workers in to scrub the fallout brings new joy to your fingertips. The game is workshop compatible, and the mod community is thriving with new ones to keep you buzzing and the game fresh. That said there is an unholy number of maps, factions, leaders and civilizations to build, destroy, conquer and make your ♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												Civilization 5, a game that made me feel irate and hate a lot of nations.This is a game about building a kingdom and acquiring fame, or in my case fear because I always ran in from the rear and torched the enemies buildings, where upon I was quickly botched and murdered while me mate john watched. It certainly requires tactics, which fills my gaping cassum of desires like a big bottle of cider. This type of gameplay is simple and soothing like a plane pilot before screaming mayday, at least at first before you're cursed and find yourself coerced into huge wars that go on longer than my drinking at any bars. With multiples nations that don't have much hesitation, one awkward gaze and you'll be bashed into a haze by five of the loons, when you're just armed with a pair of spoons. But with some mates in sight things became alright at least while they survive, sometimes they wouldn't be alive long. The blood thirsty nations flood you with all the troops they can spare in large scoops, all because you have the kingdom that is up roaring in applause, or you made the mistake to rake one of the smaller nations for their creations that everyone hated and requested to be berated anyhow. No such thing as peace, in this huge game of chess that you are at cease with 1 piece on the board of the many stored that are civilizations that resulted in nothing but huge cremations. If you make nice and not threaten anyone, but before you're beaten they'll practically speak some random squeak and before anything can be prepared, you see it pop up ""WAR HAS BEEN DECLARED.""But don't worry with technologies at hand, aided by the religious doxologies from downloadable content, that adds a congress that is not flawless. The leaders gang in times where I'd prefer them to hold a revolver to my head with a loud bang. Unless you're rich and not stuck looking like a dip switch, you have not many delegates from a few city states to aid you because you got in heated debates to embargo you or not.With friends of course in the end it is fun, just sometimes extremely laggy but seemly unnoticed when the turns take longer everyone gets stronger, each person having a massive army which makes the enemy become quite barmy, moving them all sometimes lasts until next fall, but we never cared because we shared each other’s help while hearing the enemy yelp, while the staffing got left to clean up the mess we were laughing and heading to the next target that'd inevitably have a bloody carpet.Otherwise can recommend.

												Quick summary of the game: build a nation from the ancient era to the present day.   WARNING, never play this game at night.  You will keep telling yourself this, ""just one more turn, and then I'll go to bed.""  Well that turn could turn into 20 turns and before you know it, 3 hrs have passed.  Seriously, this is a brilliant game for anyone who likes Risk.  Every playthrough is dynamic and awesome.  Also, there is a wide variety of civilizations to choose from.  Though each civilization is simile,  they have different unique units that are a ton of fun to control.  In addition, each civ leader speaks in their native language. Now thats some impressive research!  Something that may be a problem is that even though now the AI (in Brave New world) has been tuned down a bit (they were too agressive in the earliar DLCs like Gods & Kings) and probably won't provoke you into unnescessary war , it feels they are too passive as no bot provokes you anymore except when you deliberately do so.  When the main content gets boring, the comunity has done some great mods that keep the experience ongoing such as maybe a new civilization  or a new map design like Middle Earth from Lord of the Rings.  In conclusion, I recomend this game highly for anyone who is a big fan of history.			"

AUDIOSuperbVISUALImpressive, FreshDIFFICULTYComplexVIBERiskCRAVINGBoard GameON SALEOftenPROS: Civilopedia and tutorials have gotten a bit of an upgrade from Civ4 and are now more palatable to new users. The game is workshop friendly and the community is actively perpetuating content for it. Expansions actually have purpose and add dimension to the game. With all these new features, the games depth and strategy is no longer confined to country tierlists.  Hex-style grid was a great addition and feels very natural.CONS: As a long-standing fan of the Civilization series, I can't say I like the movement away from the board game feel of older installments (Civ2 and Civ3, specifically.) The graphics and animations are a bit unnecessary to me for this reason, though they are excellently-done and very beautiful.  WORTH: This game is worth full price, but DLC tends to rack up quickly. Because many of the expansions are practically necessary at this point, you may want to wait for a sale. Fortunately, the full collection gets bundled often for great prices!OVERALL: My qualms with this game are entirely from the point of nostalgia. At the end of the day, I'm willing to say goodbye to my virtual ""Risk"" board game in favor of what Civ is blossoming into as a series: a highly-complex strategy game that is a blast to share with like-minded friends.SCORE:10/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												CIVILIZTION VINTRODUCTIONCivilization V is, what I believe to be, the leader by miles in the turn-based videogame genre and I would recommend it to anyone who has patience, a goal, and a heck of a lot of time.GOAL/STORYThe goal of Civilization V is to ""build a civilization that can stand the test of time"", whether you cause war and mercilessly crush your enemies, or make pacts of peace to focus on research. This leaves the course of your Civilization up to you, and can provide very comic moments in history. One of my best moments was winning a domination victory as Ghandi (the mighty warlord), and Picasso being a Zulu! Although the goal is pretty much set in stone, I am somewhat disappointed by the lack of back story of your Civilization during the game, and that it is just thrown at you as a wall of text during a loading screen, forcing you to scan through the passage to find anything interesting out.GRAPHICSThe Graphics in Civilization V are beautiful, and have a lot of variation. I find the connected textures very effective at making the randomly generated world you are in feel like a real part of planet Earth - from a long winding river surrounded by dense rainforest, reminding me of the Amazon, to a row of snow-capped mountains seeming almost to similar to the alps. So far in my many hours of play, I have encountered no graphical bugs in the game, which is surprising considering it is a randomly generated world, with  almost limitless combinations of what may be on each tile.GAMEPLAYOn the whole, the game play of Civilization V is intense, exciting and sometimes causes the AI to be a bit too overwhelming. I would certainly recommend playing a couple of single player games to get used to the controls of the game and the personalities of most of the Civilizations, but after a while I found that it just doesn't cut it. Luckily I had a friend who had also purchased the game and so far we have spent countless hours playing together. Online multiplayer (not a private game) is a mixed bag though. You sometimes get thrown in with some people who want to have a laugh and end up trolling you or actually making good company during a game, sometimes you come across extremely serious players playing on Deity (the hardest game mode - the description states that ""only the best players in the world can beat this game mode"") and you end up getting overwhelmed, and sometimes you meet people like yourself, and you have a great time.CONCLUSIONOverall Civilization V is a brilliant game that will keep you entertained for hours, and can be replayed forever as long as you enjoy single-player or have a friend who is up for the challenge of a game.Goal/Story - 8/10. The goal is clear, but there isn't much of a background, and when you do see what your Civilization's history is, it is thrown at you as a wall of text and you have  few seconds of loading to read it.Graphics - 10/10. Graphics are beautiful and everything is rendered correctly and connected textures are fantastic!Gameplay - 9/10. With friends it's a blast, in single player it can sometimes get a bit too intense, and multiplayer is 50/50.Overall - 9/10. Great game! But I find it lacks a bit of information, and the variation of players is extreme. "

												Alright so I just finished my first game of Civ 5. I decided to play the Babylonians. My people settled along a river, no doubt reminescent of the fertile crescent, and situated in the middle of a jungle.Early on in the game, it gave me the option for my first social policy. When I was looking at them all, I decided that a scientific people like the Babylonians would have no interest to be bogged down by tradition or resort to superstitions or religions, so that meant I would go down Liberty or Honor. I always imagined the Babylonians as a rather honorable people so I decided that I would go down the path of honor. The game even rewarded me with the title of ""Nebuchadnezzar II the Great.""Okay, great, so I noticed that a few of my neighbors (Assyria, Persia, and Greece) were expanding a bit aggressively towards me and encroaching upon my great people's sovereign lands and areas to roam and I decided to put a stop to this. Using the might of the famed Babylonian Keshiks (bestowed upon us by the benevolent city-state of Ur), I conquered and annexed their lands so that my people might know further glory.Around the year A.D. 1950 I was given the choice of an ideology while within the late industrial era. I chose the ideology of Order so that the many comrades that now lived under my banner could be more productive and efficient in their works. We Babylonians do not tolerate any tomfoolery amongst our working class.The game went on until the year A.D. 3000 when I finally won a culture victory against the remaining nations of Arabia, the Zulus, and the Moroccans (Morocco conquered the poor nation of the Songhai) and the world would forever know the great poetry and works of the honorable and orderly Babylonians lead by Captain Nebuchadnezzar II.tl;dr it's a pretty good game			"

												A friend of my recommended this strategy game. I thought ''Civilization'' wasn't the game for me, however, the opposite was proven. It is the best turn-based strategy game I have ever played.The game is great, especially to play with or against friends online.I highly recommend this game!			"

												Civilization V is by far one of the best Civilization Games I have ever played.  The game takes awhile to play through both online and offline but rewards the player with both a sense of progression as the ages unlock and the technology advances.  Also the game has multiple ways to win and even if you feel your in the lead in science,  a friend can come out of nowhere and hit you with a culture vicotry so you have to not only be productive towards your victory goal but also monitoring all the other victory types to make sure no other civilization completes it before you.  I would highly recommend buying the complete pack when it's on sale, so you dont have to worry about dlc issues and not having a civilization that an opposing player wants to play as.  The game requires all active players to have the dlc in order to play against eachother and use a dlc civilization so be aware of this if you debating between the base game and it's expansions or the complete pack with all dlc.  Hope you enjoy Civilization as my as I do and can't wait for Civilization: Beyond Earth to come out :)...			"

												Awesome strategy game, one of the best I've played so far. First, when I entered the game, I was quite confused with bunch of options, but after a while, things had more sense. The game was made perfectly, with no errors at all, for both, Singleplayer and Multiplayer. Battles, science, culture, wonders, religions, maps, characters, bonuses, expansions, all of them areharmonized magnificently. Playing with friends is exciting, 6 hours marathon escalates quickly. At the end, just one more info, I've been playing Civ5 for almost 7 months and even now, I feel no boredom while playing :)10/10			"

												I want to start off by saying this is a fantastic game, but I think it is worth noting a few flaws to go alongside the many positives which this game has to offer, and reading this review will hopefully help you in deciding whether it worth picking up a copy.So first the pros: •This game has an ability like no other game i've played apart from AoE 2 to make time fly, one moment it's 4pm and before you know it you're hunched over besides your computer and it's 11pm, and you still haven't done your maths paper for the day after.•The background for music for each Civ is a nice addition, which allows for each Civ to feel unique beyond their colour scheme and unique building,Unit(s) and ability so as you play them the melody keeps things interesting.•The gane looks great and is formatted nicely so everything is clean and easy to access, and you rarely feel overpowered by an overabundance of numbers.And now for some cons•While at first and religion feels fresh and interesting, as the game advances it quickly becomes a chore even with its increased importance for any deity or cultural victory thanks to BNW. Relgion I found to be much more interesting online vs other human players, as they are likely to suffer from the same boredom you do and makes spreading your religion seem much more meaningful fun as a result.•I found myself sometimes being frustrated with a lack of some of the diplomacy tools the Ai have, such as the ability to call you out if you have troops surronding their border, and I hope that for Civ 6 the ai is smarter so this artificial difficulty does not need to be added.•My final issue with this game is the lack of balance you find in the policy trees, and games can become stale as you do the same optimal opening strategy over and over, now while you can go for a piety start it is rarely worth it unless you're trolling your friends online, or have some incredibly situational strategy.So all in all I think this is a great game for any pc gamer to pick up, and the flaws I mentioned only really become a issue when you've played as many hours as I have, so what are you waiting for go pick yourself up a copy now!

The base game feels dumbed-down to appeal to a mass-market boardgaming crowd, and the Gods and Kings expansion adds tacked-on variety but still no depth - systems have no meaningful interaction with each other, and any one decision or strategy feels as good as another, without any lasting consequence.The Brave New World DLC, on the other handm finally gives Civ V the depth you expect from a Civ game, with elegantly interacting system mechanics throughout and actions you take in the Stone Age still delivering payoffs thousands of years later.

You can play it for fun in the prince difficulty and you can challenge yourself in high level difficulties. And it did made me felt challenging, and I can’t memorized how much summer class I absented because of it (hahahahahaIn a word, this is a very good game.

												Alright so I just finished my first game of Civ 5. I decided to play the Babylonians. My people settled along a river, no doubt reminescent of the fertile crescent, and situated in the middle of a jungle.Early on in the game, it gave me the option for my first social policy. When I was looking at them all, I decided that a scientific people like the Babylonians would have no interest to be bogged down by tradition or resort to superstitions or religions, so that meant I would go down Liberty or Honor. I always imagined the Babylonians as a rather honorable people so I decided that I would go down the path of honor. The game even rewarded me with the title of ""Nebuchadnezzar II the Great.""Okay, great, so I noticed that a few of my neighbors (Assyria, Persia, and Greece) were expanding a bit aggressively towards me and encroaching upon my great people's sovereign lands and areas to roam and I decided to put a stop to this. Using the might of the famed Babylonian Keshiks (bestowed upon us by the benevolent city-state of Ur), I conquered and annexed their lands so that my people might know further glory.Around the year A.D. 1950 I was given the choice of an ideology while within the late industrial era. I chose the ideology of Order so that the many comrades that now lived under my banner could be more productive and efficient in their works.

Civilization's 5th iteration is a great entry in this franchise and is addictive as it is fun.  Prepare to loose many hours.  Some may tell you this one is a weaker game than 4 or not worth playing without all the DLC.  I am not really in that group. I had a lot of fun with the vanilla game. The expansions add depth to mid and late game stages and provide more options for victory, along with new civilizations (each which has its own perks).  If you have even a mild itch for strategy games then press buy.Also note this game is VERY moddable - all supported by steam workshop. Which couldnt be easier to use.			"

												Civilization V would be a very good game if it were not for the shoddy multiplayer and the money grubbing DLC practice.Firstly, the average multiplayer match freezes and crashes. Even if you have less than four players in your match, you will still crash frequently. Multiplayer is not designed well on this game, there are too many gamebreaking glitches to name of which can only be done in multiplayer games. This is because the developers did not pay much attention to polishing this portion of the game, since they seem to have been very busy releasing the 15 (!) pieces of DLC which were made for this game. This DLC has only divided the very tiny multiplayer community further because it can be hard to find a match of people who have the same DLC as you.The singleplayer is where this game shines, the developers obviously spent a huge amount of time polishing this portion of the game, and this is what gives it replay value. You can easily spend six hours on a single game of Civilization V and still want to play more. There are a few balance problems however these are relatively small. Overall Civilization V is my favorite game despite some of the game's shortcomings.			"

												Civilization 5 is a great game, it is the first turn based strategy game that i have bought. I have had many hours of fun, either in singleplayer or in multiplayer, although the graphics for the game are not brilliant (good if you haven't spent lots of money on your PC) it still captures you into emersive game play. The game at first can seem complicated and hard but you quickly learn how to effectively play the game and win a game, this may not seem to be impressive f you haven't played Civilization 5, but trust me when you have played you will know what i mean. If you have a lot of time on your hands or even little this is a good game for you because you can alter the game speed to suit you, from the fastest been ""quick"" (they put a lot of effort into the name) and the slowest been ""marathon"" (seems they got someone more creative to think of that name). The me can take a long time on ""standard"" speed, but is does all depend on what difficulty you go for as Civilization 5 gives you a range of options like the other Civilizations depending on if you want to become leader of the world through violence and tyranny turning all the other ""Civs"" against you, a ""domination victory"". Then on the other hand you can be peaceful and gain friendship with the ""civs"", gaining a ""technological victory"" or a ""cultural victory"". These are just some of the ""victory's"" you can achieve. The ""technological victory"" is one of the hardest to achieve as basicaly it means be the first to get to ""Alpha Centauri"", which is another planet far far away, so of course this means building a space ship. The ""domination victory"" is very clear (through the word ""domination"") just control the capital of every other ""Civ"" in the game, as a warning though other ""Civs"" do not think very highly of someone who attacks other ""Civs"" so they will attack you (only if you attack a few of them). The ""cultural victory"" is one of the hardest victory's to get, this is because it takes a long time and you need to play as the right ""Civ"" that is got traits that gain them extra culture. A good ""civ"" to play as is ""Napoleon"" because he gains culture from ""chateau's"". The game has a lot of DLC's, but luckily for you if you are considering getting Civilization 5 they have stopped making DLC's and are making Cilization 6 (this may sound like Civ 6 is coming out soon but no one knows) so steam have made it so for £34.99 you get Civilization 5 and all  11 DLC's including ""BNW"" (Brave New World) and GAK (Gods And Kings). this is a very good deal considering individualy it cost £78.35, so it is better than half priceand the DLC's make the game SOOOO much better its worth every penny. For a game where there is so much you can do either in muliplayer or in singleplayer giving you many hours of fun it is worth getting, i HIGHLY reccomend this game.			"

												This is the best PC game of all time. I have thousands of hours logged on Steam alone. I can destroy any human or AI player on any setting at anytime. I love this game and will be playing this when I'm 90 (unless a better Civ comes along and I like it better) Anyway if you don't have this game you should buy it immediately. As in right now...			"

												In Sid Meier's Civilzation V you can play as one of the many historical nations of the world from both past, and present. From there you build, expand, make war, make deals, adopt policies, and research. Lastly maintaining your economy, and the overall happiness of your citizens.You can also play as a mod civilzation. Some like Sparta for example, Vlad the Impaler, The Three Kingdoms of Ancient China. And also play on player created maps ranging from the Elder Scrolls series to Game of Thrones. And also with online. You can play with your friends and/or other players. But be warn if you make any save during that match it is highly wise you know the people first. Last thing you want is an epic matching occuring and then suddenly the player no longer shows up after a day or two.There are many things to do in this game from customizing your match playstyle both online and on singleplayer. Plus testing your skills in scenario modes. Another cool thing as well is the animations in the dipolmatic menu when dealing with other leaders. Although if you don't have a hig rig PC it is wise to turn that off completely. And don't play for too long. In my personal experience with this game it is always wise to have the autosave saving at least around 3 turns you make. A slight problem with this game is the AI. Sometimes they make really odd choices, Like for example, instead of surrending. They fight it out till the end. Or if you take down HALF of their cities and embargo their civilzation from making trade. Instead of making peace and trying to find comproise they will still act like idiots and still wage war. Even on the lowest setting as i find out. Also be warn as well, if you play this game on higher diffculty, my advice? take your time, and plan everything out. If you don't plan very well you will be crushed.At this point it is wise to get ALL of the DLC since the majority of the mods rely on them.Other than that, I recommend this game.			"

												Figured I would add to this review. I seriously dont know how to review this game. This was my first 4x game. I dont play it sp. I only jam with friends from back home (I'm in the military, we play private games). Never played Civ 4 or the the prior games before playin this. I've spent countless hours, so much fun, playing this game with my friends. Might be somewhat of a curse because when I look for 4x games on Steam now, I look for Civ clones (Civ V I should say). Just so much g*ddamn fun when playing with friends (most Ive played with is 4 others, but the game is just as fun being played with just 2 people). Don't really know what else to say.

												Conquer the world, outsmart the world, outculture the world....there are so many ways to play the game.Before I start I just wanted to say that it's a VERY slow game. It takes lots of hours to finish single games. This doesn't necessary mean anything bad, but a lot of people want quick paced games so just wanted to give a warning.You build your civilization from the bottom to the end, you make deals with your neighboring civs and conquer others or do whatever it takes to be the dominant civ. Build an empire!Pro: The god of replayability, tons of ways to play and win, beutiful graphics, decent AI with different personalities, gandhiCon: VERY time consuming, annoyingly slow loading screensIf you are interested in the game, make sure to grab the DLCs/expansions aswell to make the game as fun as possible.

												Civ 5 is one of the best strategy games I have ever played. There are tons of scenarios to play if you are into those. Most of the play time for many people is playing against AI. You can choose from multiple difficulties to play on. The harder the diffuculty the more the AI have the advantage. Civ 5 has tons of civilizations to play as each with their own unique advantages. I would say the best part of Civ 5 is during the medieval and Industrial time periods. These are times where I have the most fun at. The reason I don't really like the modern era is becuase the game usually feels drawn out and boring by that time. But if you go to your game options and start the game during the medieval era then the modern era will feel a lot more fun. Overall Civ 5 is a really fun game and has an endless play time to it. I would recommend Civ 5 to anyone even if you are not into stategy games.			"

												""Just One more Turn!"" is Civilizations unofficial motto, anyone who played the game and enjoyed it will understand. Known as the biggest turn-based strategy game today with it's rather unique hexagon tiled playfield, Civilization has entertained many throughout it's lifespan - myself included. I used to play a bunch load of Civilization III as a kid and Civilization V has done a wonderful job of replacing that for the past 4 years. Back in the days, turn-based strategy games were pretty common but today it feels like most games are real-time. Turn-based means you take turns to make your move rather than everyone making them at the same time, like in every traditional board game.Evidently Sid Meier's Civilization V is the fifth game in the series and it has really just gotten better and better by every game, the core mechanics are always there but with some variation between each game. The fanbase is rather scattered when it comes to agreeing on the best Civilization game, a lot of people still prefer Civ IV, personally I love Civ III a lot but Civ V takes the prize. The main problem with Civilization V when it came was the lack of content compared to what Civ IV already had. Today, 4 years later, tons of DLCs and 2 expansions have been released for the game and it finally has more content than it's predecessor.The game is about to create, reign and fulfill a civilization throughout hundreds of years and overcome the obstacles alongside, either online or vs computers. Explore, expand, exploit and exterminate - 4X - is the best way to describe the typical steps when playing a game of Civilization. Explore is for the first section of the game, where you settle your first city and scout the surounding area for resources or opponents. Expand is when your small settlement becomes several, either through settling another one or through conquest. Exploit is the description of diplomacy, treaties, spionage and rigging elections to make your cause the ultimate. Exterminate is pretty obvious, if diplomacy or expantion does not work, take the matter by the sword (or the nuclear warhead).There are 4 way of winning and becoming the master civilization; Cultural, Diplomatic, Scientific and by Domination. Along those victory types are also paths for your civilization to easier obtain said victories. For example; you could focus your empire on trade and become a superpower through riches. Essentially buying votes for a diplomatic victory, units for domination or technology for science. You could also be the founder of a religion and slowly but steadily gain your trust from the people of other civilizations that way. I was hoping to see a pure Economical and Religious victory condition, but sadly there are none.It feels like I have done pretty much everything in Civilization V since it's release but I still get really tempted to get back in there, and just let the hours disappear. Suddenly you sit there, 5 AM in the morning and be like ""What the hell just happened? I am not 12 anymore, I have a f*cking job!"". I remember when I used to plan my next move during bathroom breaks, I couldn't even think of something else for 5 minutes! ""Just One more Turn!"" I am really looking forward to Civilization VI and Civilization: Beyond Earth. I recommend Civilization V for everyone, not just strategy fans but everyone interested in having control and making decisions for an imaginary empire. Or if you just have a lot of time to spend, I ensure you that you won't be disappointed. "

												Probably the best strategy game to approach with a group of friends with the intention of partaking in a saga of epic battles and journeys to conquest, and probably the best strategy game that amounts to simply flubbing around with your friends in merely a matter of minutes. Games are rather slow even on the fast game settings (stay away from 'Epic' if you value your lifespan,) and playing with that one guy that always takes at least 5 minutes to finish his turn can be very much agonising (think five player chess wait times.) The payoff however, more than makes up for it.  The feeling of carrying your army across the continent to royally screw over your friend who you were suppossedly 'allied' with is like none other, as is launching a nuke at every neighbouring country and bribing Chengis Khan to mount an attack at the Vatican. Rounds may take a few hours, but you'll be talking about them for the next week.  Fans of the previous Civ games may however be a little disappointed with this edition as it seems a few majorly awesome mechanics have been removed (along with with a whole bunch of not so awesome mechanics.) Even religions are nowhere to be found within Vanilla but thankfully both Brave New World and Gods and Kings restore all that was missing to make Civ V as great as its predecessors.Between some fantastic DLC and Steam Workshop functionality (YOU CAN PLAY AS CTHULU IN THE WORLD OF TAMRIEL AND FOUND PASTAFASTARIANISM) Civ may not be a 'perfect' game to please all but it's certainly as close as it gets in terms of Civilisation.

												Sid Meier's Civilization V is the best strategy game I've played.The new hex grid tile system works extremely well for combat, allowing for a much more strategic, intellectual battle. Sadly, the game doesn't fully feel complete without both the Gods & Kings and Brave New World DLC packs.

												The Holy Grail of gaming is the game you can play forever. To some that is the make-your-own-rules sandbox RPG, to others it is the strategy game where all playthroughs are similar yet unique. In the latter category the championship title holder has always been Civilization. The original design is so strong yet adaptable that it has been able to sustain an entire series that continues its triumphant march through history with V.From one settler and one warrior begins global conquest. So it has been and so shall it be but the ways to supremacy have never been as varied or as satisfying as they are here. Brave New World finally made the cultural strategy fun and the introduction of city-states in the base game did the same for diplomacy. Victory through science has changed the least and while the same could be said for the military victory it does not apply to actual combat itself. Stack of Doom, the most bizarre design oversight in the franchise, has been done away with. In its place is a mechanic similar to other hex-based strategy games but while it does not break new ground as such it fits in here perfectly and makes annexing the pacifists quite entertaining to do. Unfortunately the vassalization from IV is not possible here. Warmongering also brings very serious diplomatic penalties, more serious than ever before, and bullies will find themselves completely isolated from the diplomatic stage. The cultural system introduced in the previous Civilization has been refined and is my personal favorite aspect of V. Accumulating culture expands the city limits which the workers can work on but also allows you to pick social policies that give empire-wide bonuses. It is of course best to plan the way to victory as early as possible and build social structure accordingly but there is also something of a role-playing feel to it as well. Whether warlord, plutocrat or tolerant diplomat, all feels satisfying to be. Another way of tailoring your empire to your liking is religion. As your cities accumulate faith you advance in religion, at first choosing a basic Pantheon belief (""God-King"", et al), then having a Great Prophet found a religion and picking your boons from the ones still available and so on. Religion is not mandatory for victory but can make it much easier. For example an aggressive leader could use faith points to purchase holy warriors, then use religion to finance the resultant army upkeep through tithes and finally pick a belief that gives a combat bonus around enemy cities that your missionaries have converted beforehand. Brave New World also added a caravan system which is the best way to make money by far, perhaps ""too best"", but still an interesting addition to the tried and true.Making the role-playing aspects even more deeper are the various civilizations themselves. All get an unique ability and a pair of unique units and/or buildings. The list is by far the most expansive in any Civ yet and includes debutants like Poland or Brazil. To my amazement all cultures feel logically designed and balanced to play as. Sometimes the abilites are much more particular than in other cases meaning that some cultures are easier to triumph as but that only adds to meaningful challenge. The Mayans have an especially amusing ability called The Long Count that gives them a free Great Person every 394 years, at the end of their calendar cycle. Menus and lists are universally clear and all necessary information is easy to find. You can also activate the DLCs you want, put in mods from the Workshop and customize many other things as well, from the map to AI personalities. Something Civilization has always had that no fantasy or sci-fi game can never surpass is the richness of lore, or in this case, actual human history. No amount of imagination can come up with anything stranger or more interesting and it makes the game more welcoming in ways too many to count. A special recognition of achievement goes to the in-game Civilopedia that is so clearly and informatively written that sometimes it is relaxing to take a break from empire-building and read about history, from pottery to Napoleon to a technology called The Internet.Civilization V is so rich and deep that writing about it always glosses some things over and stresses others too much which is fitting since the same applies to actual civilization as well. The complete game is indeed the most perfect Civ yet made and one of the finest eternal games in existence. Whether one wants to spend a night or two or all of them playing, Civ V will provide mental stimulation as long as it is needed.			"

												The depth and replayability are unsurpassed. It took a couple of expansions to catch up to the enjoyment I felt playing its predecessors, but now with all of the new systems in place it has become one of my favorite iterations in the series. Thank you Sid Meier's, Brian Reynolds, Jeff Briggs, MicroProse, Hasbro,  Infogrames, Atari Interactive, Take-Two,  2K Games, Firaxis and any others I am forgetting for providing me with years of such boundless entertainment. I can only imagine what the future holds for such an amazing and storied Franchise.			"

After the hours I have played, I have become hooked, and can't stop playing.Good Things:The gameplay is fun, You have so many things you can go into, but being the obvious, science, and domination are the main two things to go fourth to.I like that if your computer can not handle the full graphics of the game, or you just want to have a faster, and  better view so you can see the resources around you, you can always switch to the ""Strategic View"" (Pressing F10).Bad Things:It is very TIME CONSUMING, Yet addicting.

												Probably the best strategy game to approach with a group of friends with the intention of partaking in a saga of epic battles and journeys to conquest, and probably the best strategy game that amounts to simply flubbing around with your friends in merely a matter of minutes. Games are rather slow even on the fast game settings (stay away from 'Epic' if you value your lifespan,) and playing with that one guy that always takes at least 5 minutes to finish his turn can be very much agonising (think five player chess wait times.) The payoff however, more than makes up for it.  The feeling of carrying your army across the continent to royally screw over your friend who you were suppossedly 'allied' with is like none other, as is launching a nuke at every neighbouring country and bribing Chengis Khan to mount an attack at the Vatican. Rounds may take a few hours, but you'll be talking about them for the next week.  Fans of the previous Civ games may however be a little disappointed with this edition as it seems a few majorly awesome mechanics have been removed (along with with a whole bunch of not so awesome mechanics.) Even religions are nowhere to be found within Vanilla but thankfully both Brave New World and Gods and Kings restore all that was missing to make Civ V as great as its predecessors.Between some fantastic DLC and Steam Workshop functionality (YOU CAN PLAY AS CTHULU IN THE WORLD OF TAMRIEL AND FOUND PASTAFASTARIANISM) Civ may not be a 'perfect' game to please all but it's certainly as close as it gets in terms of Civilisation.

												Civilization V, let me just start with this, is an amazing game. Coming from a vetran of the older games, i was at first scared to try the ""new stuff"". But once i got into Civ V, i never looked back (Btw Civ III is like a rage game, try it at your own risk) Here are my Pros and Cons.Pros:     Crisp Clean modern graphics that still follows the look of a civilization game. The leaders' animations   and looks are outstanding.     No unit stacking. First i frowned at this but began to love it. In previous civ games, cirtain battles felt like my stack vs the other guy's stack of units which felt sloppy in a since in retrospec. Combat takes strategy now, not numbers.     Advanced Diplomacy and City States. Diplomacy in the origional Civ V is meh, but Gods & Kings and Brave New World fix that easily. City states makes the world feel more alive, even if your on an island by yourself, a city state there gives it life. Diplomatic victory is just as entertaining, if not more, than a domination victory. The political struggles to hold delegates and get your proposals passed is a blast, and Cultural Victory with the Tourism (BNW) is very very thought provoking.     The Add mod feature Encourages its fanbase to be creative with making fun senarios. (PC Master Race ftw)~probably so much more pros that i can't think of atm so ill stop here. ~Cons:The only Cons i can come to think of is...     Happiness. Until you get an ideology or of the like, your happiness seems a real challenge to keep up, expecially in a war game. (But yet again i play on Prince, on lower difficulties this isnt a problem)     Warmongering. Most AI seem very quick to neclect trading and deals with you if they suspect you of a warmongerer. I go to war with france with the persians and take no cities and the arabians are denouncing me already. If you resonably go to war for a cause THEY are responsible for, you become the ""joseph stallin"" of the world. My only complaint would be to tone this down a little.Other than that this game is a blast. Like the addict i am, ive played over 1k hours of this game, so i hope this helps. 10/10 would restart account and get achevements again.			"

												It is Civilization, the most popular and well known Turn-Based Strategy game of all time. This version is still as good as the older versions when you have all the expansions. I would recommend you get the ""Gold"" or ""Complete"" version of this one. The new hex tiles add an interesting level of strategy to the game. No longer can you have a one tile army taking over countless cities. Instead you have to plan ahead with artillery (ranged) units in the back, infantry in the front and cavalry on the sides. This one is definatly worth getting. Replayability is high, you will have countless hours of fun.			"

Overhelming Holy Master of Strategy! [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]I always tried to play Civilization but the outdated graphics and the 2D squared tiles never managed to catch my interest. With Civilization V they finally introduced hexagonal tiles and a rich 3D world, so I grabbed the Gods & Kings expansion and gave it a try!At first the game is overhelming with informations and details, but it will take you hand by hand and introduce all the mechanics step by step.After 30 hours and 493 turns I finished my first play and I was able to manage almost everything. This game is simply GARGANTUOUS. There are TONS of things to do and manage. There are dozens of leaders each one with its strenghts and weaknesses. There are 5 different ways of winning a game and you can customize the map in even the smallest detail! There are also premade scenaries, steamworks support and a very populated multiplayer! Simply WOW!Just three advices:1. Do not read the tips and tricks or they will ruin your fun showing the best strategies (there aren't so much so knowing these may lower your fun of trying new ways to beat the other civilizations).2. Buy the expansions, these are not money-sucker DLCs but they really improve the base game.3. Always keep an eye on the clock: I started playing it at 23.00 and I left the game at 6.00 with conquered cities, allies, powerful armies and... frozen legs! It sucked 7 hours of my life without me realizing!Best played with Keyboard and MouseRecommended Buy Price < 50$Score 9/10 "

												Civilization V, let me just start with this, is an amazing game. Coming from a vetran of the older games, i was at first scared to try the ""new stuff"". But once i got into Civ V, i never looked back (Btw Civ III is like a rage game, try it at your own risk) Here are my Pros and Cons.Pros:     Crisp Clean modern graphics that still follows the look of a civilization game. The leaders' animations   and looks are outstanding.     No unit stacking. First i frowned at this but began to love it. In previous civ games, cirtain battles felt like my stack vs the other guy's stack of units which felt sloppy in a since in retrospec. Combat takes strategy now, not numbers.     Advanced Diplomacy and City States. Diplomacy in the origional Civ V is meh, but Gods & Kings and Brave New World fix that easily. City states makes the world feel more alive, even if your on an island by yourself, a city state there gives it life. Diplomatic victory is just as entertaining, if not more, than a domination victory. The political struggles to hold delegates and get your proposals passed is a blast, and Cultural Victory with the Tourism (BNW) is very very thought provoking.     The Add mod feature Encourages its fanbase to be creative with making fun senarios. (PC Master Race ftw)~probably so much more pros that i can't think of atm so ill stop here. ~Cons:The only Cons i can come to think of is...     Happiness. Until you get an ideology or of the like, your happiness seems a real challenge to keep up, expecially in a war game. (But yet again i play on Prince, on lower difficulties this isnt a problem)     Warmongering. Most AI seem very quick to neclect trading and deals with you if they suspect you of a warmongerer. I go to war with france with the persians and take no cities and the arabians are denouncing me already. If you resonably go to war for a cause THEY are responsible for, you become the ""joseph stallin"" of the world. My only complaint would be to tone this down a little.Other than that this game is a blast. Like the addict i am, ive played over 1k hours of this game, so i hope this helps. 10/10 would restart account and get achevements again.			"

												I am a big Civ fan.  When Civ-V originally came out, I was skeptical.  The changes in the game seemed a bit too different and too watered down.Then I played it - granted with the expansions attached.The changes in the game altered the flow of the game, but for the better.  Without stacks of doom from Civ-IV, battles and holding territory became more tactical and less about overwhelming numbers.  It wasn't long until Civ-IV was relegated to my archaic laptop and Civ-V was my go-to.The Civ series is almost like a manifestation of the Vulcan philosophy of 'infinite diversity in infinite combintions' with a number of civilizations, winning objectives, and a vibrant modding community providing numerous scenarios and mods available online.  With how differently the game can be after running certain mods, it is hard to get bored of it.  Certainly making it easy to slip into the 'just one more turn' chant as the sun peaks over the horizon to see what you've been playing all night.The game may not be for everyone, especially if you don't like turn-based games or crave constant action.  Though, if you're looking for a classic, turn-based strategy game, Civ-V is a good choice pedigree aside.  Finding it on sale, especially with the release of Civ-VI, makes a strong pick if you've not already picked it up.Have fun out there!			"

												Here is the story of this game, the background is that one turn takes about 1-5min to do:6PM, after 4h of playing Player 1 (P1) and Player 2 (P2) illuminated by the soft light of their screens are talking through TS.P1: You know what, I wanted to clean up the room today, so I'll be going. Let's go with one more turn and then we save for today.P2: Ok, I just needs like three turns to complete the total domination unit! Is that OK?P1: Sure! So I can finish this city I've attacked!P2: Great!11PM, after 5h and 200 turns our two heroes which eyes get a little bit red at this point, start a pointless discussion again.P2: Oh f...! Man! It's 11PM! I have to go to sleep! I need to go to the work tomorrow! My wife and family count on that and (to make a cliché a little bit more scary) I'm the surgeon! Peoples may die! We have to end this now! Let's go with one more turn, ok?!P1: Sure! Sure! No problem, I've a work as well. Let's go with this turn I guess and then we can save the game! Maybe we can just setup next turn before save! Just to have a clean start next time.P2: Yea, I like that too, no problemo. We just really need to end after this turn.4AM, hours are passing and it doesn't look like there is a hope for ending the game. Players are in the future era and Napoleon has started Apollo program, so some Nuke(tm) action is required there! Winning by culture of science isn't an option for our brave Players, you know? The only thing that matters is a complete domination!6AM, nukes all flighting all around the world Napoleon is begging for mercy and tsar Catarina just ask kindly if she can keep her last city (of course she can't! We need 7th gold mine in our imperium and she offended us 4000 years ago!).6:30AM, Suddenly /PUT YOUR HIGHER POWER NAME HERE/ intervenes causing the discussion even though Players still have so much to do with Nations that left on the world (no Russia anymore I'm afraid Catarina :()P1: You know what time it's Player 2?P2: Eugh? What do you mean I'm Alexander the Great not Player 2!P1: Man! Wake up! We are still playing and it's 6:30AM!P2: What?!♥♥♥♥♥♥man! Save this this instant! I have to go to work in like 2h!P1: Yea, me to! Game saved. Have a good night then!P2: Wait I did some more actions, save again please.P1: Ok, ok. Saved. Good night again!P2: That was a great game, we need to finish this Napoleon garbage next time! He nuked me!P1: Sure man, sure.And this is how the single game session ends.Similarity to real people and events is not accidental.			"

												Sid Meier's Civilization V is the kind of game that almost anyone can get into, even if you are a diehard FPS player, you will likely find some amusement in this game. Civilization V offers a vast variety of ways to play the game, ranging from a campaign-esque scenario mode, to custom games where you pick and choose your opponents (and possibly allies), what kind of map you will be fighting for, and what you will need to do, to win. Do you want to conquer the world? Get a giant earth map, add a dozen or two opponents and fight for world domination!Do you want to start your own religion and watch it spread across the globe like a true pandemic? Well start one, send off your missionaries and start an inquisition, you will be Supreme Pope of Your-Cult-Name-Here soon!Do you want to play out historical battles throughout the history? Well, not much else to be said than: you can!Some people might enjoy setting the difficulty setting all the way down, and steamrolling their opponents; others might do the opposite and try for the challenge of beating the game with a severe handicap. Playstyle plays a huge part in how you will enjoy Civ5, but once you start a map, it is as if it will never end.The multiplayer aspect of the game has both upsides and downsides, when playing with others you need to coordidnate who does what, and it can trim parts of the game from your own experience (as in, you have to share certain wonders, it is not beneficial to have multiple religions and it will suck fighting for superiority). Beyond that, it can be great divvying up an opponents land between you and your friend, for example.Get Civilization V. It is definitely one of my all-time favorites./One more turn.			"

Love this game, definitely one of my favourites.			"

												Sid Meier's Civilization V is the kind of game that almost anyone can get into, even if you are a diehard FPS player, you will likely find some amusement in this game. Civilization V offers a vast variety of ways to play the game, ranging from a campaign-esque scenario mode, to custom games where you pick and choose your opponents (and possibly allies), what kind of map you will be fighting for, and what you will need to do, to win. Do you want to conquer the world? Get a giant earth map, add a dozen or two opponents and fight for world domination!Do you want to start your own religion and watch it spread across the globe like a true pandemic? Well start one, send off your missionaries and start an inquisition, you will be Supreme Pope of Your-Cult-Name-Here soon!Do you want to play out historical battles throughout the history? Well, not much else to be said than: you can!Some people might enjoy setting the difficulty setting all the way down, and steamrolling their opponents; others might do the opposite and try for the challenge of beating the game with a severe handicap. Playstyle plays a huge part in how you will enjoy Civ5, but once you start a map, it is as if it will never end.The multiplayer aspect of the game has both upsides and downsides, when playing with others you need to coordidnate who does what, and it can trim parts of the game from your own experience (as in, you have to share certain wonders, it is not beneficial to have multiple religions and it will suck fighting for superiority). Beyond that, it can be great divvying up an opponents land between you and your friend, for example.Get Civilization V. It is definitely one of my all-time favorites./One more turn.			"

												Sid Meier's Civilization V really changed my opinion about strategy simulation games. This game is very diverse and no two games are alike. You start out as a civilization with one city and you slowly build your way up to be the dominator, the diplomatic leader, or the first to finish the Space Race. Not only all this but it is historically accurate!			"

												This is by far my favorite Civ game. I won't bore you with a lengthy review on specifics, since there are probably a ton out there already. If you are new to this franchise, played some of their previous titles, or have been a Civ junkie from the start (in which case, why are you reading this?), you will find great pleasure in this version. I recommend all bonus content, hopefully you can get a nice package deal for cheap (saw base game + all DLC for 20bucks as a black friday deal in winter 2013) because they really make the game. The user-made content is immense and is probably why the game is still a powerhouse. Can easily take up a lot of your time, and has the ability to suck you back in even when you take a break from it for months at a time.			"

												I've extensively played every game in this series and this newest entry does not disappoint!  The vanilla game itself is incredible with a limitless number of hours to play as every game is an entirely new experience.  The number of civilizations that you can choose from (with unique units, buildings, and game changing abilities) is astonishing and the level of detail put into the variety of different victory strategies is incredible.  Building your own government (by choosing which policies to put into effect) and forming and spreading your own religion is extremely entertaining to say the least as well.  The multiplayer is incredible as well as the game in its entirety is used in multiplayer as well, not just parts of it as so many in-depth games seem to do.This game will never get old for me and I hope the same goes for the rest of you who will be joining me!

												I've been playing Sid Meier games since I was 11, I bought Civ V about two years ago and have been loving it since.  I've invested a lot of time into the game and I have to say its by far my favorite strategy game of all-time.  Though the AI is stupid and conducts repetitive actions majority of the time and the difficultly doesnt change anything (at least for me, whatever difficulty I play on, I am always in the lead a few Era's.)  The only downside to the game, is the diplomatic functions and the missing ability to ask the AI's for support the same way they can.  Fortunately there is mods for both of these downsides but sadly it disables achivements which for me at least, is a moderately big part of the experience for me. The game looks stunning and the colors pop.  Gameplay is smooth and enjoyable.  I recommend this game to any one who loves simulation, strategy, history, and action.  You can kill a good 5 hours playing a quick match so if you are ever needing to kill time at an airport or at your boring grandmothers house but you only brought your laptop with you, Civ is the game for you and you will spend countless and countless hours on it without even noticing.

												4K fans will love this game; those from an RTS background looking to try out turn-based strategy will be disappointed in the fact that combat victories are essentially impossible in games of more than 4 players/NPCs. The game is too heavily slanted towards other victory acheivements; it is too difficult to conquer cities and happiness makes a global conquest strategy through military might nigh impossible because eventually your armies will simply be spread too thin and enemies will too easily be able to reinforce their positions on large maps. I still recommend it though for 4K people, but coming from a Command & Conquer/Starcraft/Warcraft background, I can't get out of the conquest mindset and the other strategies aren't to my taste. If you enjoy the longer, slower-paced games which involve meticulously building up a civilization, this is one of the best games out there for that.			"

												Sid Meier's Civilization VPositives:+ This is an in-depth, turn based strategy game. It features a massive technology tree for the ancient, classical, medieval, renaissance, industrial, modern and future eras. Conduct research to unlock new buildings and units.+ Multiple victory styles to suit your own gameplay goals. Aim for world domination, or try for a cultural victory by constructing world wonders and acquiring great works of music, writing and art. Build the first spacecraft through the Apollo program to win a science victory. + Lots of units available for each era, ranging from archers and cavalry to giant death robots and XCOM specialist squads.+ There's a well fleshed out system for city development and unit recruiting, whereby you need to balance your productive output with your food and gold output. For your empire to be successful, you need to work the land with citizens appropriately. The more food you have, the faster your town grows, but this usually comes at the expense of production, resulting in longer building times.+ This is the ultimate empire building game. Workers can construct roads between cities, and later on railways. They can erect plantations on exotic goods like wine and sugar or ensure resources like stone and gold are extracted with mines. Settlers can found a city in faraway countries. + DLC adds a lot of new features, like religion and tourism, which impacts the game a fair bit and makes it more interesting.+ Battles with enemies seems boring at first, but soon you realise that it's much more intricate. The positioning of your troops, the type of unit, the terrain you're on and unit capabilities directly affect your damage or defensive rating. So, battles become quite intriguing. + Multiplayer co-op!Negatives:- Stupid diplomacy system which doesn't make much sense. There's several faults here. You can be allied to another civilization for thousands of years (renewing the friendship agreement when it expires), but the simplest of transgressions results in them ""denouncing"" you. For example, in one of my games, my spy successfully stole technology without being detected. But somehow, the AI knows that you've taken this research, and threatens me. Very unrealistic. When you denounce them in return, they're suddenly ""hostile"" and then attack soon after. There doesn't seem to be any complex formula governing diplomacy, it's so simplistic. The AI doesn't take into account your previous good standing with them or mutual objectives. It doesn't recognise your past support for them in wars and trading doesn't seem to have much positive diplomatic influence or effect. This really ruins a core part of the game.- AI can be overly aggressive on normal difficulty and above. It always seems as if it's scripted and the AI has decided to target you. Even if you take the initiative early on and conquer another civilization, there's another ready to invade you. This happened on multiple occassions to me. It would be fine if there was some logical reason behind their attacks, or if other civilizations experienced the same struggles. But it's not like that at all.Overall Score: 8.0/10Sid Meier's Civilization V is a grand strategy game filled with many hours of content. It can be really, really fun, but also quite unrealistic at the same time. The game has many pros and only a few cons. I suggest buying Civilization V - Gold Edition, which is cheap and has most DLC included, along with the Gods and Kings expansion. The only package which isn't included is Brave New World, but that's not necessary to enjoy the game.			"

												What more can be send about argumentatively the most addictive game series ever? Coining the phrase 'just one more turn', the Civilization series has a track record of stealing precious hours from its enthralled fans. I started out with Civ 2 and was instantly hooked, helpless to its alluring and seductive gameplay.  I resisted buying Civ 5 for so long. I loved Civ 4, and played it so much that I decided to give the series a break for a while. That turned out to be years, with the occasional game here and there. I could no longer resist when I saw the Civ 5: complete bundle on sale for $12 earlier this year. In terms of value of content, it doesn't get much better than this!I'm sure many of you reading this are familiar with the game mechanics. Civ 5 has simplified aspects of the game from Civ 4, which actually has made the game better in many ways. For example, I used to get frustrated with the number of units a player could stack up on a single tile. I found it to be deceptive, as only one unit type would show up on the tile. Thankfully, Civ 5 only allows one unit to occupy a tile. Thank you, Sid! There are other changes, but for the purpose of this review I will stop myself.Although the game is already 6 years old, the graphics are still great! The soundtrack is also at a very high standard; I would be happy to listen to the opening music for hours. The music in the game is equally as good, giving the player always something nice to listen to. If you are a Civ fan and haven't bought this yet, do! If you are new to the series and unsure, I suggest buying the Civ 5: Complete bundle when on sale. The expansion packs and dlc adds even more gameplay elements, scenarios, and maps (to an already huge offering!). The only thing that should be a decisive factor is whether you have the time to play it. If you enjoy brilliant turn-based strategy games, once you start a game you won't have much time for much else!Buy it at your own peril! I'll give Civ 6 another few years...			"

												Civilization V is an immensely popular Steam game, and rightly so. Its 'Just one more turn!' brilliance is down to lots of brilliant options to customise your game and an abudance of great mods to add  for further customization, no playthrough is ever the same. I would recommend this game to anyone interested in history, geography, or just strategy games in general; its realism is sufficient yet not so much as to be boring. First-rate game in my opinion. I would recommend that you buy the gold/complete edition if you are serious about playing the game. It gives you the nice DLC's that are really worth their money.			"

												I've whiled away many an hour playing every version of this game.  Civ V has it's detractors among those who want a highly detailed wargame along the lines of Civ IV, but I like it's focus on immersion and versatility.  It's still not the perfect version of the game it wants to be, but Brave New World is a giant leap toward that ideal.  The layers of possibilities for your Civilization have never been so diverse and interesting.  All hail the King of Turn-Based Strategy!			"

												This game, is a mix of adrenaline, and a mix of relaxation while you spread your culture, religion, or your power. You can win the game by science, domination, culture, and a few more, but those are the most common, and most enjoyable. I personally love playing science and domination. You get a nice mix of everything in those games, and i mean, come on, war is fun, and so is science! From worrying about your happiness to keep Revelation at bay, to worrying about Russia assembling units around your borders, this game is sure to give you a gratifying, and amazing experience. Many of which you will find yourself telling your friends about. This game is addicting as hell, you will find yourself slugging along at 4 in the morning ""Just....One.....More....Turn"" and so on. The combat is brilliant, the game is pretty balanced, only a few issues with that, but hard to notice, and rare to come across, and it's a blast to play with friends, and by yourself. Now, if you are a civ4 player coming to 5, the new diplomacy will take some getting used to. ALWAYS and i mean ALWAYS have a good defense, or civs who are bigger, and better than you will walk all over you to expand, but if your military is a threat, they will back off. Also, your actions can affect your relations with the other civs. If you were to make a proposal in the world congress a civ docent like, it will make then VERY angry with you, deepening on the proposal, it could be a war on your hands. Overall, the game is worth every penny, and it one of my favorite games of all time, a MUST HAVE!!!			"

												153 Hours in to the game and I am still loving it...Civilization V is my first game in the Civilization series and now that I got it I don't Understand why I never played the others.You start the game off with one group of settlers and a warrior to protect them, from there you start building your civilization.It's not like other strategy games where you literally build every single building, the map is devided into Hexagonal tiles with different resources, all you have to do is build your settlement and from there on expand to the surrounding tiles, as you play you unlock new buildings to upgrade your settlements, you can found new settlements as freely as you like but you always run risk of attack so make sure you have the proper amount of troops to protect those new found bottom feeding settlements of yours.There are 5 ways to win the game: Domination victory, Science victory, Cultural victory, Diplomatic victory or a Score Victory.But this means there are 5 ways for you to get beaten as well so you will need to not only keep an eye on your own civilization but your enemy's aswell, and know exactly when it's time to attack or ally up.If you get tired of the standard game check out the scenarios, that is where the real fun begins, with scenario's that actually happened like the Boers vs the Zulu's in Africa, the Mayan's who feared the end of the world and all the troubles they faced like the french invading them with weapons they have never even seen before in their lives, the scenario's have it all.And if that's not enough, Civilization V supports the steam workshop so there are endless mods for you to choose from to spice your game up even more.The game is very easy to learn with the help of your advisers who even though they can be pretty annoying sometimes, make sure you know what you are doing and what the Consequences will be if you take a certain action. They will take good care of you.My Rating 9/10 - (-1 the game sometimes feels like it's taking forever to finish, but there are settings to change the game speed which will sort this out for you, but I found that on Standard settings the game takes forever and on quick settings you can't help but feel extremely rushed. It would have been nice to have something in between. )BUY THIS GAME!!! IT'S AMAZING			"

												Honestly? Yes, I do reccomend it to any MMO Board game fans or Strategy players out there. Civ V is a time-eating game, it's a game you can casually playand check your emails/facebook while playing, but thatdoesnt mean the game isn't intense, whenever I sit down to play a game of Civ for a few minutes, I end up spending my whole day building my civillization. This game also has great tool-tips and UI. I mastered the game without the need of tutuorial but there areadvisor-in-game diologues that explain everything. (These can be disabled.) In all fairness, I give this game a 8.5 out of 10, buy this game, it's worth every single penny.			"

												I am a fan of turn based strategy games.  I know a lot of people find these to be the antithesis of fun, but for me I find the slower pace to be quite enjoyable.  It is just a blast to watch your civilization grow and finally envelope the world.  The game can be challenging but it is just so fun to watch your guys, who have developed to the freaking space age, tearing through the medieval armies of your foes.  It is one of those games that is difficult to stop playing.  I have played games from start to finish in one sitting.  Those familiar with the title can tell you that can be a LONG while.  Cannot recommend this game enough.UPDATE: Still playing and enjoying it.			"

I think that game HAVE balance. All nations have own bonuses. Choice what u like and beat your opponents.8. For newbies — easy to learn.Omg... It's just Civilization, what i can say more?!And... Only one bad sign i can say about Civ V — cropped release version... Because, if you want religion — you will need to buy DLC Gods & Kings... Nobody like that marketing politic.Cheers, Mazy.			"

												   It all started when our protagonist, Civ 5, woke up in a pumpkin patch. It was the fourth time it had happened. Feeling ridiculously exasperated, Civ 5 groped a sock, thinking it would make him feel better (but as usual, it did not). Unexpectedly, he realized that his beloved♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of truth was missing!  Immediately he called his friend, Leroy Jenkins. Civ 5 had known Leroy Jenkins for (plus or minus) one million years, the majority of which were sassy ones.  Leroy Jenkins was unique. He was intelligent though sometimes a little... dimwitted. Civ 5 called him anyway, for the situation was urgent.   Leroy Jenkins picked up to a very happy Civ 5. Leroy Jenkins calmly assured him that most koalas yawn before mating, yet otters usually earnestly grimace *after* mating. He had no idea what that meant; he was only concerned with distracting Civ 5.  Why was Leroy Jenkins trying to distract Civ 5?  Because he had snuck out from Civ 5's with the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of truth only four days prior.  It was a saucy little♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of truth... how could he resist?   It didn't take long before Civ 5 got back to the subject at hand: his♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of truth. Leroy Jenkins sighed. Relunctantly, Leroy Jenkins invited him over, assuring him they'd find the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of truth. Civ 5 grabbed his desk and disembarked immediately. After hanging up the phone, Leroy Jenkins realized that he was in trouble. He had to find a place to hide the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of truth and he had to do it thoughtfully. He figured that if Civ 5 took the truck, he had take at least eleven minutes before Civ 5 would get there.  But if he took the♥♥♥♥♥  Then Leroy Jenkins would be alarmingly screwed.   Before he could come up with any reasonable ideas, Leroy Jenkins was interrupted by seven abrasive aligators that were lured by his♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of truth. Leroy Jenkins sighed; 'Not again', he thought. Feeling frustrated, he thoughtfully reached for his mitten and aptly backhanded every last one of them. Apparently this was an adequate deterrent--the discouraged critters began to scurry back toward the thicket, squealing with discontent. He exhaled with relief.  That's when he heard the♥♥♥♥♥rolling up.  It was Civ 5.----o0o----    As he pulled up, he felt a sense of urgency. He had had to make an unscheduled stop at Wal-Mart to pick up a 12-pack of pencils, so he knew he was running late.  With a calculated leap, Civ 5 was out of the♥♥♥♥♥and went indiscriminately jaunting toward Leroy Jenkins's front door.  Meanwhile inside,  Leroy Jenkins was panicking.  Not thinking, he tossed the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of truth into a box of mittens and then slid the box behind his piano. Leroy Jenkins was concerned but at least the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of truth was concealed.  The doorbell rang.   'Come in,' Leroy Jenkins sassily purred.  With a careful push, Civ 5 opened the door.  'Sorry for being late, but I was being chased by some funny-smelling maniac in a Vette,' he lied.  'It's fine,' Leroy Jenkins assured him. Civ 5 took a seat vaguely close to where Leroy Jenkins had hidden the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of truth. Leroy Jenkins cringed trying unsuccessfully to hide his nervousness.  'Uhh, can I get you anything?' he blurted.  But Civ 5 was distracted. Without warning, Leroy Jenkins noticed a selfish look on Civ 5's face. Civ 5 slowly opened his mouth to speak.   '...What's that smell?'   Leroy Jenkins felt a stabbing pain in his butt when Civ 5 asked this.  In a moment of disbelief, he realized that he had hidden the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of truth right by his oscillating fan. 'Wh-what?  I don't smell anything..!'  A lie.  A insensitive look started to form on Civ 5's face. He turned to notice a box that seemed clearly out of place. 'Th-th-those are just my grandma's mittens from when she used to have pet bunnies.  She, uh...dropped 'em by here earlier'. Civ 5 nodded with fake acknowledgement...then, before Leroy Jenkins could react, Civ 5 randomly lunged toward the box and opened it.  The♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of truth was plainly in view.   Civ 5 stared at Leroy Jenkins for what what must've been four seconds. Unexpectedly, Leroy Jenkins groped wildly in Civ 5's direction, clearly desperate. Civ 5 grabbed the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of truth and bolted for the door.  It was locked. Leroy Jenkins let out a eccentric chuckle. 'If only you hadn't been so protective of that thing, none of this would have happened, Civ 5,' he rebuked. Leroy Jenkins always had been a little insensitive, so Civ 5 knew that reconciliation was not an option; he needed to escape before Leroy Jenkins did something crazy, like... start chucking mittens at him or something. All of a sudden, he gripped his♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of truth tightly and made a dash toward the window, diving headlong through the glass panels.   Leroy Jenkins looked on, blankly. 'What the hell?  That seemed excessive.  The other door was open, you know.' Silence from Civ 5. 'And to think, I varnished that window frame nine days ago...it never ends!' Suddenly he felt a tinge of concern for Civ 5. 'Oh.  You ..okay?' Still silence. Leroy Jenkins walked over to the window and looked down. Civ 5 was gone.----o0o----    Just yonder, Civ 5 was struggling to make his way through the pumpkin patch behind Leroy Jenkins's place. Civ 5 had severely hurt his arm during the window incident, and was starting to lose strength.  Another pack of feral aligators suddenly appeared, having caught wind of the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of truth.  One by one they latched on to Civ 5.  Already weakened from his injury, Civ 5 yielded to the furry onslaught and collapsed.  The last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a buzzing horde of aligators running off with his♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of truth.   About seven hours later, Civ 5 awoke, his butt throbbing.  It was dark and Civ 5 did not know where he was.  Deep in the humid desert, Civ 5 was abundantly lost. A few minutes later, he remembered that his♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of truth was taken by the aligators. But at that point, he was just thankful for his life.  That's when, to his horror, a oversized aligator emerged from the cornfield.  It was the alpha aligator. Civ 5 opened his mouth to scream but was cut short when the aligator sunk its teeth into Civ 5's face. With a faint groan, the life escaped from Civ 5's lungs, but not before he realized that he was a failure.   Less than two miles away, Leroy Jenkins was entombed by anguish over the loss of the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of truth.  'MY PRECIOUS!!' he cried, as he reached for a sharpened spoon.  With a heroic thrust, he buried it deeply into his neck.  As the room began to fade to black, he thought about Civ 5... wishing he had found the courage to tell him that he loved him.  But he would die alone that day.  All that remained was the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of truth that had turned them against each other, ultimately causing their demise.  And as the dew on melancholy sappling branches began to reflect the dawn's reddish glare, all that could be heard was the chilling cry of distant aligators, desecrating all things sacred to virtuous men, and perpetuating an evil that would reign for centuries to come.  Our heroes would've lived unhappily ever after, but they were too busy being dead.  So, no one lived forever after, the end. :'(			"

												I am a fan of turn based strategy games.  I know a lot of people find these to be the antithesis of fun, but for me I find the slower pace to be quite enjoyable.  It is just a blast to watch your civilization grow and finally envelope the world.  The game can be challenging but it is just so fun to watch your guys, who have developed to the freaking space age, tearing through the medieval armies of your foes.  It is one of those games that is difficult to stop playing.  I have played games from start to finish in one sitting.  Those familiar with the title can tell you that can be a LONG while.  Cannot recommend this game enough.UPDATE: Still playing and enjoying it.			"

												I have been playing this game non-stop for the past day and wow, you start playing at 10AM, next thing you know it is midnight. The game is highly addictive and very entertaining, the game will easily teach a new player exactly what to do, but even as you play more and more, you learn new things and gain new tactics. Civilization V is an all round great strategy game, with great game mechanics. The only downside to the game is that the Civilizations do not get smarter as you increase difficulty, they just get a much better start, although this is easily fixed with a mod.I would have to give this game a 10/10 based on my experience with it so far and anyone contemplating buying this game should definately go for it.

												After being an avid fan of the entire Civilization series, especially III and IV, since I was old enough to understand the strategy of them when they were released, I remember becoming rather psyched up when I heard of the impending release of this game. It was an interesting start to a lovely relationship.Any Civ fan from before Civ V will remember the interesting and controversial spoilers: No religion? Shame. No unit stacking? Brave. Hexagonal tiles? Scandal!For those who had not been indoctrinated with the traditions of previous Civ games, I'll admit, the forums all looked a bit silly. Eventually, a demo was released, and I installed it and played it, all 100 turns of it, and I wasn't impressed. It was all a bit boring. And that was the end of that. I wasn't going to spend a wad of my hard-earned dole money on a game that wasn't amazing. I would just play Civ IV instead.Then, one late Spring day almost four years later, a Steam sale tugged at the heartstrings of my throat, and beckoned me and my wallet to join it in virtual matrimony, and, in a whim of impetuous and spontaneous peer pressure, I bought it, and the complete edition with all of its DLC at that. It's the best whim I've ever had on a late Spring day almost four years after Civ V was released.It is a pretty game. It is easy to learn to play. You don't have to micromanage, although if, like me, you want to, then it is quite possible to manage most microscopically. Religions were introduced in the expansion packs, and they work very well. Hexagons are a lovely shape, and I find them even more accomodating than those old squares (Just ask the Settlers). The music is fabulous, unless you play as an African or Middle-Eastern nation, in which case you mostly get wind instruments that sound like dying animals, but other than that, the music is fabulous. The lack of animations for wonders and victories was slightly disappointing, but the artwork that takes its place is marvelous. A nice man narrates the technologies rather nicely, although everyone prefers Leonard Nimoy from Civ IV. The gameplay, although a broad topic, can suitably be described as good. As might be expected, it is difficult to try to lose on the easiest difficulties, and impossibly hard on the hardest. The leaders and nations available are colourful and exciting, and we can still become best friends with Catherine the Great. The civilopedia entries are very useful for the game, of course, but also contain real history and information which is well-written, and which I have personally spent hours reading in the middle of a game. The Steam achievements connected with the game are hilarious, and when you read them, make you want to cross your arms and say to yourself: ""challenge accepted.""I could go on, but I realise that, in summary, it may be best to conclude by preparing any potential player to adopt the correct mental attitude. This is not an expansion pack to Civ IV, obviously, so don't treat it like one. It is more like a younger brother to it than a son. It's different, and there may be parts of it you don't like, such as hexagons or city-capture or the way he smacks his mouth when he eats his breakfast. But I don't see any reason why, even if you have a preference, you can't be friends with both.Please enjoy this game very much, and be careful with that Attila fellow. He can't be trusted.			"

												Civilization V is as much a lateral step away from the complicated nature of Civ IV as it is a step forward in the franchise's vaunted history. Most importantly, after 18 months, Civ 5 has improved dramatically from the game it was upon release. The AI is improved, key game concepts have been buffed and nerfed, as needed. And there is welcome, but not critical, DLC.What I love about this version: hex-based game board for more natural movement. No more stacks of doom. Global happiness. No tech trading. Drastically improved AI relations. Improved event notification system means you never miss a beat.What I dislike: The tech tree has been significantly flattened from Civ 4. Tech and Culture victories are terribly boring to achieve: hunker down, press ""next turn"", repeat 200 times. Overreliance on gold farming to buy off all problems.Overall - a successful attempt to streamline gameplay without removing core elements. Civ 5 is a success, and I welcome the coming expansion(s).

I haven't I haven't played Civ U, Civ T, or even Civ S. It doesn't even seem like they sell it here. Although, the game is really good, if you end up buying Golden Edition and Brave New World.

I might be new to Civ but if you love Strategy, get this game. It's worth every cent. Although if you want (cuz it's pretty expensive with the expansion packs) then wait until there is a sale. Then you can buy the Gold edition. Having an expansion pack adds so much to the gameplay. Either wait or buy now, but once you do buy it, well, ENJOY!			"

												I've been saying to myself ""this is the last turn i swear"", but i'm just not able to quit. These are the problems that show up as soon as you begin understanding the fundementals of this game.Sid Meier's Civlization V is a turn-based 4x game, where you manage you cities and make sure your people are well fed and happy. The goal in this game is to be the most progressive population on the planet. You start out with a city that fits the population you've chosen. From here on out you start exploring and building things. With the first unit, you will find things like ruins and barbarian camps. The barbarians are your first real enemy, you will have to try to fight them off while progressing your first city. When you start expanding alot you find out that the barbarians are not a real threat anymore. In fact you will be alot more busy with the other populations on the map. The other populations can be friendly but also an enemy. This is where diplomacy comes in, some leaders of the populations may trick you and create traps to backstab you after a while, so you have to be carefull on what you decide what's best. You also get to trade and discuss with these leaders, for instance, you could trade a luxury that your population wishes for.After a couple of hundered turns you'll get the hang of it and start liking the game alot, for me it's the progressing that makes me hooked to this game. it's the mentality of ""just finishing this one thing"" that makes it soo addicting to me.I find it to be one of the best games i have every played. This is the first civilization game i ever played, but now i regret that i never played the previous parts of this series. All in all a great game! I highly recommend it!			"

												I am a fan of turn based strategy games.  I know a lot of people find these to be the antithesis of fun, but for me I find the slower pace to be quite enjoyable.  It is just a blast to watch your civilization grow and finally envelope the world.  The game can be challenging but it is just so fun to watch your guys, who have developed to the freaking space age, tearing through the medieval armies of your foes.  It is one of those games that is difficult to stop playing.  I have played games from start to finish in one sitting.  Those familiar with the title can tell you that can be a LONG while.  Cannot recommend this game enough.UPDATE: Still playing and enjoying it.			"

I might be new to Civ but if you love Strategy, get this game. It's worth every cent. Although if you want (cuz it's pretty expensive with the expansion packs) then wait until there is a sale. Then you can buy the Gold edition. Having an expansion pack adds so much to the gameplay. Either wait or buy now, but once you do buy it, well, ENJOY!			"

												I've been saying to myself ""this is the last turn i swear"", but i'm just not able to quit. These are the problems that show up as soon as you begin understanding the fundementals of this game.Sid Meier's Civlization V is a turn-based 4x game, where you manage you cities and make sure your people are well fed and happy. The goal in this game is to be the most progressive population on the planet. You start out with a city that fits the population you've chosen. From here on out you start exploring and building things. With the first unit, you will find things like ruins and barbarian camps. The barbarians are your first real enemy, you will have to try to fight them off while progressing your first city. When you start expanding alot you find out that the barbarians are not a real threat anymore. In fact you will be alot more busy with the other populations on the map. The other populations can be friendly but also an enemy. This is where diplomacy comes in, some leaders of the populations may trick you and create traps to backstab you after a while, so you have to be carefull on what you decide what's best. You also get to trade and discuss with these leaders, for instance, you could trade a luxury that your population wishes for.After a couple of hundered turns you'll get the hang of it and start liking the game alot, for me it's the progressing that makes me hooked to this game. it's the mentality of ""just finishing this one thing"" that makes it soo addicting to me.I find it to be one of the best games i have every played. This is the first civilization game i ever played, but now i regret that i never played the previous parts of this series. All in all a great game! I highly recommend it!			"

												I would definitely have to say that I thoroughly enjoy Civilization V. Civ 5 is up in my top ranked games, and many reasons got it there. One would be the fact that you can see your own civilization progress through the ages, which I find to be a very interesting concept. Should I list all of the reasons in this review, it would be a good 5 pages long, so instead, I'm just going to say that I highly recommend this game, just make sure that you have the patience for it. Finally, as I'm sure has been said in most reviews, I would say that although this game is great, like an actual empire, it takes the collaboration of all of the components to work swimmingly, that being said in simpler terms, this game is only worth it with all of the DLC that is available for purchase. It may be a sum of extra money for some, but it will be worth it in the end. If you are a bargain hunter though, then wait until a huge sale, such as the summer or winter sale, and get the game with all of the DLC for less than the price of the game alone when it's not on sale. That's all from me, so happy gaming!			"

												One of the best turn based 4x strategy games out there. Civilization V is vastly improved by the expansions Gods & Kings and Brave New World so I would reccommend picking those up if you are considering Civilization V. This game is great at allowing you to expand your civilizations through any way possible whether it be by war, diplomacy, or your economy. The game doesn't stale as you head into the late game because of the World Congress and Idealogies you are able to pick up once you get closer to the Atomic Era. Idealogies does a great job of creating rivals and allies as you align with the people you share Idealogies with.This game is relatively easy to run and can be accessible to most poeple. The multiplayer is fun if you can find friends to play with as it is more interesting playing with people you known. There are some faults with multiplayer as the game will often reload itself for no apparent reason.Overall great game and is a must own for anyone that enjoes 4x strategy games.			"

												I'm not huge on 4x games, but my recent time playing one in particular (Thea: The Awakening) reminded me of how fun they can be. I had this just sitting in my library, and it hooked me quick. It can be pretty slow paced, that's for sure, but that's the nature of this type of game; I recommend it if you have any bit of patience, or are a fan of board games with lots of intricacies to learn. Otherwise, this is not likely for you.Civilization, along with pretty much other strategy game, is for the thinking man, always looking at the long-run benefits. Civ in particular, though, has always had several options for you to go about achieving your victory, most of them relatively peaceful. It's not hard to see why they pump out sequels.PROS:* Models and textures are surprisingly high quality, both on and off the board.* Soundtrack is varied, pleasant, and changes seamlessly to fit what's happening. Could range from anything to a wartime theme complete with trumpets and drums, to something you'd hear at a classical ball.* As always, the narration and voice work in general is on point.* Customizable to the extreme in almost every aspect--gameplay, UI, tutorial hints, graphics, sound--if you can think it, this game can do it. As advertised, it seems to be capable of running on any rig with no trouble.* Bonus points for upgrading from square tiles to a hex grid.I struggle to think of any cons for this one. The whole game's mechanically sound, it's tuneable, everything is as-advertised, and it's got polish (pun intended). If you're looking forward to Civ VI and haven't already done so, snag this one, at least when it goes on sale, it's the best game of the series by a long-shot.			"

												After being an avid fan of the entire Civilization series, especially III and IV, since I was old enough to understand the strategy of them when they were released, I remember becoming rather psyched up when I heard of the impending release of this game. It was an interesting start to a lovely relationship.Any Civ fan from before Civ V will remember the interesting and controversial spoilers: No religion? Shame. No unit stacking? Brave. Hexagonal tiles? Scandal!For those who had not been indoctrinated with the traditions of previous Civ games, I'll admit, the forums all looked a bit silly. Eventually, a demo was released, and I installed it and played it, all 100 turns of it, and I wasn't impressed. It was all a bit boring. And that was the end of that. I wasn't going to spend a wad of my hard-earned dole money on a game that wasn't amazing. I would just play Civ IV instead.Then, one late Spring day almost four years later, a Steam sale tugged at the heartstrings of my throat, and beckoned me and my wallet to join it in virtual matrimony, and, in a whim of impetuous and spontaneous peer pressure, I bought it, and the complete edition with all of its DLC at that. It's the best whim I've ever had on a late Spring day almost four years after Civ V was released.It is a pretty game. It is easy to learn to play. You don't have to micromanage, although if, like me, you want to, then it is quite possible to manage most microscopically. Religions were introduced in the expansion packs, and they work very well. Hexagons are a lovely shape, and I find them even more accomodating than those old squares (Just ask the Settlers). The music is fabulous, unless you play as an African or Middle-Eastern nation, in which case you mostly get wind instruments that sound like dying animals, but other than that, the music is fabulous. The lack of animations for wonders and victories was slightly disappointing, but the artwork that takes its place is marvelous. A nice man narrates the technologies rather nicely, although everyone prefers Leonard Nimoy from Civ IV. The gameplay, although a broad topic, can suitably be described as good. As might be expected, it is difficult to try to lose on the easiest difficulties, and impossibly hard on the hardest. The leaders and nations available are colourful and exciting, and we can still become best friends with Catherine the Great. The civilopedia entries are very useful for the game, of course, but also contain real history and information which is well-written, and which I have personally spent hours reading in the middle of a game. The Steam achievements connected with the game are hilarious, and when you read them, make you want to cross your arms and say to yourself: ""challenge accepted.""I could go on, but I realise that, in summary, it may be best to conclude by preparing any potential player to adopt the correct mental attitude. This is not an expansion pack to Civ IV, obviously, so don't treat it like one. It is more like a younger brother to it than a son. It's different, and there may be parts of it you don't like, such as hexagons or city-capture or the way he smacks his mouth when he eats his breakfast. But I don't see any reason why, even if you have a preference, you can't be friends with both.Please enjoy this game very much, and be careful with that Attila fellow. He can't be trusted.			"

												Arguably one of the, if not the best series of geo-political history strategy games to ever exist. Its creator Sid Meier has renowned this game to fulfill most aspects to create a realistic strategy game that could be tackled in endless ways and mediums.Succeeding a disappointing Civilization IV, Civilization 5 has introduced a hexa-grid game style giving the game a new graphical and strategic taste. The re-introduction of religion and culture in the later DLCs also redeemed what was lost from Civilization IV.The most appealing aspect of this game is the different ways one could lead their civilization to victory and the unique tenets of each culture and civilization. In addition the ongoing integrating community has produced great mods which have even made the game more realistic than ever along its HD graphics such as the EARTH 2014 MOD where one could tackle the political obstacles as a modern political leader in the real world. da3ouk			"

												Very addictive. I launched a rocket as the Mongols in one game and got nuked by the Mayans in the next one. Then I downloaded a Mod and curbstomped the Greeks as a country led by Akemi Homura. None of that makes even the slightest bit of sense, but I love it. Some High Number/10, excellent game.			"

												What more can be send about argumentatively the most addictive game series ever? Coining the phrase 'just one more turn', the Civilization series has a track record of stealing precious hours from its enthralled fans. I started out with Civ 2 and was instantly hooked, helpless to its alluring and seductive gameplay.  I resisted buying Civ 5 for so long. I loved Civ 4, and played it so much that I decided to give the series a break for a while. That turned out to be years, with the occasional game here and there. I could no longer resist when I saw the Civ 5: complete bundle on sale for $12 earlier this year. In terms of value of content, it doesn't get much better than this!I'm sure many of you reading this are familiar with the game mechanics. Civ 5 has simplified aspects of the game from Civ 4, which actually has made the game better in many ways. For example, I used to get frustrated with the number of units a player could stack up on a single tile. I found it to be deceptive, as only one unit type would show up on the tile. Thankfully, Civ 5 only allows one unit to occupy a tile. Thank you, Sid! There are other changes, but for the purpose of this review I will stop myself.Although the game is already 6 years old, the graphics are still great! The soundtrack is also at a very high standard; I would be happy to listen to the opening music for hours. The music in the game is equally as good, giving the player always something nice to listen to. If you are a Civ fan and haven't bought this yet, do! If you are new to the series and unsure, I suggest buying the Civ 5: Complete bundle when on sale. The expansion packs and dlc adds even more gameplay elements, scenarios, and maps (to an already huge offering!). The only thing that should be a decisive factor is whether you have the time to play it. If you enjoy brilliant turn-based strategy games, once you start a game you won't have much time for much else!Buy it at your own peril! I'll give Civ 6 another few years...			"

												Warning - I'm a fan of Civilization games from the beginning; consider this review may have some positive bias.  ;-) And, this review assumes you can read the basic description of the game in the Store; not going to repeat that.Likes:Social Policy System --   A better way to achieve a Cultural victory while helping with other victory conditions.  A needed replacement for the ""Civics"" feature of the prior Civ game.  The new system offers a great variety of paths to get to Cultural victory.  And, it can be integral in developing strategic advantages and it directly supports other victory conditions.Tactical Game Play -- Hex tiles; what a concept.  Finally!  Partial damage to units is also an improvement, although a 100% healthy unit can be destroyed if up against a much stronger unit.  Lack of stacking combat units may bother some, but in context of the changes in tactical play, it works very well.  The aspect of tactical game play has improved.City Defense -- Cities can now defend themselves without a garrison, which improves upon the siege concept.  With a garrison, some strength is added to the city.  Requiring a garrison didn't add much to the game; other than the concern for a stupid, instant death by having no garrison.City-States -- A useful addition to the game.  As an Ally, you may get two or three types of benefits: food, strategic resources, luxuries, culture, and military units.  Their allegiance can be bought for much gold, but it is best when they offer opportunities to win their favor.  After getting their favor, you get some influence so moving to Ally with money is cheaper.  As an Ally, they will go to war with you, automatically.  Although, they are not very effective except possibly as a distraction to your enemy.Dislikes:A bug or two or three --  1. I prefer multiplayer, either competitive or coop.  Unfortunately, when resuming a saved game with AI, the AI gets an extra turn.  We have tried using the Auto-Save versions or the directly saved versions, but it seems to always happen to us.  I try not to save when we are at war; that can be really bad giving the AI a free turn.  2. Workers sometimes stop what they are working on.  This is with no enemy action nearby, (not at war).  It is necessary to click on them and re-order the action.  This applies to building single-tile improvements, or directing a range of action like laying a railroad upon an existing road.Some things I'm glad are gone from some prior versions, but that's just me:Religion -- In Vanilla there is no religion aspect.  I actually liked it in some prior versions, but I see now with it gone, it really doesn't matter to me.  It would be more managing and strategizing, but I'm happy with all that I must do in this current version.Corporations -- Same as with Religion.  It was nice, but I can easily live without it.Stacking combat units -- Stacking was nice in that you could use combined arms effects by putting a defensive unit stacked with an offensive unit.  I liked the flexibility that gave the player.  Civ 5 doesn't have stacking, but it has made other changes to the tactical game that are an improvement.  Also, I like now that a front line is generally bigger in hex coverage.  That makes for a better feel of a real battle.  Stacking units was, in the end, rather boring.Conclusion:The game of Civilization has gone through many changes for a game.  The trend was adding more and more characteristics of the real world.  It was becoming more and more involved and complex.  Although, as with every Civ I've played, it's not strictly necessary to play in a very complex style to achieve victory.  Indeed, some versions took that to a fault resulting in easy quick kills to win the game.By reducing some of the complexity, (adding Social Policy and City-States some would say they haven't), they have come up with an extremely playable version of Civilization.  And for those that want back some of the removed complexity, the Expansion Packs will fill that need.  In Civ 5, they have not sacrificed any of the key strategic concepts and they have improved upon some.  And, they have most definately improved upon the tactical level.  I will be playing this game for a long time. "

												I would definitely recommend this game to people like these sorts of a games and strategy games in general.I'm not gonna make a long review, but I'm gonna list a few pros, cons and at the end an overview/conclusion. PROS:  Huge replayability, every 'playthrough' is different There is a playstyle for nearly everyone (if you have the Brave New World DLC; we'll get back to that later) The multiplayer is very fun, especially when you go after the domination victory. The workshop is filled with mods, that add civs, mechanics, scenarios, which all add to the replayability of this game. CONS:  I have never played without the DLCs (except in multiplayer) but from what I've heard and seen, without the DLC, Civilization V is not as enjoyable, so I could only recommend it with the DLCs.Without the DLCs there are also about 20 less civilizations to play, so a lot of playstyles (strategies) can't really be played without them. The AI can be pretty moronic (surprisingly so in Multiplayer [e.g. I'll give you Sugar for all your Resources]) and do pretty dumb things, like declare war on civilisations halfway across the world. CONCLUSION: All in all, I could only recommend buying this game (with all addons), especially if it's on sale and you can get all the DLCs with the game for only 11 Euros or so (like me).It's one of my favourite games and I'm definitely going to be playing a lot more.

												Sid Meier's Civilization V is one of the greatest games I have played. With an almost infinite replayability value, this game can be played over and over again and get a different experience each time. Depending on how you set up the game you can play a quick hour or two game or a game that lasts days. If you are looking to sit back, relax and dominate, you can play on an easier setting. If you are looking for a very difficult challenge, you can play on the hardest difficulty mode. And the modding community for this is great and extensive, there are all sorts of cool and entertaining mods. I really enjoyed this game, and its DLC's.			"

												I really like that part of oldest ""sitcom"" in history of game development... ).So, guys, just try and enjoy that stuff. If u will play with friends, u will find great timekiller and funny moments in that game. ).Civilization V back us to classic hexagons rather than Civ IV. It's first  good sign.2. Great multiplayer mode.3. Great scenarios for lone wolves.4. Extended settings for your own game.5. Recommended by time. ).6. Of course, i love that soundtrack. Great work by composers.7. I think that game HAVE balance. All nations have own bonuses. Choice what u like and beat your opponents.8. For newbies — easy to learn.Omg... It's just Civilization, what i can say more?!And... Only one bad sign i can say about Civ V — cropped release version... Because, if you want religion — you will need to buy DLC Gods & Kings... Nobody like that marketing politic.Cheers, Mazy.			"

												One of my favorite games. Strategic and addictive. There's many play styles and world leaders to choose from. Every time I play, there is a new map and leaders to trade with, making every individual game different each time. That for me, makes the game more enjoyable. If you enjoy playing the vanilla, I recommend buying all the DLC when it goes on sale. It makes the overall game so different, yet so advanced. Also super fun to play with friends. The game is definitely worth the purchase.			"

												Great Game, worth the money i paid.A classic gaming series, amazing. Just amazing. I don't even care if i win now, i just enjoy playing the game, beautiful graphics, nice opening video and i play with everything on low so my laptop can run it. Challenging if you go on a high enough difficulty and fun occasionly to go on low difficulty to rek scroobs. Exciting strategy game that's full of surprises, i've heard people saying it's bad at higher difficulties, and i think why? Is it because you can't win? It certainly lives up to its ""one more turn"" tag, i've often said i'll finish in 5 minutes and end up playing for hours more. Best game i've played in a long time. Despite its high cost still buy it, you'll have almost endless fun. One of the first games i got on steam and one of the only ones i'm still playing. It's fairly easy to make mods, well mods anyway!

												One of the best turn based 4x strategy games out there. Civilization V is vastly improved by the expansions Gods & Kings and Brave New World so I would reccommend picking those up if you are considering Civilization V. This game is great at allowing you to expand your civilizations through any way possible whether it be by war, diplomacy, or your economy. The game doesn't stale as you head into the late game because of the World Congress and Idealogies you are able to pick up once you get closer to the Atomic Era. Idealogies does a great job of creating rivals and allies as you align with the people you share Idealogies with.This game is relatively easy to run and can be accessible to most poeple. The multiplayer is fun if you can find friends to play with as it is more interesting playing with people you known. There are some faults with multiplayer as the game will often reload itself for no apparent reason.Overall great game and is a must own for anyone that enjoes 4x strategy games.			"

												Arguably one of the, if not the best series of geo-political history strategy games to ever exist. Its creator Sid Meier has renowned this game to fulfill most aspects to create a realistic strategy game that could be tackled in endless ways and mediums.Succeeding a disappointing Civilization IV, Civilization 5 has introduced a hexa-grid game style giving the game a new graphical and strategic taste. The re-introduction of religion and culture in the later DLCs also redeemed what was lost from Civilization IV.The most appealing aspect of this game is the different ways one could lead their civilization to victory and the unique tenets of each culture and civilization. In addition the ongoing integrating community has produced great mods which have even made the game more realistic than ever along its HD graphics such as the EARTH 2014 MOD where one could tackle the political obstacles as a modern political leader in the real world. da3ouk			"

I might be new to Civ but if you love Strategy, get this game. It's worth every cent. Although if you want (cuz it's pretty expensive with the expansion packs) then wait until there is a sale. Then you can buy the Gold edition. Having an expansion pack adds so much to the gameplay. Either wait or buy now, but once you do buy it, well, ENJOY!			"

												I've been saying to myself ""this is the last turn i swear"", but i'm just not able to quit. These are the problems that show up as soon as you begin understanding the fundementals of this game.Sid Meier's Civlization V is a turn-based 4x game, where you manage you cities and make sure your people are well fed and happy. The goal in this game is to be the most progressive population on the planet. You start out with a city that fits the population you've chosen. From here on out you start exploring and building things. With the first unit, you will find things like ruins and barbarian camps. The barbarians are your first real enemy, you will have to try to fight them off while progressing your first city. When you start expanding alot you find out that the barbarians are not a real threat anymore. In fact you will be alot more busy with the other populations on the map. The other populations can be friendly but also an enemy. This is where diplomacy comes in, some leaders of the populations may trick you and create traps to backstab you after a while, so you have to be carefull on what you decide what's best. You also get to trade and discuss with these leaders, for instance, you could trade a luxury that your population wishes for.After a couple of hundered turns you'll get the hang of it and start liking the game alot, for me it's the progressing that makes me hooked to this game. it's the mentality of ""just finishing this one thing"" that makes it soo addicting to me.I find it to be one of the best games i have every played. This is the first civilization game i ever played, but now i regret that i never played the previous parts of this series. All in all a great game! I highly recommend it!			"

												Warning - I'm a fan of Civilization games from the beginning; consider this review may have some positive bias.  ;-) And, this review assumes you can read the basic description of the game in the Store; not going to repeat that.Likes:Social Policy System --   A better way to achieve a Cultural victory while helping with other victory conditions.  A needed replacement for the ""Civics"" feature of the prior Civ game.  The new system offers a great variety of paths to get to Cultural victory.  And, it can be integral in developing strategic advantages and it directly supports other victory conditions.Tactical Game Play -- Hex tiles; what a concept.  Finally!  Partial damage to units is also an improvement, although a 100% healthy unit can be destroyed if up against a much stronger unit.  Lack of stacking combat units may bother some, but in context of the changes in tactical play, it works very well.  The aspect of tactical game play has improved.City Defense -- Cities can now defend themselves without a garrison, which improves upon the siege concept.  With a garrison, some strength is added to the city.  Requiring a garrison didn't add much to the game; other than the concern for a stupid, instant death by having no garrison.City-States -- A useful addition to the game.  As an Ally, you may get two or three types of benefits: food, strategic resources, luxuries, culture, and military units.  Their allegiance can be bought for much gold, but it is best when they offer opportunities to win their favor.  After getting their favor, you get some influence so moving to Ally with money is cheaper.  As an Ally, they will go to war with you, automatically.  Although, they are not very effective except possibly as a distraction to your enemy.Dislikes:A bug or two or three --  1. I prefer multiplayer, either competitive or coop.  Unfortunately, when resuming a saved game with AI, the AI gets an extra turn.  We have tried using the Auto-Save versions or the directly saved versions, but it seems to always happen to us.  I try not to save when we are at war; that can be really bad giving the AI a free turn.  2. Workers sometimes stop what they are working on.  This is with no enemy action nearby, (not at war).  It is necessary to click on them and re-order the action.  This applies to building single-tile improvements, or directing a range of action like laying a railroad upon an existing road.Some things I'm glad are gone from some prior versions, but that's just me:Religion -- In Vanilla there is no religion aspect.  I actually liked it in some prior versions, but I see now with it gone, it really doesn't matter to me.  It would be more managing and strategizing, but I'm happy with all that I must do in this current version.Corporations -- Same as with Religion.  It was nice, but I can easily live without it.Stacking combat units -- Stacking was nice in that you could use combined arms effects by putting a defensive unit stacked with an offensive unit.  I liked the flexibility that gave the player.  Civ 5 doesn't have stacking, but it has made other changes to the tactical game that are an improvement.  Also, I like now that a front line is generally bigger in hex coverage.  That makes for a better feel of a real battle.  Stacking units was, in the end, rather boring.Conclusion:The game of Civilization has gone through many changes for a game.  The trend was adding more and more characteristics of the real world.  It was becoming more and more involved and complex.  Although, as with every Civ I've played, it's not strictly necessary to play in a very complex style to achieve victory.  Indeed, some versions took that to a fault resulting in easy quick kills to win the game.By reducing some of the complexity, (adding Social Policy and City-States some would say they haven't), they have come up with an extremely playable version of Civilization.  And for those that want back some of the removed complexity, the Expansion Packs will fill that need.  In Civ 5, they have not sacrificed any of the key strategic concepts and they have improved upon some.  And, they have most definately improved upon the tactical level.  I will be playing this game for a long time. "

Great multiplayer mode.3. Great scenarios for lone wolves.4. Extended settings for your own game.5. Recommended by time. ).6. Of course, i love that soundtrack. Great work by composers.7. I think that game HAVE balance. All nations have own bonuses. Choice what u like and beat your opponents.8. For newbies — easy to learn.Omg... It's just Civilization, what i can say more?!And... Only one bad sign i can say about Civ V — cropped release version... Because, if you want religion — you will need to buy DLC Gods & Kings... Nobody like that marketing politic.Cheers, Mazy.			"

All of the aspects in the game (such as production) are linked to each other (building the great library for science, building a worker for happiness, etc) in such a way that every choice you  make will shape the outcome of the game. It also offers wide range of potential playing styles, so that no matter what mood you're in you still want to play the game. Because of this, it has amazing replay value and appeals to a large amount of people.9/10 (the multiplayer is weird)0/10 if you're playing with Ghandi's AI.			"

												With or without the DLCs this is an amazing game however if you have the choice BUY THE DLCs. To be honest playing with friends is well, kind of annoying, if you have friends like I do (ones that get bored after playing for an hour), so I can't comment much on the multiplayer other than the small games I've played with friends.  When playing single player you can just relax and watch the fallout of your nukes burn your enemies as well as take your time, in multiplayer you'll have your friend constantly telling you to 'END YOUR TURN' which causes a little trickle of salt to flow in. Lets be honest, sooner or later this is going to get a bit boring so why not try mods which are no hassle what so ever when you've got the Steam Workshop there full of great mods. If you're anything like me then you'll love the feeling of having a hyper massive map with one giant nation of the other side of it with so many nukes they could blow up the moon. So yeah, great game. I've spent many hours telling my friend I'll be done soon as they wait impatiently for me to 'finish nuking that c*** Egypt'. Funny story, when I said France had attacked Russia with a nuclear missile my friend thought I was talking about real life before running off and telling everyone about it.He felt pretty stupid once I told him that he was tricked by my intense CIV dialog.  So all in all, yeah. Good game.P.S. Its really easy to learn how to play, like, really easy.			"

Note: This review is about Civilization V: Complete Edition. I will not describe the gameplay very deeply. I believe it was described many times in other reviews here on Steam and on many game sites.This game brings back the atmosphere that was in the good old RTS like Rise of Nations or Empire Earth. Choose the civilization you wanto to play as, then guide it from the ancient history to the near future.You can win by conquer every capital city on the map. If you are going to do that, you probably will have to kill everything that stands in your way and conquer all the cities on the way as well. However, there are more victory conditions than just conquer and kill everything. There are more peaceful ways to achieve victory. You can spread your culture to other civilizations. You can become a world leader. Or build a spacecraft and send it to Aplha Centauri. Thanks to this, the game is not only for bloodthirsty warmongers, but also for players who like to play as a peaceful lord. It's also more replayable.Another good point of Civ V is the opportunity of taking history in your hands and change it. What if Zulu was the first nation who sent their spacecraft to Alpha Centauri? Does it hear ridiculous to you? Or what if Napoleon didn't declared himself as the Emperor of France, but was elected as Leader of the World instead? Do you say that it's impossible? Not in this game. This is what I miss in newer games.The game is turn based, so you don't have to hurry. This makes the game relaxing. What makes it even more relaxing is the soundtrack, especially when you play as one of the Middle East civilizations.Another thing that I like about games like this is the fact that you can learn something by just playing them.  Civilopedia, the in-game manual, contains informations not only useful for the gameplay, but also some historical facts.The other way to learn something is to create The Great Works of Arts. They can be produces by Great Writers, Musicians and Artists that are born in your empire. They are named by real persons and the works they create really existed. You can read excerpts from the books, hear parts from the songs and look at the paintings.Sure, you won't gain enough knowledge to teach at Oxford University, but it can raise an interest in you about these things. Well, at least it did in me. There weren't many games with such an impact on me, only Age of Empires II and Rome: Total War, as far as I can remember.I was able to lost myself while playing this game. Many times I told myself ""Ok, I will play this for a few minutes"". Then I looked at the clock and thought ""Well, it's pretty late"". I can fully recommend this game for anybody who likes to play strategies.""Sir, what will be it today?""""We are going for the space victory, James"".""What civilization will you send to space, my lord?""""We will play as Morocco.""After few days...""How is it going, sir?""""We are nearly done, my dear James. We have the most delegates in the world congress. The other nations are waging wars against eachother.""""What ideology have you chosen, if I may ask you?""""We are following the Autocracy ideology.""""Pardon my, my lord, but I am not sure if Autocracy is suitable for space victory.""""Maybe it isn't, James. But we'll get an achievement for it if we win.""""Oh, I understand. How much did you progress in your goal to win the science victory, sir?""""Just a few turns and our spacecraft will be ready. Then we will send it to space and we will be the winners.Just a few turns..."" "

												Still one of the very best strategy games around these days. Civ 5 offers a huge diversity of nations, maps and difficulties that makes it easy to spends hundreds to thousands of hours into the game. As a round based game, where you can play solo with AI or together with real players you will face challenging rounds of strategic building, researching and fighting. Diverse troop types, lots of different tiles, many ways to win the match and an overall freedom of choice on how to play make this an all-time fun game. The only downside one can think of is simply the insane amount of time it can take to play - and actually finish - a multiplayer match. Tip: Buying the gold edition surely brings in a lot more bang for you buck. The DLC's available and the DLC's you might actually need differ a lot. Nations and Maps are a nice bonus, but should only be bought in a discounted state.Overall: Totally recommended if you enjoy long sessions of round based strategy with freedom of choice regarding your gameplay.

												I played Civ 2: Test of Time back in the day. It was fun to explore, the city building was interesting, trying out new units was always enjoable, and then of course, marching an army to an opponent was a blast. Fast forward 10 years to Civ 5. Exploration is always fun. Seeking ruins, meeting city states, fending off barbarians and eventually finding your opponents is great. The reasearch tree in this game makes it incredibly difficult to choose: Do I build up my military tech, increase my gold income, push for some good culture wonders, increase my science, grow my city... etc. and every play can be done differently. I have a favourite tech path due to familiarity, but if needed, I will take any road. The variety in strategy for early game exploration, mid game conquests and late game domination is incredibe. I bought this game on the suggestion of a friend and it was the best money I have spent on a game. Do I recommend Civ 5? YES! GET THE GAME! PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS!Once you get past the initial learning curve, you will find that the exploration, development, strategy, and eventual victory will be incredibly satisfying and very addictive.

												Comparing Civilization V to contemporary strategy games is entirely pointless. Imagine if Modern Warfare had come out alongside Quake II. There is simply nothing comparable out there, not least because the strategy genre has become the province of indie developers and niche publishers. Civ V is a towering, AAA release with millions of dollars worth of polish in an era where questionably localized Russian titles are all that strategy gamers have to tide them over for months at a time. It's also a delightfully fresh take on a formula that has been slowly iterated on for more than two decades.The heart of the Civilization fantasy is unchanged. You still manage cities, developing them from rude collections of mud huts into gleaming modern metropolises. Vast armies and armadas are again at your command, waging global war for conquest, defense, or resources with everything from spears to nukes. The land must still be worked, the primordial wilderness tamed through your people’s sweat and blood. Your ultimate goal is yours to choose: Diplomatically unite the people of the world under your benign leadership, launch a viable colony ship into outer space, conquer the globe through force of arms, or create a glorious utopia through enlightened civility.Civ V's genius lies in the way that Firaxis has aggressively chopped the number of decisions that a player has to make during the course of a game while taking away almost none of the meaningful ones. As a hardcore Civ player, I appreciate some of these ancillary aspects of the design, but the removal of all the fat is unquestionably Civ V's greatest accomplishment.			"

It allows you to grow a civilization of your choice through the ancient era all the way up to the information era, if you can survive until then that is.The vanilla game itself is decent but is lacking in some areas. I highly recommend buying the complete edition which includes two major dlcs; Gods and Kings and Brave New World, with some other small civilization and map dlcs.			"

												Well then, the time has finally come to review what has occupied my life for the past months. Oh Civ 5, how I underestimated you this past summmer when I saw your GOTY edition on steam. How I was hesitant to buy you and thought your gameplay was boring. If only I knew...I bought this game out of pure review score, which of course -being a 90- I assumed was something special. As many of the steam games that are bought during sales do, it sat on my library quite some time while I was busy murdering Teemos on the Fields of Justice. When I finally got tired of that, I decided to check this game out, so I double clicked on the icon, and went into the game with little to no prior knowledge of what lay in store ahead. I booted up the tutorial, grabbed my water and said, ""Well Civ 5, do your worst.""I was greeted by a Morgan Freeman like voice, telling me about America and its past, along with some facts about George Washington. This narrator got me so pumped up; the combination of music, the epic dialouge, the VOICE, mother of god THE VOICE, I had so many goosebumps running over my body that I could hardly contain myself! And then I did it, I pressed Begin Your Journey, little did I know this would take me above and beyond what I believed was a true gaming experience. It started out simple, a settler and a warrior unit, and some lady telling me to found a city. I plop it down and start producing a monument, moving my warrior around and reasearching pottery. I found my neighbor soon after, the Incas, and I was greeted by a stunning display screen with a great voice actor and interface. Soon enough I had made a Declaration of Friendship and one thing led to another and all I remember was me saying just....one....more....turn.I ended up playing the tutorial for ~6 hours straight. Yes. 6 HOURS ON THE TUTORIAL, AND IT WAS GLORIOUS. I ended up panicking and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at the fact that I could not save my progress, but I digress, it was the tutorial after all. Nowadays I find myself using my spare hours to play this meth like game. My grades were rekt, my relationships were rekt, my reading life was rekt, my League career was rekt and my plans to play Bioshock Infinite were REKT.All in all I give this game a 20/10 and reccomend you pick it up now that it will be dirt cheap with the summer sale, only and only IF you would like to have some -Ghandi nuking you, Would you like to make a trade agreement with ENGLAND, cursing that damned jungle king Monty, and OH MY GOD THAT WOUNDER WAS ONE FREAKING TURN AWAY FROM BEING BUILT I JUST WASTED 25 DAYS OF PRODUCTION AND ONLY GOT A MEASLY 100 GOLD SANIADSUFLUDSBASFJDSBFJSFDSLFA- filled afternoons then this is the game for YOU!Life Status: rekt ☐ | not rekt ☐ | Tyrannosaurus rekt ☑			"

One moment you two are peace buddies and the next he is launching nukes at you while creating an alliance with Ghengis Khan to♥♥♥♥♥♥and pillage your cities. Oh and by the way dont♥♥♥♥♥♥off the City States.  And if you do make sure to take all of them over or they will band together as a nation to destroy you. And then Ghandi sits in the corner laughing at you. Because thats what Ghandi does. He lets everyone else kill eachother then nukes the survivors. You hear that noise? Its the sound of screams from the Nuclear blast and Nuclear fallout which Ghandi interprets as forgiveness. Long story short dont let Ghandi get the nuke. "

												Comparing Civilization V to contemporary strategy games is entirely pointless. Imagine if Modern Warfare had come out alongside Quake II. There is simply nothing comparable out there, not least because the strategy genre has become the province of indie developers and niche publishers. Civ V is a towering, AAA release with millions of dollars worth of polish in an era where questionably localized Russian titles are all that strategy gamers have to tide them over for months at a time. It's also a delightfully fresh take on a formula that has been slowly iterated on for more than two decades.The heart of the Civilization fantasy is unchanged. You still manage cities, developing them from rude collections of mud huts into gleaming modern metropolises. Vast armies and armadas are again at your command, waging global war for conquest, defense, or resources with everything from spears to nukes. The land must still be worked, the primordial wilderness tamed through your people’s sweat and blood. Your ultimate goal is yours to choose: Diplomatically unite the people of the world under your benign leadership, launch a viable colony ship into outer space, conquer the globe through force of arms, or create a glorious utopia through enlightened civility.Civ V's genius lies in the way that Firaxis has aggressively chopped the number of decisions that a player has to make during the course of a game while taking away almost none of the meaningful ones. As a hardcore Civ player, I appreciate some of these ancillary aspects of the design, but the removal of all the fat is unquestionably Civ V's greatest accomplishment.			"

												I played Civ 2: Test of Time back in the day. It was fun to explore, the city building was interesting, trying out new units was always enjoable, and then of course, marching an army to an opponent was a blast. Fast forward 10 years to Civ 5. Exploration is always fun. Seeking ruins, meeting city states, fending off barbarians and eventually finding your opponents is great. The reasearch tree in this game makes it incredibly difficult to choose: Do I build up my military tech, increase my gold income, push for some good culture wonders, increase my science, grow my city... etc. and every play can be done differently. I have a favourite tech path due to familiarity, but if needed, I will take any road. The variety in strategy for early game exploration, mid game conquests and late game domination is incredibe. I bought this game on the suggestion of a friend and it was the best money I have spent on a game. Do I recommend Civ 5? YES! GET THE GAME! PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS!Once you get past the initial learning curve, you will find that the exploration, development, strategy, and eventual victory will be incredibly satisfying and very addictive. I cannot wait for Civilization: Beyond Earth			"

												It's not like this game is so obscure that it actually needs a recommendation, but I thought I would add one from the perspective of someone who has never played a Civ game until #5. I grew up on PC games and could have easily played any of the previous versions, but for some reason just felt this wasn't really my type of thing. Well, it took 20 years or so, but I can finally admit I was wrong. It's a really fun and extremely addicting game. That said, there is definitely a bit of a learning curve for newbies. I really had no idea what I was doing at first, but eventually it all gels and you start to see why the series has been so popular. I have no idea how Civ 5 compares to previous games, but from personal experience, I can at least confirm that it's most definitely a good place to start for those new to the series. If you are like me and was never really sure if Civ was for you, I say give this a try. You'll probably be addicted before you know it. Just... one... more... turn... ;)			"

												            I have owned Civ V now for almost two years, and it has always been nothing but awesome. Even more awesome now with the Brave New World DLC, and the addition of Religion, Spies, Congress, Tourism, Trade Routes, etc. This has made the game even MORE interesting. I lose track of hours on this, building my economy, while trying to build my army and not breaking the bank in the process, watching other civilization's machinations with my spies, and increasing border expansion to an all-time high without♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off my neighbors. It is indeed very complex and I am always learning new tips and tricks. Besides Skyrim, this is most definitely my favorite game on Steam. I give it 10/10 cupcakes.			"

												Civilization V, the game where you rerite history!At the time I am posting this I have 576.1 hours on Civ 5, and I've had this game for nearly two years. Less than 100 of those hours are spent on the Vanilla version of this game. If you buy this game only buy the Complete Edition.This is my favorite game of all time. It's pretty easy to learn how to play, but don't worry because each individaul civilization is different. The playstyle for a desert civilization like Arabia is VERY different than the playstyle for maritime civilization such as England. Not to mention that there are 5 different ways to win Civ 5.-TimeVictory is given to the Civ with highest score after the set time period is over.-DominationBashing Skullz and taking names!-CulturalIts complicated. It deals with the culture and tourism your nation outputs.-ScientificBe the first to reach the distant planet Alpha Centuari.-DiplomaticBefriend city states, make strong allies, and become the world ruler through the United Nations.*!*And if any of these victories sound boring or annoying you can turn them off*!*In Civ 5 you will decide how to deal with:~Barbarians~Foreign Nations and Relations~City States~Religion~Religious Wars~Actual war with blood and bullets~GOD DAMN MONGOLS~Exploration~Expantion of territory~Expantion of military influence~Trade~Guilds~Espionage~Military Coups~Nuclear War Heads~Archaeology~World Congress / United Nations~And MUCH MUCH MOREI would recommend this game to not only turn based strategy gamers and fans, but anyone who has the patience to nurture a small group of settlers and warriors in 4000 BC into a thriving World Power of 2075 AD.

												A moment comes which comes rarely in history but we step out from the old to the new when an age ends and a soul of a nation long suppressed, finds utterance. Build courage when courage sees to fail, gain faith when there seems to be little cost for faith, create hope when hope becomes forlorn and remember....the future belongs to those who believe in their dreams....I have to say, this has been the most fantastic, most amazing game i have ever played. Especially when you get the DLCs that can be be bought to go with it. A generally good game with regular Civilization 5 but the excitement and intensity of it increases when you get BNW and G&K DLCs. Definetly consider getting this game if you havent already and be sure to get the DLCs!!!!!!			"

												For all time strategy fans this game is a must buy. The almost flawless take on a turn by turn strategy franchise makes the game not only stand out against it's competitors in the industry but also allows the game to boast it's golden reputation and show off its most impressive new features. While there are a few unbalanced things in the game such as how a millitary victory is much easier to achive than other means, the game still manages to get that tone between being complicated enough for veterans of the series and welcoming to newcomers. the change from squares to hexagons is a bold one, but yet again maxis an their brilliant team have done it again. like i just mentioned, the game has changed to hexagons rather than stayed at squares and the game surely flexes it's muscles, but you probably knew that already, what you really want to know is what have Maxis done to the Civilazation series. Did they break it? After all the series has never seen such a huge overhall before and it's assuming the title from a game thats earned it's golden reputation. Well im not going to make your mind up for you old veterans of the franchise but civilization's 5 blows each competitor out of the water one by one. EVERY animation in the game has been redone, the AI is much smarter (though that still dosent make them smart) and the diplomacy pannel while it may be lacking in many ways compared to games like Crusader kings, it is a massive improvement. For more on civilization 5, and boy is there a lot more, buy the game on steam now. This game really has shown us what companies can do when given unlimated time and money (look at gta 5) and lastly this game it appears will stand the test of time...			"

												Best Test of Time game?Extremely easy pick...since this is a game exactly about that.I'm getting very close to 1000h of playing this (and you better believe almost every minut of it is non-idle time) and I don't even own it since it was released but got it some years later.I've been playing Civilization games since the third installment, liked the previous ones but this one, this one just consumed me whole. Why did it do so? Simple answer - User friendliness. Everybody can play this game and win, but only the biggest brainiacs can truly have it ""around thier pinky finger"". And after tasting that initial ""victory for dummies"", it was so pleasurable and I really felt that I deserved it that I just wanted more and had to pushed myself further.This game made me learn most of it's ""under the hood"" mechanics and that includes reading a lot of related forum posts while I should be working, watching many hours of related YouTube material, not having enough sleep because I was thinking about playing it first time I wake up the other day and of course playing the actual game in all of it's variaty.Tested all the difficulties, acheived all victory types, tried out many maps, built all the wonders, made my friends hate me for a short time after I kick their asses in multi, played almost all scenarios (yes, those exist within the game you people who never even clicked on ""options"" in your life :P) and I just don't see the end of it (nor wish for it).Yes, there were times when I literally had to force myself to play something else so I wouldn't go (entirely) nuts. But the test of times is passed with the highest mark as I always return for Just...One...More...Turn.			"

												Well then, the time has finally come to review what has occupied my life for the past months. Oh Civ 5, how I underestimated you this past summmer when I saw your GOTY edition on steam. How I was hesitant to buy you and thought your gameplay was boring. If only I knew...I bought this game out of pure review score, which of course -being a 90- I assumed was something special. As many of the steam games that are bought during sales do, it sat on my library quite some time while I was busy murdering Teemos on the Fields of Justice. When I finally got tired of that, I decided to check this game out, so I double clicked on the icon, and went into the game with little to no prior knowledge of what lay in store ahead. I booted up the tutorial, grabbed my water and said, ""Well Civ 5, do your worst.""I was greeted by a Morgan Freeman like voice, telling me about America and its past, along with some facts about George Washington. This narrator got me so pumped up; the combination of music, the epic dialouge, the VOICE, mother of god THE VOICE, I had so many goosebumps running over my body that I could hardly contain myself! And then I did it, I pressed Begin Your Journey, little did I know this would take me above and beyond what I believed was a true gaming experience. It started out simple, a settler and a warrior unit, and some lady telling me to found a city. I plop it down and start producing a monument, moving my warrior around and reasearching pottery. I found my neighbor soon after, the Incas, and I was greeted by a stunning display screen with a great voice actor and interface. Soon enough I had made a Declaration of Friendship and one thing led to another and all I remember was me saying just....one....more....turn.I ended up playing the tutorial for ~6 hours straight. Yes. 6 HOURS ON THE TUTORIAL, AND IT WAS GLORIOUS. I ended up panicking and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at the fact that I could not save my progress, but I digress, it was the tutorial after all. Nowadays I find myself using my spare hours to play this meth like game. My grades were rekt, my relationships were rekt, my reading life was rekt, my League career was rekt and my plans to play Bioshock Infinite were REKT.All in all I give this game a 20/10 and reccomend you pick it up now that it will be dirt cheap with the summer sale, only and only IF you would like to have some -Ghandi nuking you, Would you like to make a trade agreement with ENGLAND, cursing that damned jungle king Monty, and OH MY GOD THAT WOUNDER WAS ONE FREAKING TURN AWAY FROM BEING BUILT I JUST WASTED 25 DAYS OF PRODUCTION AND ONLY GOT A MEASLY 100 GOLD SANIADSUFLUDSBASFJDSBFJSFDSLFA- filled afternoons then this is the game for YOU!Life Status: rekt ☐ | not rekt ☐ | Tyrannosaurus rekt ☑			"

												A moment comes which comes rarely in history but we step out from the old to the new when an age ends and a soul of a nation long suppressed, finds utterance. Build courage when courage sees to fail, gain faith when there seems to be little cost for faith, create hope when hope becomes forlorn and remember....the future belongs to those who believe in their dreams....I have to say, this has been the most fantastic, most amazing game i have ever played. Especially when you get the DLCs that can be be bought to go with it. A generally good game with regular Civilization 5 but the excitement and intensity of it increases when you get BNW and G&K DLCs. Definetly consider getting this game if you havent already and be sure to get the DLCs!!!!!!			"

 As a person that played a lot of Civ 4 I can tell you this game is better in every way much like a very polished update.Removed unit stacking a problem.Graphical Improvements.Lots of other minor Bug fixes.Some of the empires have more bonuses for playing them.Improved Ai though still buggy at times. Some Bugs/annoyances Very aggressive empires hard to make friends with other countries.If a empire is not friendly have fun trading with them because they offer Insane bad trades. "

												Civilization 5 is a great game that has amazing replayability value. The game offers hours of entertaining forms of alternate history and critical decison making. It allows the player to immerse themselves within the game world and be straped in for a thrilling ride for hours. With the additon of the DLC's the game gets only better, adding new civs and scerios. Anyone who likes turn based strategy games should take a close look at Civilization 5. No game is perfect but this game is certainly close.			"

												            I have owned Civ V now for almost two years, and it has always been nothing but awesome. Even more awesome now with the Brave New World DLC, and the addition of Religion, Spies, Congress, Tourism, Trade Routes, etc. This has made the game even MORE interesting. I lose track of hours on this, building my economy, while trying to build my army and not breaking the bank in the process, watching other civilization's machinations with my spies, and increasing border expansion to an all-time high without♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off my neighbors. It is indeed very complex and I am always learning new tips and tricks. Besides Skyrim, this is most definitely my favorite game on Steam. I give it 10/10 cupcakes.			"

												Civilization V, the game where you rerite history!At the time I am posting this I have 576.1 hours on Civ 5, and I've had this game for nearly two years. Less than 100 of those hours are spent on the Vanilla version of this game. If you buy this game only buy the Complete Edition.This is my favorite game of all time. It's pretty easy to learn how to play, but don't worry because each individaul civilization is different. The playstyle for a desert civilization like Arabia is VERY different than the playstyle for maritime civilization such as England. Not to mention that there are 5 different ways to win Civ 5.-TimeVictory is given to the Civ with highest score after the set time period is over.-DominationBashing Skullz and taking names!-CulturalIts complicated. It deals with the culture and tourism your nation outputs.-ScientificBe the first to reach the distant planet Alpha Centuari.-DiplomaticBefriend city states, make strong allies, and become the world ruler through the United Nations.*!*And if any of these victories sound boring or annoying you can turn them off*!*In Civ 5 you will decide how to deal with:~Barbarians~Foreign Nations and Relations~City States~Religion~Religious Wars~Actual war with blood and bullets~GOD DAMN MONGOLS~Exploration~Expantion of territory~Expantion of military influence~Trade~Guilds~Espionage~Military Coups~Nuclear War Heads~Archaeology~World Congress / United Nations~And MUCH MUCH MOREI would recommend this game to not only turn based strategy gamers and fans, but anyone who has the patience to nurture a small group of settlers and warriors in 4000 BC into a thriving World Power of 2075 AD.

												Civilization V is a strategy game by Firaxis Studios that supports both multiplayer and singleplayer. Unlike other strategy games I know, (*Cough cough* Starcraft II *cough cough*) this game does not have as huge of a learning curve to it. I was introduced to it at a fairly young age as both my brother and father were avid fans of the series. You start off usually by doing a single player game. Before you dive into the actual gameplay you must set up your game. First you are given a choice of factions, of which there are many. My favorite for the classic Civ is Egypt, while in Gods and Kings it is the Huns, and in Brave New World it is Brazil. After you select your faction, you select your land type (islands, continents, fractal etc.) and game length. Getting started can be tough, but the helpful ""Advisors"" will show you the way. There are many ways to win, so finding your play style will not be a problem either. As you player you contruct buildings to help with different conditions, and units to help defend against or conquer your enemies. Just like the real world, world wonders of all different varieties can be constructed for your empire as well, however only one of each may exist. There are many as well, ranging anywhere from the Great Wall of China to the Big Ben. The different victory types are diplomatic, cultural, domination, science, and time. I personally have only won twice with both victories being cultural as Egypt and Rome. In addition, there is endless replayability. With the many different world types and Civilizations to choose from, gameplay is endless. You will be investing hundreds if not thousands of hours on this game, I assure you. Multiplayer is something to brag about as well, I have never had a better time anywhere than playing with friends on Civilization V. There are two expansions to this game, Gods and Kings and Brave New World. Each of these expansions are worth every penny. In the end, this game is spectacular and one of my all time favorites. If you can afford it, pick it up immediatly or if you don't have the cash, wait for a sale and then do yourself the favor. This game and all of it's expansions combined earns a 95/100 from me. Fantastic, amazing, superb. Get it.			"

												Let me Start by saying that I tried this after my brother wanted me to get it a looonngg time ago. I couldn't understand the Politics and how to Micro-Manage everything. Put it down for a while. I had about 10hours of Trying.. Went to my brothers house after 150$ worth of DLC went on sale for 12$.... Bought it thinking ""For when I get around to learning this, I want to have map packs, politics, etc"" Asked him to come to my House and Start a game like he would at his own house, and kind of walk me through it (I am 27, but could not grasp how to have an eficient start (Sort of like chess)I noted his approach of how to put your Civ together and Take over parts of countries at a steady pace all while proctecting your own people. Have logged over 50hours in a Week or Two after not playing for almost 6 months. What a change of Events. Have moved up to King Diff because on Prince no one attacks you, you have to attack them, AND with a moderate amount of troops, you can just Run Over other Civs. Please. If you like chess, work for a living and have an hour or two to play at a time, Grab this game! The Cautious One  "

												This game allows you to unleash the inner sadistic dictator that we all are underneath, burning cities and ravaging the countryside.   Engaging in a pre-emptive strike against Gandhi, I was able to keep him in the renaissance era while everyone else moved on into the modern era, preventing him from nuking me or anyone else in the future. In the meantime, I took part in the very practice I claimed to condemn and sent two consecutive atomic bombs to Amsterdam.   This game allowed me to engage in a foreign policy similar to the U.S.A.'s without the real life worldwide scorn and condemnation. 11/10   The only thing I would add to the game is the ability to stage false flag terror attacks, to further the realism.

												The base game is good with loads of ways to win and a game is never the same as the last, with some game taking 8 hours to even 50 hours or longer to 'win'. The game with all the dlc is great adding a few changes, but these changes just improve on some of the good aspects of the base game. There are lots of mods available here on the Steam Workshop as well as the  Civ 5 forum [forums.civfanatics.com] where there are countless amounts of mods to play with. Some of these mods are small but useful mods that give more information about your game while in game; other mods change visual aspects of the game. There are a set of mods called Community Balance Patch (CBP) that just revamp the whole game that you almost don't recognize it, making you almost have to relearn a whole new game. I barely have 280 hours and I know people in the thousands of hours. Buying this game  not  on sale is somewhat expensive. I would recommend to wait for the Steam Summer Sale where you can buy it 75% off for a price of $12.49. I'd r8 8/8 m8.			"

												Civilization V is a strategy game by Firaxis Studios that supports both multiplayer and singleplayer. Unlike other strategy games I know, (*Cough cough* Starcraft II *cough cough*) this game does not have as huge of a learning curve to it. I was introduced to it at a fairly young age as both my brother and father were avid fans of the series. You start off usually by doing a single player game. Before you dive into the actual gameplay you must set up your game. First you are given a choice of factions, of which there are many. My favorite for the classic Civ is Egypt, while in Gods and Kings it is the Huns, and in Brave New World it is Brazil. After you select your faction, you select your land type (islands, continents, fractal etc.) and game length. Getting started can be tough, but the helpful ""Advisors"" will show you the way. There are many ways to win, so finding your play style will not be a problem either. As you player you contruct buildings to help with different conditions, and units to help defend against or conquer your enemies. Just like the real world, world wonders of all different varieties can be constructed for your empire as well, however only one of each may exist. There are many as well, ranging anywhere from the Great Wall of China to the Big Ben. The different victory types are diplomatic, cultural, domination, science, and time. I personally have only won twice with both victories being cultural as Egypt and Rome. In addition, there is endless replayability. With the many different world types and Civilizations to choose from, gameplay is endless. You will be investing hundreds if not thousands of hours on this game, I assure you. Multiplayer is something to brag about as well, I have never had a better time anywhere than playing with friends on Civilization V. There are two expansions to this game, Gods and Kings and Brave New World. Each of these expansions are worth every penny. In the end, this game is spectacular and one of my all time favorites. If you can afford it, pick it up immediatly or if you don't have the cash, wait for a sale and then do yourself the favor. This game and all of it's expansions combined earns a 95/100 from me. Fantastic, amazing, superb. Get it.			"

												This game... IF YOU HAVE NO LIFE (Just like me) You will enjoy this game. This game is ridicious. I've never had more fun, besides with Terraria. This game will entertain anyone as long as you have a bunch of money to spend into the DLC (seriously the DLC by itself it like 25 bucks for the main ones each). Other than that this game is really good. 5 out of 5 for gameplay. 5 out of 5 for PC controls. And remember kids! NEVER TRUST GANDHI!			"

												Oh Civilization V, what a masterpiece you are.Most of you who are interested in this game probably don't know the series. But Sid Meier's Civilization dates back to the 1991 and has span a long time. The second most recent was Civilization IV,  a game most fans are calling a masterpiece. With it's advanced gameplay, not fully broken diplomacy and a good mod community it was destined for greatness.Then this came a long.Civilization V is an amazing game. You'll be leading a Civilization through all of human history (And even the future) looking at how your civilization progresses. Will you wage war, and be a war mongler the world fears? Will you lead in science, and be the first to launch to a diferent world? Will you have all of the world succumb to your civilization's greatness? All of this is up to you.You have full freedom of what you want to do within the game. And it benefits from it. Since you can do whatever you want, you end up with fun scenarios, intensity, and essentialy some very satisfying gameplay.The visuals and the overall presentation is good as well. You get a very good cultural appropiate soundtrack while you're playing as a specific civilization, which is very neat. The best is especially the in-game rendered diplomacy screens. Where you will stand face to face with the leader you're discussing with. It is amazing the first time, and it's still awesome the 561th time.The only thing I'm dissapointed with is the AI. in the game. They tend to either be passive, or be down-right agressive. However there are mods fixing this, and you can always play multiplayer against/with other people. Which is a lot of fun in it self.The base-game is already a worth-while purchase, but can you afford it I'd suggest getting Gods and Kings as well as Brave New World. Both expansions add a lot to the vanilla game, and I personally can't go back to the normal experience.All in all, this is a must buy for any strategy gamer, whatever if one's casual or hardcore. You'll be spending a lot of fun re-(or just creating) historic events.Get this game as soon as you can, no doubt about it.			"

												An all around fantastic 4X RTS game, Civilization V, once it has the two major expansions (Gods & Kings and Brave New World) is an amazingly engulfing game.  So much of it is designed to pull you in and keep you wishing to advance your empire one more turn.  Winning the game can be completed multiple ways with large or small empires, and on higher difficulties victory can be a mad dash to the finish.  Combat is fun, and offers enjoyment in outwitting your opponent, or holding off large waves of enemies at a choke point.  The units are are crafted in high detail, and each civilization plays a slightly different way, letting you try a vast array of different strategies.The game is not without its faults, however.  The biggest of these issues is the AI, which can be confusing or downright moronic.  Additionally, while the shift to tactical-styled combat is a nice change of pace in the series, the AI doesn't seem to grasp how to make the most of its units and can make obvious tactical blunders with startling regularity.  The game's netcode and stability are also questionable at times once larger maps come into play, but when it is working play is smooth and almost seamless from one turn to the next.  All in all, an excellent game in a series full of well-made games.			"

												A very complex game that has a slight curving point for noobs. Though it takes a while to master it, it is still by all means my favorite game.The things I like about it: It has very fun scenarios such as the American Civil War, Scramble for Africa, and the Fall of Rome to name a few. There are a lot of countries to choose and master. It takes true strategy you can't just build a city and say you'll win (You probably won't with that overconfidence).A very good wide variety of maps too choose from. The multiplayer is amazing except for the fact that if you go to war with another human player you have to play in sequential order. The graphics are quite astonishing aswell.The things I dislike about it: There are no multiplayer Scenarios. :(Overall I give this game a 9.5/10Please leave any critizism in the comments. Thanks! :D			"

												Sid Meier delivered yet again with the latest, and debatably greatest, installment of the Civilization franchise: Civilization V.I'm not going to pretend I have played hundreds of hours on this game as you know I haven't becuse it says above(EDIT: yeahhhhhh, this game is addictive). But from what I have played of this game makes it one of my absolute favourites in my library.I personally am not usually the fan of strategy games because I haven't got the brain capacity to work out simple war strategies, but this game had me hooked from the begining. So much so, even, that I managed to convince my dad to buy it which he is now playing by my side religiously.I know I have tried and failed to sound intelligent so I will just say it how it is. BUY THIS GAME!!! The only fault i could possibly pick with this game is a few bugs that will inevitabley be fixed and the occasional crash. I would highly recommend that you save the game every 5 turns to avoid loss because of crashes. But what the hell do I know, maybe its my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop's fault.All in all the game is very fun, highly addictive, seriously time consuming and life destroying but however needs some polishing 9/10			"

History RewrittenI've never played any of Sid Meier's previous games and I'm a huge fan of Catan (a board/online game it reminded me of) so this automatically won me over. Civilization V is more complex than Catan in that it has more features to offer and it's more organized, requires more strategy so it's less random, and more relaxing depending on who you're playing with and/or what difficulty. You play a real historical leader, each equipped with their own perks to suit your desired win condition, and you choose how you want to interact with other leaders and their civilizations. You can build whatever you want, from armies to cities, as the technology and resources become available. It's addicting and so much fun alone or with friends. The game isn't the same without the DLC which I strongly recommend picking up.10/10 - JUNEBUG'S FAVORITES			"

												With the latest expansion, Brave New World, this is probably the best turn-based strategy game out there. Civ 5 has now reached the pinicle of the evolution of the Civ francise. I say this as a player who first played Civ over 20 years ago on my 386 and has played all the Civ games apart from Civ 2.Whereas most 90/early 2000s PC games that have been rebooted or updated in the last 5 years have been dumbed down as if developers think we are all xbawks kiddies with ADHD (I'm looking at you SimCity, Hitman, Wolfenstein, Thief, etc), the Civ series has actually been improved with time and has become a deeper game.

												Civilization V is an amazing turn based strategy game in which the goal is to rule the world through battle, culture, science, or diplomacy. The new hexagonal grid tiles allow for much more interesting gameplay than the previous games in the series. The game allows the player to choose from a variety real civilizations, each with their own unique perk, unit, and building.While this game features multiplayer capabilities, the games take a very long time to complete, and take more than most people are willing to invest in a single session. If you do have a lot of free time, it can be very satisfying to dominate the world with or against friends. I'd very highly recommend this game, particularily in conjunction with its downloadable content and expansions.			"

												Civ V strikes a nice balance between the raw mechanics of the earliest Civ's (1&2) with improved polished gameplay of more recent installations. It does not suffer from overengineering in the same way that Civ 4 did, bless it's heart, however it is still full of intense micromanagment, which, if you're into it, is great. However it does potentially suffer from slow paced gameplay, which isn't an issue for single player, but can stymie attempts at satisfying online play - nothing is more dissappointing than a heated game against a human player being inturrepted by an apologetic blip on your Steam interface with the message ""sorry, gotta dip, wife's giving birth!"" Which is all the more frustrating because his wife was only eight weeks along when you started playing, and still had two weeks to go when you guys hit the Industrial Era.But srsly, Civ V is polished, offers plenty of opportunities to win and undermine your opponents, and has better replayability than just about any contemporary game in existence - multiple vanilla victory conditions, and multiple paths to fulfill them, along with copious and creative mod options means losing is a matter of multiple missed opportunities, rather than the result of a single split second blunder, like spilling your Red Bull all over your desk, and getting domeshotted faster than a sophmore loses it in a burlesque house (like every workaday, unispired clone of last quarter's FPS rhyming with fall love fruity). Also, given all the mechanics to experiment with one should never be bored with Civ V in their inventory. You will never beat it on hardest difficulty. It's an in joke by the coders. That's what I tell myself every night to fall asleep.Final score: 39 out 42 Chichen Itzas (pronounced ""Chicken Pizzas"")Pro advice: Play Industrial Era start, Huge map, against 22 Ghandis for a special treat, epescially if you're an 19th century journalist who enjoys getting slapped around by Barronesses exclusively wearing furs.

History RewrittenI've never played any of Sid Meier's previous games and I'm a huge fan of Catan (a board/online game it reminded me of) so this automatically won me over. Civilization V is more complex than Catan in that it has more features to offer and it's more organized, requires more strategy so it's less random, and more relaxing depending on who you're playing with and/or what difficulty. You play a real historical leader, each equipped with their own perks to suit your desired win condition, and you choose how you want to interact with other leaders and their civilizations. You can build whatever you want, from armies to cities, as the technology and resources become available. It's addicting and so much fun alone or with friends. The game isn't the same without the DLC which I strongly recommend picking up.10/10 - JUNEBUG'S FAVORITES			"

												I get to play as Russia settling in South Africa while attempting to build the Pyramids.10/10No but really, this game is pretty addicting. As there is little to no actual historical accuracy it does a great job of familiarizing you with ancient wonders, different civilizations, and ideologies. The game is great and has a lot of different things to try. Maybe one day you want to play with only Native American factions while playing on a Great Plains map; maybe another day you want to play with only the European powers on an archipelago map. Or maybe you just want to play as a faction and see how fast you can get Modern infantry and straight dominate a hunter/gatherer faction. This game has it all. With added mod support via Steam Workshop, there is always something or someone new to try out.			"

												Civilization V is an amazing turn based strategy game in which the goal is to rule the world through battle, culture, science, or diplomacy. The new hexagonal grid tiles allow for much more interesting gameplay than the previous games in the series. The game allows the player to choose from a variety real civilizations, each with their own unique perk, unit, and building.While this game features multiplayer capabilities, the games take a very long time to complete, and take more than most people are willing to invest in a single session. If you do have a lot of free time, it can be very satisfying to dominate the world with or against friends. I'd very highly recommend this game, particularily in conjunction with its downloadable content and expansions.			"

												One of the best turn-based strategy games I have ever played. Starting from the pre-historic era and having to explore for a good place to settle your first city, you then have to scavenge and trade with other leaders to increase revenue and protect city states from barbarians to gain access to their goods. You can play the game any way you want. If you want to be a tyranical leader who's goal is to kill everyone and take their land as his, or you could win the game through strategic trading and tourism. The tech line is intuative with many ways to get where you want to go in the game. This in depth game with a diverse number of leaders and a great atmosphere always has you watching your back, making allies, signing treaties from previous altercations you had with that nation, and being the most dominent power by the end of the game in order to win. Yes, this game takes a while for a single game to finish, but with every second being like the first one you've had since trying the game the first time it will always keep you smiling and excited for what comes next. Don't even get me started on the multiplayer. XD I can't wait to play this game again! 10/10			"

												With the latest expansion, Brave New World, this is probably the best turn-based strategy game out there. Civ 5 has now reached the pinicle of the evolution of the Civ francise. I say this as a player who first played Civ over 20 years ago on my 386 and has played all the Civ games apart from Civ 2.Whereas most 90/early 2000s PC games that have been rebooted or updated in the last 5 years have been dumbed down as if developers think we are all xbawks kiddies with ADHD (I'm looking at you SimCity, Hitman, Wolfenstein, Thief, etc), the Civ series has actually been improved with time and has become a deeper game.

												Civ V strikes a nice balance between the raw mechanics of the earliest Civ's (1&2) with improved polished gameplay of more recent installations. It does not suffer from overengineering in the same way that Civ 4 did, bless it's heart, however it is still full of intense micromanagment, which, if you're into it, is great. However it does potentially suffer from slow paced gameplay, which isn't an issue for single player, but can stymie attempts at satisfying online play - nothing is more dissappointing than a heated game against a human player being inturrepted by an apologetic blip on your Steam interface with the message ""sorry, gotta dip, wife's giving birth!"" Which is all the more frustrating because his wife was only eight weeks along when you started playing, and still had two weeks to go when you guys hit the Industrial Era.But srsly, Civ V is polished, offers plenty of opportunities to win and undermine your opponents, and has better replayability than just about any contemporary game in existence - multiple vanilla victory conditions, and multiple paths to fulfill them, along with copious and creative mod options means losing is a matter of multiple missed opportunities, rather than the result of a single split second blunder, like spilling your Red Bull all over your desk, and getting domeshotted faster than a sophmore loses it in a burlesque house (like every workaday, unispired clone of last quarter's FPS rhyming with fall love fruity). Also, given all the mechanics to experiment with one should never be bored with Civ V in their inventory. You will never beat it on hardest difficulty. It's an in joke by the coders. That's what I tell myself every night to fall asleep.Final score: 39 out 42 Chichen Itzas (pronounced ""Chicken Pizzas"")Pro advice: Play Industrial Era start, Huge map, against 22 Ghandis for a special treat, epescially if you're an 19th century journalist who enjoys getting slapped around by Barronesses exclusively wearing furs.

I wasn't surprised how much it evolved - it has been 20 years since the first Civ after all. But was amazed by how much of the good stuff I remembered stayed basicaly the same. I haven't played it enough to be sure yet, but this game might be the best strategy game ever. The only flaw is that it will eat up all your time.			"

												Sid Meier's Civilization V is a turn-based strategy game, falling into the 4x genre of video games. It is the Fifth game of the series and was released in 2010. You play as the leader of a civilization, such as; Ramses, Washington, Khan, and must develop your civilization to grow and settle new area's, including through diplomatic, economic, or military means. There are several conditions for victory you can play toward, and each turn represents several years in your civilizations time. Civilization V also has a new feature known as City-States, individual settlements, who are independent of the computer controlled civilizations, and operate as their own entities, making alliances, declaring war etc. Having had limited experience with the series, only playing Civ 3 for less than an hour several years ago, I came into Civ V with little expectations. I found it to be relatively easy to learn, the tutorial process and advisor tips help shorten the learning curve, and is actually fun. I found the AI to be interesting, as each player civilization and city-state has it's own personality. I haven't tried any of the Downloadable content, such as; Gods and Kings, or Brave New World; However, I can assume they only add to the fun you will have with Civilization V. Normally, I don't care for turn-based games and prefer real-time strategy, but Civilization V was a pleasant surprise. It was easy to learn, graphically, it looks a lot like the Total War games. If you like turn-based strategy games in the 4x genre, give this one a try.			"

												I will now go on to tell you about what spending time with Sid Meier and playing Civilization V has cost me;1. My Family: They had gone on holiday multiple times without me ever noticing because of Civilization V.2. My Girlfriend: I truly loved her more than anything. We were the best couple. But she quite never understood why I always spent time with Sid instead of her. She then asked me to choose between her and Sid. As you can imagine, without hesitation, I chose Sid. 3. My High School Diploma: There usually isn't much time to study when you're playing Civilization V 25 hours a day.4. My University Diploma: Refer to point number 3.5. My Future & Humanity: Sums it up.However I also gained some things;1. A best Friend: His name is Sid Meier and he is the best!2. Knowledge: I am considered the foremost expert in World History.3. Wisdom: I now know that I should never trust Indian people and the natives of the Shaka tribe. NEVER EVER!4. My Virginity: Speaks for itself, does it not?10/10 would nuke the s**t out of Catholic Indians in South America playing as the Muslim Japanese in Europe.			"

												They say that history is what shapes us to be men. To be men of the future. To overcome the problems we've encountered before so we don't repeat them again... It's true for the most part. But, sometimes we, as men, do things that we believe is best for our sake, since we, as humans, are inevitably selfish. And there is no overcoming our greediness. Our lust for power, for things that we want the most. You may not agree, but I will tell you a story to prove this. It is a pretty dramatic story, mind. Starting out with nothing but a vision and willpower, Gandhi scrambled as many people as he could to lead, to turn them into soldiers that live to protect their home. They travelled across the uncharted lands to settle down in. He was respected among his men. He was a wise man. He was patient, and caring. Never was there a ruler who was so ... peaceful. Who had his wits about him when making his decisions as a great ruler. He was a man who never wanted war.Then he stumbled upon Genghis Khan... a tyrant... a visionary... a man without fear...  looking his way to conquer every civilization there is. But, Gandhi did not flinch. He wasn't scared of this Mongolian peasant! Ohhh, no. Gandhi does what he does best ... play it cool. He respectfully told him to stay away from his lands. The little Mongolian didn't like that. Not one bit. Eventually, they grew to hate each other. But, Gandhi knew Khan was more powerful than him. So, he built Delhi, and Mumbai, and with the resources he built with his people, ventured out to find more civilizations, and grew close with Ormus, Sofia, and Valetta. The former two had only a formal connection, but Valetta was the ally that proved fruitful. Eventually, Gandhi meets a mysterious, but a beautiful woman, who turns out to be a Chinese Sovereign - a Huangdi by the name of Lady Wu Zetian of China. Gandhi was smitten by this woman's graciousness, and was immediately prepared to conquer for her. He wanted to woo her. He wanted to impress her. To prove to her that he is the greatest of them all. Of course, this was no easy feat. As Gandhi built his empire, Khan's plans were unknown. But, as time passed, paranoia got the better of Gandhi, as the very thought of Genghis Khan taking the hand of his beloved Lady Wu angered him. It filled him with bloodlust. It turned a good man ... cruel. He abandoned all thoughts of taking care of his own cities. And focused more on building his military power. While the relations between his civilization, Ormus, and Sofia were deteriorating, Valetta stood beside them, and gave them the units they needed to defeat Genghis Khan... and it was time. Khan set up Beshbalik, near the outskirts of Delhi, to make Gandhi feel powerless. Gandhi saw this, and finally, the unthinkable happened. He snapped... and sent his units to Beshbalik. Thus ... the first war of the world began. It was long. It was bloody. It was brutal. To think that a man of peace who settles with wearing dhotis would go crazy for power would render anyone speechless. Khan offered peace many times. But, Gandhi wasn't having any. He didn't want peace. He wanted a war. So many lives... the soldiers, the horses, the workers ... all perished as the war went on. Both sides lost a lot. But, Khan's forces proved stronger, as he was allied with Kathmandu, his best performing ally, who abandons him eventually, and Prague, their most passive. So, Gandhi took a step back, and gathered his wits to take the time to make a stronger army.At long last ... after losing any relations he had with previous civilizations, after losing even Valetta, after throwing away every single shred of dignity he had for humanity ... He conquered Beshbalik in 100 AD. And then, Khan offered peace yet again. But, this time, Gandhi accepted. And so, the war was over. Annexing Beshbalik instead of razing it, in hopes of bringing up a civilization there, Gandhi celebrated his victory by laughing maniacally. But, soon, it dawned on him. His love. His beloved Huangdi. And so, he set off to Guangzhou. And there she was. As beautiful as she was the first time he met her. He offered the city to her. With all of his heart. Asking nothing in return. A city ... a whole city ... for this majestic beauty. And he smiles gleefully, as she accepts. He returns to Beshbalik to gather his troops to return to Delhi. All the way imagining her by his side, as his beloved queen, conquering every civilization there would be. Oh, the sweet feeling of victory. Finally, he was going to get everything he had ever dreamed of.He arrives. He finally arrives at the city. But... but what's this? Oh, no. To his horror... he sees the camps ablaze. Men, women, children ... the whole city on fire. Razed to the ground. By his own love. A city he fought for, for his own love. For years. All that time spent on fighting for a city, losing the many men that fought for the very city he wanted to gift to his beloved, only to have it burned to the ground by her. Why? Why would she do that? How could she be capable of such atrocity!? He loved her! He fought for her! Well, too bad the game doesn't have RPG elements, otherwise, we could've known why.10/10 Would fight Genghis Khan for control over Beshbalik for over 2 hours just to gift it to Lady Wu Zetian of China only to have it burned to the ground. I spent 6 straight hours playing the game very seriously ... only to find out later that it was the tutorial. Heh.On a serious note, the game does have a major problem with the cinematics, so if there's a chance you're facing start-up problems, for example a black, unresponsive screen, you'll have to modify/delete the cinematic files of the base game, and the cinematics of the DLC's - Brave New World and Gods & Kings. This is the only downside I had with the game. DO BUY IT!			"

I said take the kids but you leave me my monkey, unfortunately my wife took my monkey which i was gonna feed bananas to, i've got a surplus of bananas so i've got that going for me which is nice. But gethis 3 years later it turned out that my wife was having an affair with my monkey so i was heart broken and ofcourse the bananas had gone rotten, all in all this is a great game, but you should note that i loved my monkey he was like my best friend and now he's with my ex-wife, so i found a new friend he's called oscar the chicken, he wasn't as friendly as my monkey but he did taste good.

												I could never get into this game like I got into Civ 4 and its mods.- It doesn't have the gloriously inspiring Baba Yetu music on its title screen ;)- Global happiness means I don't care about my individual cities, thankfully Firaxis recognized this and are bringing back city happiness with Civ 6.- Mods are nowhere near as awesome as Fall from Heaven 2 for Civ 4. Modding support was much delayed, as well.- While in theory I like the introduction of the hex grid for more wargame-like tactics, one unit per tile means a lot of tedious shuffling when you must move all your army to a new front. Some kind of stacking for travel or strategic move (see: Hearts of Iron series) would've been necessary.Doesn't mean it's not a good game, just a disappointing compared to previous installments. I'm still gonna play it from time to time hoping that with the expansions it suddenly ""clicks"" with me.			"

												Much better than ""CATS"". Also, much better than being assaisnated by my own colleagues at the CIA for 'talking too much'. God, believe me, I've been through that. Also, MUCH better than hearing Pearl Jam cover that crappy song from Frozen. My god....talk about Jumping the Shark. All of that being said, I play this game over and over again and I'm not sure I'm even any good at it. I win and I lose.  But I have a good time doing it. If my g'friend is off on a Sunday and I play from 8am to 3pm, there's usually some blowback, but maybe that speaks to the addictive qualities of this thing. I'm above average in my abilities to disuage my lover from resenting me for spending that one extra hour destroying Catherine the Great's legacy  across 4 cities because she won't just share some f'in cotton with me for a 'I love the King Day'. Because, if she knew Catherine the Great and how snide she can be, she's be sitting there with me, asking if there's anyway to loosen that corsett and humiliate her in court...but, alas. No such options exist in this game. That's not why I play it, though. I play it for the glory.			"

You can play for 300+ hours and still get thrilled by beating the pants off the AI. You still look at your clock every half hour and keep extending your play deadline just a FEW turns longer, until it's like 3am and you have to work in a few hours. Oh and if you somehow get bored with the dozens of civs, scenarios, map and victory types, etc, you can go and MOD the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it. 10/10			"

												This game asks one simple question: Can you build a nation that will stand the test of time?Its not an easy question to work out ""yes"" to if you're looking for a challenge. The AI might be random at times or it might be entirely logical, But from playing it I've learned you should always keep on your toes. Outside of easy, the computer players can outmatch you but not just militarily - unless you hit the ground running you can be quickly overshadowed.This incarnation of the Civilization franchise makes a lot of changes, namely the switch from a grid to hexagons and the removal of the ability to stack units. Some people loathe this but after playing it i've found the whole thing less of a meatgrinder; no throwing your army at a stack of 23 armies on one square, no 31+ stack of armies lying in wait when you attack an enemy city. In fact the system makes it more viable and likely to surround a city (which is what happened in most wars by the way) rather than charge headlong at it with a bulk army. Every detail of the world is beautifully rendered, sometimes I found myself panning the camera over my and my enemies' civs imagining what life is like in the piece of Earth they have carved out.Gods and Kings and Brave New World - its epansions - at a ton of variety to the game. The culture victory option for example, involves tourism and cultural influence, which is how places like America, Japan and the UK ingrain their cultural mannerisms elsewhere in the real world.The game is not just beautiful on a strategic level; I'm a fan of history and culture and this game is bursting at the seams with it, especially with Brave New World; every technology has an associated quote be it a passage of a holy book, a line from a Greek, Roman or Shakesperian play or a phrase coined by a legendary person. Every world wonder you complete shows you an oil-on-canvas painting of it complete with a quote that relates to its purpose or its reputation, in the second expansion your great people can world-renowned paintings and compositions which you, the player, can enjoy for yourself. It makes you want to build wonders even more if this is your kind of thing.Whether you're an empire builder at heart, passionate for history, love high culture or just enjoy watching burning everything to the ground. This is a worthy addition to the franchise so get this, get the expansions too (even if you're nonreligions, Gods and Kings adds a lot of other stuff to the game), this game would be ideal for you.Just don't expect to be done in a three-hour session; Civ is not a game for the twitch player. Its famous for that.			"

												Have you ever once looked into yourself in a self-reflective manner, contemplating existence as you stared into a mirror, and wondered?:""What would it like to have George Washington and Genghis Khan duke it out against eachother in a battle for world-domination?""With Civilization, you can accomplish this.CiV is not a game that requires many reflexes; in fact, it requires no reflexes at all; it trades this in for being vexingly complex, filled head-to-toe with different stats and numbers and other things which will have your mind moving faster than it would in your average game, but your mouse much slower. Whether this is a ""good"" or ""bad"" characteristic depends on your tastes; if you like action-packed FPSes filled with massive explosions and a fervor of button-tapping, CiV will disappoint you. If you like calming, casual puzzle games where you mix and match coloured gems or other such objects; CiV will disappoint you. However, if you like spending hours slowly building up your empire, moving military units to resources and strategic positions, and discussing diplomatic policies with AIs or your friends with a similar lack of a social life; CiV will *not* dissapoint you; in fact, quite the opposite.CiV is interesting as it has a variety of different playstyles; perhaps you want to create world peace as Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden? Or send a spaceship to Alpha Centauri as Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon? Or raze across the land like a fire, destroying and conquering all in your way as Attila of the Huns? CiV endorses multiple different playstyles which make the game interesting; and different civs have different abilties which make others better at some playstyles; most of which are *fairly* balanced, although some civs can't help but be somewhat mediocre (e.g., America, The Ottoman Empire [before BNW], The Iroquois Confederacy), at least in comparison to others.If a single-player game seems to drag on for too long, CiV has a solution; multi-player. You can team up with your friends for a co-op, split up into tag-teams and viciously try to take eachother down, or even play an ""every man for himself"" strategy. The one problem is that, unfortunately, multi-player does seem to have quite a few glitches; although these aren't game-breaking, they can be quite the nuisance at times. I'm somewhat hopeful that Firaxis will make an attempt to deal with some of these.To end this short, spur-of-the-moment review; CiV is a game I highly suggest; unless you want to have a social-life, as buying it -and, hence, becoming addicted to it- will often severely damage your ""life"" to the point of being unsalvageable.

												Simply brilliant.A piece of software that allows you to live and reenact (even change!) most of the important historical events that humankind has ever lived. You can quench you thirst for power and domination with this game, as well as your blood lust. Develop a CIVILIZATION from the very beginning where rocks were weapons, to the all modern Nuclear Fusion Death Machines. Take your time, and lose your life with this game. I've been playing since the beginning of the franchise, and I can say that this is the best game so far. (Especially for the crap that Civilization IV was.) If you can afford all the expansions as well, don't waste time. BUY THEM ALL.Brave New World brings the concept of diplomacy and World Congress to a new level, I strongly recommend playing this if you have some passion for history, politics, warfare and economics. #OneMoreTurn			"

												By far one of the greatest strategy games of all time, the addictive nature of Civ is in its unique ability to completely invest you into the civilization you create and grow. Through violent conquest or peaceful cunning, the game's near infinite number of ways to be played adds a replayability unrivaled by any game before it save some modern FPS's. As one of my top 5 games of all time, I cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												I always I'll be able to arrange myself not to go overboard with this game. I had planned scheduled, nothing to fancy, maximum two hours a day. But then that button keep staring at me, like saying, ""end your turn now!"". I tried and I tried to end my turn, but it never stop. I need to develop so my country won't be left behind, i need to conquer, I need to be there for my people. So every turn became an obsession, I feel compelled to stay. I WANT TO KNOW MORE! I WANT TO FEEL MORE!So yeah, it take longer than two hours. This is the greatest strategy game on planet earth, easy to play, hard to master.			"

												Sid Meier's Civilization is one of, if not the best tbs on the market. Civ V added to the collection of the others and is not a downgrade in anyway. I will state that the multiplayer could use a much needed revamp but the single player works completely fine. The A.I. as for most Civ games will attempt to do outragous deals or not abide by what you say, but the flow of the game great. The expansions are also worth almost every penny, and a new one is on the way.			"

												It's an exhausting game to play, but once you have the BNW expansion, it's also one of the best strategy games you'll get your hands on.**Edit:** I have now played the game long enough to know what all my quirks with the game is. I still believe it's a really good game. For a future Civ game, i'd LOVE to see a pitboss mode that allows you to use a shared steamcloud save, and gave steam notifications when it is your turn, rather than having a dedicated server running hosting the game 24/7 while it is played (which could be months potentially).A pitboss mode like this would be even more attractive if a future civ game was focused more around optimization and lightweight-ness than pretty polygons. The perfect civ would be an epic game spanding several months, where it'd take you 20 seconds to sign in, take a turn, and leave the game again.			"

It would seem like there is always something new to discover, something new to learn, which is, in any game, awesome and something that makes games timeless and entertaining for a long time. but you wouldn't need me to tell you that, I'm hardly a strategy game pro.Besides being an awesome strategy game though, this game also chose to have this message of showing you how awesome humanity is with quotes and cinematics... just great stuff, really makes ya feel optimistic :D  But all I can say is: Great Game.

For all of its more controversial elements and related failings, the hours I’ve spent playing Civilization V make it quite obvious; this is still one of the most varied and consistently satisfying games that I’ve played to date.With dozens of different civilizations to choose from (America, Mongolia, China etc.), each with their own unique abilities and bonuses, no two games are likely to play out quite the same way and as such, Civilization V is a tough game for strategy fans to get bored of.As Arabia you might seek to establish a lucrative trade network and ‘buy’ yourself friends using your mountains of dosh, as England you might construct a powerful maritime nation and go on the offensive with enhanced frigates and longbows, and as France you may instead choose to wow the world with your awe-inspiring culture and devotion to the arts; ensnaring people to your ideology with that time honoured brand of “polite terrorism” that is tourism.The two official expansions to the game only seek to refine it further with the official releases Gods and Kings and Brave New World both adding a raft of additional features including new civilizations and wonders, religion, espionage, trade routes and an expanded culture game including great works and archaeology.In every new game I find myself drawn not to the most powerful strategies, but instead to the ones that intrigue me the most. It’s a testament to the game’s diverse palette of “boardgamey” elements that make every setup so unique and rife with potential.Ultimately, my favourite aspect of Civilization V is the mere fact that it’s a game you can get really good at by using your own approach. This is a game that just keeps paying off as you come to appreciate the finer aspects of tile yields, unit movement and preparing for events that will come hundreds of turns from where you are now.An essential title for fans of 4X strategy.Read the full retrospective at my blog »[www.celjaded.com] "

												This game is by far my favorite Civ as I had never played Civ 4. The game is kinda dissapointing without Brave New World as it improves the end game of Civ. I also recommend to all those who get this game to look at the community workshop because there are some mods that are a must get for Civ to improve the overall quality of the game. Look at the amount of hours I've played. I would never have played a game that much if I hated it.			"

												Civilization has always been the penulitimate ""Just One More Turn"" game.  Its latest continues that tradition with gusto.  There is something deeply satisfying about guiding your growing civilization through the course of history.  The varied victory conditions allows for a multitude of strategies to be effective and fun to pursue; And with the latest expansion, Brave New World, these victory conditions are better balanced than ever.I can not recomend this game enough, but be warned: it is all too easy to play ""Just One More Turn"" for hours on end.

												Sid Meier's Civilization V is a great strategy game that new and old players of the Civilization franchise will love. It combines great AI with complex strategy mechanics to immerse the player into his own empire made from a vareity of cities and military might that the Civilization franchise specializes in. However, the only downside to this game is the lack of interesting scenarios that only pricey DLC can supply. But despite the scenario problem, Civilization V is a fun and exciting game to play with friends or by yourself against the difficult AIs. I recommend this game.			"

The civilizations are great and the technology unlocks are just awesome. The biggest feature that brings me back to this game is the fact that each time you start a new civilization you know the gameplay and the way you complete the game is going to be very different to the last game you played. Extremely recommended!			"

There are absolutely no cons with this game whatsoever and despite its age, whatever price they put on it would be worth it. This is absolutely a must play and honestly should be given to every steam account created.			"

												Addicted. I need help!... Can't stop... Just one more turn....I'm a re-newb to the genre so I won't go into technical and comparison.To any other newbs I recommend checking out the Steam Community guides if you find yourself overwhelmed by the plethora of set-up options and want some frustration saving strategy hints. Totally worth a little reading time.Very few games out there keep me playing after the main objective has been met.  I can't even properly describe why... why I can't stop. Once you get past the initial learning curve it becomes seductively simple and almost hypnotic. You'll be all like, 'Hey, I can have this running and do a turn here and there while I'm getting on with something else'... 4 hours later... 'I'll do it in a minute, just one more turn...'Graphically, it's a pleasant enough mask for the clever mechanics. Many ways to play and win. Nice array of buildings and units, Stealth and Nuclear Missile being my favourites... ""Oh! Hello. Looking round my border are we? BOOM! ¡SƎHƆ┴Iq I'll melt your faces off and rub my butt all over your tiles!"" The UI is uncluttered and easy to find your way around. Tooltips and tutorial messages and in-game help are surprisingly helpful. The community is active and awesomely creative. The achievements are plentiful but stretched across DLCs.Recommended for people with time to spare.			"

												Extraordinarily fun and complex.Even small matches can easily last upwards of 6 hours, and each one is unique to the extent that your strategy must constantly evolve and change for each situation, resulting in potentially hundreds of hours of game-play. Truly mastering this game is like mastering chess, in that you never really quit learning.But dammit, if I get beat to a culture victory by one turn after a six hour game again I'm burning down a museum.

												Please love yourself and get this and all the DLC next time it goes 75% off, which is relatively often.I'm not sure how veterans to these sorts of turn-based strat games find it, but to a total newcomer like me the mechanics are rich and complex. It takes a while to become familiar with how everything works (I'm 150+ hours in and I'm still discovering things) but that just makes it more enjoyable in my opinion. You get out of it whatever you put into it. If you're super serious and looking for a challenge, this has it. If you're interested because you've heard of the potential hilarity that can ensue, this certainly has it. The worldbuilder DSK that comes with the game is also very enjoyable, especially if you're a writer or an artist. It's a great source of inspiration.			"

												There are many paths you may take. You may take the wonder path and build so many wonders you may be considered a God, or you may take the world domination path and FORCE them to consider you a god. Maybe you hate earth and decide you want to conquer the stars (as if Earth wasn't hard enough); so you decide to build a rocket and escape. Oh wait, I forgot you are a nice guy.... So instead you should go and create a giant organization and present yourself as its head. Don't want that either? Then just live for about 450 turns (a couple millenia) and die of old age. There are many paths to choose from, but how will you pave it?			"

												After roughly 200 hour and 20% of the achievements, I can easily say I have not been adicted to a video game like this in a while. Learning how to play is easy, becoming a master requires a lot of trial and error. It took me roughly 200 hours to master a vanilla strategy and will probably take me another 200 to master my strategy with the expansions. This has been one of the few games in my library and it probably will stay that way for a while. Find some friends, grab a drink, and play for hours while you crush them.			"

When you aren't DCing, you come back to find the AI, even if it's only been one turn, has entierly ♥♥♥♥ed your stratagey, moved your troops, spent your gold, founded new cities, ect. It's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to fix. I reccomend the game but if you have problems DCing, don't play multiplayer. I personally think it should ask the game host if they want to continue playing when someone dc's to prevent the AI takeover from hell.			"

												Do I recommend it? Yep!Civilization V is a game I recommend. However I only recommend for those interested in games that require thinking on your next move, rather than acting on impluse. Civilization V is a game where you can be a country, and lead it from the ancient era to the ""information era,"" the most advanced era in the game with the best tech. Such tech including a giant death robot which you can use to thump war other enemy giant death robots! Or smaller units. Like infantry... But the giant death robot always wins. Although its mostly them just fighting in other ways in short animations. But wanna get those really fast? Well you can adjust the pace of the game. Thats right! From a normal quick paced game that can end shortly, to a pace that can take about an entire 3 days to really complete or so! Anyway... As I was saying, you can be a country... The game provides loads of information on each civilization, (Being your country) and leader who you play as of that country. This can be a very fun role playing game for many who would seek to like ""alternate history."" You can even name your own country and all, making it even more suitable for roleplayers. Such countries may include China, Russia, America, England, the Celts, Mongola, Monocco, the Aztecs, Inca, and many many more! I've played almost or more so over 500 hours of this game, and I simply love it.One thing I can say gives this game a boost is its scenaros. These are games players can choose from, like a Steampunk styled scenaro, a Invasion of North Korea by Japan with their samuri, (Which believe me, I have an epic story to tell because of this one.) and even choas in midieval England, where you must fight to retain the throne from countless waves of invaders on all coasts and fronts, who are even fighting themselves. (Which made me rage quit.) Without this, I would most likely be ""meh"" towards this game. You can even be one of the invaders if you'd prefer!Do I recommend the DLC? Yes! I recommend getting the DLC first hand if you are interested in buying this game. The DLC which added the U.N. (Being ""Brave New Worlds"") is a fascinating idea for the game, and can be used as a weapon against other players in multiplayer games. You can ban resources, (That you think might be immoral. *Cough* Roleplayers.) and really deal striking blows to your enemies. But beware, as you might blow indirect hits to other players as well, hurting your country in the long run, as they invade you just so you will vote to unban oranges when the next world congress is summoned!Another great reason to buy this game, is the mods. These mods can be resource mods, civilization mods, mods to make your game feel better (Such as making units seem more epic by scalling down their size and making more of them. Making combat look extra epic.) and many other mods. There are even many mods for Bronies. Wanna fight an evil insane Pinkie? Do so as Twilight Sparkle or Princess Celestia! Heck, wanna BE Pinkie? Build some ""cupcake factories"" and get producing those weapons! Because for you, the sun might be just coming over the horizon... Rainbow Dash fan? Yep... Daring Do? Yep! Want Pony advisors instead of those boring ol' regular ones later on? You can do that. And each mod with these seems to me to be wellfully done, making them feel like they are really part of the game. Wait, whats that? You've ponified your game so much but are still bored of always fighting on the Earth map? Well... A mod can change that. Such as the ""World of Equestria"" mod, which I must say is a very epic change of pace for any Brony players. Maybe even non-brony characters... Maybe.So this is my review for Civ V. Strongly recommended for stradigy peoples and also just simply recommended for roleplayers who like country type roleplays! I mean, I could also direct those people to NationStates, but... I feel I already just did. So buy this game. With the DLC. Its freakin' epic. Don't get mods right away either. Go. No. Just buy it... Go! Get it!The choices are yours on what you want to do in this game, be it either you warmonger or you try to be a global police force, or even just an isolationist. If you have any questions for me, please ask, and I'll respond to them. There is quite a lot I ended up leaving out. I didn't want to make this to long and boring, especially since it isn't like this is in video form.			"

												This is a very fun game but without expansion packs i belive this game can become very dull Without expansion 8.7/10but if you have the full edition it is a 9.4/10Sometimes the Ai can be very easy to exploit such as the city states when you can declare was and take a worker and instantly and keep the worker. AS well the fact that on difficulties 1-5 the Ai civs will give you cities 60% of the time while making peace no matter what the circumstance. One horrible thing with this is the fact on level 5 the Ai is not bad and the fact it gets multiple advantages the layering or difficulty on level 5 and 4 very slim. For these reasons the ai can be easy to exploit. Other than some Ai problems the game is great and I would recomend it "

												Great game, very detailed in its mechanics which might be hard for some to get into. Each playthrough seems unique, lots of difficulty settings for a wide spectrum of players. However there are some glaring issues such as dumb AI, balancing problems, some civilizations are disadvantaged due to their weak unique abilities, etc. All this is fixed, or at the very least improved, with the ""Community patch"" and ""Community balance patch"" great mods which add a lot to the game and fix some existing problems. Overall I highly recommend this game for strategic game fanatics.			"

												An overall fun game with tons of replay value that is detrimented by the sheer amount of DLC. If you didn't buy all the DLC from the get-go, enjoy forking out a bunch of cash to be able to enjoy the full game, or have fun in singleplayer since almost all multiplayer matches require DLC.edit: I managed to get two of the expansion packs and it makes the game more deep and enjoyable, but I still think those who are suckered into buying any other version that the complete edition are going to be disappointed at the money they have to spend to fully enjoy the game. Still a great game.			"

												Sid Meier's Civilization V is a roundbased turn-based strategy, 4X ( = eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate) game.I'll review and recommend this game together with its expansions, as those DLCs add important things to the main gameplay, making this game so outstanding good.If you like games like Crusader Kings or the Total War series, you definitely should check this one out. (There are of course some minor to major differences)You pick a leader/country for a game and have to reach different goals for different victory conditions.My (formerly) most played game on steam, here's why:+ addictive as hell+ high replay factor+ you get so much game for your money+ every country/leader has different strengths+ you'll be able to play against friends+ lots of diplomacy and different victory conditions+ it is so much fun to watch your empire grow+ every game you start is quite different+ with DLCs: there is now religion and even more ways to win a game+ many different characters, with DLCs: even more different characters+ Graphics are actually neat, can look quite nice but does also run on older pcs (I guess)About the music: Some parts of the soundtrack are very nice and beautiful, but after playing a long time they can get repetetive and annoying, so it's neither really bad nor good.Some small things do bother me:- I guess this is a matter of taste, but I think there are way to many achievements, like 280 of 'em.- the scenarios are quite boring- sometimes I feel like you should have more diplomacy options and sometims it's annoying how fast another nation dislikes you (but I guess this is somehow realistic =)- Battle is really simple, if you want a similar game with more focus on battle/war, try the Total War Series (e.g. Medieval or Rome 1)Overall, this game is giving you extremely many hours of gametime due to its addictive gameplay and I guess you'll easily get plus 100 -150 hours with this one.Rating:94/100			"

												It's an exhausting game to play, but once you have the BNW expansion, it's also one of the best strategy games you'll get your hands on.**Edit:** I have now played the game long enough to know what all my quirks with the game is. I still believe it's a really good game. For a future Civ game, i'd LOVE to see a pitboss mode that allows you to use a shared steamcloud save, and gave steam notifications when it is your turn, rather than having a dedicated server running hosting the game 24/7 while it is played (which could be months potentially).A pitboss mode like this would be even more attractive if a future civ game was focused more around optimization and lightweight-ness than pretty polygons. The perfect civ would be an epic game spanding several months, where it'd take you 20 seconds to sign in, take a turn, and leave the game again.			"

												gandhi nuked me xD that's not supposed to happen because gandhi was peaceful lol actuallyMohandas Karamchand Gandhi (/ˈɡɑːndi, ˈɡæn-/;[2] Hindustani: [ˈmoːɦənd̪aːs ˈkərəmtʃənd̪ ˈɡaːnd̪ʱi] ( listen); 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was the preeminent leader of the Indian independence movement in British-ruled India. Employing nonviolent civil disobedience, Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahatma (Sanskrit: ""high-souled"", ""venerable"")[3]—applied to him first in 1914 in South Africa,[4]—is now used worldwide. He is also called Bapu (Gujarati: endearment for ""father"",[5] ""papa""[5][6]) in India. In common parlance in India he is often called Gandhiji. He is unofficially called the Father of the Nation.[7][8]Born and raised in a Hindu merchant caste family in coastal Gujarat, western India, and trained in law at the Inner Temple, London, Gandhi first employed nonviolent civil disobedience as an expatriate lawyer in South Africa, in the resident Indian community's struggle for civil rights. After his return to India in 1915, he set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination. Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, but above all for achieving Swaraj or self-rule.Gandhi famously led Indians in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930, and later in calling for the British to Quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned for many years, upon many occasions, in both South Africa and India. Gandhi attempted to practise nonviolence and truth in all situations, and advocated that others do the same. He lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community and wore the traditional Indian dhoti and shawl, woven with yarn hand-spun on a charkha. He ate simple vegetarian food, and also undertook long fasts as a means of both self-purification and social protest.Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism, however, was challenged in the early 1940s by a new Muslim nationalism which was demanding a separate Muslim homeland carved out of India.[9] Eventually, in August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire[9] was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan.[10] As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Eschewing the official celebration of independence in Delhi, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to provide solace. In the months following, he undertook several fasts unto death to promote religious harmony. The last of these, undertaken on 12 January 1948 when he was 78,[11] also had the indirect goal of pressuring India to pay out some cash assets owed to Pakistan.[11] Some Indians thought Gandhi was too accommodating.[11][12] Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, assassinated Gandhi on 30 January 1948 by firing three bullets into his chest at point-blank range.[12]His birthday, 2 October, is commemorated as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and world-wide as the International Day of Nonviolence.

For all of its more controversial elements and related failings, the hours I’ve spent playing Civilization V make it quite obvious; this is still one of the most varied and consistently satisfying games that I’ve played to date.With dozens of different civilizations to choose from (America, Mongolia, China etc.), each with their own unique abilities and bonuses, no two games are likely to play out quite the same way and as such, Civilization V is a tough game for strategy fans to get bored of.As Arabia you might seek to establish a lucrative trade network and ‘buy’ yourself friends using your mountains of dosh, as England you might construct a powerful maritime nation and go on the offensive with enhanced frigates and longbows, and as France you may instead choose to wow the world with your awe-inspiring culture and devotion to the arts; ensnaring people to your ideology with that time honoured brand of “polite terrorism” that is tourism.The two official expansions to the game only seek to refine it further with the official releases Gods and Kings and Brave New World both adding a raft of additional features including new civilizations and wonders, religion, espionage, trade routes and an expanded culture game including great works and archaeology.In every new game I find myself drawn not to the most powerful strategies, but instead to the ones that intrigue me the most. It’s a testament to the game’s diverse palette of “boardgamey” elements that make every setup so unique and rife with potential.Ultimately, my favourite aspect of Civilization V is the mere fact that it’s a game you can get really good at by using your own approach. This is a game that just keeps paying off as you come to appreciate the finer aspects of tile yields, unit movement and preparing for events that will come hundreds of turns from where you are now.An essential title for fans of 4X strategy.Read the full retrospective at my blog »[www.celjaded.com] "

												What is there to say about this game? It's great in strategy, always allowing for choices on what kind of nation you want to lead with Policies, Research, Diplomacy... It would seem like there is always something new to discover, something new to learn, which is, in any game, awesome and something that makes games timeless and entertaining for a long time. but you wouldn't need me to tell you that, I'm hardly a strategy game pro.Besides being an awesome strategy game though, this game also chose to have this message of showing you how awesome humanity is with quotes and cinematics... just great stuff, really makes ya feel optimistic :D  But all I can say is: Great Game. Of all the games you ""need"" to buy on Steam, this one is one of the best classics that still holds up time and time again.			"

												Please love yourself and get this and all the DLC next time it goes 75% off, which is relatively often.I'm not sure how veterans to these sorts of turn-based strat games find it, but to a total newcomer like me the mechanics are rich and complex. It takes a while to become familiar with how everything works (I'm 150+ hours in and I'm still discovering things) but that just makes it more enjoyable in my opinion. You get out of it whatever you put into it. If you're super serious and looking for a challenge, this has it. If you're interested because you've heard of the potential hilarity that can ensue, this certainly has it. The worldbuilder DSK that comes with the game is also very enjoyable, especially if you're a writer or an artist. It's a great source of inspiration.			"

												There are many paths you may take. You may take the wonder path and build so many wonders you may be considered a God, or you may take the world domination path and FORCE them to consider you a god. Maybe you hate earth and decide you want to conquer the stars (as if Earth wasn't hard enough); so you decide to build a rocket and escape. Oh wait, I forgot you are a nice guy.... So instead you should go and create a giant organization and present yourself as its head. Don't want that either? Then just live for about 450 turns (a couple millenia) and die of old age. There are many paths to choose from, but how will you pave it?			"

												After roughly 200 hour and 20% of the achievements, I can easily say I have not been adicted to a video game like this in a while. Learning how to play is easy, becoming a master requires a lot of trial and error. It took me roughly 200 hours to master a vanilla strategy and will probably take me another 200 to master my strategy with the expansions. This has been one of the few games in my library and it probably will stay that way for a while. Find some friends, grab a drink, and play for hours while you crush them.			"

You start with nothing but a small city and a band of warriors, progressing through the ages, discovering technologies and creating the best civilazation in the world. 9/10 aboslutely recomend, just make sure you get the complete version. The vanilla game will leave you wanting more. Also, if you're a fan of Alexander the Great, prepare to absolutely hate his guts in this game.			"

												Civilization 5 has had an interesting journey over the years and remains the game I have most likely wasted the most time on. But do not think it is perfect in any ways, it is as flawed as a game can be.I will not waste time on Single Player as the AI is either unfair on Diety and it is a challenge so far that you have to play one exact way to win or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly stupid and all you do is haul those wonders and wait for a time to attack. Their attack strategies are mediocre at best and even with number advantage you are able to defeat the opponent without any issues. But there is a reason I only played Civ Beyond Earth 30 hours and this game since then 500 hours. And it is the Multiplayer.Back in the day I used to play Civ 3 with some buddies on Hot Seat Mode and that was a blast, so going into Civ 5 I started playing MP right away and have not been disappointed, well I have been but more on that later.The team games are awesome, they require great tactics and strategy and are highly competitive given you play with the right group. FFAs are plenty and can be fun too, there is nothing more rewarding than winning a 6 hour game. At the beginning there are several ways to be competitive and one has to make quick and rash decisions on whether to build wonders, cities or units. There is a default way to be effective but one still has to analyse its territory. With the addons this just becomes better as one has to decide whether to go for that early pantheon, how to deal with city states and potential neighbors. Sometimes an early rush is the only option you have to succeed. This is what makes the game great, you are required to make game altering decisions quickly and early. It is not like AoE where you can play with a preset mindset as sometimes it just dont work out. When you are playing as Babylon, a science powerhouse, but you see yourself surrounded by 2 players, your typcial play by rushing Great Library will not be possible anymore.With all the updates and addons I do have to say I like the current setup of Wonders as well as the selection of Natural Wonders. There are some which are gamebreaking and are usually banned, e.g. Great Wall. But I do like them as a adjustment to your game. The Natural Wonders are IMO also quite nicely balanced, except of course El Dorado and the Fountain of Youth, which are rare spawns. The 500 Gold equalizes an early Settler buy or 2 workers, which gives you a great advantage to do anything. Fountain of Youth gives you 10 happiness plus higher Reg, you can expand without worries for a long time. But it is possible to still defeat a person with these wonders, something that can be rewarding. The Tech Tree I always had my issues with as it is pretty locked and sometimes offers little room for strategy. There are some techs which are game deciding, Crossbows and Navigation the most apparent ones. Later one as the tech tree branches out one has to make a decision on getting certain techs while neglecting others. One of the toughest decisions is always on whether getting Public Schools or Artillery, Science or the 3 range unit. Early on I always play a default setup, I rarely adjust it to the start. C			"
