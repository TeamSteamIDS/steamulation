												NO HD version, NO new freatures, NO achievements or card drops, JUST nostalgia and one of the best strategy games ever made.beautyfull graphics and an awesome gameplay, start with 10 worker units and finish it with a 700 man strong army.you can WIN with MASS OR CLASS, you can send over 1000 units but they can weaker as 400 fully upgradet units.to bring it on the point, when you LIKE GOOD strategy games, you do NOTHING, NOTHING wrong with it.EDIT: for me it runs perfectly on win7, i played it with a friend (LAN) and we had no problem, he used win8 and yeah the first time he had many crashes but we found the problem (start the game through the exe in the steam folders .

												I still remember when I got the game, it was an accident...My friend gave me a demo cd with a bunch of games on it and cossacks: back to war was one of em.I kept play that one demo mission again and again...I think STILL this is the best strategy game of all time, it amazes me how you can control thousands, big cities and navy fleets.And it takes hundreds of hours to finish the game because there is so much missions in it and of course an editor too.And this strategy game is unique because the game mechanics are so different than most of the other strategy games, you dont have to rush for resources, there is always a few mine places around you where you can get the resources from.But it takes a long time to upgrade yourself and meanwhile you have to defend yourself too and thats why almost all of the missions takes 2-3 hours to finish, so this makes you feel like you are in a real hardcore war I think.I had so much epic battles in this game			"

												It was one of my first computer games and it's still one of my favorites!-Amazing battles-Many possible strategies : mortars to attack from a huge distance, cavalry to attack the rearguard or to quickly pillage mines, officers and drums to make troop formations (up to 196 soldiers with one officer)...-Enormous battlegrounds filled with soldiers (up to 10 000 if I remember correctly)!-A lot of available countries with different architectures and troops-Possibility to capture citizens, artillery and buildings with only some simple soldiers (there are priests too but they can heal a bit)-Interesting use of ressources (to be able to fire you need coal, to keep mercenaries on your side you need gold etc.) so if your coal mines get captured for example you can no longer fire anything! (of course you can buy coal on the market but the prices can vary a lot depending on your behavior)-Pretty good soundtracksIt's often really cheap on sales so if you enjoy RTS games, grab it! "

												I've been playing Cossacks for 13 years and I can say that it's the best rts I've played.Pros:-Extensive economy-Massive battles (at land and sea)-Various strategies for winning, depending on circumstances,terrain and your nation's and opponents' features.-Buildings are exact replicas of real ones all over Europe-100 single missions-9 campaigns-Taking advantage of the terrain is my favourite aspect of this game.You can place artillery on high ground,musketeers on either side of a passage for ambush,build walls and towers on strategic positions, block bridges  etc. Cons:-Apart from a couple of minor bugs,none whatsoever.I tried playing age of empires and empire earth,after having played cossacks for a time,and I just couldn't! They are, definitely,inferior games. "

												Incredibly good game. Been playing this for over 10 years with a friend and we're still impressed by it.-The game has an excellent balance between different unit types.-The nations are varied enough to keep it enjoyable for a long time. Some nations may be very slightly over powered though e.g. Poland and Ukraine-Seemingly endless single missions and enjoyable campaign.-Art style is good and will likely age very well over time.-Good resource ideas.-Good upgrade trees-One downsides is poor AI, which uses the same tactics constantly, just with increasingly larger numbers of units.-The blue and black team colors are difficult to see on the map sometimes, while the white color is easily confused with the unit selected color on the map.-The mine locator upgrade obsures your mines on the map making them difficult to locate ironically.-No options for reforging alliances after the game has started.-Multiplayer over internet is difficult to set up initially			"

												Reasons to get this game:Very light, would run on a toaster if necessaryBIG battles. Battles of 1000+ vs 1000+ (and way way bigger) are possible if you so desire, easy system to make your soldiers in to ""squads"" so managing those 1000+ soldiers is not very hardActually has LARGE maps. Compared to, for example, AoE III, their ""large"" map is small compared to cossacks very large.I have not played the campaign very much but from what I have, it seems pretty solid and challenging.Has map editor that's pretty easy to use!Also one cool thing I must add is how every single unit you have, be thousands or more keep their own record for their kills. You can see every single soldiers killcount separately, pretty cool. This is also true for cannons, towers and ships.			"

I have played this game since 2004 but off Steam. i've played Command & Conquer, Rise of Legends, Age of Empires, Starcraft, etc. a lot of RTS games. yet i keep coming back to this beautiful masterpiece.pretty much all the negative reviews on this game are people that arent able to play it because they're too n00b and dumb and switched to Windows 8 or 10.

												Lets Fight in the 17th and 18th Century with Cossacks:Back to War.This statergy game is like mix of Total War and Age of Empires,though there are some pros and cons in the game,which are written as follow: Pros:  Great Game,good graphics of its time Huge battles,good AI,Lengthy Campaigns. Huge choice of nations,and units.I can only mention the above,thier are alot of pros in this game. Cons:  No Unit Voice. Very hard campaigns, cannot be really completed by everyone. No message of telling that resources are low, unit has been created,unit is idle,or no downward toolwarThis is a great game,these cons are the only ones i could find,though as i said above,the single player missions and the game campaigns are very very hard even on normal mode,and lengthy too. Only a true statergy player can play and like this game.			"

												One of the best strategy games out there. Spend hundreds of hours playing this game back when it just came out (ahh... nostalgia). Some campaign missions are insanely hard, even on normal difficulty, unlike most 'modern' strategy games in which you can usually beat the entire campaign without real effort (which is rather boring, I like having hard missions!). You can actually have huge scale battles on land or on sea in this game with thousands of units. Every battle will be unique because of all the different nations you can choose to play.TL;DRI only have one piece of advice: stop reading reviews. This game costs just 5 euros (or even less when its on sale). Buy it. Now.			"

												Cossacks Back to War is one of the best RTS games of all time and my personal favorite by far. It was created more than a decade ago but is still played and enjoyed by many people. If they had servers up and running for it many more people would still be playing it. COSSACKS 3 IS COMING OUT THIS FALL! They are planning on basing it off this original version of cossacks, keeping it a full priced game (a good thing), and it will be modding friendly. Way to go Cossacks 3 developers!			"

												Here's my review for Cossacks, I'll go for the negatives first which are few.- I've recently got into the game just a while back, I can understand why it eventually became overshadowed by other RTS strategies like Age of Empire (AoE). It is not exactly a classic that can meet to todays options.- There is a huge learning curve, the tutorials are extremely hard to understand working on a story line based script that throws you essentially into a game with some start up bonuses (note I did the one trying to understand military movements and got wrecked in the tutorial in minutes). - Controls are more rugged than modern strategies understandably and this can be a deterrent if you're not willing to put the time into play it. - Unlike franchises like Civilization and other games with Strategic Alliance emphasis there is no Diplomacy, its either 2v2s, 3v3s 4v4s or FFA. Don't expect the AI to give out on you if you make a blunder or get annihilated by them (don't expect if from strangers on Multi-player) they will continue to destroy you until you lose or rage *note, I did the first couple of games, which I normally don't do*.- Understandably, Multiplayer is no where near as large as other strategy games, I haven't played multi enough to judge is characteristics of its gamers' virtues.Now the positives of the game which to me outweigh its slight love obstacles. - Simplistic design does not mean you have to over analysis, there is one goal, kill everyone else.- Game runs on a simple quasi-rock/paper/scissors game mixed with a tacticians prowess and unit leadership.- With friends you can build massive empires and role-play the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game, only with friends and Multiplayer.- Remarkable graphics (for its time) that can arguably stand up to this day. - Replaybility and saving in the midst of battles are nice, as well as restarting a game with the same map or different starting armies.- You can choose between historic powers of the 1600s and 1700s, like France, Britian, Turkey, Bavaria, Prussia, Saxony, Russia, Netherlands, Venice, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Sweden, Poland and others!-Up to 8 players in a match with great challenging AI, even at Easy.- Its a cheap affordable game which should work on any computer *note I'm running this on a Windows 8, not Win 8.1 with 4th Gen i3 and 4 GB of RAM*-Its a game that if you are familiar with the Total War Series should remind you of an arcadey version of Empire Total War, *note without turn base, diplomacy or agents, and the fact that this game is more 2d than Empire*.I would say this is a must buy if you have the patience, heart and  tolerance to get be humbled by the good AI system or a Human player, its cheap and fun. Also I haven't tried any of the 'DLC' or Expansion Packs as they were known back then. I hope this helps you make your decision ultimately, I wish you best of luck on the battlefield if you get the game.			"

												Best RTS game ever.  I used to play this game a lot in my youth.  The best thing about it, is you have no limit on how many troops you can create!  You just need to have enough resources and dwellings, as long as you have enough, you can create as big of an army as you want.  For those of you complaining about this game not working on Windows 10Here is how to make it work (and stop crashing):1. Go to your steam library, right click on ""Cossacks: Back to War"" and select ""Properties""2. In ""Properties"", go to the ""Local Files"" tab, and select ""Browse Local Files""3. Open the ""bin"" folder, then scroll down & find ""csbtw"" right click it & select ""troubleshoot compatibility""4. After a moment you should get to a screen where you can select ""Try Recommended Settings""5. Once you have selected it, you can click on ""Test the Program"" to do a test run of the game, then exit the game6. Now select ""Next""  and then ""Yes, save these settings for this program"" it will then try to detect other issues7. After this, it should say that it is fixed, click on ""Close""There you have it!  The game should now run fine without crashing on you, and you can change the game speed without problems. My only issue now is getting it to display in widescreen, other than that, it runs perfectly.  I found the above steps in a youtube video, and it worked.  I hope this helps.			"

												A timeless classic. It has all the usual features that RTS games of that time tended to have.. and more!Here are some features that make this game especially awesome and which many contemporaries lack (e.g. AoE, Warcraft, C&C):- automatic infinite production loops of units (so you don't click yourself to death trying to constantly refill the ranks of your troops)- armies CAN get huge (easily over 1,000+ per player) and WILL get huge (due to the ease of producing lots of units)- more realism: your swordfighters won't be able to hit a building with melee weapons magically setting it on fire and eventually destroying it, instead, most buildings can be captured, and buildings can be destroyed only using artillery or certain specific unit types (standard settings)- very flexible game speed (single player only): you can play it really slow to follow every single move your units make, useful when building up a base, or insanely fast to the point where you'll have trouble keeping up with understanding whats going on during a battle			"

												Couldn't tell you whether to get this or any of the other from the original Cossack(tm) series. Most of them say this, and I own them all on GOG.com.At any rate, I can't recommend this enough! If you're a history buff like me, and/or fan of strategy games then you're bound to like this. There are not many, and especially well made, pike and shot games out there. Believe me, this is one of the few fantastic ones. And for the price it's hard to beat. There are some 20 nations to choose from, each unique with advantages and disadvantages, and each offer different challenges and opportunities.Just how a strategy game should play. Just buy it, I doubt you'll regret it! "

												This is one the best stradegy games I have ever played. Everything about this game makes you think of your economy versus your army. However, most of the game focuses on your military and navy. This is the best in the Cossacks series and the only one you need. Each nation is matched as they would be in the 1600 to 1700s. So late is better to go with a strong nation from that time. So not the middle eastern countries, but they are very stronge in the early part of the game. It is Napolionic fighting and is very addictive. This is very recommened to anyone who like RTS's. It will become a favorite, when you see 3000 of your troops attack a city.			"

												Classic RTS. Consists of fast or slow paced civilization building with unique nations, you can control thousands of units at any moment, and the game features a realistic--and equally unforgiving--resource/economy system not seen in many RTSs.During its prime the game looked quite beautiful, and while I can't confirm you can play multiplayer with your friends, the single-player campaign is quite challenging and you will face challenging overwhelming forces more often than not. It's quite cheap on Steam, and you will find a lot of value for your dollar. Edited - 6/10/15			"

												Many of you may be asking whether this is a game worth picking up. Some of you may be turned off by the graphics but believe me, this is one heck of a fun game to play. I'm a person who will try any game no matter how old the graphics as long as its is addicting and fun to play.Actually, this one of my favorite RTS Games of all time. With tons of nations to choose from each with their own distinct characteristics, it will definitely keep you playing for hours end on end fielding gigantic armies and swift yet powerful navies to throw at your enemies. I recently bought this game here in Steam just to get a secure copy of the game because mu old CD is now broke. I've probably sunk hundreds or perhaps more than a thousand hours into this game since I started playing it 8 years ago and I still enjoy it today! If you don't mind the look of the graphics and want a great strategy game to sink your teeth into, you should definitely try Cossacks: Back to War (^_^)			"

Its also most entertaining and most accessible to new players. There is not much to it. Just build economy a spam as much units as you can feed and arm, then butchery can start.

												Cossacks Back to War is a very old RTS that focuses on building huge armies of 10.000+ units per player with tactical 18th century combat using variety of canons,upgrades and naval warfare . You can use generals to build formations that give melee bonuses, use cavalry for flanks (which is actually very effective ) and canons for long range siege .In its own right this is one of the best game in the genre . Since all units and buildings are made in sprites rather than 3d models this game still looks pretty good .Go to options and reduce game speed when you playing single player ;)I don't get to say this very often but UKRAINE and DENMARK OP			"

												This one's a bit different from cossacks 2.  It is a lot more like Age of the Empires in the sense of gameplay.  It takes place in the Napoleonic Wars.  I believe Age of the Empires 3 ripped off this game, and put a lower unit cap.  My attachement to the game is the scope.  You control squads of 196 men (At least I do).  That is a lot for a game like age of the empires.  A comparable game series would be Stronghold.  I checked, and the global unit cap is none.  WOW.  So yeah, feel free to use your math to figure out how many is too many and crashes the computer.  I also must mention the imperium mod here.  I adds the 19th century, and balances a few things.  Of note is that there is diplomacy, and other things.  Also, the upgrade system is pretty extensive.  You will NEVER research everything.  Well, unless you play defensive the whole game, and stall your opponent until that point.  I do that in Cossacks 2 to my friend.  :POh yeah, I've played Age of the Empires 3, and this game is EASILY superior.			"

												Really great game! I would recommend it for anyone who likes strategy games! It is a challenging game though, I cant beat it on easy mode ( Over 50 tries so far). Its still really addicting! 8/10 (It would be 10/10 if it could be updated more and have easier multiplayer setup)			"

												Dear Gamer,Cossacks Back To War is in my opinion one of the best colonial- and build-your-army game. You can choose a imperium, which was in the 17th and 18th century popular, like Prussia, Great Britan or Bavaria. Be careful, because it's a very old game, which released in 2002, but the feeling is unforgattable.Marcel			"

												Though my hours are few I plan on adding many more, all I can say is this game is right up my alley and as a fan of history (specficially Protestant Prussia) I whole heartily approve of this game with some caveats:The common cry among the negatives reveiw is that it is not optimized for modern computers and that is true, was not the case for me but a common warning nevertheless.It is quite different from modern RTS, wheras modern RTS have since had their shift focused more on the combat and less on the economy (or reducing it to 2-3 resources) this game I find is a balance, you need a good economy to make a good military which unlike most modern RTS is set in the 17th-18th century.Gameplay wise, while every nation has roughly identical units (to a greater or lesser degree, some nations have completely unique and distinct units) their sprites are distinct for each nation, culture and people (hell, you can set wars between Prussia and Bavaria in what was once vestige states of the ""Holy"" Roman Catholic Empire, 100 points to Martin Luther for smashing that to peices).I highly recacomend this game, doubly so if you computer has Windows XP virtual drive.

Tried several computers, several monitors all with very low display settings for these older games. Crash. Crash. Crash. I bought 2 copies, one for myself and one for my son so we could play together. Instead we spent over an hour crashing. What a waste of money. Would appreciate a refund. Maybe Cossacks 3 will be better. Crash... crash... crash... crash... crash... crash... crash... crash... crash... crash... crash... crash...			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding cheese cake recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients: 1 cup digestive plain sweet biscuit crumbs3 tablespoons sugar3 tablespoons melted butter40 ounces softened cream cheese1 cup sugar3 tablespoons flour1 tablespoon vanilla1 cup sour cream4 eggsDirections:For The base:.If you're using a dark pan, preheat the oven to 350. If you are using a shiny pan, 375.Combine the crumbs, melted butter and 3 tbsp sugar well and pat onto the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan. I also like to very very lightly butter the sides of the pan so that the cheesecake will not stick later on.Bake for 10 mins in your preheated oven and remove. Let it cool while you prepare your batter.For the batter:.Make sure everything is at room temperature.Combine sugar, cheese, flour and vanilla in a big bowl and mix on medium speed till well combined. Don't forget to scrape the bowl as you're doing this.Mix in the sour cream till its incorporated well. Then, add the eggs one by one, mixing well after each addition.Pour the batter into the springform and let it bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes After the baking time, turn off the oven and leave the door ajar. Let the cake cool in there for about 1 1/2 hours.Remove the cake and let it cool thoroughly. Refrigerate overnight.Release the sides of the springform.Eat.			"

												Seriously, buy this game. Its dirt cheap and absolutely FANTASTIC you CAN play it on multiplayer using Hamachi or Evolve (works better) and if you get MOD1 then this becomes an even bigger gem. If looking for people to play with I am ALWAYS up for a computer match or a player vs player (even though I am not that good). I recommend it more than I can possibly recommend any other game I have ever bought.If looking for the link to MOD1 or how to install if feel free to add me if you like and I would be more than happy to assist you in downloading it and even teaching you the basics or even advanced moves!

												As steam probably shows I don't have very many hours on this game, but I have played american conquest which was released 2 years after this game. it is almost an exact replica with very minor gameplay changes and different nations, other than that just higher terrain detail and graphics quality.The whole system with buildings, upgrades, etc. is basically the same and I think both of these games are equally good because they are not exactly the same so it just depends on what you want to play at the time, but after playing American Conquest I can't play age of empires with my friends without wanting to play specific game modes (other than a simple random map match) similar to the gameplay of AC.Would definitely recommend anyone who loves RTS to play the Cossacks/American conquest games and looking forward to Cossacks 3 coming out some time soon.

 Great game!Cossacks is my favorite RTS game of all time. Even though it is old it still got all these features that makes every game different and opens for numerous tactics and game styles. One of the interesting things that Cossacks got different from other RTS games is the number and variety of nations and what i believe is the most important thing; practically unlimited numbers of units. 

Still waiting for the multiplayer features to get better, would be really great to be able to play with friends without the need of being in the same network.

10/10 i do really recommend this game! "

												As steam probably shows I don't have very many hours on this game, but I have played american conquest which was released 2 years after this game. it is almost an exact replica with very minor gameplay changes and different nations, other than that just higher terrain detail and graphics quality.The whole system with buildings, upgrades, etc. is basically the same and I think both of these games are equally good because they are not exactly the same so it just depends on what you want to play at the time, but after playing American Conquest I can't play age of empires with my friends without wanting to play specific game modes (other than a simple random map match) similar to the gameplay of AC.Would definitely recommend anyone who loves RTS to play the Cossacks/American conquest games and looking forward to Cossacks 3 coming out some time soon.

												One of the best RTS of all time. It different then AoE in that it delivers the satisfaction to have more massive action, both in developing economics and battles. Battles are similar to what You have in Total War series (and non similar to those in AoE), but with more micromanagement and less realistic as in Total War (there's no such thing as moral of army). You end with the joy of building and upgrading Your army yourself. Quite big choice of strategies to have. Warfare of 17th and 18th are accurate mostly. One, who enjoys Napoleonic era wars will certainly enjoy this game. Naval warfare is also present, and is tweaked in Back to War addon. Skirmish mode is infinite, i can't have enough usually.			"

												Gold that's hiding behind the hill, my favorite game of this genre. This old school RTS game is based on events which took place during the 17th and 18th centuries in Europe. It offers 16 playable nations and each has its own architectural style, military advantages, technologies and unique units. The 9 campaigns (requires a DLC) and 100 single missions in this game are tough and it makes the game very challenging and therefore I highly recommend it to any classic RTS fan. In my opinion the first three Cossacks games (Cossacks Anthology series) are far better than Cossacks 2. The second game has different mechanics and just isn't as simple and identical to the first game.EDIT: I forgot to mention that the Steam version of this game DOES NOT work with the Game Ranger servers or Hamachi at all. This includes LAN as well. If you want to play against other players you will have to own the non Steam version. Luckily I have the orignal CD somewhere laying around, (it's fuggin lost) but I find this quite a letdown, but other than that this game is truly outstanding and absolutely worth buying, but I just don't recommend the Steam version (unless you're fine with single player mode).

												Used to have Cossacks Back to War on disk, gave up after it became really complicated to make it run on Windows 8. This steam edition worked flawlessly for me right from the start, allowing me to enjoy great single player action in this classic game. Multiplayer unfortunately is the part that never worked properly for me, despite spending hours combing through all the advice and recommendations. Only a wired connection allowed me to play with friends at home, and even then it didn't work every time we tried. Online play seems even less stable for me, although other people seem to have got it to work no problem.6/10 - Great single player experience from a great classic game. Multiplayer is a little unstable unfortunately - some people have got it to work without too many problems, others like me are still trying after weeks.			"

Die Grafik ist zwar nicht mehr die beste (gut war sie damals schon auch nicht), aber hey, man kann tausende von Soldaten oder hundert Schiffe auf dem Bildschirm versammeln, die den Begriff ""Armee"" oder ""Flotte"" wirklich verdient. Die Kampagnen der einzelnen Länder sind geschichtlich auch recht interessant, weil man die meisten aus dem Unterricht eher nicht kennt.

												This game is a must have for anyone who loves the Age of Empires series and just great RTS in general. This game doesn't use any fancy graphics engine but it does feature some great artistic presentation that paints a colorful picture. First of all the ability to chose from a giant variety of nations is amazing. Every nation has its strengths and weaknesses. Ex. Chinese start out with more peasants and have a better economy regulation, while Ukraine excels at firearms and cavalry, but lacks any cold steel infantry. So playing a different nation every time will give you a totally different feel. Sound effects are top notch in this game, ranging from atmospheric distant and close cannon fire, to nature sounds, to soldiers dying on a battlefield. There are a ton of factors that make this game superb so I won't bother mentioning them all. One last and important aspect that I will mention is the ability to literally control THOUSANDS of units at once. Imagine Age of Empires roids. That quality definitely adds an epic feel to the battles.I probably put over a 1,000 hours into this game back in the days, that how much replayability it has. I was feeling nostalgic lately so decided to pick it up on Steam and give it a try once more.			"

												Oh this game takes me back... It was the late 90's. Gaming hadn't quite devloped into the modern behemoth that it is today and adventuresome games were as common as dragons in Skyrim - not everywhere, but you knew for certain they did exist.Cossacks is a base-building, tech-researching RTS that has a world of charm despite being rough around the edges. Set bewteen the 16th and 18th centuries in Europe, Cossacks: European Wars and Cossacks: Back to War (the standalone expansion) cover roughly twenty nations from Poland to Portugal, from Algeria to Ukraine - and just about everything inbetween.Battles are fought with ranged and melee infantry and cavalry, as well as land-based artillery and naval units. The number of units the game can display on screen at any one time is in the thousands, as I recall. Enough so that an army can look like a literal blood-stain seeping across the map.Resources aren't just for purchasing units, but are also required for upkeep. What this means is: run out of coal and you run out of gunpowder. Run out of gold and your units can mutiny. Run out of gold after you've built a ship-of-the-line and you'll have a mutinous unit on the order of a Renaissance ""Death Star"" gone rogue.While this might sound like it requires a great deal of micromanagement, it's actually fairly easy to keep track of - just monitor your resource counters at the top of the screen. If one starts to drop, start some research or throw some more peasants at it. If your food drops below zero, your units will begin to starve.Some other great concepts found in the Cossacks series: Peacetime in multiplayer. Essentially, you can agree to a set amount of Peacetime - a period where you cannot make aggressive moves. Well, you can, but your units will die when they cross the peacetime borders. This allows for the construction of intricate defenses and massed strategic-level armies.Another favorite feature of mine and often copied by other games is the right-click-drag to change facing. I can't swear that Cossacks is the first series to use this feature, but it definitely was the first one that I'd played.The game's default speed is incredibly fast on modern computers, but it can be slowed down to suit your needs - or sped up if you feel you've really just had way too much caffeine today.All in all a stellar example of base-building RTS. Limited scope and limited marketing kept the game from the rightful place it deserves among the genre, but the game is far more than worth it.Downsides? Don't expect much in the way of tutorial. You'll also need to really read through the Academy (the main research structure) as well as the Blacksmith and other structures to find all the tech and research upgrades. If you don't mind all of that, you'll find a true diamond in the rough.			"

												Used to play this years ago. Thought it was great at the time. Last year I bought Age of Empires on Steam to get back into old style RTS but found it uninteresting. Recently I noticed Cossacks was in the Store and bought it. Worked first time though the second time I tried to play it I had to set the game mode in Windows as per the help instructions on Steam. Been perfect since then.It's just as good as ever. Just had a massive war with over 40,000 casualties. Horrific scenes, but that's the game of Cossacks. I was playing a random map against AI on hard and they still did some silly things and missed obvious opportunities (like the enemy ships did not attack my buildings) so the AI is not perfect but the game play is still fun and challenging and does not look too dates, apart from perhaps the menu screens.
