												I just finished the game. If you like doing puzzle games and are also a fan of zombies,  I would recommend this game. The puzzles get progressivly challenging- with the hardest having 350 pieces. The pieces float around in a river which makes for a little challenge of grabbing the ones you need. I got a little frustrated clicking over and over and picking up the piece that was either overlapping or under the piece I wanted. Many pieces got away from me, but I eventually caught them. The puzzles are nicely drawn and one thing I really liked was that each puzzle had different shaped pieces. One had different suits as on each side- spades, hearts, clubs, and diamonds. Another puzzle with a rapper zombie had words like SWAG as the edges of the pieces which made it interesting. The zombie shooter aspect of the game is fun, but I didn't find it as challenging as I expected it to be. The zombies come out one by one until the Z timer runs out. Then multiple zombies run out, but at a rather slower than desired pace. I was able to pick most of them off before they even reached my barricade. Most run in a straight line or at a slight slope. It would be nice to be able to change the difficulty level to up the zombie factor, either with more zombies, special zombies (currently, all zombies take 3 shots to kill), or zombies that run in zigzagging directions making them harder targets. I know the game is fairly new, so I'm looking forward to seeing what will be added to it. I'd also be interested in purchasing DLC puzzles. Lastly, Steam achievements would be the icing on the cake for this game.			"

												So I played a second game from the Pixel Puzzles (1) franchise. And I just can't recommend it. First the good things: I like the graphic style. The pictures used for the jigsaw puzzles were nice and had enough characteristics to solve within 15-60 minutes each. The game includes 19 of those puzzles with 60-350 pieces.But... there are a couple of things I just didn't like and which made me not to recommend the game.There is the same big bug in the game as it is in Pixel Puzzles: Japan. You just can't select a floating piece properly. Whenever there is more than one piece below your cursor, the one with the lowest internal id is selected (i guess) and this is not the puzzle piece that is the most on top, but is visually the piece down below.All the piece ids are sorted from top left to bottom right. So picking the upper row is ok, but when you want to complete the border first, you have to be very patient until you have all the pieces on the board.Second thing I didn't like is the minigame. In Zombiemode you have to defeat zombies while you solve the puzzles. Let's be honest, most people solve jigsaws because they want a calm experience, not a time challenge?Ok, you can deactivate the zombies, but I am not sure how that character leveling to unlock new puzzles works without zombies.As a completionist be warned. You have to play the minigame in the main menu for about 90 to 120 minutes straight. This gets really annoying.From my opinion: I don't want to buy a jigsaw puzzle just to play a top down zombie shooter instead.			"

												I may have only just started, but i'm having a lot of fun so far.  It's basically what you see- you're completing a jigsaw, but to change things up a bit you also occasionally get attacked by zombies at the bottom right, so you have to think about your ammo and barricades etc. So that you don't die. It's fairly challenging, actually.The puzzles are nice and it doesn't have the problem of everything being a similar colour in the jigsaw, the art is pretty good, and it makes a nice change in the pace of the game when you suddenly get attacked by a horde of zombies.There's also an option when you start each jigsaw to turn off the zombies, in case you really don't want them.Also, the jigsaw pieces are shaped differently to the usual looking jigsaw pieces, which is an interesting idea and you have to think differently to how the pieces go together.It's an interesting idea, and I feel it works well.There also seem to be enough jigsaw puzzles to keep you busy and justify the price, and the devs are adding more for free. Reccomended :D			"

												I wasn't sure how this was going to work, coming off the Japan Pixel Puzzle game and its zen like peace and calm. This is a really clever concept, tying an action defense game in to a jigsaw puzzle mechanic, and I REALLY admire the concept - but its in total contrast to the other game in terms of tension, panic and ultimately frustration. I'll still play it, because of the novelty of it, and sometimes I like a buzz. If you like being under pressure, and you have a quick keen eye for puzzle pieces you might like this incarnation. If you're a dawdler and a person who does jigsaws for relaxation I'd say this probably isnt the right title - go and play the Pixel Puzzles Japan game instead.			"

												While the game itself, like it's predecessor Pixel Puzzles Japan, is quite enjoyable, it still has the same key issue: you cannot save the puzzles, a thing you can do with real life puzzles even. It is also somewhat easier than the Japan version due to using drawings instead of photographs.There's a tacked on ""survival mode"" with a shooting game going on in the lower part of the screen, as a kind of hard mode. A nice idea, but mediocre in execution.Images vary from good with funny motifs to half amateurish, which is a shame. There's fifteen puzzles in total, if they had gone with their better illustrator for all of them it would have uplifted the whole game.What finally prompted me to go for a negative rating (instead of saying it's mediocre and still giving it a thumbs up) has to be that one last achievement though. Completionists, stay away from this unless you are prepared to suffer!There's a menu mini game, which has several achievements tied to it. Some of them are for killing a certain amount of menu zombies. The first ones stack, the last one apparently doesn't. So essentially I'd have to start all over again for that last one, because I was tricked into believing I could give my eyes a rest after over an hour of the most boring(!) achievement hunt period.Doing hard achievements is one thing (and welcome), but this was simply a sadistic and dirty move from the devs on behalf of hunters. So, to return that ""favor"": here you go, Decaying Logic, while being overall not very much disappointed by the game, I choose to make that one, tiny last bit under my review a big thumbs down. Feels good, feels right, doesn't it?			"

												Pixel Puzzles: UndeadZ (why the Z? ugh) is basically a jigsaw puzzle videogame. I'm not too familiar with the genre so I don't know where this title stands in the great pantheon, but it's a solid way to kill a few hours.This game is basically divided into three modes. There's the jigsaw puzzles, there's survival jigsaw, and menu zombies. Survival Jigsaw adds an element of danger. While you're trying to put together the puzzle, you also have to fight off the occasional zombie. There's a clock and when time is up a minor horde will attack. You earn cash via completing pieces of the puzzle, which can be spent on defenses, or to view the full picture. You also control some guy who can shoot or throw grenades at the zombies. It's a cute idea I suppose, but I'd rather focus on the puzzle itself. Menu Zombies is an overhead shooter, that takes place on the main menu. It's basically a gimmick-mode, since you can best it simply by standing still and throwing infinite grenades at everything. There are achievements for killing 5,000 menu-zombies and staying alive for an hour. I spent 15 minutes in this mode, which is still far far far too much time.Like I said, I don't own any other videogame puzzle...games(?) so I can't judge the overall quality of this title compared to others. I do however love me some jigsaw puzzles, and the convenience of not cluttering up a coffee or dining room table is a nice bonus. For a ""throwaway"" indie bundle title, this ain't bad.			"

												The Jigsaw Puzzle part is similar to PixelPuzzles: Japan.Because of the topic Zombies they incorporated some action elements like survive zombie waves in the below screen and build baricades. That is not nice. Another gimmick is the zombi survival game in the main menu which is quite nasty. Especially too kill 5k zombies in 100 min for an achievement.I enjoyed more PixelPuzzles: Japan.

												It's kind of hard to ruin a proven forumla like that of a jigsaw puzzle game, but some people manage to do it. The result is a mixture of half-baked ideas that could have been so much better.Mixing an action minigame with the patience-driven puzzle game just doesn't work. It doesn't help that the Tower Defense-esque portion is mediocre at best. You have a single straight lane were a few Zombies at a time come out and you can either place barricades to slow them down, mines to kill them or shoot/throw grenades to kill them. One problem here is, that you get the money to buy this stuff not from killed zombies but at random for correctly places puzzle pieces another, that as soon as a timer runs out, more and more Zombies come down the lane and you don't have much time to concentrate on the actual puzzle anymore.On the bright side, you don't have to play in this mode and can enjoy the puzzles taking all the time you want.That would be nice, if the actual puzzle game would be good.First the mechanics are totally off - it only checks the position of the tile against its right spot on the canvas and there's no possibility to connect tiles and move them around. Either you find the right spot and it gets locked or not. That's acceptable for minigames in larger games, but not for a standalone jigsaw game.Finding the right tiles is made ridiculously hard with all of them floating and moving around the edge all overlapping each other and not respecting screen borders. The tiles are a fraction of their actual size and the elaborated shapes are barely visible. If you finally spot a piece you want, the game does its very best to make it as hard as humanly possible for you to actually grab it. Even if the cursor is right over it and it's not overlapped itself or overlapping you will most likely grab another, presumably warped in from the other side of the screen.Apart from that the actual puzzles are too easy. The last one only has 350 pieces, the tiles can't be rotated and like mentioned before will just snap on get locked if they're in the right spot.If you're on the brink of frustation due to chasing a tile for literally a minute, you will start to notice something else. The badly looped, too short single piece of background music, the clunky controls of the action mini game and the uninspired pictures themselves.And then there is a third game within the game. The main menu is kind of a twin stick shooter zombies ... for whatever reason. But this comes with its own problems, like imbalances, weird hitboxes and a delay between triggering an action and the actual action, leading to you firing shots in whatever direction you're facing while it's performed and not the one where it it's supposed to go.Oddly enough the developer honours that gimmick with a good portion of the achievements, one for surving 60min and one for killing 5000 zombies - in one life, in one sitting, without pause - which takes around 100min. The actual distinguishing feature of the game - the tower defense - meanwhile only gets a total of 3 achievements, one of them for failing. The elephant in the room: is this reflectory of their priorities for this game?Anywho, if you enjoy jigsaw puzzles it might still be worth it for you. I spent around 6h on the 20 puzzles and did get some enjoyment out of it.			"

												7.8/10 - A Zombie Killin', Puzzle Solvin', Hybrid That Works!I really enjoy games by this developer. The puzzle games are just old school jigsaw and allow you to really chill out and relax. This is the first of these games that has differed from their winning template combining top down zombie killing! You can choose to solve the puzzles the old school way or engage in combat and defend a stronghold while you quickly work though the puzzle! This was actually really fun, but not what I personally come for when I want to solve puzzles. The title screen is also converted into another top down shooter game; which I did mess with for quite a few minutes. My only complaint with this game is the overall puzzle format and lack of controls. The puzzles range from 50-350 pieces, so once you get to 100+ piece puzzles it’s incredibly hard to see the individual pieces floating around. I really need some kind of magnifying glass; or the ability to see these small pieces more easily. I also hate that you can't work on sections prior to adding them to the actual puzzle.Worth the $7, but you can consistently find this game for around $2.50!

												The time 8:30 p.m.. the town.... well your town!  A military truck carrying numerous chemical agents speeds down main street.  The truck hits the pot hole Ms. McGreagor has been trying to get fixed for the last five years.  The truck's front right tire crashes into the pot hole then back up.  Causing the containers of waste to smash against each other.  Using quick thinking the driver of the truck manages to maintain control.. He mutters profanities to himself as he continues his trip into forest Cliche.  As he steers the truck over the unpaved roadways the veteran driver picks up a pack of the cheap cigarettes, the kind a man smokes when he dares cancer to infect his lungs.  Shaking the pack gently he flicks his wrist and a single cigarette appears.  putting the pack to his mouth he wraps his lips around the smoke.The man tosses the pack of cigarettes on the seat next to him and pop's out the truck's lighter.  Reaching down he yanks out the lighter and proceeds to light his smoke.  He takes notice of a large puddle ahead of him.  He speeds up like any driver does when they see a large puddle.  What he didn't realize was the puddle has loosened the dirt and as the three thousand pound truck cruises into the water, the dirt lets loose causing the truck to fall down the side of a rather steep hill.  The hill isn't really much of an issue, but the town's drinking water down below is.  The truck flips and the barrels of various chemicals crack open and pour directly into the drinking water.I think we all know what's about to happen.. that's right ZOMBIES...Pixel Puzzles Undeadz is a very niche title, it'll appeal to people who like puzzles, well extreme puzzles..  The game has a total of 13 puzzles, each of them being a rather ghoulish looking photo, with some type of undead or zombie.  In all honesty I wouldn't mind having a few of them as my screen savers or back ground pictures..  The pro's  -  Nice challenge to putting together puzzles, the pieces float around, and it can make finding and grabbing pieces rather difficult.  Combined together with a ticker which counts down untill a stream of zombies charge out and you'll be forced to switch your attention to killing them with your soldier..Interesting art work,A main menu minigame.Easy but grindy achievementsThe con'sThe pool pieces have a knack for picking up the wrong piece. (You'll always pick up the next left most piece in the puzzle.)  Which makes getting your corners together quite bothersome, even grabbing a single piece can be troublesome especially on the puzzles with the smaller pieces..The main menu minigame is repetitive and necessary if you want to complete the achievements (will take at bare minimum an hour and a half to get just the 6 associated with the main menus game)I wouldn't recommend this title to everyone, while I had a lot of fun with it, I can imagine other people may not find the fun in putting together puzzles, even the added benefit of the zombies crashing through the barricade and eating your soldier may not be enough excitement for some.  I'd suggest watching some videos and doing some research before you actually plunker down your money.  This way you'll be fully informed on whether or not you want to make the purchase or not.			"

												Best game of the series! I first played Pixel Puzzles: Japan and fell in love so I bought this one. This game is a strictly BETTER. The developers have added a save puzzle feature (yes finally!), overlay feature (to help you solve a puzzle IF you need it) a mini game for the main menu (with steam achievements) and of course a completly  new twist -> try to complete a puzzle while zombies run at your characater and you have to defend yourself. Now this game has a lot of negative reviews - why? - because it is not obvious to all players that you HAVE THE OPTION TO TURN OFF THE ZOMBIE INVASION and solve your puzzle in peace :) I highly recommend it!

												Can't decide between puzzle or zombie survival to play next? What if I said you don't need to choose? It's either incredibly stupid, or incredibly clever. Either way, it's incredible!What's it all about? It's basically jigsaw puzzles with an undead theme to the pictures you have to assemble. To make things more interesting, it's also a zombie survival game. I can see the eyes popping out of your head in disbelief. It actually works surprisingly well. While you try to put together your jigsaw puzzle, you also have to keep an eye on the path at the bottom of the screen, ensuring the little man down there survives the zombie attacks. If he dies you have to restart the puzzle. He's only armed with a few bullets and grenades, but if you can assemble some pieces you'll be able to buy some more ammo soon enough.Freaky, huh?If that wasn't enough to lift your eyebrows clear off your face, there's a 'horde' timer as well. If you're fast enough with earlier puzzles you can avoid these, but later, bigger puzzles will see you defending against numerous zombie hordes. They can be easy, but distracting; yet it helps mix up the gameplay elements and stops you from falling asleep. Often you can get by letting the horde build up at a barricade, then set a tripwire bomb on all of them at once. Some might prefer the simple pleasure of a jigsaw puzzle without the additional complications - if this is you, you might want to steer clear of this game.The puzzles themselves are a mixed bag. Some are easy, others are made needlessly hard by having too much of the image one colour or texture. They're passable, but none of the images really jumps out at me as a favourite. The accompanying background music wasn't bad though, it has a good survival feel to it.Speaking of survival, it even has a minigame on the menu screen, where you must survive from a top-down perspective on a small patch of earth against zombies that continue to appear and attack from all sides. This game caps out at about 65 'menu zoms' on the screen at a time though, so it's kind of fun.Nothing like the threat of a zombie horde to make you jigsaw hard and fast! Worth getting just for the unique gaming experience.			"

												A fairly interesting twist on a classic game style. Decaying Logic have a series of these jigsaw games, each featuring a different theme. The theme for this one being a zombie apocalypse. They managed to incorporate the theme into the jigsaws by creating a tower-defense mini-game of sorts at the bottom of the puzzle. The aim is that you have to complete the jigsaw, but also keep your little character alive. You buy ammo and defenses with money you accumulate by placing pieces of the puzzle in the right places. If you fail to keep your character alive, you lose.This makes for an interesting twist on an otherwise quite relaxing genre of game. You need to manage your resources properly and make sure you are solving the puzzle fast enough for you to keep a steady amount of money in the bank for defenses. That added pressure can actually make the game more intense. Especially when you start getting to the later puzzles. There are 19 puzzles in total, ranging from 5 different levels of difficulty. Anyone who has played any of the others in the series will already know what the structure is like. The more difficult the level of puzzle is, the less of them there are in that level. For example, You will start with 6 easier puzzles to complete, then 5 slightly harder ones, then 4 harder ones again, then 3 then a big final one to complete.I quite enjoyed the uniqueness to this one, as from what i can see, the others in the series are pretty standard. With that said, this whole theme may be a little tedious for those who just want to relax and solve the puzzle in their own time. The art in this game is interesting, and a few of them actually made me think. There are certain scenarios that aren't really highlighted in zombie apocalypse stories and some of the art pieces in this, while a tad questionable, actually made me wonder (or just straight up say ""oh, that's messed up"").In terms of achievements, this one has a few that are quite tedious. Along with the puzzles, there is a main menu mini-game that involves you playing as your little character. Zombies home in from all angles and your aim is to just survive as long as you can. The tediousness in the completion of this game lays here. You have to 1) survive 60 minutes in that main menu mini-game and 2) kill an overall of 5,000 zombies in the main menu mini-game. Which, alas. Is mind numbing. I would go into details for tips and tricks for these achievements, but honestly, as there is not many guides on this game i am actually  tempted to just create one. So check for a guide if you need help, if not feel free to ask.All in all it was fun! It stressed me out a little and i would be lying if i said i wasn't looking forward to starting another one in the series that is less stressful.But still, it was an interesting one in the series and i would recommend it to anyone that wants a classic jigsaw game with a bit of a twist.TL;DR : A fun jigsaw puzzle game with a bit of a twist, definitely too try if you want something a little more unique that will put a bit of pressure on. But if you'd prefer to relax and solve the puzzles in your own time, maybe try another in the same series.			"

Pixel Puzzles: UndeadZ - 7/10Pixel Puzzles: UndeadZ is one of the Pixel Puzzles Collection and, as the title suggests, it's a Zombie themed variant.Gameplay is very simple, you have a puzzle to complete, so you have your central field where you can place the spare pieces floating on the upper, left and right side. The original challenge lies in the lower side, there's a road view from above with an underground exit on the left end and your character on the right end, behind a barricade. Some random zombie will crawl out of the underground, and at a certain time (when the timer reaches zero) there will be a horde of zombies coming out at you. So you can defend your barricade by shooting at them, throwing grenades, building more barricades, everything while you complete the puzzle!You will also gain some ingame credits when you place some random puzzle tiles in their right places, and they will allow you to buy ammos or barricades. However This zombie defense ""side-game"" can be disabled as in most advanced and difficult puzzles they can become quite annoying.Puzzles are divided in 5 difficulty levels with a decreasing number of puzzle each. Difficulty lies in the number of tiles and their dimension as well because the higher difficulty level brings smaller tiles. Besides, each puzzle set has tiles with their own shapes and harder difficulties bring more odd and irregular shapes. A small advise: play this game on the biggest screen you have.On a side note, as soon as you load the game there will be a minigame with zombies coming at you while you can shoot and throw bomb at them!The entire game is animated in 2d so I can't scream ""miracle"", yet it doesn't look bad anyways, and despite the game's title it doesn't look that pixellous.The soundtrack in the game is not that bad, and it's kind of dynamic as well as it will change pace and mood according to ""puzzle"" moments and ""horde"" moments. Unfortunately each level has one single track, so it becomes a bit boring after a while.An odd thing I've noticed is the difficulty in catching the floating tiles with your cursor because you will struggle with this operation as the cursor itself seems to be programmed to pick up anything but the highest and closest tile your pointing. I'm saying this because in the very last puzzle I didn't have this issue at all. I don't understand the reason for this choice which will cost you lots of time just to catch the desired tile while zombies are assaulting you (unless you've disabled them, of course)+++PROs+++ PUZZLE. A simple and relaxing puzzle game with a nice zombie assault diversion to increase the difficulty and make the game more active and challenging. MUSIC. Some nice track will be played during puzzle solving sessions and they also change pace according to the situations (regular situations and horde moments)---CONs--- CURSOR. For some odd reason the cursor seems intentionally glitchy as you will struggle to pick up the tile you're aiming while you will attract any other tile nearby. Pretty annoying. And in the final puzzle it's a totally absent issue. MUSIC.

												Pixel Puzzles Undeadz is one of the best in the series where you try and stay alive by killing Zombies whilst trying to complete Jigsaw Puzzles. It's really challenging, fun and the puzzles are graphically stunning. However, I can't recommend it and here is why.Pros:♦ Great Graphics (The Graphic design for each Puzzle is stunning)♦ Challenging yet fun Gameplay (Having to juggle between completing a Jigsaw Puzzle, Killing Zombies and Staying alive is really nice)♦ Nice number of weapon upgrades or completing x amount of the Puzzle (This is a nice reward based concept)♦ Great number of Puzzles (Not too many and not too few, about the right number)♦ Menu Zombie Kill Minigame is an awesome touch to the main menu (Though it's really hard and doesn't scale properly, by the time you kill 15 Zombies, it's really hard to stay alive no matter what you do)♦ Decent Number of relatively easy achievements (This is great as you don't really have to do anything special to get the achievements, the only problem is the main menu minigame achievements)♦ Graphically Stunning Steam Trading Cards (This is always a good addition to any Steam Game)♦ Decent Price (For the effort that goes into the graphic design of the Puzzles it is worth the price and the Zombie addition gives nice Gameplay)Cons:♦ No Cloud Save (This is terrible, if a game is on Steam and doesn't make use of this feature... then it shouldn't be on Steam for obvious reasons)♦ The Kill 5000 Menu Zombies Achievement is almost impossible (You have to kill all 5000 in one go, which sucks as I found killing 15 to be inbalanced enough)Overall, for a Jigsaw Puzzle Zombie Killing game, it mixes the two modes together nicely and has way more Pros then Cons. However, for the sole purpose of not having Cloud Storage, I recommend you do not buy this. This is because nowhere does it tell you it doesn't sync to cloud storage and for me, I beat 9 Puzzles and Re-installed Steam for whatever reason and none of my Saves for this game were there. Thus, for a game that takes a lot of time and effort to beat a Puzzle I don't really want to have to redo all 9 Puzzles that I had already completed. Therefore, even though it is a decent game, to save you the hassel of having to start over like I did, I wouldn't recommend it as it doesn't use Cloud Storage.			"

												I was admittedly dissapointed in this game after playing Pixel Puzzles: Japan. I really enjoyed that game as a relaxing game to play one or two puzzles before bed. I've always liked Jigsaw puzzles but my big problem here is that this game is not relaxing at all. First off the art of zombies and guys with guns isn't exactly the soothing imagery I want to look at while solving puzzles. Adding to that the art isn't even that good meaning the satisfaction that comes with finishing the puzzle isn't as great since the final product is usually just gross ,mediocre or both. Adding to that is an odd mini-game involving protecting a base while solving the puzzles. For people who wanted more of a 'game' this may be fun but for anyone looking to lay back and solve a puzzle this can be annoying, frustrating and in my case, outright ruin the game.I'm sure I sound like a cranky old man but I honestly cant recommend this as every thing I liked about the original PP is absent in this installment.

I appreciate the minigames within the puzzler, but admittedly prefer the zenlike PP:Japan game more.  That said, they provide a non-survival option so you can just do the puzzles, but to get all the achievements, prepare to 'nade 'zoms in puzzles (a little bit) and in the minigame - ALOT (think - carpal tunnel if you are my age (40+))			"

												As a second game in the series it does fix some problems the previous one (Japan) had.The pool with puzzle pieces is a bit bigger, which helps a little in the later stages where hundreds of tiny pieces are stacked on one another. The ""fishing"" for the pieces is still bad, often picking up everything but the one piece you are pointing at, but at least it's a little bit less broken than it was in Japan. It also tried differentiating the gameplay by making the player manage a soldier on the bottom of the screen while putting together the puzzle, setting up barricades, buying weapons and fending off the zombie attacks. It's not very well done and doesn't fit in the gameplay style, but it's just a gimmick you can turn off when you get bored or annoyed with it.That gimmick addition is also included in the menu, where you can really see how bad it is. Especially if you are going for the achievements, because to get them all, you will have to spend around two hours playing this mess of a shooter, all in one sitting, with no way to pause it.Speaking of which, just like in the previous game, there still is no option to save the progress of your puzzle and come back to it later, all of them, even the ones with hundreds of pieces have to be completed in one sitting.It's a little thing, but the settings also proved to be an annoyance, specifically the fact that they do not save your changes (it seems to be a theme for this game,) and if you don't want to play with the default levels of sound and in fullscreen, you'll have to change it every time you launch the game (fake sliders included.)As for music, I can't say much about it. It very well may be good (It is the only game in the series you can buy soundtrack of) but I quickly got annoyed by the zombie moans and grunts in the background, so I've turned it all off and listened to my own music.Overall, by comparing it to the Pixel Puzzles Japan (which got negative review from me) it is decent enough to make me consider giving it better score (if you ignore achievement hunting, and look at the core gameplay only,) if it wasn't for one thing, which happens to be the most important: The puzzles themselves. It's all a matter of taste, but frankly speaking most of them (excluding just one, maybe two) are just ugly and/or disgusting.No matter how many things it fixes (which isn't that much in this case anyway,) I can't find myself recommending jigsaw puzzles with visuals like these.

												In a desperate search for jigsaw puzzle game on Steam that will fulfill my new found love for jigsaws, I've stumbled upon discount for Pixel Puzzles: UndeadZ. Me, being a lover of all things puzzle and zombies thought it's a winning combination.Turns out, nah.Pixel Puzzles: UndeadZ has two modes: first one can be labeled as survival, second one as peaceful mode. Survival mode lets you control soldier in a topdown perspective shooting aproaching zombies that shamble from left to right, while at the same time you're putting the pieces together. This mode let you buy additional equipment by earning Zombucks (zombie money) everytime you put the piece at the right place. In a way, it makes jigsaw puzzle game a bit tense, which is exactly the opposite of what I want and need when I do puzzles, but if you're into something competitive, there you go.  Peaceful mode makes you put pieces together and unlock additional puzzles (think classic). You start at level 1 with your puzzles consisting of 60 pieces. As you progress, you get more and bigger puzzle sets. There are several severe problems with this game. Problem No. 1 lies in the complete lack of customization of puzzles: pictures are 'glued' to number of bits, so if you like a certain motif, you'll only be able to play with it in its default cutout - you can't play 60 bits puzzle in 112 bits mode.Also, there's no rotation, puzzle shapes are odd and if you're into something more traditional, you will not appreciate this contemporary approach. Puzzle pictures unfortunately look amateurish and lack the interesting motifs that make you comeback for some more.Additional drawbacks for me are 'floating pieces' (check the trailer) and pretty ugly UI and menu solutions.Would I reccomend it? If you can grab Tabletop Simulator, do it - they have new jigsaw mode that lets you pick your own pictures and number of pieces. If you decide to get this one, wait for a heavy discount. I certainly can't recommend this game at its current price. P.S. Their time tracking is appearantly bugged, I haven't played for only 24 minutes.			"

Can you finish the puzzle before a horde of zeds eat your spleen?It's still a casual game but offers more challenge than 'Pixel Puzzles: Japan'Also there's a top-down mini-game in the menu system that adds a little bonus game play.

												Puzzle game about Undead - Nice pictures, nice idea with the menu action, nice music... and nice pictures (didn't I say it already?). Though I wouldn't let kids play it as some pics are really graphic.If you need a break from killing Nazi zombies or Tanks or Necromorphs or demons or any pet from Horzine or people with headcrabs on the head or... well, you get the picture: that game is perfect (along with the other Pixel Puzzles).It's a jigsaw game. The more you advance in the game, more puzzles with a high number of pieces will be available. Here, you have an action mode you can play: zombies are assaulting your position, kill them, place traps, thanks to the money you'll find behind some jigsaw pieces. Else, the main core is the same: puzzles pieces floating in the water, with different forms.Anyway, you can play in the menu: it's a survival minigame: kill incoming zombies!Pixel Puzzles UndeadZ is probably the more elaborated game in the series, due to the action added.

Teal DeerDevelopers: Decaying Logic Publishers: KISS LtdInitial release: June 2016Genre: Puzzles, Action #Worth/NotWorth: #Worth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationTo be honest, I'm not entirely sure if I remember how I came to own this game. I'm going to assume it was through a bundle. Nonetheless, I'm glad I discovered it. This is much like the other themed puzzle games here on steam; this one obviously depicting zombies in some state of affair or at times the survivors of an assumed but not often eluded to zombie apocalypse. But this one has a twist that I think sets it apart. A TIMER *gasps surround the room in a cacophonous roar that affronts your ears and causes them twitch with fright searching for its source. (Note: This can be turned off should you just want a normal puzzle solving experience.) The timer counts down to a zombie horde that will attack your base. In between waves, stray zombies will show up to keep you on your toes. What makes this more than just a timer is that must actually shoot the zombies yourself. There is only one lane so its not super demanding but you must WASD around and firing a rifle and throwing grenades allowing yourself enough time to solve the puzzle. This makes the puzzle more engaging and frantic as in true survival games resources are scarce. You'll run out of bullets and be forced to solve more of the puzzle in order to get more money to buy more ammo at the shop. There are also mines among other explosives at your disposal that effectively rise in price as the more effective they are at exacting death the more expensive they will be. It may not be the most original idea but it is an interesting and novel idea to say the least.Follow my curation for more "

My playtime: 11.7h (based on steam).Grindy Achievement: Yes (8 achievements; you need to play a super boring and grindy minigame for 1.5h+ straight without break).Optional Achievement: Yes (11 achievements).Difficult Achievement: No.Developer Response: No (last response is in 11 Sep 2016 and that's only for promoting their new game).IntroPixel Puzzles: UndeadZ is a zombie themed jigzaw puzzle game. Besides finishing the puzzle, you can start the game with ""zombie mode"" where you have to shoot zombies which will come to your base when you are doing the puzzle. There are 19 puzzles in total which is ranging from 60 to 350 pieces.MusicsThe music has a horror feel which makes it perfect for the zombie theme. The main menu has a strong guitar tune while the in game music has a super low tone in it. When the horde of zombies come out, the music will change into a more passionate one.GraphicsHonestly, i don't really like the splash screen and the in game menu. Both of them looks bland to me. However, the others look okay to me. Although the puzzle images are zombie themed (which tends to have a gore element to it), it's not really that bad (unless you have blood phobia of course).The gameAlthough i said that there are 19 puzzles in total, you need to unlock most of them first. You'll start with the easy ones and as you finish more puzzle, a higher level will be unlocked which will unlock a higher tier of puzzles with more puzzle piece.If you choose to go in zombie mode, the zombie will come out from the bottom part of the screen. You'll know when there's one from the scream, although you can constantly keep an eye on the screen to make sure nothing pass through. There also will be a timer on the bottom of the screen which will give a countdown for ""zombie hordes"". When the timer goes to 0, a lot of zombies will come out which will make you have to switch your focus to the zombies. You can always shoot the zombies while doing the puzzle if you want, but whenever i did that, the game suddenly slows down (read: lag) by itself.You'll obtain some money when you place some puzzles in the right place. These money can be used to buy ammo, traps, claymore, fortress, or even puzzle hint which will overlap the completed puzzle image with the puzzle. I honestly find it annoying because i hardly can see the difference between the hint and puzzle pieces which i have placed correctly. If you don't play the ""zombie mode"", you can use hint as many as you want without paying anything.If you place the piece in the correct place, the piece will automatically register itself to that place and can't be moved anymore. This can help when you don't know where the puzzle should be placed to. You just have to click and spam all the fields that you think is the right place until the piece fit itself. This also made me broke my mouse.Speaking of pieces, the puzzle piece will float around the puzzle ""board"" which can have its color changed by pressing the (H) icon. However, the puzzle piece, especially on higher levels, will be hard to select because of its size. You'll keep on selecting the piece that you don't want and because both selected piece and the piece beside it will be moved to a random location when you release your mouse button, you have to be careful when selecting and deselecting the piece.Besides the puzzle, there is also a minigame in the main menu to shoot zombies. However, it's really boring and useless.Pros:- 19 puzzles, 60-350 puzzle piece- Pieces will fit by itself when it's placed in a correct placeCons:- Difficulty to select pieces on higher puzzle piece- Boring minigameConclusionPixel Puzzles: UndeadZ is a puzzle game where you have to shoot zombies when you're doing the puzzle. You can always choose to not have the zombies in the game though.Should you buy this game?Yes.That's if you like puzzle game. However, if you are an achievement hunter or care about your average completion rate, you might want to skip it (or buy other pixel puzzles game) since the last few achievements are so boring to do.

												This is a pretty solid extension on their Pixel Puzzles: Japan title, which is pretty zen at its core. This one aims to add time pressure with the additional mechanic of have to fight off ever-spawning zombies as you solve the puzzles. While you can turn this off if you just want the puzzles, you might as well play the first title if that's all you're after. The additional mechanic makes it harder and adds a bit of impetus to solving them more quickly, although it's usually pretty easy to stay ahead of the zombies, particularly with well placed grenades.Achievements are all pretty straight-forward if you like them, the only one that is really just a grind is killing all the menu zombies, which needs to be done in one sitting rather than over multiple sessions.Overall I liked it, although it feels like a fairly small increment over the previous title.

												Barely recommended for the puzzle.No recommendation for the action game.The action game doesn't add anything to the puzzling, other than distract you every now and then. For me it takes away the ""zen"" experience of doing a puzzle and just adds some cheap action to it.Also, the programmer seems to have never seen a timer. Seconds run from 60-1 and single digits don't have a leading 0. So you get times like 4:60 or 2:2. Not game breaking, of course, but looks stupid.The puzzle game is not well done. Pieces on top won't be grabbed first. It almost seems random. You can't connect puzzles outside their final position. No bins to sort pieces into. Very basic.Get it for cheap if you like some puzzling with comical zombie pictures.			"

												The programming is godawful (see ""menu slowdown""), while the non-pausable zombie murder minigame with its related achievements should be called the Unjolly Carpal Tunnel Challenge.As for the main game, timed puzzle games are a bad idea to begin with, and this adds an additional awkward defensy aspect to it that solely forcefully distracts from the actual puzzling without being any fun.Fortunately you can play the puzzle mode (complete with its curiously shaped pieces) without those distractions as well. That's about the only way to make a human being voluntarily play this for more than ten minutes.It's so shoddy that after my initial few minutes of playing, I immediately uninstalled it, and only reinstalled it when asked by a friend if I could reproduce some of the many bugs they were plagued by.(They don't even save any of your game options. Just none. It's that sad. Anybody can program better data retention in a few minutes.)			"

												This game is a lot of fun, until about halfway threw. It is basically completing a jigsaw puzzle while managing the zombie waves coming at your avatar shooteron the bottom of the screen. Its easy and somewhat casual fun, not like a serious shooter or puzzle game. Each zombie takes three shots to pop, the waves are easy to take out, the weapons don't upgrade or change.Once I got down to the last four puzzles, it did seem to get a bit harder, but then the technical issues that were minor became impossible to surpass. For one, I couldn't manage to pick up the piece I was clicking on ever floating in the ether along the edges. The pieces that picked up when I clicked directly on one would be seemingly random. The edges of each piece somewhat appear as though they fit together, but often I was just throwing pieces at each other to see what stuck because some patterns were awkward.Overall though, I'd recomend it. The begining of it was a blast. If someone were to make something like this, I'd recomend offering upgrade options and variations in the shooting survival part and making it easier to pick up specfic pieces .			"

												I went into this game not 100% sure what to think about it. Basically, you solve a puzzle while shooting zombies, and trying to finish the puzzle before the zombies can get to you. Money to buy ammo/traps/barricades is earned by putting pieces of the puzzle together.One of the first things I noticed, which may just be a personal bug, was that everytime I closed the game and reopened, it would reset my audio and video settings. Luckily, they are very easy to change, so it isnt a huge deal.The puzzles themselves are pretty nice. The art styles differ slightly in between puzzles, as well as the general tone of the puzzles themselves from silly to creepy. The puzzle pieces themselves also differ from puzzle to puzzle in shape. The pieces float around the edge which adds a little challenge when trying to put together the harder puzzles. Grabbing the piece you want gets difficult if there is a piece on top of it or under it, as it seems to guess which piece in the pile you were grabbing rather than tracking which one was clicked on. Not a huge deal as you can just pile the unwanted pieces somewhere on the board until you have room to toss them back in the water, or place them in the puzzle.The zombie shooting part isnt my favorite. It adds something of a timer to it since if you dont solve quickly, you run out of money to buy ammo, and when you run out of ammo you die eventually. That said, even on the hard puzzles, the zombies are no harder to kill than they are on the easy puzzles, so its more of a slight distraction while you puzzle solve. Its different at least.Overall, its a pretty good game. The puzzles are enjoyable, and while the shooting part isnt my favorite, it does grow on you after awhile (or did for me at least). The one bug Ive found isnt a major draw back, and doesnt really effect gameplay, so even with its faults, I still highly recommend it.			"

												This is a great puzzle game with some really original ideas, blending puzzles with action to keep your mind constantly switching from one to the other. Unfortunately, there's one really big problem: as you get to the higher levels, the pieces get smaller. On the second level, the pieces are about 1cm square. On the third level, they're so small you can barely see what's on them, so unfortunately this game quickly becomes unplayable.Great idea, poor execution.			"

												Pixel Puzzles: UndeadZ is a jigsaw puzzle game with the distraction of fending off zombies.  Instead of explaining what the heck a jigsaw puzzle is, I'm going to say what you need to know if you intend to play it right.Play it with a big screen, and with a little more brightness than you find necessary.  If your screen is smaller than 19"", you're going to have a hard time with the size of the puzzle pieces in the later puzzles.  Also, a lot of puzzles are dark, which becomes a pain in the butt when you are matching various colors of darkness.You can turn off the distracting zombies when solving puzzles.  The button to do so is to the right of the ""Go"" button.The menu mini game gives you infinite grenades, and can be thrown with the RMB.  This is how you get those pain in the butt survival achievements.To use power ups, such as the extra wall or the trip mine, you need to click and drag with the LMB to place them.  If you don't place them, you still pay for them, even though they don't get used.Expect each puzzle to take a long time (30min to +120min), and there is no 'save and quit' function to pause in the middle of a puzzle.  You can pause the game with the ESC key, but make sure to plan your games in advance.I do recommend it to those diehard puzzle game fans (like myself), but this game definitely isn't for everyone.  If the game could be paused and saved for later, I would say it would be a casual game.  Play it when you have a lot of time on your hands.			"

												I agree with the review of the current top rated comment. If anything, he understated the game's problems. If you want 100% achievements, not only do you have to play the world's worst minigame for a very long time, you have to do it flawlessly. If you die once, you have to start again. It's quite easy to die. They should have stuck with jigsaws.			"

												The game is fun but also frustating on the same time.Music is very very repeative and it never change. Which is very frustating and give me a headache.Puzzle pieces moves and goes over a different puzzle piece, which makes it very difficult to pick it up.If you try to pick a puzzle piece there is a high chance that you pick a different one instead.Only reason that this is time consuming is because you can not pickup the correct puzzle piece.Also you can just pickup a Puzzle piece and place it on the field and it might be ""Correct"", Even if it is impossible to know where the puzzle piece has to be and even when ur entire field is empty.You can kill zombies during puzzle mode which is easy but time consuming. You can also kill zombies in main menu which is borderlines useles. IF YOU PLAY WITHOUT ZOMBIES DURING PUZZLE MODE. You can keep pressing on the ""Results"" to see where every puzzle piece has to be. You can use this unlimited time.WHICH REALLY BREAKS THE GAME.I do not recommend this game at all. Rating: 1/10			"

												Pixel Puzzles: Japan had it's issues, which were not addressed in this game.  Namely the fact that all the pieces are floating in a pool, and if two or more pieces are floating around, the game seems to choose from a specific order which one you pick up.  If your like me and you prefer to do the border of the puzzle first, this may help with the top border, but the lower half becomes a hassle due to this mechanic.On top of this issue, they added zombies to make this game even more annoying.  You can thankfully do puzzles without the zombies, but there is another issue.  Some of these puzzles are just graphic, including one of what seems to be a female zombie giving birth to a baby zombie.I can not recommend this game to anybody but a hardcore zombie fan, and somebody who likes doing puzzles as well.And yes, I am fully aware that I've only done maybe 25 minutes of this game.  That was enough for one puzzle, with zombies, and going through the extras to see all the pics used for puzzles.			"

												I'm going to be somewhat lazy here, and rather than detail this game in its entirety like I normally would for a write-up, I'll instead refer you to my review for its predecessor, Pixel Puzzles: Japan. For the most part the basic premise for the two games is the same. Just replace all the Japanese references with zombie related stuff and you're pretty much covered as far as the fundamentals go. Read that and you'll be up to speed with the rest of where this review is going. Go on, it's cool, I can wait...OK, so you've read it and now you know what the deal is with that game, right?...You haven't read it, have you? Well screw you, buddy. I'm just gonna carry on like you have anyway, so there!So while the core concept and gameplay from the previous game is in tact, as well as giving the game a new zombie themed facelift, they've also added a new element into the mix - zombie defense. The jigsaw board and floating puzzle pieces are still there doing their thing, but now there's a second game being played out at the bottom of the screen as well.A little shotgun-wielding dude stands in a small barricaded area at the bottom right corner of the screen and can be moved around his tiny hidey-hole with WASD, while zombies appear from the left corner and shamble their way toward our hero. Using the Space bar to shoot or Q to toss grenades, you must fend off the threat and survive long enough to complete each puzzle. Ammo and grenades are limited, but can be restocked using currency collected from correctly setting pieces into the board. This currency can also be used to briefly reveal the finished picture within the puzzle board or to purchase additional barricades or claymores which can be placed in pre-set locations along the zombie track at the bottom of the screen to give yourself some additional breathing room. Which you'll need, because a timer is also counting down to a hoard rush that will need all your attention to fend off. So it's a jigsaw puzzle game mixed with some management elements and a little zombie-shooting action.I love that they didn't just rest on their laurels, but instead really made the effort to add something fresh to the series. But what I love even more is that it's optional and you can turn off the zombie defence stuff at any point if you're not in the mood for it and just want to put a picture together. To be honest, that's what I ended up doing after a few rounds. Don't get me wrong, it's a really nice, competent extra, and I appreciate it being there, but it just wasn't what I was looking for. I came for the basics, so I was happy enough with that.Otherwise, this is almost exactly the same game as PP: Japan, both good and bad. The pieces can still be a pain to rummage out from the pile, but at least they're now going towards some far more interesting pictures this time. Though, that said, they don't hold back, and even though they're only cartoony illustrations, I could easily see how people who get a little squeamish around gore would feel a bit touchy about this. But other than that, this is a nicely put together, fun little time killer that's as laid back or demanding as you want it to be, and I can't wait to play the rest in the series.... You still haven't read that previous Pixel Puzzles review, have you?... Well screw you, buddy!			"

As in, time limit to solve a jigsaw puzzle.Umm. No, 0/10. Bad idea.The menu minigame is also super basic yet they apparently want you to play it for an hour for an achievement, hahah, no...?Really there's not a lot to like here, I dunno why I played it.

												Hate it.     Having to deal with the floating pieces where it is next to impossible to get the one you want is frustrating enough, but with Pixel Japan you could drag them into piles sorted by texture to not have to deal with it.  Here you have to place pieces in right place right off as you don't have enough time to sort them all.  The continual diversion of attention to fend off zombies is ludricrous.   Put a ******* timer and award gold/silver/bronze.   Don't make me redo the puzzle from scratch.   Stupid beyond belief.			"

												The Game itself is nice, you can choose to either way play with Zombies our without. I personally thought some of the pictures are actually quiet creepy. The only annoying thing which I found so far was that you can't save the puzzles. (You can do that in the other ones like Birds and Anime). And also some of the achievements. For the fact that you have to play the Main Menu Game, it has horrible controls and you just got 1 life. The Game itself is nice, especially if you love jigsaw puzzles and Zombies. But it is hard to perfect.Therefore I give it still a thumbs up but I would only recommend getting the game if you don't mind perhaps not to complete all the achievements.Tipp: If you don't like the Zombie Attack during the Puzzling you can turn that off by clicking at the Puzzle with the Z which is crossed.

												Some things really should not mix; zombie games and jigsaw puzzle games are definitely among them.As a jigsaw game, it's competent, though the fact I seem to have tremendous difficulty picking up the piece I actually want to makes it incredibly irritating.As a zombie shooter, it's just dull, especially the minigame on the menu, which you have to play to excess if you want all the achievements.It (the menu game) isn't even that difficult when you realise you have unlimited grenades, which not only explode on contact, instantly killing any zombie in range, but they're also much easier to aim than the rifle.  Unfortunately this is counteracted by the fact the character has a throwing arm like a wet noodle, and that the explosions they generate are smaller than you think they are.  Once you get that figured out, it's pretty much impossible for anything to touch you, and it quickly becomes incredibly boring.Take out the zombie game part, and the puzzle game would be better.  Take out the puzzle game part, and the zombie shooter would be good for maybe three minutes before you get bored and never look at it again.			"

												My playtime is not what Steam shows because I idled for cards for 8-9 hours and after that played the game. I am saying this because if you're after the achievements and don't want to waste 17 hours they don't take that much time. More like 8-ish. It's a really nice puzzle game with good uality that I got for free and I might buy the other Pixel Puzzles games if discounted a lot. Keep in mind that you might lose the button on your keyboard that is above ""A"" and left to ""W"". The one in uestion is used a lot. That is if you want to get all achievements. Right now the game is 80% off and if you like puzzles then what are you still waiting for? Click that ""Add to Cart"" button and give Gabe some cash moneys or save your wallet and don't buy it.			"

												You can do it the easy way or the hard way.Start up the game, and you are thrown into a mini-game on the menu screen.  You have a survivor with a gun and bombs.  It's top down.  Run around shooting/blowing up zombies.  Your bombs are unlimited.  You get 1 life, and the zombies kill you if they touch you.The main game has a large ""table"" to put puzzle pieces onto.  Around the top and side borders, the puzzle pieces are floating around.  Click and drag the piece to the table.  Put your puzzle together.  That's the easy method.  The hard method has your little survivor on thee bottom border and a stream of zombies coming in from the left.  You have a barricade and limited ammunition.  The zombies will break down the barricade, eventually.  You get funding from fitting puzzle pieces.  You use the funding to buy more ammunition, barricades, traps, etc to fight off the zombie onslaught.  It makes the game rather frantic as you're hurrying to grab a piece to fit so you can keep fighting.The nice thing is, if you don't like the frantic mess, you can always play without the zombie onslaught.

												would I recommend this game to people who don't care about achievement?if this was aronud 3,50€, yes.would I recommend this game to completionists?hell no, this is the worst!I usualy show the good and bad of each games, but this is a puzzle game, so there's not a lot to review on that aspect.(but if you really want me to review this part of the game: the puzzles can be completed)what I can review though, is the rest AKA the zombie minigame.while playing the puzzle, the minigame is fine, it's easy and just acts as a diversion from the puzzle, plus, you can play without this minigame, which is great!the minigame in the main menu though? it sucks.you have to choose between using your gun, which kill zombies in 3 hits, and grenades, which kills zombies in one hit...and you have unlimited grenades...in other words, the minigame is just you standing in the middle of the screen spamming grenades at zombies""but blü, this isn't the main game, who cares?""completionists like me.this minigame is tied to achievements...and they're he worst!for instance, the achievement that wants you to survive in the minigame (which, again, is just spamming grenades) for 1 HOUR.and that's not the only one, there's another one that wants you to kill 5000 zombies IN ONE RUN (I've spent my entire day killing more than 5000 zombies in one game session, and it didn't work, so you definitely have to kill 5000 in one run!).then, in other news, the options don't get saved, meaning that the game goes back to fullscreen and max sound/volume everytime you launch the game again!so all in all, the puzzles are cool, but the price is way to high for me to recommend it.and if you're a completionist, I highly recommend you avoid this game.

 #LittleLycanOnSteam   Hello Reader  , If You Are Reading This Review, Don't Keep Your Hopes High As It's Not A Review As Such But My Feelings About Any Games Including This One. I May Have Played Or Not Played This Game, Still I Will UpVote It As I Know How Much Efforts, Blood And Sweat Is Used To Make Any Sort Of Game, Irrespective To Big Or Small, Branded Or Small Devs. I Personally Do Not Have Time To Play All Games, So I Just Idle Them, No Offence, Just For The Cards But I Know That The Game Is Worth Shot Even If Not Worth Our Time As It Requires Tremendous Efforts To Make Even The Simplest Of All Games. God Bless All The Game Developers, You Guys Are Great Because You Guys Make Games And Games Are Life For Gamers And Stressbuster For The Working People. Thank You!- #LittleLycanOnky #January2017			"

												I thought this might be cool, but it isn't all that fun. the puzzle pictures are lame, one is kinda sexualized which is stupid, starting the puzzle is a puzzle as you have to click GP button which isn't even an obvious button as it is just looks like a logo and happens to be next to some other logo button. While playing I died because the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wouldn't reload and then an achievement popped up blocking the view of my character and and he wouldn't shoot. Got it in bundle of stupid games so whatever. If I feel like doing a puzzle while being attacked by zombies, I will do a puzzle on east hastings on acid at 3 AM.			"

												It's a puzzle game.No, wait...It's a zombie-shooter game.No, wait...It's a zombie-shooter puzzle game!Pixel Puzzles: UndeadZ is definitely the most unique game I've played to date. Having to kill zombies while working on a puzzle can be quite nervewracking, on the flip side my puzzle completion speed has greatly increased. There is an option to turn off the zombie killin' and only play the puzzle aspect of the game, which is great when I want a more relaxing gaming experience.PROS:-Artwork-Music-Zombie Killin'-Puzzles-100% Achievements (Some achievements are a little grindy)CONS:-Sometimes when trying to select a certain puzzle piece, you wind up picking up every single piece around it except the one you're actually clicking on. This can be particularly annoying especially when you're getting swarmed by zombies.BOTTOM LINE:Overall, it's a lot of fun & worth the price!			"

												This game is as the name suggests, about puzzeling.UndeadZ combines this with a small zombie defense gameplay.If you don't like staying alive while making puzzles, there's an option to turn the zombie defense off.This way you can enjoy puzzeling without the zombies.I'd like an option to save during your puzzle, hopefully this makes it into the next pixel puzzles game.I also played Pixel Puzzles Japan and it was nice too, but Japan had more difficult flowers-all-over-the-place puzzles.Grab them when they are on sale if you want to puzzle a bit.

												Surprisingly, I really enjoyed this game.  Puzzles -The puzzles are fairly easy to complete and look very nice.-The feels I had when I completed the first one was great. Music -I put my own music on, as I felt it got repetitive. Main-Menu Game -It's a neat little top-down shooter. Just spam Q - easiest way to kill the Zombies. Should you buy it? -I'm gonna be honest here. I would recommend only buying this on sale.			"

												I have only completed 2 puzzles so I do not have a huge base of experience from which to speak yet,  However, it certainly has been interesting to fight off zombies with one hand while placing puzzle pieces with the other.  Thus far - again only have 60 pieces floating around - it seems the piece selection issue that plagued Pixel Puzzle: Japan is corrected.If you can find a coupon, or buy this game on sale it is an original concept implemented with a simple user-interface that allows for maximum game play and minimum hassles.

												Really enjoyed this game.  I'll ocassionaly do online jigsaw puzzles, just to relax, as they are mostly mindless entertainment.  This game takes that activity to the next level.  The built in threat of the timer (not to finish the puzzle, but to get zerged by zeds) adds an element of suspense that's never been part of my jigsawing experience.  Also a great game if you're after a lot of quick and easy badges.  Wish there were more puzzles available (and there really needs to be a pause button for the menu game) but other than that, this game provides quite a few hours of pleasurable entertainment.			"

												Keep calm and kill 5k Zombies!Or: Don’t you dare to drink anything for the next 1h and 40min… o.oI never thought Pixel Puzzle was gonna get any meaner after they forced us to turn the pieces. Noooooo, we really had to kill loads of Zombies! It worked fine for me though – after I read some of the guides, telling me to use those grenades and don’t bother about shooting. I even got the Achievement right away after that. Maybe I should have done it in the middle of the night though. I never thought it would take THAT long! So beware: You might not be able to drink or eat or sleep! BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO KILL ZOMBIES!After an hour it started to feel pretty relaxing – almost meditative – to me :DApart from all the killing – I think this is my least liked Pixel Puzzle. I know, that Zombies are not pretty. They are not supposed to be. But they were bloody ugly! (Ha, got that one, right? :D)Maybe I should have checked those pictures before :] All in all it was (as always) a nice idle puzzle. Can’t say anything about the music department, my sound was turned off :D "

												If there was a neutral review option, I would have selected that.  It's hard to strongly recommend the game as many times the selection of puzzle pieces was very frustrating.  It sometimes seems like the game is determined to give you every piece near the mouse pointer EXCEPT the one you are trying to click on.  You would think that the top piece under the tip of the mouse pointer would be selected, but this isn't the case.  Often a piece under the piece you are targeting will be selected, other times, a piece adjacent to the piece you are targeting gets selected.  Very frustrating.I like the concept of fighting off a zombie attack while putting together a puzzle and it was fun for the first few puzzles.  After the trouble selecting pieces started, I abandoned the zombie defense and switched to plain puzzle assembly to get through to the end.TL,DR; Wait for a sale then pick it up cheap.  It has some fun to it, but the frustrating piece selection detracts from your enjoyment.			"

												Fun time-waster, a puzzle game in nearly the most literal sense of the word... lol. It's a puzzle, with zombies, how could you go wrong? Unless you don't like puzzles. Or zombies. Then, well, you could go very wrong.In all seriousness, besides being a puzzle game, there is a fun little extra to it. As you piece your puzzle together, you have a simple top-down shooting game happening at the same time. ( It can be turned off if it becomes too distracting.) Mind you, the shooting aspect is rather simple... An occasional zombie shows up, use your keyboard to line him up and shoot him before he breaks down your barricade. At regular timed intervals, a large group of zombies will show up in waves... There's a small sense of depth there, and things can go wrong. As you put the puzzle together, you'll randomly earn cash to stock up on bullets and grenades, even the ability to add more sections of barricades. The shooting part is really very simple, but I'll hand it to the developers- it's a small thing like this that can add quite a bit of fun to the game. It's really only towards the end of the game, (as you complete tiers of the puzzles, the puzzles become broken down into more pieces,) that the shooting game can lead to death. (game over if your soldier dies.) Even then, your soldier dying is usually more based on a combination of bad luck, (not getting pieces laid down that earn you money to restock,) and bad timing. Again though, if the shooting aspect of the game isn't your cup of tea, it can be turned off. Kudos again to the developers for not turning off achievements if a player does so... You'll still earn an achievement for finishing the puzzle regardless of whether you choose to participate in playing the shooting game aspect.Before selecting the puzzle, you can also enjoy a game of shooting zombies, as well... Even achievements for playing this part of the game.Perhaps the only major negative I've found is grabbing pieces from the floating current of water that surrounds the top and sides of the board can occasionally be finnicky... It's not HORRIBLE, but I've certainly had my share of trying to grab a piece (usually in the higher piece count boards,) only to have to keep grabbing several times before landing the one i was trying to get... It's rarely been anything more than a slight annoyance.Overall, this quickly became my favorite time-waster/ ""I only have 15 minutes to play something,"" game for quite some time. The shooting part was a pleasant surprise, but I've been known to turn it off to just enjoy putting together the puzzle without the distraction.It should be noted that while very cartoony in its art style, a couple puzzles may not be entirely appropriate for the ""young'uns,"" depending on just what your level of tolerance is in regards to what you allow your kids to view.For a jigsaw puzzle game, it's a ton of fun. I enjoy the zombie apocalypse stuff as much as the next guy, so when I found this little gem, combining zombies and puzzles, I couldn't have been happier. Currently on sale for $2.37... At that price, you should be jumping on it!			"

												Considering how I haven't put together a puzzle since I was a kid, this game was a good, satisfying time filler.  However, if you are looking for a challenging time management type of experience, this game will not fulfill you.  It is pretty easy to realize the most efficient and easy strategy for dealing with the zombie part of it.Overall, get this game when it's on sale for just a few bucks.			"

												If you thought Jigsaw Puzzles were meant to be relaxing, think again.  This game brings the stress of not being able to find the right piece, and thinking it may be lost under the couch somewhere, whilst adding the stress of a zombie shooter.Although going down to the local goodwill store and then drawing your own pieces to replace the ones that didn't come in the box can be fun, it's nowhere near as fun as this game :)++ Will Stress Out Again :)			"

												Interesting fun little puzzle game. The zombies as a sort of timer made it interesting, I liked it.Major gripes:-It is practically impossible to pick up the puzzle piece you want-Which pieces give you money is random, so you might get 4 coins in a row or put in 6 pieces without a coin; it can kind of screw you over when you're low on cash for ammo-You have to do each puzzle in one sitting, which kind of sucks, because the later ones take a long time. You can pause, but you would have to leave the game open-The menu game achievements... just why. I spent an hour and 6 minutes got to 3300-something trying to get the 5000 kill achievement, only to have my mom call me and I died trying to lower the volume on my pc. And so I had to start over. Another 1 hour 39 minutes to get that achievement. Put in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pause button.			"

												The puzzles are fairly difficult to put together which is a bonus and the difficulty get progressively hard, however selecting the right puzzle piece under your cursor is impossible and when you get into the fourth level it's too annoying to finish. After the third level there are basically 2-4 layers of tiles floating and the hit box for the tiles are about the size of 4 tiles so you always select the same one. I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this game until the tile select is fixed.			"

When you have smaller amount of pieces it is ok, only ugly but later when number of pieces increase it make it very very hard to determine where piece belong and you ended up looking for place where this piece belonge by its shape not actual image that is on it, so yeah there is that :/ If this effect could be turned off should be much much better than it is now.On a plus side it is very simpel game so when you doing soem havy computation on you workstation you can paly it no problem while waiting fore results :)			"

This game's got everything good and bad that that other Pixel Puzzles 1 game's got from the possibly-hard-to-click puzzle pieces that annoyingly float on water to the options settings that reset each restart of the game to the lack of a save feature during a puzzle. It's essentially just a reskin. What this one's got has more bad though because of the inclusion of also trying to be a tower defense game during a puzzle, which does a poor job at even that.The only real difference here is the theme, number of puzzles to piece together which there are a bit fewer of, and that tower defense thing.The tower defense thing is probably the worst thing included in this game as the entire premise itself is absolutely pointless and I think it just tries to get into the zombie fad which only maybe successfuly does with just the theme. The game could have seriously been better off with just having that zombie theme instead of having a very unrewarding & cumbersome extra game you've got to do.It's supposed to be that you're to use a character at the bottom of the screen to defend yourself from zombies that endlessly spawn every 20 seconds or so while at the same time you're trying to solve a jigsaw puzzle. There's a timer as well and after that timer runs out then zombies will start to spawn at a much faster almost as if a sudden wave or hoarde of just suddenly arrived and started pouring in. Some of those faster spawning zombies take a few more hits to kill but they're still easy to deal with. After the hoarde's been dealt with the timer resets and this process will continue again & again until you solve the current puzzle. You've got a barricade to start with at the very beginning of each puzzle and a relatively big space between you and the zombie side. You defend your barricade and yourself from zeds using a rifle that's limited to 30 bullets, a max of 3 grenades, placeable claymores, and extra barricades which all can be recharged and bought via the little shop thing during the puzzle itself. Currency is earned by getting closer to putting the jigsaw puzzle together. Unless you're just an incredibly bad shot, which is hard to be in this game, the grenades and claymores are absolutely useless; practically all of the zombies just come one at a time anyway so there's no reason to use anything else but the rifle and the bullets are incredibly cheap themselves. These zombies are pretty slow and even if they managed to get close enough to damage your barricade they take a long time to destroy it and longer so because it's way more than likely you'll be killing zombies faster than they'll be getting close to your barricade. If by some miracle they manage to destroy all your barricades you'll be dead from one hit and if that happens, your character dies. If that happens the canvas empties out and you've got to piece the entirety of the current puzzle all over again from the beginning. A complete restart.If nearly all of your shots haven't been missing, which again isn't hard, then you'll be left with nearly way more than enough money by the end of the jigsaw puzzle which further proves how useless every other buyable item is.So it's the exact same game as that other Pixel Puzzles 1 game with the only real downer this time is that piece of unnecessary wad that you're supposed to fiddle with while you try to put a puzzle together.I couldn't get very into most of the artwork & music so I don't know for sure what to say about those.Side-note: This game's notorious for having a particular Steam achievement where you're supposed to sit through a mini-game on the main menu for way over an hour without pausing, which isn't even fun on its own.

												Kind of ""Every Game Needs A Zombie Mode!"" ... besides this one is a rather funny one ;)Maybe not worth 7€, but getting it in sale could be a great deal, if you like traditional puzzles and jigsaws.			"

												Ok puzzlegame, the grab-from-the-river mechanic can be a little annoying if you play with attacking zombies. That's especially the case in the levels where you rarely pick the piece you were aiming for. This seems deliberate, btw, because it is not the case in all levels.			"

												It's a fun game, but the one thing I don't understand is, what's the point of having the zombies on while you put together the puzzle? There's no achievement for having it on, but there's plenty of achievements for playing the menu mini game. It literally makes no sense to me. Fail sauce.			"

Interesting idea, terrible execution.- Hitboxes of the pieces are off: Every piece has an hitbox ""aura"" that makes selecting the one you actually want a nightmare;- Pieces don't attach to other pieces: I see clearly they fit together but cannot turn them into a ""block""- Pieces moving constantly is a strange design choice that caused more problems like:  - Pieces getting stuck;  - Layers not being respected: you click the one one top and get the one on the bottom;- If you click somewhere in the pieces area, those pieces ""get out of your way"", they reappear somewhere else, but this plus the hitbox and layer problems cause you to select the wrong piece and when you drop it, the piece you actually want is moved somewhere else;- Crappy menu minigame + achievements that make you play the minigame for an hour straight (it does not even have a pause button) and kill 5000 zombies, so after that one hour, add about 40 minutes more.
