												Tower defense at its best. Being able to place your towers in such a way that it forces the baddies to take longer paths is extremely enjoyable and challenging.Key features:- Block baddies just as they're getting near your cores, forcing them to re-route.- Bounce a train of baddies back and forth between two paths by repeatedly opening one and blocking the other.- Unspent money earns interest so if you build just the towers you need, you'll have even more money later on.- Create ""kill zones"" with your most powerful towers + slowing towers + bonus money towers to maximize efficiency.- Cool story with some great DLC (The Portal cross-over DLC is top notch)- Alternate modes/achievements will keep you playing for a long time			"

												10/10I've played a lot of Tower Defenders in my time, and this one is unequivocally the best! The balance and learning curve are manageable, with just the right level of challenge for players. The Voice acting is way above expectations for this price level, and the script is both funny and tragic in places. Once you've completed the story, the journey continues in a wide array of DLC, which is reasonably priced and well-sized. Also the range of ""Challenge"" levels like Go back through this stage using only machine guns make you rethink a map and re-creates it for you. If you only play one TD game (and you should try everything once, except incest and folk dancing) make it this one.			"

												This is not only an excellent tower defense game, it's just plain fun to play.  The base game has plenty of maps and a great selection of different towers to place.   The game is very challenging to find all the right combo's of towers and also the placement of the towers.  Plenty of different aliens make their way onto the map, learning what aliens are on each map will really affect what towers you will use.  Right clicking on an alien will provide much needed info about the alien to help you make tower choices. The UI for the game is very good, making it easy to get towers placed quickly. The wide variety of maps and types of games you can play on each map keeps the game fresh and keeps you coming back to play once again trying to get all gold medals on every type of game.The story line also makes the game fun as well. I'm still playing the base game right now and nearly have story mode complete and already have 70+ hours logged on the game and am not bored with it one bit and I still have all the DLC to get into as well. I highly recommend this game as a good challenge but something you can sit down and play anytime.			"

												As of this writing, this game is almost 7 years old. For perspective, it came out only a year after The Orange Box did. When it was first released, it was undeniably the best tower defense game in the world -- but that's not surprising, because its only competition was Desktop Tower Defense and a handful of other shoddy flash games that were starting to ride the trend.A lot of time has passed since then, and hundreds of weird and interesting tower defense games have been released. So, is Defense Grid still the best? ...Honestly, I have no clue. I haven't played as many tower defense games over the years as I would have liked, and I blame it all on the quality and longevity of this one. The people who made Defense Grid understand where tower defense came from. Everything about this game is built to look, feel, and sound like retro StarCraft, from the isometric view, to the color choices, to the tower types and damage types. Gun towers are basically bunkers of marines, inferno towers are bunkers of firebats, cannon towers are bunkers of ghosts, and so on. They’ve even borrowed some classic towers from other games, like the tesla coils from the Red Alert series. Even today, it still hits me with that old 2002-era nostalgia of searching for tower defense maps on Battle.net and that pumped feeling of starting the map with a full lobby of people (because, of course, you needed a full lobby to even have a chance!)The biggest reason why Defense Grid is so great is because of its scoring system, which rewards even the tiniest improvements in performance with exponentially more money and score. It appeals greatly to the gamer's OCD, since the better you play the beginning of a mission, the more freedom you have to build deadly mazes for the remainder of the mission, the easier victory becomes, and the more often you can see your score skyrocket into the hundreds of millions. Fast-forward and checkpoint-rewinding controls make it simple to re-do every wave until it is perfect. It also creates an ultra-hardcore metagame with a massive curve of leaderboard scores, if you’re into that kind of competition. You’ll need to learn some really annoying advanced techniques if you want to break into the top 100 on any mission, or you could choose to compete in maps and game modes where the techniques don’t apply. Or you could simply choose to compete with yourself and your friends, or just aim for the pre-set gold medals. It’s really up to you.I've got over 130 hours logged into this, and I'm finally coming down the home stretch of getting all the achievements. God, this game has a lot of content, thanks to over 4 years of continued support and expansion sets. The expansion sets are quite solid, too; at one point I thought I had found a strategy which works on any mission, but then the DLC campaigns came and changed all the rules, and made me rethink everything.Is Defense Grid still the best? Probably not, and I will have a lot of tower defense games to explore once I’m done with this one. But one thing is for certain: this game is the sole reason why future tower defense games had to start trying new things, because it got the basics about as perfect as they can possibly get… at least for those of us who still occasionally see hordes of zerglings filing through mazes of bunkers in our waking dreams.

												This is by far and away the best tower defense game I've played. The game is very simple to play, pick a tower type, choose where you want to put it, watch it kill aliens. The aliens are trying to steal power cores, your job is to kill the aliens before they can make off with them. You start with limited money, but gain more by killing aliens. The challenge comes from making the best tactical use of that money. You need to pick the optimum type of tower for the available locations to place them in. Some of the maps are cleverly designed to let you place towers  and divert the path the aliens take to the cores. Choose wisely and your towers will kill lots of aliens, earn you more money for more towers, and the power cores will be saved. Choose badly and you will slowly be overrun and the cores lost.    All of the maps have massive replayability with different modes offering different objectives. Your scores are also ranked against everyone else who has played. Think you found the optimum way to play a map? Take a look at the highscores and think again! Scores are based on the number of cores you managed to save, the money you have left at the end of a map and the sale value of the towers that you have built. The less you have spent, the better your score will be. Getting the highest scores requires using the bare minimum of towers leaving you constantly on the edge of failure.  Experiment, improve your tactics, watch your name rise through the ranks. There are literally 100's of hours worth of gameplay to be had from the main game, and 100's more from the DLC, which is all excellent.			"

												By far the best tower defense i have ever played. Tons of content.The game allows for a ridiculous amount of customization, you have so many towers to choose from, and you will definitely have your favorites. There must be hundreds of ways to effectively crush the enemy.combination of towers + tower placement and which towers you will upgrade first + the resource system (that gains interest depending on how much you have in the bank) gives you so many options for strategy.each map, and there are a lot, will have different challenges and modes - that allow for huge replay potential. different layouts and enemy pathing has you thinking tactically about how to maze the aliens into oblivion. easy checkpoint system that lets you go back in time in set intervals, meaning a small error will not force you to restart from wave 1 if you are going for that perfect run.Practice mode give you a ton of cash to perfect a strategy you want to apply once you play the map for real. Great voice acting for a tower defense. its just an amazing game.... I cannot think of a single fault for it. Enemies are varied wth nice animations. Towers look and sound good, upgrades improve their looks and fire effects.... its just obviously handled with a lot of care and love.If you like tower defense - you would be hard pressed to find a better one than Defense Grid. If you do, LET ME KNOW, because i would instantly buy that game too.I highly recommend this game for yourself, or even as a gift to strategy loving friends.This game is AWESOME.			"

												Simple concept and easy to get into yet a challenge to perfect. Every level has multiple ways to succeed (& fail) which means even when you get your all your Gold medals you still can go back and play it completely differently. This is a rare trait to see in a game to have such good balanced mechanics (between real-time & strategic planning) and level design that it constantly feels fresh! Balance continues in the tower design & difficulty levels where it often feels like a real tug-of-war with the aliens.This and all the DLCs are exceptional fun, worth every $$$ and even going on 5 years since I purchased I still find this game a great experience. It is the definitive Tower Defense game with replayability not often seen in the modern world of disposable gaming. Cannot say a bad thing about the game other than it will consume your soul and spit out Rasberries!! - You'll keep coming back to play again and again. Graphically, it is feeling a little low-def in 2014, but does not detract from the experience.I would definitely say it's worth the standard price. It's a truly big game, packed with everything one could ask for in this genre.			"

												If you enjoy Tower Defense games, then this game is most likely for you. I'd even go as far as suggesting that this game is the best Tower Defense game I've played.Everything feels right, and it's a challenge, and the most fun are the missions in where you have a the option to shape the pathway that the enemy will have to walk through using the towers you set up. It's really fun to think about how to set them up, what time you should place towers, shape the pathways... especially with your starting amount of resources, given how often you're limited.And after you've completed the game, you can replay maps/stages with lots of modifiers that offer new challenges! It's a good time waster for a half hour or so per stage!			"

												You and your AI buddy, who surprisingly enough has more personality than a good number of VG characters, are on a quest to save to world from aliens with big guns... that are on towers.There's a nice little ""twist"" tho: Instead of generic bad guys come in and you have to stop them getting out, you have to prevent aliens taking power cores from the power station and leaving with them... I said nice, not groundbreaking.There are also nice variety of enemies which vary from your typical speedy and tanky mobs to some stealth and shielded aliens or aliens who project a shield/ a stealth field on other nearby aliens.It's a good TD game and I would recommend it to anybody who enjoys TDs.

												I certainly enjoyed Defense Grid when it first came out. But what has surprised me is that, over the years, I find myself periodically coming back to pick fights with those stoooopid aliens.  Seldom does a game have such long term interest.With the add-ons and all the variations one can play, there's plenty to enjoy.  The artwork has stood the test of time, and then some!   Sometimes I'll settle into a favorite scenario that I know I can win, but do it with imposed restrictions -- not allowing myself to use certain towers.  Some just to zone out.I have enjoyed DG2, but not nearly as much.  Not sure I can pin down why.  Weird.  Too many voices, perhaps, and poorly delivered dialogue.   Dollar for dollar, Defense Grid is a super value.  If you have ANY interest in tower games, you MUST have this one.  BTW, it's an interesting game to draw children into computer strategy.  Of course, that can be good OR bad.			"

Posted: November 3, 2016
												This to me is THE tower defense game, that i compare every other TD to. Now, if that wasn't enough to make you buy this game, here's a bit more in depth analysis:The real challenge in this game comes from the level design. The large open areas don't give you even grids like 10x10 to build your mazes, instead, they give odds like 8x7 etc. So most of the times i found myself thinking that:""Damn, if i put them this way, i could direct them to that area, but then the damage suffers pretty greatly.."". Most other TD games just give your enemies a pre-determined path, that you put towers alongside of it, and usually one tactic works in every level.Most TD games i've played give you usually a path of two that the enemies go, in this game, you can create a proper mazes on your own, on most levels. That increases the re-playability a lot, and often i find myself trying some level again just to test out a different strategy.The towers are pretty basic ones, all with 3 levels. There's the gun tower, flamethrower which acts like ""poison"", heavy hitting cannon, laser, slower, air, concussion that does huge damage to land groups, and command tower that increases the money gained from kills/shows stealthed units better. So nothing too deep in that department.  But nothing more is even needed. In my opinion this game wuold be too much of a hassle with deeper tower system. Since the levels require thinking.The levels itself, there are a good amount of them, and dlc's add a lot more. Every level also has different modes like 99 waves, lesser cores (that enemies steal), core's that stay where they're dropped by an enemy that's killed (these are challenging), restrictions that you must complete the level using only lvl1 towers, and many more different challenges.if you're a fan of TD games, this is one of the must-play game of that genre. Really. I haven't encountered a single bug ever on these 134 hours that i've played this, runs perfectly on win 10.			"

												Defense Grid takes the tower defense genre to the next level. I liked every aspect of the game. Level design, tower design, tower diversity, enemy types, economic system, soundtrack, effects, difficulty level, extra playable modes, the fact that tower placement shapes the aliens path. Everything is designed very carefully and delivers a perfect playing experience. I got all achievements and I'm still playing to earn the gold metal on every single mode of every level.I admit that the first time I played DG I looked down on it because it looked like a ""small"" game. That was on a friends computer before I finished the main campaign. Then I played it again a year later on my brothers computer and finished the main campaign again! Finally, this summer, I got it for myself and finished it again, plus every expansion that was available.I'd like also to note that the voice of Jim Ward, who voices the AI assisant, is a big plus for the game. It gives you the feeling you're together into the fight, with a person that shares his personal moments with you, even his craving for raspberries!!The Containment, You monster, Resurgence and Borderlands expansions add greatly to the game, in playable levels but also in the story.And above all else is the Strategy. You may beat easily a level the first time, but it's certain you will come up with a better plan the second time you play the same level. And different game modes (like ""out of bullets"" or ""shredder"") will force you to adopt a completely different approach to beat the level. And all of this is done by placing just 10 different types of towers on those tiles. The game depth is incredible.I give this game a 100% with honors! An excellent idea, a perfect design into a superb game.			"

It's like building something up as a defense system, and then seeing it if works out.  Defense Grid does exactly what I want.  It allows me to work on the defense building, while the game unleashes havoc on the hoardes of invading bugs.There is nothing here that hasn't been done a million times already, but it does it in style and it looks great.  It has a great interface and is easy to pick up and play.  All around, this is a good game.  It's not Skyrim or anything, but it's good for what it is is.  A top notch tower defense game.			"

												Defense Grid: The Awakening made by Hidden Path Entertainment  is one of the better tower defense games you will find on Steam, even now. The game has classic maze building maps and a plethora of towers  at your disposal. You play as a defender of your planet against a volatile alien race that must be destroyed at all costs. To help you accomplish this, you must protect power cores important to your planetary defenses. And what better way to increase your chances of success than an old soldier from the past, that has dealt with them before, whose consciousness is downloaded into a computer to aid you in this undertaking. Alright, maybe the story has a little cheese, but most people play tower defense games for the challenge and difficulty. The graphics of Defense Grid are pretty good considering most tower defense games. I like how the zoom in feature has a lot of detail and eye candy. The sound effects are generic futuristic sci-fi. The game has music soundtracks on the levels to help set the mood and they aren't all bad. (OK so you wouldn't play this game for the music.) This game scores you on a badge system, bronze being the worst. To get a higher score you have to finish the level with a higher resource number, which can be a challenge if you are use to spamming towers. (So, just don't.) There are also different types of modes/challenges per level which will have you reloading plenty of times. (Yes, the backspace key is your friend.) Defense Grid: The Awakening will have you hooked for hours trying to get gold badges and achievement hunting. If you like sci-fi settings and tower defense games this game is a must have. Happy gaming.			"

												Tower security entertainments are a dime twelve on the Internet, which is a touch of an adornment generally as in most by a long shot of them are permitted to-play, so paying 10 pennies would be unnecessary overabundance. Still, it's not stunning that tower shield entertainments are so celebrated; done successfully they can be an addictive time suck, draining without end the hours as you try to set up a defensive system that can withstand everything the PC hurls at it. With these free preoccupations out there, can't avoid being there space for a premium tower security diversion? Covered Path Entertainment advances a persuading resistance with Defense Grid: The Awakening, a $20 redirection that offers a great deal of tense minutes and significantly more significance than an ordinary tower monitor diversion. Shield Grid is set in a far away future where you ought to guarantee the last scraps of a capable human advance from a pariah danger. To make a long story short, everything comes down to keeping power focuses out of the pariahs' hands. On each level, the pariahs enter the guide and dare to all aspects of the most short route to the power focuses, and after that they make the way to the exit. In case they escape with a middle, that inside is lost. If the outcasts escape with each one of the focuses, you lose and ought to endeavor afresh. There's nothing more satisfying than a solid watch. To keep this, you ought to create and redesign careful towers that pound the untouchables with different weapons. There are weapon, laser, and firearm towers; power outage towers that rain aggregate weapons; rocket towers for airborne units; meteor towers that serve like huge weapons; inferno towers that are basically flamethrowers; Tesla towers that stun the untouchables, and a transient tower that backs them off. Regardless, the all the more able towers cost an awesome arrangement to the extent resources, and updating them is impressively more expensive. Since the most ideal approach to ""win"" resources is to murder outcasts, each level is a dire race to plot and execute a perfect mindful lattice. To make things more troublesome, the untouchables arrive in an extensive variety of combinations. There are juggernauts and secured juggernauts; these are essentially giant, staggering behemoths that are amazingly difficult to butcher. By then there are fakes, which are on a very basic level whipping young fellows that are proposed to ingest an insane measure of damage so that the outcasts following it remain for the most part unscathed. There's an untouchable boss that shields whatever different pariahs that contact him. There are convenient untouchables that can race through your resistances, making it difficult to cause an extensive measure of damage on them. There are flying pariahs that can avoid all your ground shields. There are swarm untouchables that come in monster packs that can overwhelm obstructions expected to target single outcasts. There are turtle outcasts that, upon death, unleash a horde of units. Each level will hurl wherever between three or thirty waves at you, and every dynamic wave is expected to extend you quite far. Thankfully, a notice structure lets you know the sythesis of each wave early, so you can endeavor to get prepared for it conventionally well. If you see an inundation of racers coming in, you know you need to fabricate and upgrade laser towers, as they do the most mischief against them. The altering is to a great degree well done. It's greatly difficult to stop a divide of the more moved waves without losing a couple focuses. The elevating news is that there's a particularly advantageous checkpoint structure that gives you access a glimmer come back to a past checkpoint by essentially taping the erase key. Besides, entertainment gives you an extraordinary superlaser, be that as it may you ought to be to a great degree fundamental about its use, as its resuscitate time is broad. Put down towers to shape the battle zone. Insurance Grid has 20 levels that expansion stuck in an unfortunate situation as you go. At in the first place, the pariahs will travel a since quite a while ago, confined, coordinate track that is definitely not hard to shield, as there are a great deal of spots where you can create towers. In any case, the levels get more troublesome, as there may be separate tracks or distinctive entryways to stretch over. The best levels are the more open ones; there isn't for the most part a track, yet rather a decently deplete grid that you have to ""shape"" by putting towers down. These are extra trying since you have to endeavor to develop a maze while you're made up for lost time with battling off the outcasts. Level development is trying, however the last level the inconvenience twist takes off like a NASA rocket; it's puzzling, toward the day's end amazingly compensating to beat. (I continued with just a lone focus remaining, and that middle drew close to escaping.)The open levels also give an endless number of setups, giving a ton of replayability. To further bolster replayability, there are similarly leaderboards where you can differentiate your scores and others, and furthermore a test mode that amps up the inconvenience. The 3D representations engine isn't particularly cutting edge however in any case it stays far over the benchmarks of the class. In light of present circumstances, various tower watch diversions are Flash-based. Besides, 3D engine considers three dimensional levels that have diverse levels to them, which incorporates versatile quality and significance. The sound is also a phase over most of the class; the sound effects are workmanlike however then again there's a guide that mentors you and gives examination. The voice on-screen character for the guide is wonderfully picked, yet he tends to wind on about raspberries a considerable measure, and a couple lines are reiterated over and over and over. The Verdict For a spending redirection, Defense Grid successfully passes on a considerable measure of getting a handle on gameplay; it's definitely not hard to disregard time while playing it. Honestly, there were a noteworthy number of times where I vanquished a surge of outcasts just to comprehend that I had persevered through the entire level. I truly required another wave or two with a particular true objective to test the feasibility of the mouse trap I had formed. It's reliably a not too bad sign when a redirection relinquishes you requiring for extra.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time.

												This is easily the oldest Tower Defense on Steam, and is probably a bit of an obvious first choice for talking about them. But it's an obvious one for good reason, as Defense Grid is one of the best of them on Steam even being eight years old at this point. The premise is simple enough: aliens have invaded earth and are spreading chaos and destruction to...do something, they never really get around to saying what. Your player, an unnamed civilian, manages to escape the onslaught and reactivate an ancient defense system, as well as the AI operating it, the mind of the late General Fletcher. He serves as your mission control, and is pleasant enough to listen to even though it doesn't take very long to hear every line he has.Together you set about using the grid to defend against the alien attacks, since the cores powering it are a far more appealing target for them than the Earth's population. Every level aliens will try to make their way to the terminal housing them. That's where things get complicated, as rather than taking health off you immediately, if one makes it there they'll grab up to 3 cores before turning around and trying to make off with them, either out where they came in or on a different path entirely. Kill it and the core will drop and float back toward the housing, but this also means another alien can pick it up themselves. Ideally this means you don't want them making it to the core at all, but in many instances this isn't possible, creating a tug of war.You have quite a few tools to deal with this, of course, as you have all the usual tower types: the fast, low damage Gun tower, the high damage, slow Cannon tower, three different area of effect towers, and more. The campaign is 20 stages long and unlocks them at a good enough pace to keep letting you use new things. Every stage also has a great variety of places you can put them, too, and it's often crucial to alter the alien's path as much as possible, as the aliens have a lot of tricks of their own. Past the first ordinary enemy, there are extra-durable ones, extra-quick ones, ones shielded from most towers, and stealthy ones that won't ordinarily be targeted at long range are just some of the ones they'll throw at you. There are also bosses, and combinations of all of these can be pretty taxing at times. Luckily Defense Grid has what I wish other games in the genre would crib, a checkpoint system. If you mess up in a level you can simply go back a bit in the level and be more prepared, instead of doing the whole thing over again.The game's campaign is easily enough to get your money's worth full price, and especially on a sale, but each level also has a bunch of alternate versions to it with various conditions, like not being able to upgrade your towers. If you want to give those a try you could easily spend a ton of hours watching aliens march to their doom. There are also the Containment and You Monster DLCs, which feature smaller campaigns (the latter of which swaps in Fletcher for none other than Portal's GLaDoS), and four map packs that contain two stages each. So for content, and good content at that, you can't really beat this game. To top it all off, every different level and variant on it has a scoring system to it, allowing a conservative player to compete with others. I haven't played the sequel to the game, but I've heard it's a bit lack-luster in comparison, which is a shame, since Hidden Path pulled it off so well here.			"

Replayability, game mechanics, the sound work (oh, that voice...), and this subtle, sad humor buried deeply in those memories of family and battle comrades lost long ago.This game is much more than it seems. An absolute must-have for tower defense lovers, and highly recommended for the rest.Oh, and remember - there is no ""stun"" setting on cannon fire!			"

												Awesome tower defense game, maybe the best I've found to date.  The sheer number of maps and game modes offers many hours of gaming for a decent price.  There are a decent selection of towers, which offer different tactical options.  There is also a good balance of maps where structure locations are fixed so the AI route is also fixed and others where you can arrange towers to make epic kill zones.All up, if you like tower defense games, this should be considered a must have addition to your collection.For me, it's a solid 8/10, rising to 9/10 if you are a die-hard tower defense gamer.

												One of the best ""tower defence"" games around, with a decent number of maps (26 in the base package, more available as DLC), several challenges and alternative game modes per map, clean graphics and very entertaining voice acting (an American doing an over-the-top ""English butler"" accent).It's not without its problems, though. For example, the camera can't be rotated or zoomed out very far (which makes the range of some towers almost impossible to judge), the mouse cursor doesn't move freely (it just jumps from button to button), the UI is rather basic and text-based (no easily recognisable icons), and (perhaps more annoyingly) there is no way to see your score before you finish each map (which is just incomprehensible, since some of the challenges involve aiming for specific scores).Also, there are almost no graphical options, no way to enable antialiasing in-game, no manual saves (it auto-saves at predetermined checkpoints, but you lose those checkpoints when you finish a map), and everything seems to have been dumbed down slightly to work on consoles and touchscreens. To give credit to the developers, those limitations aren't nearly as annoying here as in most console / tablet ports, but they still make the game worse than it could (and should) have been.For the price I paid (under 3€), it's definitely worth a buy, and the same would probably hold true for anything under 10€.

												A nice tower defence game. It doesn't differ too much from other TD games, but it's pretty fun once you get a hang of it. Most of the standard mechanics associated with TD genre are here: a good tower variety, a good enemy variety, rock-paper-scissors tactic of using the right tower against the right enemy, scoreboards, and so on.Graphically the game is very beautiful. Though at times I wished the towers looked a bit more different to one another, otherwise it can get confusing what is what. I do like the whole colour scheme of green towers being basic, yellow advanced, and red the best. The musical side of things could've been a bit better though. Most levels have between 20-30 waves, and can take a while to play through, so it would've been nice to have it spiced up with more memorable tunes. The A.I. narrator most times provides a nice commentary and keeps you entertained with his colourful personality, though at times he can be annoying when he keeps telling you about cores being stolen. *shakes fist*Most levels had a very interesting design and forced you to think hard on how to channel enemies down a longer path and where would be the points of highest offense. They provided a nice challenge. A few felt like difficulty spikes and seemed unnecessarily convoluted (looking at you, Waste Disposal), but most were a great fun.There were a few aspects that annoyed me slightly, so might be worth mentioning them. First one which I noticed straight away was how much punishment the enemies could sustain before going down. Even the weakest, most basic enemies could absorb a fair amount of damage, which in turn made many towers feel too weak. And this brings me to another one. Majority of towers are very situational and tend to have a lot more shortcomings than strengths. The only tower that I felt was all-round good at just about everything was the Cannon tower, and these usually formed the meat and potatoes of my defence, with all the other towers just acting in supporting roles. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it means there is a bit too little room for experimentation with various setups.Aside from the story mode, each map also has a variety of other modes, most providing some form of a new challenge, like enemies being tougher, or the cores which you must protect not going back to their starting location, and so on. So there's a lot of stuff to try out here and the completionists can easily sink tens or hundreds of hours in this game.Overall, it's a fun TD game. Don't expect anything new and extraordinary, but if you like the genre, then you should definitely grab this game.			"

												Defense Grid is tower defense game with a unique touch to it. Like most of you already know, you have to set up defenses around your base and protect yourself from the approaching enemy. You have a huge array of towers to choose from and loads of unique enemys to kill. There is total replayability and with DLC still coming out for this game you'll be playing for a while.

												A historic entry into the tower defense genre.In many aspects Defense Grid has aged very well. The level design/variety is superb - Having very different levels is crucial for forcing the player to not get locked into certain strategies. The tower balancing is excellent compared to most entries in the genre - I think cannon towers are a tad overpowered, but not at all game-breakingly so.Defense Grid incorporates my favorite Tower Defense mechanic - unspent resources earn you income (at least in a majority of the game modes). This encourages the player to keep their defenses as lean as possible to maximize the amount of available resources for later waves. With this, even ""easy"" levels are still very challenging for trying to achieve the highest score.With a ridiculous amount of levels and score-keeping for them, you can compete with your friends' scores. The biggest weakness Defense Grid suffers is that it feels too ""vanilla"". Not only was its design direction not particularly brave with any novel mechanics to begin with, but due to its age, later titles have been afforded the opportunity to duplicate its successful elements while also putting a more novel spin on their mechanics.Still, what it lacks in novelty, it far surpasses in being an overall sleek optimized tower defense game.

												I remember playing this years ago on Wild Tangent, long before I switched to Steam, and it's still just as fun as it was then, maybe even more now that I know what to expect.Defense Grid is among the best you'll find in the Tower Defense genre, and rightfully so. This game has a tantalizing blend of simplicity, planning, general enjoyment and even graphics. One of the largest pluses to Defense Grid is that it allows you to progressively shape the path your alien foe take. You can also set up ""kill zones,"" places where you concentrate your best towers and where most of the killing happens, hence the name.Another huge twist in Defense Grid is that your enemies have to go to a central hub to take a power core, essentially hitpoints. If you kill an alien who is holding a core, the core will progressively float back to the hub unless another alien grabs it. This makes strategy much deeper than ""don't let them get to the end.""Your AI friend who is booted up in the prologue is your constant companion, giving you tips and commenting on how you're doing or what's going on (this has saved my♥♥♥♥♥many times when I was focused on improving outer towers and he told me that aliens had their grabby little hands on a core, and they wouldn't left the map with it if my AI friend hadn't told me in time).Another great, possibly unintentional twist is that your AI friend has a British accent. This somehow makes his warnings more spoken and his cheers more cheerful, plus it sounds so classy when he says ""bloody hell.""Some maps also have multiple levels to them, where aliens have to go up in a spiral to get to your cores. This opens up a huge amount of possibilities for towers that help cover multiple levels.Overall, I'd have to say Defense Grid is one of the best if not the best game you'll find in the Tower Defense genre. Your Tower Defense collection can't be complete without this game. Definately get this if you're into Tower Defense.			"

												Gameplay - This is a tower defense game which means you build towers on a map which have their own unique different ways of attacking waves of enemies.  These type of games are all about strategy and experimentation.  You have ten different towers available in each level and have to find the best way to kill all the enemies before they can escape the map.  Unlike the early tower defense games in Warcraft III, Defense Grid has a set number of places where you can build so it becomes important to learn how best to use the space you have and what towers should go where.  You can also shape the paths that enemies take (you always want them to take the longer and more difficult path) which is a cool innovation for the genre.  The designers were smart to put a fast forward button in Defense Grid.  It helps more experienced players get through most maps in 10-15 minutes.  The only downside is much like the Run button in Final Fantasy 7, you have to hold down the F key for long period of times which does get tiring.  It is almost as if a slow down button would have been better than the fast forward.The most important thing is that this game is fun and even addictive at times.  There are over hundred-fifty different modes in the base game alone.  A new player to Tower Defense may find that this game can be challenging without a good strategy so I highly recommend checking out Youtube for any levels that give you trouble as there are lots of good strategies already out there.Story - Like a lot of action-oriented games, Defense Grid tries to have a story when there really isn't room for an interesting one.  It is more like there is an ""announcer"" for the game who makes comments about certain things and encourages you to beat the game essentially.  The story does not get in the way or waste any of your time which is probably for the best. Presentation (Graphics and Sound) - The graphics in Defense Grid are not very impressive but that isn't the reason you play a game like this either.  The textures are not very detailed and look aged, but this has a nearly top-down and zoomed out camera so it is hard to make the graphics look that great anyway.  The effects of the towers do look good and the game never lags no matter how much action is going on.  This is a plus because old tower defense games could not handle huge waves of enemies.  The sound is good with nice explosion sounds and the announcer is charming and never gets annoying.  What little music is in the game is very good.  If you play through everything in Defense Grid, the music will eventually get repetitive and you'll probably want to listen to something else instead but that is true of any game you play for a long time.Overall Score - Defense Grid is a great game if you enjoy Tower Defense.  It is probably daunting to a beginner, but if you know you like these kind of games, this is easily the best 2D one on Steam at the time of this revew.  This game is now cheap and if you catch it on sale, it is an incredible value.  There are three DLC packs and all three of them are pretty good and add new level designs to the game.  One is tied into Portal so if you like Glados,  you will definitely like that.  While it took me just over 100 hours, this game is pretty easy to get all the achievements.  A few achievements are a grind, but every achievement is pretty easy to get and there are plenty of videos on Youtube to help you figure out how to get them.  I never expected to play this game so much, but the fact that it is fun kept me playing for over 100 hours.8.0 (out of 10)			"

												Rating 8/10Overview: Tower DefenseThe Good+ The premise is a bit different than most tower defense games. Rather than the enemies reaching the end of the map, this game has the enemies collecting 'cores' from a specific point on the map and then moving towards the exit. Because of this , your strategy has to be a bit different when placing your towers. In addition the more resources you collect the more interest you earn, thus spending your resources to build/upgrade your towers may not always be the best strategy especially in the beginning of a level. +20 Main missions and 28 DLC missions. Every map is completely different from the last, some maps have multiple entry and exit points, core locations, pathways. Every map almost feels like a new puzzle, trying to figure out how to make the optimal path to win. + The DLC missions are unique and fun. The best DLC levels is mixing the portal universe with this one. Each level is unique and provides an interesting twist to each level altering your strategy.  + Every mission features a variety of different modes. The modes that cause you to rethink your strategy are probably the best ones. For example, one mode has the entry and exit points reversed, another you can only build level 1 towers, etc. + The game features a variety of different towers each one with a unique purpose. The type of tower and the placement plays a big role in the game. + Great graphics and effects for this type of game+controller supportThe Bad:- Other than a variety of different modes per level, this game offers little new. -Some modes can be very repetitive. Once you figure out what works in a level, you can play different modes with the exact same layout. However these modes are optional. - The game feels like it was designed with the controller only in mind. Why can't I map every control function on the mouse? "

												So, Defense Grid. Is it worth your time and money?The short version: yes it is.The long version: keep reading.To start of with the best part, Defense Grid is a TD that focusses on plotting your layout. There are no close to a hundred different tower types here nor are the levels a micro frenzy of having to click at spots at just the right time. Defense Grid is a game about strategy. It's about being so shrewd that your placement of only a handful of towers will obliterate wave after wave.Having only nine towers is a good thing as it focusses attention. You have these nine to master and no more. The learning curve is found in how to combine them.Lasers set aliens on fire, meaning they deal damage even after they left range. But they are useless against shields, which means you need guns or cannons to bring those down. But what if there are speedy aliens in the wave? You need lasers again, or perhaps temporal towers. It's a game about combinations both in placement and upgrades. And speaking of upgrades, there are two upgrades for each tower, each merely increasing the stats of the tower. More damage, more range, faster firing speed. This again, simplifies the learning curve yet the doubling in price for every upgrade still makes it an important choice. You can upgrade two green towers to a yellow one for the price of upgrading one yellow to a red one. Which is better? Well... what's your layout like?The aliens themselves offer variation as well, although it's not so much the power each alien type possesses. It is when these powers are combined within waves that real danger appears. You even might need to take the next wave into account. A wave of very fast aliens, having sped by your defences, stole cores. That's fine, you think. They are all low health, I get them when they re-enter my grinder on the way back. Unfortunately, the next wave arrived already and contains aliens that shield other aliens. And just when you plan your killing blow, the shield envelopes the thieves from the previous wave. Leaving you to hit backspace a couple of times to revert to a previous save. The smoothest quick load I ever encountered in a game.Even the resource gain has a strategic consideration in the form of interest. This mechanic will steadily increase your resources based off a % of what's available. Less spending means more income, requiring you to look ahead. That's the reason why at the top of the screen the next wave is already approaching as a set of clearly identifiable icons.The DLC offers new gamemodes and maps, Ranging from modes where building of the towers is changed, to modes where the behaviour of stolen cores is changed. Each brings only subtle change, but instantly changes the dynamic of any map.The multiplayer aspect of the game is found only in the scores. Everyone on your friend list who owns the game will show up with their scores provided they played that map/gamemode combination, thus inspiring an ever increasing optimization race to eke out just a few more points than them.Of course, afterwards you switch to the global highscores and you will cry silently in your hands as you didn't even realize numbers as big as those existed. The downsides then.The biggest problem is that once you get good at this game several of the gamemodes lose their lustre. Especially the Grinder modes become a bore, having to wait for a hundred waves doing nothing. Not even the ability to speed up the game can make this time go by fast enough.Another problem is that the Tesla tower grows useless. This isn't because it is, but because its intended role as a fail-safe tower, isn't required for a good player. A good player doesn't need fail safes.And finally, there are people who continuously manage to hack/cheat themselves into the top of the highscores somehow, leaving Hidden Path to squat them down again and again. As beating highscores is the endgame for Defense Grid, this is an annoying thing to face.TLDR; There is a demo. Go try it.			"

												Amazingly good Tower Defense game. If you like straightforward TDs (no first person, no creating units to attack - just towers and baddies) you will love Defense Grid. Great graphics - they're not CoD of course but this game does more than justice for TD with it's simple design that comes off looking very sleek and setting the mood very well.Fantastic audio - each tower/gun has it's own distinquishable sound. The music is memorable and very well suited.Moreso, the AI companion who keeps you company all game has depth and charisma. He's even got an announcer pack in DotA 2! Tons of replayability - tons of very varied levels to play on, each with multiple different modes to change your challange, and (affordable, and imo very worthwhile) DLC content also add even more content.Amazing gameplay - DG's gameplay is fast paced with a need for good reaction skills and planning, but it manages to also be marvellously straightforward. It's constantly skimming the line of enjoyable challanging and (occasionally) frustratingly difficult, but a well-designed ""backtrack"" feature in this game takes a big part of what tends to make TD games frustrating. You can always back up a few 10-second blocks of time backwards to re-think just where you place those towers - leaving your gaming time spent playing, killing, planning - instead of re-doing the first few easy waves of a level over and over while you try and handle the challanging part. Whether you're just looking for a fun game to pass a half hour here, or a hardcore lover of Tower Defense, Defense Grid is a damn, damn good game that will get my stamp of approval any day.			"

												I was sceptical at 1st but I have come to really like this game. A mere snip at £6 when I got it I have easily had 15 to 20 hours of playtime from it. It is fast past with nice yet simplistic graphics, an easy to understand interface with a suitable amount of challenge. It has a large number of achievements which if like me you are an achievement hunter will take you a good while to get. This coupled with the steam cards and the ability to instantly compare your level scores with your friends and your world ranking makes it a competitive game.All in all I would certainly reccomend this and I am looking forward to the sequel. In addition the in game announcer is just excellent, with a suprise visit from GLADOS as well :)			"

												I think it's time to give this game a fair review after over 50-hr playing. Though this game only have the simplest form of tower defense genre: tower, and the only thing you can do is just put them at the proper position, though its art design is just so-so at the present time, but it still give me much fun, excelling many games lying in my library. Its goal is simple. Its learning curve is smooth. It has many different playing mode. Whether you're a hardcore fan of tower defense game or not, you can always find something satisfying you.If you're amateur in this genre, its fighting is intense enough to grab your eyes. When you are a little experienced, its advanced strategy needed to achieve higher goal is easy to understand and learn. And if you have progressed to become a hardcore fan like me, you will catch the art of positioning towers and the timing to position and remove them. Most importantly, you only need a mouse to play. That means you need only one hand, therefore you can play when lying on he bed like a lazybones. Don't need to worry about ache due to unhealthy posture.			"

												Simply put, this game is awesome, and possibly the best tower defense game I’ve ever played. I love the quick nature of levels, and the thrill of feeling like a pro when you end level with loads of money left over. The range of abilities of the towers makes each level unique. Will you slow a pack of aliens, in a gauntlet? Or maybe zap them over and over with a laser... either way, very fun.At the end of the day, I'd give this game an 8/10. Game play is awesome, and the quick nature makes it easy to pause and get some water. I do wish you could level a tower up more than 3 times. Additionally, I found the menu a teeny bit clunky.			"

												Sanctum still remains one of the best tower defence games around, so I suppose every other game ends up being compared to it. Well, Defense Grid stands it’s own.  There are a few fundamental differences. The most noticeable is that rather than being down in the action, Defense Grid gives you an aerial view, and it doesn’t have multiplayer either,  but other than that it’s pretty similar to  Sanctum and a great deal of fun to play. There are plenty of levels to keep you interested, and it’s the type of game you can just keep on playing and playing. All in all, highly recommended.  If you want multiplayer, then buy Sanctum. If you want solo play, then buy Defense Grid. Simple really! "

												Believe it or not, Defense Grid was the first straight-up ""tower defense"" game I've ever played (thought I had played other games with elements of TD before). By all accounts, this was a great game to start with, and after many hours of playtime, I have to agree. To summarize the game (as much as I can within the character limit), basically it boils down to this: a bunch of aliens walk down a preset path and it is your job to lay down various towers to stop them from stealing your stuff. The challenge comes in figuring out which tower types to use and managing your resources. The game features tons of levels in the main campaign, along with various alternate challenges for each level. A number of add-on campaigns are also available. There is a TON of content here for a very low price. Considering the addicting and fun gameplay, plus all of the hours of content available, I give this a wholehearted recommendation, even (or especially) for those who have never tried a TD game before.

												Easily the best tower defense game out there. The learning curve is well balanced, the graphics is quite nice as well and you have multiple approaches for almost any map awailable. Each map also provides with several different modes, like only tier 1 towers awailable, or reversed entry and exit pionts.There are DLC packs awailable, too. Those are fun. Especially the You Monster one will melt your mind and make you cry silently in the closet while you still hear GlaDOS's taunting voice...Never played a tower defense game before?

												An incredibly challenging tower defense game that focuses more on the placement/location and type of towers you use, as opposed to having an overwhelming number of them like other games in the genre. A strategy that worked for you on one stage may not necessarily work on another, and there is no one tower that is *the best* (sans the slow tower). Most TD games will last you through story mode and not much else, but DG offers plenty of other modes ranging from your standard survival fare to limiting the types of towers you can build, not allowing upgrades, harder enemies, etc. It is hard and ruthless, so if you're not willing to piece out each level like a puzzle you may want to avoid it, but there's no better tower defense game out there.

												This is an economic/financial game as much as a TD game, and I mean that in a good way.  The single biggest factor in your ranking will be how well you underconsumed, saved, and gained in interest.  The game itself is pretty easy, but getting a high ranking is difficult.  The only real flaw with the game, as strange as this may sound, is they introduced too many modes for each map.  As I said, the challenge isn't in completing the level, but in getting a high score, and there's so many maps, with several modes for each one, that there's no way to spend the necessary amount of time with each.  A prime example of how less can be more.  Even still, highly recommended for TD fans.    "

This is polished as can be, with a deftly delivered narrative to boot.  Plenty of expanstions and challenge modes make it a bargain for the player that enjoys repetition.  The strategies are subtle, the graphics smooth.			"

												Never thought a standalone turret defense game would be worth it. I mean, every RTS game has tons of player-made turret defense games and you can get 100 of them on your phone. This game is worth it. A perfectly refined and difficult turret defense game.			"

												As well as being a superior tower defense game (with upgrades, rerouting and other nice features) one of the best aspects of Defense Grid  is the high score tables that display for each game mode available on every map in the game. They show your scores and ranking relative to everyone else on your friends list and in terms of the overall world wide high score tables. Curretly working on getting in the top 1000 for all maps. Beaten my steam buddies on all maps where it is possible (all but one of the tutorial maps). The question is. are you good enough to you beat me on the rest? :P			"

												I'm not normally one for 'Tower Defense' games, but this is good! Not only am I enjoying the working outs for best path & best towers to use, I find I'm looking forward to the narrator voice overs - gold writing :DI find myself playing a few levels, then coming back a week later and trying to improve on those before I take on the next level.This is so much fun, I'm going to get al the DLC and the sequel too!

It's got everything you would expect from a turret game and more, so if you like that kind of thing, get this!			"

It is a singleplayer game and needs online with friends.  Starcraft 2 Tower Defense is the best ever made, and this is really really close and comes second.  This game is amazing,Great range of towers, which needs a little more to make harder etc, but a coop would be beneficial.  Hopefully a Defense Grid 2 is made withit.			"

With a number of game modes while also being able to compare your scores for each level with those of your Steam friends there's a huge amount of replayability here. Polished gameplay, great voice acting and a cheap price mean this is pretty much the gold standard by which other tower defence games are judged by.			"

												Defense Grid is pretty much the definitive of Tower Defense games. Build a variety of towers, kill alien creepers, earn resources, level your towers, save the day, and still have time to bug your sisters.The difficulty starts out easy enough, but the later levels and the DLC are certainly not for the feint-of-heart. The checkpoint feature is certainly handy though. Did you do amazing through the level until you got to this part and suddenly it all went to pieces? Fear not! With the tap of a single button you can jump back to the last check point in the level and try that again!After you beat the normal campaign, each level offers a variety of other modes that are sure to keep you busy. Some are simple changes, such as simply making it harder. Others add a spin. Such as grinding through 99 waves of creepers, have a single core that kills on contact as it returns to the base, etc.It's no PvZ, but no hardcore TD fan should pass this up without AT LEAST trying the demo.

												This is one of the few games I've enjoyed enough to get every achievement in. The towers are well balanced and are all useful at some point.  Both tall (few upgraded towers) and wide (many low level towers)  builds work on most levels. The levels often have flexible path possibilities. Multiple modes for each level get you to think about the level and tower placement in new ways, and often force you to throw out your old strategy. Compound interest really rewards patience. Checkpoints are great for helping you fine tune a strategy, get perfect placement timing, or back up just a bit when you mess up. Global rankings give you a chalenge to aim for past a gold medal.

												In a genre that's become saturated with ""me too"" clones, Defense Grid brings a few innovative ideas to the Tower Defense crowd.Unlike most other TD games, the object is not to prevent the baddies from running from point A to point B.  Instead, the baddies are trying to run into the heart of your base, grab a ""core"", and escape.  You have a limited number of cores, and you can kill any beastie that has stolen one.  The cores gradually float back to where they belong, but they can be intercepted by the invaders.  This adds a tactical layer to the gameplay - you might not want to kill a carrier right away if it means another baddie will grab it and try to escape.The game isn't perfect - it feels a bit sterile and I wish there were better feedback on damage done to the invaders - but easily worth the asking price for anyone looking for a good Tower Defense game.

												A great variation on the tower defense theme. Everyone probably asks whether it is worth buying when there are so many free TDs out there. And I think it is. The game mechanics seem well balanced, gameplay is seamless and there also is an attempt at a story. :) You will proceed through a series of missions in different environments, building towers, upgrading them and repelling wave after wave of enemies. In some levels the enemies take a mostly predetermined path, in others you may shape it, which is yet another important element of your strategy. Over time, you will gain access to an orbital cannon that, if used correctly, can save your hide quite a few times. Automatic checkpoint-based save, quick reloading of checkpoints and a 'fast forward' button provide enough control over the game to avoid boredom and repetition. The biggest con is that even upon completing the game you can't play any mission with all the towers. Only the ones from Story mode of that mission are available.			"

It's 3D, but it's only really playable in the default viewing mode. There's not much point in zooming in, other than to witness the carnage inflicted by your defence towers when you're feeling particularly confident that you've covered every angle and none of the aliens is going to slip through your net of flames, bullets, incedniaries, lazers and tesla coils. I like the fact that the map is a simplified grid, which makes it easier to adopt a definite strategy. It's why I prefer these sort of tower defence games over other more polished real-time stratrgy games like Starcraft and Command & Conquer. The maps in Defence Grid don't get so big that you have to fret about what's happening off-screen. The optimum strategy may not be entirely evident at the outset and successful strategies tend to emerge as a necessary response to unforseen threats and limited resources. The gameplay has been finely tuned, with statistical targets to hit for achievements and medals. There's also a high-score leader-board, and downloadable content.

												This game is all right. It's a straight-up tower defense game, but doesn't really bring anything special to the genre. There is unfortunately not a great deal of towers in the game. Once you've seen them in action, you've basically seen the game. I guess this can be seen as a good thing, since it means you must rely on placement and tower knowledge rather than brute force building.I appreciate the amount of work that went into the game. The stages and gameplay are clean and easy to work with. I wish I could see the damage numbers my towers are doing, though. The stat bars don't really tell me anything useful.There's quite a bit of content (with DLCs)! It took me long enough to complete every stage at least once without losing cores. I'm not even going to attempt the additional challenges per stage, though. I've seen enough.To anyone who decides to pick this up, my only advice is to remember that BACKSPACE loads from your last autosave, and you can hit it several times to backtrack further. This is quite useful for attempting perfect playthroughs.Overall I'd rate this a 7/10. Would I recommend it? Ehhhh. I kind of liked some Flash TD games better.			"

If you've ever played a tower defense game, then you'll know what to expect. There is a nice leaderboard, with constant records that you can beat, medals to earn and such.There is always space for progress and accomplishment. The best tactic to defeat your enemies is to know how and when to place your towers correctly so you can beat your enemy with maximum presicion and prevent any unwanted consequences.If you're looking for a game where you can relax and still have fun with, look no further then Defense Grid.

Sus DLC son geniales y no cuesta mucho, lo tengo tanto en Xbox 360 como en la PC, siendo la consola en la que lo he jugado todo el tiempo.I highly recommend this game for all the TD lovers <3, this is one of the best, if not the best, games from the genre, it totally goes according the TD hardcore concept; it's kinda difficult, so it won't be a walk on the park but a challenge. Its DLC are great! and overall cheap (as price) but awesome in quality and replaybility. I got it for Xbox 360 and PC, I had only played it on the console tho.			"

I guess this can be seen as a good thing, since it means you must rely on placement and tower knowledge rather than brute force building.I appreciate the amount of work that went into the game. The stages and gameplay are clean and easy to work with. I wish I could see the damage numbers my towers are doing, though. The stat bars don't really tell me anything useful.There's quite a bit of content (with DLCs)! It took me long enough to complete every stage at least once without losing cores. I'm not even going to attempt the additional challenges per stage, though. I've seen enough.To anyone who decides to pick this up, my only advice is to remember that BACKSPACE loads from your last autosave, and you can hit it several times to backtrack further. This is quite useful for attempting perfect playthroughs.Overall I'd rate this a 7/10. Would I recommend it? Ehhhh. I kind of liked some Flash TD games better.			"

												If you like Tower defense, this is a great game.  Highly suggest it.  Each map has limited ""Build"" points, so sometimes you have to get creative in making your own maze within those restrictions.  But that's part of the beauty of it, and something Tower Defense players are familiar with from the older Warcraft Mods. The story is fairly amusing, but it's nothing to write home about.			"

												By far one of the most addictive games I've ever played, and this is coming from someone who hadn't ever played a tower defense game prior to picking this up. You'll spend hours watching aliens run to their deaths in a hail of bullets (or lasers, or missiles, or flames, or.. you get the general idea) from your towers, and it never stops being entertaining.

												Defense Grid: The Awakening is THE definition of tower defense and perfectly combines both nice optics and addicting gameplay mechanics, making it probably the best tower defense game to date.The game features 10 different and upgradeable tower types, 15 different enemy types with various abilities and 26 unique levels in various settings. Another 8 levels are available through the Resurgence map pack, which can be purchased additionally (I highly suggest you to do so).Also, with its various game modes such as 'Out of Bullets', 'Grinder' or 'Poison Core' the game brings up new challenges for each of the levels which require different tactics, mazes and tower setups.The playtime for the 20-mission-story is around 8-10 hours, however, the game modes and additional maps can easily keep you busy for 100 or more hours.Defense Grid is an example of how a perfect Indie game looks like, so if you are into tower defense games, don't wait for a sale - grab the game and the map pack now!

Defense Grid is one of those ""invincible towers and plan your upgrades"" type of TDs - amazing depth, a good difficulty curve, but most of all is fun to play and experiment with. I only wish there were more types of enemies and towers, but that's not to say the game is lacking in those departments.			"

												Here comes a great tower defense game. Defense Grid will have you assist the awakening of this AI during an alien invasion. While you keep fending off hordes of nasty aliens and work your way through the campaign, your AI buddy will educate you on the different kinds of towers it unlocks for you, and will provide intel on any new kind of alien appearing on the battlefield. In addition it will comment every now and then on whatever is happening on the field, always with its distinctive british accent.Every battlefield can be played in a number of different modes, each providing a different challenge on its own, with different waves of aliens and different perks/limits for you to enjoy different playstyles. Visuals are great. Battlefields encompass railroad stages where aliens will be moving on a fixed path and you'll only be allowed to put your towers on the sides, and stages in which you'll be allowed to alter the alien's path by building a maze of towers. The game won't prevent you from blocking the way to the core, but aliens will only follow the path you draw for them so long as there is a legitimate way to do it: you block the way, they'll ignore the maze and just follow the most direct path. You play fair, they do it too.You can speed up the game a little but there is no pause button, so stay focused. Luckily the game provides a well-designed checkpoint system, allowing you to rewind to any one of the save points for that match should the aliens manage to steal a core or two.Definitely recommended!

You want towerdefense classic? you get it..But just like those original TD games, this 1 cant be played for hours straight... infact, the intensity added will only make you play less. 1-2 games and done... and since its fast paced, you wont play for more than a couple of minutes.

												A big big thumbs up for this tower defense game.The campaign is very fleshed out and gives you around 20 levels. After that there are more challenges available.This game wins on so many levels:1.) It is insanely and maddeningly challenging. You will want to replay every mission in the campaign and try not to have any cores taken. 2.) The game rewards you for strategizing and tactics. Incorrectly placed towers will lead you to scream in frustration. Correctly placed towers will give you a huge sense of satisfaction as you correctly and accurately reroute aliens.3.) You can level up each tower with resources gained from fallen aliens. 4.) An insanely high replayability factor. You can replay different missions and see what towers and where works.5.) The voice acting is pretty good, I have to admit. You are kept company on each mission by some British dude talking about his family, his son Zeke, etc. Hammy but a nice touch as you fight off the alien columns.If this is on sale, grab it. One of the better tower defense games. Very, very well done. "

												Defense Grid is one of the best tower defense games ever made. It doesn't deviate much outside the norms for the genre - you accumulate funds over time by killing enemies and gaining interest, and then use these funds to purchase and upgrade towers around the path(s) which enemies take while trying to steal your cores. Successive waves are more difficult, and in some levels you actually build the path yourself by blocking their ability to progress with your towers.Later levels are quite challenging, there's a wide variety of towers, and there's also multiple modes which can add different twists to the gameplay. It's extremely well balanced, allowing for multiple play styles to come up with valid combinations which can be effective.Any fan of the genre should own this game, and it also makes for an excellent introduction to what tower defense games can offer.

												While I find the camera and control much easier to wield on the console version (which is an oddity for this type of game) it doesn't detract - much - from the home computer version of one of the best tower defense games of all time.Rarely does another TD game even approach the level of Defense Grid, much less attempt to surpass it.One caveat is that you have to stick with it for quite a few levels before everything is available to you. This is not uncommon in TD games, but I've known folks who were put off by it.			"

												Picked this up on sale and I've already got almost 10 hours in the game in less than two weeks, and this is the first tower defense game I've ever played or owned.Looks can be deceiving -- this game looks simple, but there's real depth to it, and each successive map opens up new possibilities in terms of strategy and playstyle. The brilliance of the game is how it nudges you out of your comfort zone to try new approaches, without losing what makes it fun.For example, some maps are all about setting up brutal chokepoints that operate like murder mills, with all your firepower concentrated on the alien hordes as they pass through. Other maps require you to set up overlapping fields of fire and cover wide areas because aliens spawn in multiple locations. And some maps are all about closing off alternate paths and forcing the aliens to take the route you want them to take.The towers all have their own strenths. Guns are weak but fire rapidly and can target flying aliens. Cannons pack a punch and can hit flying aliens, but fire slowly. Lasers are great at sapping aliens of hit points, but have a smaller targeting radius and can only harm land units. Inferno towers hit aliens with fire that leaves a DoT effect on them. Tesla towers electrocute aliens. Temporal towers send out pulses that slow aliens down. Missile towers provide air defense. Meteor towers have huge range but fire slowly. Concussion towers shred groups of aliens with AoE explosives. Command towers reveal stealthed enemies and help you recover more resources. And so on...Bottom line: This game is a hell of a lot of fun, and on sale it's practically a steal.			"

Forward 200+ hours, and yes the game is the best tower defence game i have played.A lot of thought is needed and high scores mean building as latest as possible, which carries risk.Im a casual gamer so to play with just a mouse is great while pressing F to fw time. great game. would reccommend highly if you want to lose 200 hours of your life.

												TLDR: Worth it at almost any price, if you like any sort of TD games.DG:TA is a the perfect execution of a standard tower defense game. As usual, the first few missions unlock new towers as you go, but you have all tower options available for the vast majority of the game (rather than only the last couple levels like many TD games). There's no experience points or carry over from level to level. All towers can be upgraded twice, increasing their range/speed/power. Tower variety is really good.Story (8/10) - For a tower defense game, this is probably the best storyline you'll ever find. It's touching, believable, and satisfying. The voice acting is superb, which really helps with the immersion. While I've not played more than a few hours of Portal, even I can appreciate the ties to the game in a hidden bonus console, as well as an entire DLC devoted to it. The game is worth playing through on the easiest difficulty simply for the storyline.Gameplay (10/10) - Levels are very well balanced. Zoom features are great. There's a ""rewind back to a checkpoint"" button that autosaves every few waves (and you can rewind back through multiple checkpoints). Different levels force different tactics, so you'll use almost every tower at least a bit. Artillery can miss. Rewinding can alter the rest of the mission simply because it resets where all the bullets are, and some may/may not miss. Fast forward feature works flawlessly. There's both fairly set path levels, as well as completely wide open levels that you can maze up to 'til your heart's content.Replayability (11+/10) - Every level has a whole mess of ""challenge"" options, such as ""out of bullets"" (no towers that use bullets), ""reverse"" (level is reversed), ""hard"", ""no upgrades"", ""poison"" (the objects you're defending kill the enemies if they're dropped), and on and on and on. There's a leaderboard, and multiple medals for each different option on each different map. This is literally hundreds of hours of content. The DLCs are equally as impressive, with a stronger showing of ""open concept"" levels, they are much harder and present countless different ways to win, and it's rewarding to replay them to find those ways.Sound (7/10) - The effects are good, cannons and explosions are satisfying, ambient noise/music is fitting although you'll probably turn it off if after the first 30 hours (which is pretty darn good anyway). I put the voice acting under the story, but there's fairly consistent comments from your sidekick during the missions that somehow never got annoying even after the millionth time I heard them.Graphics/UI (7/10) - Solidly above average for a TD game of its age. You can zoom in quite close, or zoom out for a view range that's more than far enough. Things look like they're supposed to, enemies are all easily distinguishable. Faster enemies will sometime ""outrun"" where something hits them, so the bullet hitting animation can be slightly behind an enemy (fairly minor problem). The levels show a really good variety without ruining the believability. Menus are very well laid out, as is the ability to see at a glance how you did on each mission (great if you're trying to get all the medals). Nothing here will blow you away, but nothing will annoy you, which is awesome for a TD game.Achievements/Steam Cards (10/10) - They are there, and work flawlessly!Overall (9/10) - For what it is, it might very well be 10/10. I, personally, enjoy continuity between levels, which is the only thing I would have changed to make it perfect in my eyes. Questions like ""Is clicking on specific towers easy, or is mis-clicking common?"" are questions that just won't come up in this game. There is nothing that will detract from the fun of this game, nothing clunky, nothing annoying. You will like it, or not, based on the game concept itself, because the execution is simply done right.			"

I don't usually compete at games, but this one is really fun to try to set new records on.As far as Tower Defense games go, this has to be in the top 5 by anyone's estimation. In mine, it's simply the best.Tower and map variety, enemy specializations, a surprisingly involved story line, and some of the best script work and voice acting all add up to make this one highly re-playable.

												It's basicly just another tower defence game but with decent graphics. The game has fun points but is also very frustrating when you look at all the flaws. For example, towers should always attack the creature closest to the end first, which doesn't always happen, you will often by accident sell a tower in stead of upgrading if you accidentally move your mouse, if you want to sell a tower that's brand-new because you misplaced it you only receive 75% back, the story is very annoying because I would rather just play the levels on skirmish without the story (that doesn't even make sense). I recommend turning off the voice-over in the options because it will turn you insane after restarting a level 5 times. Nevertheless, it is definitely worth the $2,5 (-75% sale) but never the regular $10.			"

												I recommend this game for tower defense fans, and nobody else. Good balanced game; bit tedious; very bad presentation. In some respects this game is the best tower defense game I've played. I consider it to have flaws which diminish the fun.Tower defense: waves of enemies come, and you build static defense weapons to counter them. Defense Grid is a pretty basic tower defense: despite the appearances, enemies seem to be considered one-dimensional dots on a path; weapons always hit. There's a line-of-sight mechanic though, by which towers can't shoot through other towers, and some towers are higher than others, and the levels are considered in 3D for targeting. It isn't immediately obvious what the barriers for targeting are (some towers are considered lower than their model suggests, many can shoot steeper downward than their models can bend).That is the first weakness of the game: there isn't a direct correlation between what you see and what you get. Even the indicator for how far your towers can shoot seems not to precisely correlate to how far they can actually shoot. So now you can enjoy learning the actual capabilities of your weapons by heart.In some stages Defense Grid let's you build towers in the way of your enemies, so that you can make them take a longer route. Often you need to find the longest route to get a good result on a level; the second longest route won't do. They obviously did a lot of balancing to get the stages to work like that. Also the different weapons are well balanced with their costs. So that's one strong point: very subtly balanced game.Second strong point is the resource management. Keep your ""money"" in the bank and you get interest. Very simple, but works perfectly for tower defense games. This is one of the points that makes it rewarding to go for a highscore.The towers don't take any orders, tweaks, or diverging upgrade paths. They will however automatically target enemies they're strong against, which is nice on one hand, but isn't very rewarding. A special class of enemies flies and takes a shorter route. Countering them boils down to saving enough money to buy a special AA-gun on time. It all works, but it feels a bit artificially scripted.For some reason you can't zoom out to see the entire stage at once. If an enemy slips by your defense, you will often not notice it immediately. The game has some checkpoints where it autosaves, so you can rewind the game as much as you like to one of those checkpoints. This is a must for getting good highscores.The enemies are shapeless blobs that could have been somebody's first 3D project. The stages look like the part of the background that you can't actually interact with in other games. There's only one BGM (that interactively changes mood). The sounds of enemies dying is either muffled, or sounds like one of your cannons firing. And you have some posh computer companion with a tragic backstory who tells you what to do. Many people seem to be ecstatic about the voice-acting and humor of that character; I found him annoying and overly dramatic.			"

												I can't say I found this game terribly interesting.  It'sa VERY basic TD.  There's no persistent upgrades, no customization of your loadout, not much story (even for a TD), no optional goals (no rewards for speed, extra cash, perfect no loss, etc..  In many maps you don't even get to choose tower location, the game only gives you a handful of platforms to build on.  I've played better TDs for free on my phone.  MUCH better ones.The upsides are good graphics, lots of maps (if you do like it, you won't run out), and the AI helper is entertaining.  His backstory (what there is) is far more interesting than the story you're playing (kill invaders, the end).I bought it for 2.50 on sale.  For that price, sure, get it.  Don't buy it at full price.			"

												Very basic and well polished tower defense game.  Nice graphics, runs well on low end machines, tons of challenges, and a great menu system.  Only downside that this game has is that it could have used a few more types of towers and some of the levels should have had a bit more placement spots.  Overall a very good tower defense games, only real downside being that it lacks variety. I give it 7.58 thumbs up out of 10 thumbs.			"

												This must be one of the best tower defense games I've ever played. The graphics are solid, the sounds are decent, but the gameplay is so addictive. There are lots of levels, with lots of different enemies and upgradeable towers. They become increasingly difficult but somehow it never frustrates. And I thank the Fast Forward button for that, a button that allows you to speed things up instead of waiting and waiting for enemies to arrive. It's a good way to see if your towers are set correctly, or if they need to be replaced, moved to somewhere else or even upgraded. Lots and lots of fun to be had here, so make sure you own this game as soon as possible.[Rating: 86/100]			"

												I can't say I found this game terribly interesting.  It'sa VERY basic TD.  There's no persistent upgrades, no customization of your loadout, not much story (even for a TD), no optional goals (no rewards for speed, extra cash, perfect no loss, etc..  In many maps you don't even get to choose tower location, the game only gives you a handful of platforms to build on.  I've played better TDs for free on my phone.  MUCH better ones.The upsides are good graphics, lots of maps (if you do like it, you won't run out), and the AI helper is entertaining.  His backstory (what there is) is far more interesting than the story you're playing (kill invaders, the end).I bought it for 2.50 on sale.  For that price, sure, get it.  Don't buy it at full price.			"

												I have to be a voice for reason with this game. With this being considered the gold standard in tower defense games I have to wonder if people who love this have ever played some of the GOOD free online tower defence games- Kingdom Rush and Cursed Treasure being two of the most recognizable names.This game just makes me feel sad. The graphics attempt to be realistic but fall short. The gameplay is like shredded wheat- dry, bland, boring and repetitive. Look, there are obviously lots of people who think this game is great, but there must be a reason you're looking in the Negative Reviews section. My advice is: don't believe the hype. This game is average at best, and I have no urge or desire to keep playing it.			"

												Fun at first but gets boring and tedious real quick. No persistent upgrades so there's no real feeling of progression thru the levels.

												This is the most fantastic tower defense game ever made! It is simple to operate and very hard to master, to get you in the top ranks. I love toping the high scores of my friends.It has not only got the story line, it also has challenges to play once you have gone through the story. I have played this game over 400 hours and still can't get enough of it.As I stated on top, the game as such is easy to play, but very hard to master and get the super high scores! But that is the fun of it once you have played through. Try hitting better scores and optimizing your points earned. This game has so much to it when you try to master the levels.I also recommend to get the DLCs. They are just as fun as the main game.For me . . . the best game ever made!!! . . .			"

												Gave it another try and the game seems decent, but it makes me not want to play. You have to slowly sell towers at end of a level for higher score and the game doesn't tell you that you gain more interest when you have more resources. It's frustrating not to know this on early missions when you are going for gold medals.I wouldn't have tried the game for longer if I didn't stumble upon this information when googling for ""defense grid towers"". Not only that, but comparing the game to other TDs that I've tried, it feels a little too slow or too basic.I guess if you like mazing with basic towers (later in the game) or spending time on trying to understand how to beat a level without any knowledge on how to get a higher resource gain, give it a try.

												Standard tower defense game, build towers (limited mazing), kill waves of monsters, defend your main base.  The main difference with this tower defense is that enemies must ""steal"" lives from you meaning if you can kill them shortly after they reach your main base you can recover those lives they stole.This is a bit older and should probably be ported to mobile as the graphics and gameplay are pretty standard when compared to your average mobile tower defense these days.Nothing new to see here so if you're looking for some sort of complex or rewarding game you'll have to look elsewhere.  If you're just looking for a casual TD with lots of ladders, achievements, and such then you might enjoy it for a few days!			"

												I love Strategy games. And it's hard to find good strategy games that I haven't played already and got bored of them. Now, what I love more than strategy games? Tower defense games. And this is the only good Tower Defense game I've seen in Steam so far.The story is okay. I wasn't really expecting something good as Half-Life anyway, but it makes the job. The enemies are generic aliens who want to take over the world, and you, and some sort of IA have to deal with them using towers. Is that simple. Now, what makes the game good? A nice amount of strategy, lots and lots of maps, a good number of towers to use, and LOTS OF MODES to play. And not only that, but there are maps made by comunity members.The DLC's are, most of them, worth it. Good and cheap maps with extra dificulty. If I have to choose one, it's quite obvious the Portal DLC is the best one. And if you're a guy who doesn't want to buy lots of DLC's, just buy this one and ignore the others.I still play this game from time to time. And I had it for like, a year or even more. If that doesn't show that it's good enough, you might want to try it yourself, since it had a lot of sales and price drops during events, like the one going on now.Now, if companies made more of these games, instead of more generic FPS...

												There's just nothing to it. It's a pretty simple tower defense game that makes no meaningful improvements over anything you might have played on Kongregate or in WarCraft III custom maps. It's well made, looks pretty nice, and is a top-to-bottom competent product, but given that there are so many kooky variations that not only cost less, but are flat out better, you should give Defensive Grid a miss.

												This game SEEMS like a great tower defense game, but I think there's a major flaw: It isn't FUN. The maps are big and there are so many ways you could lay out your defense.... yet, as each defense you try fails or barely succeeds, you get the feeling that there is actually only one or two ways to beat each challenge. That isn't fun to me. I think tower defense games need to choose whether the ""solution"" to a challenge is intuitive and you can find it after a few tries, OR whether you can decide how to build your defense and there are many ways to win. When a tower defense game gives you many options AND requires you to play a very specific way, I call that TEDIUM. You have to play the whole challenge (they are quite long) over and over until you find out the successful layout.You could say I'm just not that great at the game, but I never consider ""you're just not good enough"" or ""there are people out there who can do it"" to be a strong defense (no pun intended) for a tedius and difficult game. I think if I play video games pretty often and I tend to be good at them, I should be able to achieve moderate success in a game without investing hundreds of hours. For that reason, I can't recommend this game. Non-hardcore tower defense fans will probably enjoy this game up to a point then realize that it's is either hopeless or way too time consuming and demanding.			"

												Everywhere I went on the Internet, I was told this was the ultimate tower defense game, excellent in every single detail.Don't get me wrong. This game has an amazing level of polish. It has everything good tower defense games should have. If you have not played many tower defense games, then it is probably going to be an amazing experience for you.However, Grid is exactly that, and no more: a game that takes all the basics from tower defense games and make them work perfectly. There is nothing more. There is nothing new. You will play with the same basic boring towers you have been playing with since the very first TDs on Warcraft. No ambition, nothing new, nothing exciting. Even the strategic depth is minimal, leaving you sometimes with no choice on where to build your towers. It is a great production, but with no innovation. Frankly, some indie games or even some flash TDs are more innovative and addictive.Grid, because it has NOTHING that makes it different from other super-classic TDs, will fail exactly where all the classic ones failed: it becomes quickly repetitive, boring and brainless. Such a shame when we think that a tiny bit of innovation would have made it a seriously great game.			"

												With many expansion and map packs to boot, this one stands tall among tower defense games. Great graphic, fluid gameplay and many contents available for cheap. Learning curve isn't steep at all. You place a tower, wait for money to come by killing enemies, upgrade the tower and protect your cores. Simple, yet satisfying to watch.For people who prefer to lie back when playing like me, plug in a controller (or x360ce) and you can play easily with it. You can't go wrong by getting this game.			"

Towerdefense CodeifiedTower Defense. That's all you need to know. Think of your standard Tower Defense Game, Give it some sweet 3d graphics, a challenging difficulty curve and a soothing british voice as a narrator, and you'll have this game. It doesn't do much beyond one new thing compared to the standard tower defense (TD). NO fancy gimmicks, no trick twists, no surprises. IT is as standard as you can get in terms of mechanics. In terms of graphics, this is where the polish comes in and boy did they polish it. What id does add is a surprising bit of subtle story-telling through your AI Advisor. I won't spoil it but really, it's right up there with the Stanley Parable and the Bastion Narrator. Without this guy, the game becomes a well polished but soulless husk of a game.As for negatives. Well  it has a crazy difficulty curve and is not advised if you OCD.. COmpleting the missions is not terribly difficult. COmpleting a mission with a gold star ranking on the other hand... Yeah. Plus each map has a plethora of challenge modes. Really it is the fun sort of game if you like a Tower Defense game that makes you think and plan.About the only othe negative is that there's not really anything here for people who aren't already fans of the genre. If you know you like Tower Defense, give this game a shot. if you're not sure, give it a shot but be careful. YOu'll find the 2 hour limit goes by pretty quickly. "

												Nice challenging fast paced tower defense game that is really great in levels you have great amount of free spots and you can freely build different types of towers and change aliens paths.It gets frustrating really fast in levels where is only few spots and lots of crossroads, you have usually only one way how to beat such levels. You have to quess right order and right time in which you build (or upgrade) right tower, so there comes attemp-fail scheme and frustration of course.Was suprised by controls but got used to it fast. Flying aliens have different paths (different from ground units) its great idea, cause you have limeted number of spots for towers and you have to think more wisely. Also towers are obstacles for each other, so one tower cant fire through the other etc. some game mechanics are great.Real minus for me is that  you cant zoom out or pause the game (well, you can honestly, but you will see only menu then) - there is also no minimap or something, so you cant stop and think about your strategy/next few moves. This game really wasnt meant to be played on small screens/resolutions and slow.I can imagine that with proper hardware the impression can be different, cause presentation is great (graphic, voiceacting, additional content... ) but ... im not sure. This is definitely not game for me (and my PC).			"

If you are one who sits and randomly moves controls it is a game with a bellow standard action moves that you make. It s developers made CS Global Offensive with the same lack of control fail. It is all a big failure of modern gaming. Even Mount and Blade has more thrills althouhg has no gamepad support. "

												You are mankind's last, best hope against the alien horde.   Unfortunately, you are also an intergalactic hobo forced to scrape together every last penny you own to purchase the towers you so desperately need to hold back the alien menace.  Once you own some towers, you can improve them.  Well, you would be able to improve them except that you are far too poor to afford it.  And then at the end of each board, if you manage to hold back the aliens, any money you did manage to accumulate over the course of the board is taken away so you can be returned to a state of abject poverty in preparation for the next board.  Your performance is graded partially on how successful you were in defending the 'cores' (your main objective) and partially on how 'wasteful' you were with your meager funds.  Apparently you are supposed to defend the cores with an absolute bare minimum and if you do manage to build a secure defense that stops the aliens dead in their tracks... well... you've done something wrong and need to be penalized in terms of score.  The layouts of many of the boards are interesting and provide you with many options on how you can halt the oncoming horde... if you had the money to actually carry it out.  I also had the feeling in many places that although it appeared that I had many options, there was a particular way most boards were 'supposed' to be done.  This gives the game the unpleasant feeling of a guessing game where you set up a defense only to find out that the designers had something else in mind, and as the aliens burst through your defensive line you are (as usual) flat broke and unable to change your strategy without backstepping to an earlier point and simply making a different guess.That said, the base concept still makes for an interesting tower defense style game.   The graphics are good and the voice acting is very good.  The towers types are interesting and the ability to actually shape the path of the aliens by blocking some access points with towers gives this game an edge over other tower defense games.  However, I feel that Defense Grid 2 carried these concepts out in a better and more entertaining way than this game.			"

												Defense Grid: The Awakening is a Tower Defense game where you do what you do in every TD, place towers and kill aliens. It has a solid base and levels achievements are earned by not spending too many resources and keeping all your power cores from being stolen. Everythign works as expected, however I cannot recommend this game.The Awakening is just too basic to get through as a good TD that costs money. I can find many more entertaining games back from the era where everyone was hanging out on Xgen-Studios. There are no upgraded between levels, only the most basic tower models and a nonexistent story. The only thing that this game has more of than most TDs is grapics. There is no motivation to re-play a campaign than any stupid handicaps you can put on yourself, every session is closed in itself and you do not take any bonuses to the next level. Enemies are very boring (5 types of walkers with scaling health, fast ones, flying ones), they only offer the most basic enemies. The game got boring very quickly and I had much more fun playing other TDs for free.			"

Product received for free
												(I accidently pressed the recieved for free button, just ignore that, my bad)TLDR version-----------------Pros:- Some fun maps- Good variety of game modes for maps- Good music, sound effects and voice acting- A story that actually works for a tower defense gameCons:- DLC- Too much trial and error- Feels like a puzzle game- Most of the towers are useless- Awkward to play without a controller- Some game modes feel too impossible to beatIn depth review:I love strategy games, in the 90s there was an excess of these games and most of them were good or at the very least worth playing. Most people claim that Warcraft invented the tower defense game genre, but that is far from the truth. These kind of games already existed and Warcraft merely popularized it.That being said, a tower defense game is a different take on the RTS genre. Taking in strategy and a finite amount of space that a player can actually use. I like tower defense games, however I have only played very few games that are ACTUAL tower defense games.Most of games in this genre are nothing more than… how do I put it…. Glorified puzzle games. As in that only a preset combination of towers placed on specific spots will result in victory. Or that there isn’t even a fixed path leaving it to the player to figure out how to shape the way.Don’t get me wrong, I don’t mind these things, but I do mind it when 80% of a tower defense game is like that. At that point it just stops being a tower defense game, because suddenly you’re not using strategy anymore but trial and error in order to win a level.At first I liked the game, in fact I liked the campaign so much I even bought a few DLC packs. Which was a big mistake on my part, I don’t even know what exactly you’re supposed to do. None of the extra maps have a predefined path, none of them. It’s not nothing more than just replaying it again and again until you finally find out where you have to put the towers.Another problem that I noticed is the fact that you have so many towers, yet you could finish most of the maps with nothing more than fully upgraded gun towers. Why even bother using the others? Why even bother playing this puzzle game?So in the end, don’t spend your money on this, don’t even bother with the sequel.			"

												I must retract my earlier comments on this game. After playing it some more and especially after trying some of the DLC missions, I must say that Defense Grid has serious balancing issues. It is simply way too hard.Even on standard difficulty, I have tried a single mission for hours now - never even close to winning it. And it was one of the ""easier"" missions, not even in one of the special challenge modes. If you like frustration, try it all you want. Everybody else should skip this game.			"

As tower defense goes, this game generally follows the standard layout/structure (bullets/fire/slow/mortar/missiles). They throw in some interesting ideas of what towers can do (sniper/tesla/command). Unfortunately there are entire levels where you never want nor need most of them - a real waste of options and menu space.Sadly, the gameplay grinds along at what can only be described as ""inexorable"". Pacing was not a high point of this game's design, evidently. Waves of enemies came and went, but all I really wanted the entire game was a speed toggle instead of having to hold down a key to accelerate gamespeed. I really only looked forward to getting it over with, by the time each level was finished. Level design was interesting but quickly became too big and too bulky. Getting to the end of ten minutes of planning out and building a massive gauntlet, just to find that a single unit can still make it through, was met with dread instead of a curiosity or anticipation. There is little room for error in most of the levels - if you want a good score, that is. Placing a tower that blocked unit pathing was allowed and suddenly they could just walk through your towers with no ill effect. Lastly, fine-tuning the towers (with upgrades) was never needed or necessary - new towers are just better and there is always room for more towers.The final flaw was that each level was far too isolated, lending to a disruptive lack of cohesion in the story. Lost a core (life/hitpoint)? It'll be back in the next level! Lots of resources at the end of one level? Too bad, they're gone! There was great opportunity to build a bank&store system with persistence in campaign, but they obviously missed those chances.The game has some intriguing ideas and some fun DLC (GLADoS content is always good!), but they introduce an obnoxious relay/replace gameplay mechanic that only serves to frustrate and annoy. In summary, the game under-delivers on the core elements of tower defense and underwhelms with its thinly-veiled attempts at innovating on this genre. I cannot give this game a recommendation rating, but it's worth throwing a couple of bucks at it (Steam sales! Woo!) just for the story mode and a single playthrough.			"

Nothing special about it really. I guess if you're a HUGE TD fan then buy this game. If you're looking for an interesting and complex TD then move on, this isn't worth the price.			"

Since these options are absent, you can't tell which tower would be most efficient to upgrade.			"

												If you have ever played a tower defense game, you've played them all. Dont give me that look, you jackass. It's horribly true. The only difference is what they call the towers and enemies. I thought this was Sol Survivor for a minute.Frankly, this stuff makes me snore. I try to get into it, I really do, but something about the reward mechanics for NOT spending money on more towers, and pure efficiency goals..... it's just crap. If I'm going to use something efficiently, it's not because I used less when I could have used more, it's because I used what I had to greater effect. Having to restart missions over and over to find the perfect sequence of tower placement and upgrades isn't as fun as it is tedious.7 / 12			"

It also has a global scoreboard tracker so that you can compete against the community. A few of the levels have a resource cap mode that starts you out with max resources so that you can perfect your tactics and strategies for the waves of enemies. If you're like me you'll end up with a handful of favorite levels that you keep returing to. I've got plenty of hours into the game so far and I'll have plenty more into it before Defense Grid 2 comes out.			"

												If you like Tower Defense style games, then this is an easy pick for you.  It has both mazing-style maps and straight-shot creep runs, and a little story line to go with it.  Throughout the story you're being assisted (or assisting)  your ""defense matrix"".  This witty little robotic entity keeps you company and helps you out with learning each of the new map elements and towers that are thrown at you.  With the storyline, differing maps, and pretty decent graphics, I would heartily recommend this game to anyone interested in Tower Defenses.			"

												Meteors, lasers, guns, alien guts. Very challenging in terms of knowing your enemy and how to defeat them with the right amount of resources. 10/10 for a tower defense game; must-play for the genre. Having played this casually for about 4.5 years-ish(?), I can attest to how much this game still holds up. Definitely enjoyed it.With 87 achievement completion [finally], I can put this one up on the shelf of great games in my Library and move on to DG2 to see what more awaits me there. Strongly recommend the 'Containment' campaign + assorted DLC as a prelude to the 2nd game and what's going on in that one. (But you can pick that one up and jump right in, no problem.)A.D.D. Moment: it'd be cool to have your own personal A.I. buddy like Fletcher is. He's legit.			"

It's you and your buddy against the world.I like to feel immersed (I like RPGs) and that added a layer of nuance to tower defense (the voice) was appreciated.edit: you can also come back to the game after a while, and if any of your friends play it, you can compete against their score.

												This is a superior Tower Defence game that rewards tactics and preparation. Starting with a gentle learning curve (and one of the few flaws of the game is that the earlier levels act as tutorials which hampers their replay value) it introduces you to an array of towers and tactics, each with their own advatanges and disadvantages against the diverse array of aliens that you would place them to kill.The gameplay mechanics, as befits the genre, are simple: you place towers alongside or in the way of the enemie's path to prevent them passing. Simple to grasp but, with an array of both towers at your disposal and enemies conspiring against you, tricky to master. Many times you find yourself going to earlier save points within a level or restarting it to try a different combination or placement.The sounds are good and the graphics all of a piece and attractive enough. The in game commentary and voice over can get a little annoying sometimes, but does add personality to the proceedings.			"

												Defense grid is an excently crafted tower defense game. excelent level design, tower choices, and creative enemy character models and types. it doesnt do anything really super inovative, but it hits all the points a tower defense game should have and it hits them perfectly. it starts of easy and quickly ramps up the challenge. expect to have to do some levels more then once. this is the best tower defense game i have ever played.

												Fun tower defense game with great graphics and good tower variety. The later levels can become quite challenging as there is really no set path for the enemy. You have to design the path with your tower placement, trying to make it as long as possible while balancing your funds for upgrades. There is also challenge modes and other fun modes to add variety to the levels. There are about 30 or more levels in 3 campaigns, although only the first campaign is of substantial length. Fun game though.			"

This game is just pure fun plain and simple.  The interface is very intuitive and flows very well with no clutter.  You can play this game entirely with just your mouse.  I recommend picking this one up if it is on sale but even for 10 bucks it is well worth it.			"

												If you're looking for a pure TD game, this is it.  This is the one TD game that I keep coming back to over and over again.  It has a decent enough story to warrant a playthrough, but the sheer number of challenge scenarios on each stage add in lots of replayability.  What you won't find are the gimmicks in some other TD games such as a first-person perspective or being able to control a ""hero"" to to make the game more ""action-y"".  This one is strictly placing towers and trying to come up with a strategy to survive, so it's a lot more focused on the strategy aspect of TD games than the action aspect.  There are a lot of Tower Defense games out there, but for a strictly no-gimmicks tower defense game, this one does it best.			"

												Honestly wasn't expecting much from this game, but I was pleasantly surprised. I've never been very good at RTS's but enjoyed them, and for me, Defence Grid is like RTS's for dummies (I mean that in the best way possible). It still takes some fast thinking to defeat those evil invading aliens from taking your shiny blue orbs, but nothing that's going to take precise second to second timing. So if you're looking for something easy going that still has a challenge, this may be it.			"

												Kicking where it’s due: The game gets repetitive quickly and all the add-ons are more of the same except the portal themed pack (the portal themed pack is called “You Monster”) which like the main campaign does have something of a story.The good: A very enjoyable game, finished to a very impressive standard. I especially liked the narrator’s voice acting (and voice acting IS a hobby horse on mine). For the completionists there are a number of challenges for every map. And personally the difficult is about right (easy-good). I rate this game: 7/10 Meaning positively good. Nearly every element is fantastic. However the concept is old which I do not like to see in Indie. The game for me gets repetitive with few levels requiring path lying. I’d like to see a “Double-Speed, Fast Forward” since I have to sit through most of the bloody game and I think the demo REALLY showed what this game could be, the full game feels a little ... bit of a backwards step.

												I love this game so much! Each level is challenging on it's own and couple that with the different modes makes this that much more enjoyable. There are endless possibilites and outcomes to each mode which makes it a game you can consistently play and modify your strategies. I cannot tell you how many hours I can waste on one level just to restart over again and repeat the process over and over and over. I am nearly complete the entire game and I can honestly say that this is the best tower defense game I've enjoyed. Whether or not you like tower defense games, I love the strategy behind each move I'm forced to make.			"

												The addiction to Defense Grid builds as you play. First it's simply to beat each level. Then it is to beat each level without losing a single core. Then you begin to focus on improving your score. From there, you want to beat your friends scores, and of course, try to achieve all the achievements. But always, you will replay to polish your layout, your design, change your towers to see what works better, and try to figure out why you never seem to use Tower Type X (Fire, Concussion, etc).This is a great game with endless hours of playtime, further fed by the DLCs.You'll soon be waiting with bated breath for Defense Grid 2!

Lots of different modes and challenges.Will keep you busy for many hours and is worth the money.Just be warned and try to not lose your patience and break your keyboard.I personally liked P vs. Z better but thats just me. :P,As far as being the best of it's kind?I'm sure it is to some, just not me.Still liked it and is on my favorites list when ever i feel like killing some aliens.4* out of 5*			"

												Beeing a bit late to this genre of games (just played a few casual iOS TD games) I managed to discover Defense Grid: The Awakening. It was basically mentioned on almost all Top-10 Lists for TD games on the internet and therefore I had to try it out. What can I say: I'm hooked. I spend way to much time playing this instead of working. Beeing generally a casual gamer I could never be bothered with perfect scores or gold medals etc, however with this game for the first time ever I really want to try hard and earn a gold medal in each and every level.Best thing in my opinion is, that the game makes it easy for a newbie to enter the world of TD, however it seems to offer enough challenge when becoming more experienced in the future to keep me hooked for a long time.Needless to say, that I already spent additional money on the DLC and can't wait for the sequel :-)			"

												Decent tower defense (TD) game.  These guys almost got it.  I miss the TDs that allow you to do your own mazing though.  Most TD developers don't seem to understand what makes a good TD... freedom to build your own defense system from the ground up.  When you take mazing out of the equation, you simplify the game and bore the gamer.  Developers really need to take a good hard look at the pioneers of TDs... in Warcraft III custom games.			"

												The best tower defense game on the market.  Casual enough for anyone to enjoy, but enough strategy for you to constuct a plan.  Nice graphics, music and sounds.  The voice acting in particular is amazing.  In this game you have to protect these blue speheres or ""cores"" from alien creatures, that sometimes look like robots from taking and running off with.  To stop them you get the usual various towers which you can upgrade and do more damage with.  You try to stop them before they run off with all of your blue spheres.  The premise is very simple, it is just a layer of quality that really sets this one apart from the others out there.  If you have ever liked tower defense or just want to try something different, this is the best in the genre.			"

												I see the players who've spent hundreds of hours on this game and I can...I can really understand it. This isn't just one of the best tower defense games ever made, it's one of the best games ever made, period. There's a finely honed balance between clever level design, basic resource management, and tower type & placement. It all adds up to a truly nailbiting experience, with just enough brain-teasing frustration to make you feel accomplished once you beat a campaign.It's a superb example of what game designers can accomplish by layering simple gameplay systems on top of each other, and fine-tuning through play balancing. Post-release support and free DLC updates only make the game that much more replayable.			"

												Defense Grid has everything that you might not expect from a tower defense game: original gameplay, a polished interface, great artwork and visuals, and even some nice voice acting. It also has the things that you probably would expect, like an assortment of different towers that may be upgraded, different types of enemies to defend against, and a variety of levels in which to try out particular strategies.In Defense Grid, you must defend your planet from an old, forgotten enemy. You take control of a dormant defense grid to fend off these alien invaders. Unlike many other tower defense games, the goal is not simply to stop the enemies from reaching the end of their path. Rather, you must prevent the aliens from stealing your power cores, which reside in a special housing. Thus each alien will walk from a starting point to the power core housing, and then to the exit. In many levels you have the option of shaping the aliens' paths by placing towers in their way.The cores provide an interesting addition to the gameplay. If an alien carrying a stolen core is killed, the core will slowly float back to its housing unless it gets intercepted by another alien. Keeping your cores in their housing allows you to collect additional ""interest"" on your resources, which can be used to buy and upgrade more towers. A particular core can trade hands many times, so even with a long and deadly path of towers, a large enough swarm of aliens will manage to get a core through if you aren't careful. You only need to keep one core protected to win a particular level, but saving all of the cores is necessary to get a silver or gold medal and a high score.The game features 10 different types of towers, 15 types of enemies, and 20 levels. There are also a number of DLC packs which offer additional levels. Each level also has a number of challenge modes which can be unlocked. These challenges often mix up the gameplay, such as by restricting which types of towers you may buy, or by altering the aliens' direction, and so on.But the most striking feature of the game is its presentation. Tower defense veterans may be used to playing Flash games with crude graphics in their web browsers, but Defense Grid's production values are comparable to most other high quality commercial games. The graphics, sound, interface, and level design were all executed very well, and there is enough content to last quite a few hours. The plot is fairly minimal, but it features a main character who has a surprising level of personality.You really shouldn't miss this one. Defense Grid offers the best of tower defense, whether you're new to the genre or an already avid fan. I highly recommend it.			"

												This is a superior Tower Defence game that rewards tactics and preparation. Starting with a gentle learning curve (and one of the few flaws of the game is that the earlier levels act as tutorials which hampers their replay value) it introduces you to an array of towers and tactics, each with their own advatanges and disadvantages against the diverse array of aliens that you would place them to kill.The gameplay mechanics, as befits the genre, are simple: you place towers alongside or in the way of the enemie's path to prevent them passing. Simple to grasp but, with an array of both towers at your disposal and enemies conspiring against you, tricky to master. Many times you find yourself going to earlier save points within a level or restarting it to try a different combination or placement.The sounds are good and the graphics all of a piece and attractive enough. The in game commentary and voice over can get a little annoying sometimes, but does add personality to the proceedings.			"

												If you like Tower Defense style games, then this is an easy pick for you.  It has both mazing-style maps and straight-shot creep runs, and a little story line to go with it.  Throughout the story you're being assisted (or assisting)  your ""defense matrix"".  This witty little robotic entity keeps you company and helps you out with learning each of the new map elements and towers that are thrown at you.  With the storyline, differing maps, and pretty decent graphics, I would heartily recommend this game to anyone interested in Tower Defenses.			"

												This is probably the most satisfying pure tower defense game I've played. A nice mix of towers, interesting enemies, forgiving gameplay, challenging levels, enjoyable atmosphere. It's really fun to start a level, blank and empty, and have no idea what to do. But then you break it down and build a maze, figure out the right combo of turrets, and win by a small margin. And then you think of a way you could have done it even better. There's never quite enough money or enough good building spots. The compromise and multiple solutions makes it interesting.

												This is a truly fun game. I really like the tower defense genre, but I am more drawn to games that look and play like this one. With a more real-world look and sci-fi atmosphere and story. Rather than the more fantasy oriented games with magical abilities, and cartoonish look. I like Fletcher, with his British accent. He is the AI that helps you on every stage. He operates the defense system and processes the the remains of destroyed aliens into resources for you to build and upgrade the towers. You never see him but his voice always encourages you and he provides an interesting plot for the game. You can see I have a ridiculous number of hours in this game - but that is because I became rather obsessed with playing a perfect game on as many stages as I could. For that you need to play through the stage without allowing any power cores to be stolen by the aliens. To accomplish that I would quit a game once the aliens got through my towers with a couple of cores, and then revise my strategy and start over. The amazing thing was on some of the perfect games that I played, there were still 50 or 60 thousand games on the leader board with higher scores than mine! Getting all of the DLC for this game greatly adds to the playing time by adding new stages and plots including one that had the voice of GLADOS from Portal! And there is replayability by playing the same stages with different circumstances and goals. Like playing the standard storyline stage with the alien entry and exit points reversed. Some of these are very difficult, like the Super Grinder mode which has 99 waves of aliens, instead of 20 -30 waves. THis game has very few weak points, and I'm looking forward to Defense Grid 2!

												Defense Grid is without a doubt my most favorite tower defense game that I've ever played.  I'm biased against laser towers (but others love them), but I like how most of the towers actually have a purpose and the game lets you choose what strategy you want.  Multiple solutions exist for almost all stages unless you're doing the ultra-difficult challenge modes like ""Out of Bullets"" and ""Green Towers Only"".I will admit that I am biased toward Defense Grid, as this game let me go to the Portal 2 launch party, so it'll always be a little special to me.  I spoke to the developers and they are incredibly nice people.  One more fact:  This is one of the few modern games that was released on the PC first and then ported to the console.			"

												Hell yes! One of the best tower defense games i've ever played. Excellent graphics, great sound, interesting aliens to combat, fantastic, innovative and imaginative levels with multiple ways to finish them (not all but most of them). Towers are also very well made, they give the user a good feedback on what they do and how effective they are and best of all, their placement and upgrading is incredibly straight forward and easy to use (with grid based placement), so gameplay itself is a real joy.There are tons of levels with the stock game, but i highly recommend buying all the expansions and DLC's. I've bought and played the extra maps as they were released and they were well worth it.Cons or dislikes? If i'm truly honest, i can't think of a single one. Maybe that they aren't making new missions anymore (i'd even pay for them like i did before). That's about the only critic i have for this game.So, if you feel a need for some puzzle alien shooting in a tower defense type of a game, look no further, because this is it. The mother of all tower defense games. Say whatever you want, i think the game is absolutely amazing, great looking and just plain fun.			"

												If you're into Tower Defense, this one is really good. It doesn't have that many options, even if there is already quite a few different turrets, upgrades consist only of turret evolution (no branching system) - but somehow, there are a lot of different stragegies to tackle each level, most of them being very well conceived.The difficulty ranges from easy (earlier level) to nightmarish (the last ones, especially in some special modes).Overall and for its price, a very nice game.

												I've been an ""almost a fan"" of tower defense games for a long time. Either they were too hard or required too much micro management to master. Defense Grid however is a great game. Every mission once you beat it in story mode unlocks other modes of play on that map. Each one adding difficulty in the form of a twist on the normal gameplay. Added to that trying to get the gold score on each map and you've got a lengtty game ahead of you. Not to mention the DLC. Very much, very much worth the price of admission. One of the few tower defense games I actually like and still play.			"

												Defense Grid is a brilliant game of its kind.  Build a maze of horrors that no rat can survive!  OK, it's actually aliens trying to steal power cores and destroy your computer AI pal or something.  The alien types are many and varied, as are the different towers you can build, of course.  Do you rely on machine guns?  Flamethrowers?  Long range cannon?  Time warp towers?  Lasers?  These and many more are deployed strategically and in interesting tactical combination to ensure the worst possible time for the alien invaders.  I would recommend this game without hesitation as a solid $20 title.  The list price of $9.99 is a steal and if you can get it on sale after that, oh brother.  Don't wait another day to pick up this great game.			"

												Defense is grid is a pure classical Tower Defense, with no RPG or FPS stuff. In fact it is the quintessential TDWhat makes it stand apart of the crowd of TD are:+ The quality of its production, and it's 3D engine (fixed wiev however), No cute gfx or mobile apps looks.+ The excellent finetuned gameplay,+ Waypoints avoid to start the missions all over from the start,+ Easy and straightforward controls, + Good scoring system, plus leaderboard, make replaying for high scores meaningful.+ Numerous play modes, ensure a good replayability- The only downside for me, is that when the map is full of level 3 towers, all the blasts and kabooms cause some minor eyestrain (actually this is the case with many TDs).Recommended to anyone with an interest in TD.

												Defense Grid: Awakening is a nice Clean and tidy Tower Defense Game.Its Maps are divided into quadratic fields where you can build the Towers. It has 20 Levels from the get go, various DLC`s and Community Maps, so on the scope of the Game there is nothing Bad to say.There is a rather expendable Story for every Map, but additionally there all sorts of Mods (for example Reverse Level or Horde Mode).The Level design varies a bit, there are Maps with wide open Arias where you can build your own Tower Maze to your Hearts Content, but also more Levels where you are given are very Limited set of fields to build. And so the Difficulty and Strategy fluctuates quiet a bit. I would not say that its a difficult Game to beat, but to Master every Level on Gold there is quiet a bit of Level study and learning if and when which Wave of Enemy's is coming.Pro:-Level variety-Enemy variety-Easy to learn, hard to masterContra:-Learning Curve has spikesSo clear Recommendation. Especially for this price (Game is in addition often discounted). "

												DG is really the rolls royce of tower defence games. There is really not much out there that can hold a candle to it in terms of quality, both of gameplay and presentation, and story.It has a reasonable learning curve and will hold your hand for a while but many of the levels can prove quite challenging and you will likely need to come back to them, to conquer them.One of the best bits is that most of my gaming opportunities come in small bites of time, like 20mins or half an hour. This game is ideal for that sort of slot, with a decent amount of fun and payoff in that time.I do like to give something a try, see how it goes, then perhaps come away for a day or so and while you're at work, or on the train, you think, ""What would have happened if I had tried this or that, or put that turret there?"" and then you can go back and try it.  So I love to try new approaches and see if I can come up with new ideas to defend the levels better. or just try new ideas.All in all it's an awesome little game, and likely worth far more than you'll pay for it!

The different weapons (each with 3 levels eventually) and assist towers allow for multiple ways to beat each map.  There are a couple maps that will challenge you to get the gold on.			"

												This is one of the best games that I have ever played. The graphics are great, the sound is great, and the number of available missions (and variants) is great. There are a vast amount of different approaches that can be taken with most of the missions, and just upgrading all of your guns usually will not work. The medals, leaderboard scoring, and the achievements provide something to strive for. There is quite possibly over 100 hours of game play in all of the core and DLC missions combined, so getting this title on sale would be an absolute steal, and well worth it at regular price.			"

												Of all the tower defense games I've seen and played, this is the most polished and professional.Each scenario is well balanced with enough variety in towers and placement, as well as game modes per level, to keep things interesting. Each of the 10 or so towers you can build are unique enough that even late game, you are using a wide variety; there's no ""best"" tower. Every tower can also be upgraded for more damage/faster fire rate/increased range.Leaderboards are done extremely well in this game. Your score is ranked worldwide, but then you also see your friends and their scores. This gives it a much more competative feel since you can see how you measure up to your friends per scenario.The story isn't anything fantastic, but compared to other tower defense games (which usually have no story), it's good.There is no multi-player and no map editor. Check Defense Grid 2 if interested in these.This game is my benchmark for other tower defense games, and most fall far short of this one.			"

												Excellent game. On each level you have to place a variety of defensive towers, choosing the position and type of tower carefully thanks to your limited budget. As waves of enemies try to cross the map, your towers will (hopefully) wipe them out, earning you extra funds which you can spend on ... more towers. The strategy element is strong - do you place lots of cheap towers, or keep replacing a handful of towers with more powerful (and very expensive) upgrades? The waves of aliens are varied enough to keep you guessing, and there are dozens of levels to play through.			"

In fact it may seem a bit too easy at first but things quickly escalate and soon you realize you are becoming engrossed, and with each level, the number of choices available expands greatly as does the difficulty.

If you're going for full completion, you're looking at several hundred hours of game time.  I'd say that makes it well worth the cost.  Oh, and do get the You Monster DLC.

I've found it to be one of the best tower defense games I've ever played, perhaps even the best.Gameplay wise there's a lot of variety in the levels and how you can play them, varying in difficulty from pushover to devilishly hard. There's just enough types of towers to give you a lot of options but not enough for there to be any real overlap in their roles. The voice acting, while limited to just one character, (two if you count the ""You Monster"" DLC) is top notch.In addition to all this the game has gotten plenty of love from the developer over time with bug fixes and DLC with new maps and gameplay. The ""You Monster"" DLC also has some gameplay very different to anything else so far.Oh and there's a demo, so check that out!			"

												This is a fairly solid tower defense game. You build towers on strategic spots on a map to prevent aliens from stealing cores. There is a  large assortment of towers to choose from, and you will need to learn the purpose of most of them to do well.This game has a handful of issues. The strategies that it offers are interesting, but they don't seem to be as effective as they should be. The game offers that you build towers in the way of aliens to shape their paths. If they are not given a choice, they will pass throught the shield of the nearest tower. Unfortunately, the AI tends to bug out and ignore this, passing through shields despite there being another unobstructed path. Also, certain aliens seem to have implausibly high resistances to damage. More than once I have had a line of cannons firing a storm of shells at tiny poorly armored units and fail to kill them. More than once I've had badly damaged heavy armor pass by multiple towers of any kind and slip away at the last core			"

												Defense Grid is a tower defense game, meaning that you strategically place different types of towers to damage enemies as they move past, occasionally using towers to determine their paths through the level. Defense Grid introduces nothing new to the genre, offering little more than the basics: building, upgrading, and selling towers. That said, I'm a fan of tower defense games, and this game does provide a good challenge. The levels do get pretty hard, especially if you're looking to get the achievements.I think the biggest problem with this game is the steep learning curve, which could be a problem if you haven't played a tower defense game before. I would've also liked a little more variety in the maps, or maybe a few more of them, at least.I've enjoyed Defense Grid, but then again, it's my type of game. I'd recommend it to anyone that enjoys strategy. Everyone else can pass on it. I think it's worth it for $10, barely, but it's worth waiting for it to go on sale.			"

												Going to keep it simple stupid. I bought this game during the holiday steam sale. So far with 11 hours in I can say I have gotten far more than my monies worth. Defense Grid provides a robust and diverse tower defense game. It has tons of levels, challenges and gameplay modes. Not to mention some pretty sweet graphics and tons of tower options. My simple statement. At full price the game is probably well worth it. If you manage to grab it on sale, its a no brainer. You like tower defense, you'll like Defense Grid.			"

The fast forward and checkpoint feature really help re-strategies when you make mistake. I got the whole bargain with all DLC for around $3, so yeah, its worth for your money. Looking forward for the sequel to be fixed because I read some negative review about downgraded quality, and so they recommend to buy this one instead.			"

You might not find much challenge in the earlier levels, but some of the later levels are legitimately hard. The challenge in this game is all about tower placement moreso than it is about maximizing tower strength. Most levels have areas where you create the paths for the enemies yourself, and a few levels are nearly open ended in terms of path placement.			"

The atmosphere is neatly done, the voice over, graphics, ingame sounds and soundtrack are mixed together very well! With the expansion packs, the various gametypes, achievements and the fact that you can easily check out which of your friends you still have to beat with a high score, this is true value for your money.

The soundtrack is epic and perfectly compliments your destructive death trap.But what makes this tower defence game more strategic than any other is the ability to redirect your enemies' paths with your towers. Blocking off pathways and having them adapt to find the shortest route possible adds an amazing amount of depth to the game. Nothing feels better than finishing your grand death-trap maze consisting of gun towers, cannons, flamethowers, lasers, temporal slowdown fields, tesla towers, clusterbombs, and missile launchers.Oh, and there's Portal DLC with GLaDOS.

Highly recommended game - in Fact pick up the extra maps, well worth it.			"

												I am a sucker for a good Tower of Defense game.  This game sets the pinnacle to reach for on the PC.  No other TOD comes close.  The extra maps are enjoyable as well.  If you don't know what TOD is then get this game, it's cheap and a great way to see what this genre is at it's best.  Sad thing is you'll have to wait for more new maps (I hope they do some more) or maybe a sequel as I don't know if a better TOD will be created as I keep waiting and have yet to find it.  I don't really know that a sequel is even important as all it really would need is more maps so keep creating maps.			"

												Fun tower defense game with great graphics and good tower variety. The later levels can become quite challenging as there is really no set path for the enemy. You have to design the path with your tower placement, trying to make it as long as possible while balancing your funds for upgrades. There is also challenge modes and other fun modes to add variety to the levels. There are about 30 or more levels in 3 campaigns, although only the first campaign is of substantial length. Fun game though.			"

												Defense Grid is what happens when you take a well explored genre of games and then polish the hell out of it.  This game will have you replaying levels time and time again for that perfect score.  Just when you think you're done with a level because you've got the gold medal, you'll discover your friends are higher on the leaderboard and fixing that is just as fun as completing the game the first few times.If you're not screaming for raspberries by the end of the game, you might just be a robot.

												It starts out slow, but quickly turns tough and interesting. As the waves progress, they throw new challenges at you. What wins an early round rarely wins  further in the campaign. Also, the story is a tacked-on irrelevance, but it is peculiarly touching - the AI narrator is starts out irritating, but becomes sympathetic as the game progresses, giving context to what is otherwise a game about building towers.

												If you are ever looking for a classic tower defense done right, try this out; there is a demo. The gameplay is perfect and the map variation and challenges are a lot of fun. There is a great balance of towers and enemy types.  The only bad thing is the dialogue, which is good and often funny, but can get annoying as the same lines are constantly repeated.The You Monster DLC is probably the best part of the game. This DLC is not much like the original game in the way the levels are set up, but the dialogue is great and the levels are very challenging even to experienced players.  The Resurgence map packs and Containment DLC aren't much different in style from the original game, and the story isn't interesting, but if you loved the base game and want more, they are fun.			"

												Back when I used to play many RTS titles, one of my favorite things to do was to build a defensive network with multiple types of turrets, just waiting for the enemy to throw what they had at me.  Then later I found 'Defense Grid', a game that takes this Defensive Network concept and makes an entire game out of it.  And it actually works excellently, perhaps better than any other entry in this 'Defense Tower' genre.  Each level is challenging (sans the first) but by going through the motions, it's fully possible to work out a working strategy for all situations.  But most of all, it's highly addictive and you genuinely feel a level of accomplishment when you beat a level.  It's neither hand-holding nor frustrating.  It even has a story, more or less.  Highly recommended.			"

My simple statement. At full price the game is probably well worth it. If you manage to grab it on sale, its a no brainer. You like tower defense, you'll like Defense Grid.			"

												Beat the campagin + DLC in 13 hours. Pros----Good stroy-Decent sounds-Challenging -Maps designed well-extra game modesCons----Only 8-10 towers---not much synergy between them-Probably about 10 different enemy typesI like tower defense games. I played WoW Frozen throne TD online, Bloons TD, dozens of flash/apps TD's. This game is better then all flash/app TD's. Probably better then Bloons TD. Limited towers and enemies really ruined it for me. The price is fair and it's worth playing none the less.The biggest reason i got this was because DG2 came out and has multiplayer. However, after playing DG1 and watching DG2, not much has changed. Here's what i gather,DG2 has multiplayer, but the story is terrible. All the same towers, i assume enemies too, but with better graphics. After all is said and done i don't think i will play DG2, or revisit DG1 to earn some acheievements and play the other game mdoes. It is a fun game, and addiciting, with a fair price tag, i just always felt like something awesome was gonna happen but it never did....Still a solid 8/10 "

The limited presentation of the story is still quite engaging at times.The cons of the game are without a doubt the lack of replayability once its existing content (Quite a lot admittedly) is played through (Important for a tower defense game in my opinion), and the relative lack of variability in enemies.Defense Grid doesn't revolutionise Tower Defense, but it demonstrates excellent production quality for a tried and true design.

												One of the best tower defense games I've played. Totally addictive!I played Defense Grid: The Awakening back in 2011 and spent a lot of time replaying all the levels to get a gold medal in all the levels. I'm now revisiting it again in 2014 and I've found its still as good as the first time around but they've added so much now along with a DLC if you're willing to spend $5.The different modes give numerous ways to play the different levels. Some will require you to play without gun and cannon turrets where other modes will give you a 10 tower limit or green towers only. Green towers being the tower without any upgrades. So this game will keep you busy for hours upon hours trying to get a gold medal. There being Bronze, Silver and Gold for each level.The original Awakening campaign sports 20 levels each with anything from 4-10 different modes to get gold on. If you enjoy getting achievements there is one to get 150 gold medals on the Awakening campaign alone. Then there are additional campaigns of Borderlands, Resurgence and Portal (You Monster) which have 5 additional levels each and of course the DLC called containment.You can see the hours racking up here. So in regards to value for money it is definitely a good buy.			"

												355 hours of gameplay to get all the achievments.. I loved every hour.  This game is as addictive as it is challenging which is a nasty combination.. nasty like full sleeve of nutter butters.If you like Tower Defense, it doesnt get better than this.. until the sequel.			"

												i'm not a strategy game buff but Defence Grid managed to grip me for the occasional play session. A fun and satisfactory combat that is hard to master yet relatively easy to go through on most levels (some of the mid-later ones can be hard as nails if you're not paying attention).A funny voice over and epic score highlight the experience, with a ton of achievements and extra levels for aficionados. More control on certain towers like specific enemy targeting would be cool for the sequel, in the meantime the orbital laser will have to do!			"

												Beeing a bit late to this genre of games (just played a few casual iOS TD games) I managed to discover Defense Grid: The Awakening. It was basically mentioned on almost all Top-10 Lists for TD games on the internet and therefore I had to try it out. What can I say: I'm hooked. I spend way to much time playing this instead of working. Beeing generally a casual gamer I could never be bothered with perfect scores or gold medals etc, however with this game for the first time ever I really want to try hard and earn a gold medal in each and every level.Best thing in my opinion is, that the game makes it easy for a newbie to enter the world of TD, however it seems to offer enough challenge when becoming more experienced in the future to keep me hooked for a long time.Needless to say, that I already spent additional money on the DLC and can't wait for the sequel :-)			"

												Very polished Tower Defense game, with varying levels of mazing depending on the level. If you love tower defense games you will probably love this! The playtime you'll get out of this depends on whether you enjoy replaying levels with increased difficulty and restrictions or not. Just playing through the game is somewhere around 10 hours.			"

												Note: I originally bought this back when it was on greenhouse (defunct), so my playtime is significantly higher than it says. I haven't yet found one Tower Defense game that I enjoy as much as Defense Grid. There's tons of replayability and excellent added DLC that was made way after the original game was released. The main story is simple, yet interesting, and the narration is well done.This is the game that sets the bar for TD games, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone interested in the genre.			"

I feel that's an understatement - there are a lot of difficulty stages to play each level with unique twists. You'll get a LOT more hours of gameplay even if you just stick to the easiest setting. Highly recommended game - in Fact pick up the extra maps, well worth it.			"

The atmosphere is neatly done, the voice over, graphics, ingame sounds and soundtrack are mixed together very well! With the expansion packs, the various gametypes, achievements and the fact that you can easily check out which of your friends you still have to beat with a high score, this is true value for your money.

												I had a lot of problems over several years trying to sink my teeth into this game.  It's fast-paced, the levels are very long, there's no saving mid-level, and the strategy necessary is very complex.  It's been a grind, but ultimately a rewarding one, and certainly the best on the tower defense market.  However, you can also sometimes cheat and use the mechanics to ""juggle"" waves around your towers infinitely, which is a little lame.Nevertheless, the features in this game are unparalleled, and so are the story elements.  Don't give up.  Grind it out and iterate on your strategies.			"

												Emotional attachment to a character in a tower defense game?  Especially one that you never get to see on screen, and all development is done purely via the narrative?  Oh, and let's also make that character an AI.  Sound unlikely?  I never would have thought it would be done either - for that matter, I never expected a developer to even bother trying.  But in ""Defense Grid: The Awakening"", the narrative AI who guides you through the game really DOES develop a character that can bring an emotional attachment towards ""him"" even without any onscreen presence - especially towards the later levels of the story.  And it's a pretty cool tower defense game in its own right, too.  Strongly recommend checking it out for anyone who likes TD games, OR who wants to see an example of how to develop a seemingly impersonal character through narrative alone.  Well done to Hidden Path Entertainment with this one.			"

It is pure tower defense, nothing else, no mucking about with heroes, no leveling up, just levels for you to build a network of towers to kill the baddies.I’ve played a lot of TD games, and this one still has no equal. If you haven’t tried it, you really owe it to yourself to pick it up.			"

												One of the best top down tower defense games I've ever played. Every tower defense fan should have this game. You might not find much challenge in the earlier levels, but some of the later levels are legitimately hard. The challenge in this game is all about tower placement moreso than it is about maximizing tower strength. Most levels have areas where you create the paths for the enemies yourself, and a few levels are nearly open ended in terms of path placement.			"

												This is the best version of a ""Tower Defence"" style game that I've ever played. Quite addictive, good graphics and animations. It's simple enough in concept to play yet it can get quite challenging too. It's a good ""casual"" type game in which you can return to time and again when the mood strikes to play something different for a little bit aside from the standard shoot-em-ups and racers.			"

												This Tower Defense is both entertaining and challenging, offering up several different game modes on multiple series of different maps. A little clumsy to get the control system at first, but pretty easy to remember and get used to. Quite simple, yet effective, this is a first choice for TD gamers who like to earn Steam Achievements. ***			"

												I've never been into tower defense games, but I am into Defense Grid. It's pretty, it has an engaging narrative and addictive levels, and a ton of different modes. It's one of those titles that has me  re-starting whenever a level isn't going PERFECTLY. It's a great bridge between regular RTS titles and tower defense games.			"

												Defense Grid: The Awakening is, at its core, a puzzle game. It's a good one, but the various levels are not nearly as free-form as you might initially believe. Many levels can be beaten in multiple ways, but many levels favor a particular layout of towers. After playing through a dozen levels or so, you realize certain consistent strategies to victory: make the path the aliens travel as long as you can, and build a lot of cannon towers. Yes, there are nuances beyond that, but the strategy isn't really all that deep.But that's okay. It's an easy game to play in 30-minute chunks; the lack of save game slots (as opposed to the acceptable-but-not-ideal checkpoint system) is annoying, but mildly so. (Although, to be fair, that might be just my own over-saving nature speaking.) It's rewarding, pretty, nicely paced, and has a decent enough plot.I bought it for something like $2.49. At that price, a great bargain.			"

												In my mind, the tower defence genre rose to it's apex with the custom warcraft 3 maps, and nothing ever quite matched the same feeling of satisfaction in regards to gameplay.That said, Defense Grid was not an altogether unpleasant experience. The maps were varied and interesting, but I found myself getting bored by the end of it, and only bothered to play through the story. There's a lot of repetition.I liked it enough though.My recommendation is putting it in windowed display, if you are going to play it. On my system it didn't like alt tabbing to the desktop and back, and would get graphical errors that made it nigh unplayable.			"

												Great Tower Defense gameI've come back to Defense Grid again and again. Good level design - a mix of limited tower locations as the enemy races by vs. block the enemy's path with your tower placements plus fun tower types. There's an ongoing discussion about which tower types are necessary (e.g. Cannons > Lasers, etc.). While you can win maps without using Command or Concussion towers, your score really starts to shoot up when you do. And it's great to keep beating your friend's high scores!			"

												Great little game, with more depth than what meets the eyes at first. This is an evolution of the basic tower defense maps from warcraft 3, but a lot more refined. There is a decent choice of towers, all balanced so they each have their applications and role. And there is also the local (your friends) and global score tracking that adds tons of replay value. It keeps you constantly wanting to go back to each level to try and come up with better, more innovative and cost efficient solutions.It has also some great ideas like savepoints you can backtrack to with a touch of a button (backspace), the ""interest"" mechanism that lets you earn more score if you find a good defense and have spare, unspent ressources, and so on. A fine gem of a game, highly recommended.			"

It feels like all they did was the minimum necessary to make the game recognize the mouse as if it was the thumbstick on a game controller. It's unweildy and never stops feeling uncomfortable.But other than that, it's one of the most perfectly executed TD games I've ever played, and I'm a big fan of this genre.			"

												What's better than killing defenseless zombies rushing towards you? Aliens walking in straight line, while being mauled endlessly by the defensive measures you have placed in advance. Yes, Defense Grid is a typical tower defense game, where nameless characterless pixels try to move on the screen to steal your resources and making it out alive. Your mission is to stop them, and your arsenal are towers that are equipped with either gatling gun, flame-throwers, tesla coil and missiles amongst others. With an apt in-game voiced commentary, there isn't a dull moment while you keep the alien population in check. Defense Grid stands out especially in the ability to shape the paths for the aliens, challenging the players to best themselves on repeated attempts on the same map, by making the alien's suicidal mission even more grueling each time around. With a number of challenges like poisonous cores, Defense Grid is a title that offers hours and hours of entertainment to the faithful.			"

												Definitely an engaging game!  I've beaten all of the Story levels and the various challenges, but I still come back for more.  Back in '09 I got hooked on just the demo, which only had 4 levels, and would play it again and again just because of how good it was.I definitely recommend Defense Grid!			"

												Surpringly very fun. I mean I've been a fan of tower defence for a while, but even still.Standard fare tower defence, different tower types, some are better against certain creeps, yadda yadda.The main point of interest for me was you can place towers on the grid where the creeps walk, and direct them through a maze of towers. But you can't just place them willy-nilly, you can only place them in specific areas, which lends to the strategy of tower defence. Often, you'll have many small squares of these bridged, with not all spaces on the square buildable. You have to direct the creeps in the most efficient way, but of course, building towers requires resources. Setting these mazes up is a challenge - a fun challenge.Oh and your little robot companion buddy AI thing has some amazing quips. I did find myself laughing and saying to it ""you're terrible, you know that?"", but that's what makes him so good! It's like listening to Stephen Fry. Even the bad jokes are good.			"

												I don't normally write recommendations, but I thought this game was very well done.  The graphics and sound are pretty good, and the gameplay is challenging without becoming impossible in the later levels.  One of my biggest complaints about most tower defense games is that the difficulty curve usually takes a sudden giant leap into the realm of impossibility towards the end, but I felt they didn't do that here and managed to keep the difficulty curve nice and smooth.  But the most important part? This game is fun and never feels like ""work"".  Highly recommended.			"

												Yeah, its only a TD game. But the graphics are decent and you do find yourself getting pretty hooked on protecting every last power core. There is a lot of strategy involved in the tower placement. What might work at the start of the game for the first few waves could quickly turn pear-shaped if you end up changing the enemies' path by accident (by default they take the shortest path. Very important to remember).			"

This game will have you replaying levels time and time again for that perfect score.  Just when you think you're done with a level because you've got the gold medal, you'll discover your friends are higher on the leaderboard and fixing that is just as fun as completing the game the first few times.If you're not screaming for raspberries by the end of the game, you might just be a robot.

												It starts out slow, but quickly turns tough and interesting. As the waves progress, they throw new challenges at you. What wins an early round rarely wins  further in the campaign. Also, the story is a tacked-on irrelevance, but it is peculiarly touching - the AI narrator is starts out irritating, but becomes sympathetic as the game progresses, giving context to what is otherwise a game about building towers.

												If saving the planet from alien hoardes, assisted by a raspberry loving computer and some towers with guns and stuff on them  sounds like your idea of fun... well, this is the game for you!Having played the missions on the original ""The Awakening"" on more than one occasion, I'm happy to say that I still find Defense Grid an enjoyable way to spend a quiet afternoon.Ok it's Tower Defense and doesn't really do more than that, but it's challenging enough not to need to.The amount of levels is generous and even though it's pretty much ""rinse and repeat"" every level, the design of each map does make you think a bit, and the difference between good and bad tower placement makes some of the maps really quite interesting, as correctly placing towers will allow you to send the aliens running twice the distance for their beloved ""cores"" passed your deadly ""towers of doom"".Graphically the game sits in a 'sort of' fixed 3d retro isometric type view, which is more than adequate for the game mechanic and does it's job wellThis game also has a lot of DLC which i have yet to investigate, but it all looks pretty promising.All in all it's a pleasant experience and I would definitely recommend it ito Tower Defense fans.

												Defense Grid: The Awakening is one of the most robust and full Tower Defense games I've ever played. Contains a full voice-acted story, great looking settings and models, and some very challenging levels. It also contains a competitive angle with leader boards and alternate game-play challenges.I'm excited to hear that Hidden Path is already working on a sequel (as well as more content for the original). They even have a Kickstarter project for it, where you can get Steam codes for this version when you support the sequel: http://kck.st/NeSvwVIf you're burned out on Tower Defense, it's worth checking this out.

												The pinnacle of Tower Defense; Defense Grid nails the genre.  The presentation value is high with sleek visuals and a well-crafted narrator that guides you through the game's universe, but what really matters is gameplay, and Defense Grid nails it in the campaign and the many, many diverse modes it packs along.  You can challenge yourself with limited resources or engage in a zen-like grinder session as you slowly roast your way to nigh unlimited riches.By far the best money I've ever spent on Steam, I've also purchased all the DLC and already prepurchased the sequel via kickstarter.  If you like strategy in general and TD especially, you'll want all the DLC, but definitely don't miss You Monster, because the only thing this game was really missing in the first run was GLaDOS.  She compliments the game's existing narration nicely.			"

												I've played tower defense since their first appearance in starcraft use map settings. I think this may be the most polished TD game around. The gameplay is very simple and straight forward, but when you start trying to gold medal the various modes/maps, some depth can emerge. The rewind and speed up mechanics make the game very user friendly, reducing slog immensely. The gamepad UI works very well, and you don't lose out from not using a mouse. Only real complaint is the somewhat bland critters. The voice acted companion can be mildly charming, but shut him up when you are going for achievements. High recommendation for anyone who enjoys TD. Solid.			"

												Defense Grid: The Awakening is hands down the best tower defense game I have ever played. It takes all the conventions you would expect from a good traditional TD game such as different types of upgradable towers, different enemies with their own stengths and weaknesses, and multiple stategies and game modes for large replayability. All this packaged into a budget title that feels like a AAA game and you have a game that simply can't be passed up. Add to this already great game the fact that there is a Portal themed DLC!			"

												This is a great tower defense game - possibly the best on Steam.The controls are very intuitive, the towers are diverse and useful, and there are plenty of game modes for replayability.Towers range from the typical machine gun tower to AOE damage towers to utility towers like the slow-movement-speed tower and more.This game has some unique features that differentiate it from other tower defense games. Checkpoints occur at various intervals throughout each mission and the player can simply hit ""backspace"" to return to the previous checkpoint (or hit backspace multiple times to go to a specific checkpoint). An ""orbital laser"" ability allows you to destroy large groups of enemies at one time as a sort of ""last ditch effort"". This ability is on a long cooldown, but lets you get out of a tight spot quickly.			"

												The premise is simple, a slew of alien baddies enter the map in waves and travel the shortest path to steal your power cores, you must build a maze/grid of towers to stop them. You gain more resources by killing the aliens, resources you desperately need to upgrade or build more towers to kill the ever increasing new waves of aliens. Every game is basically a race to figure out the optimum defensive grid. After you beat each level, harder varied challenge versions of the level open up. I never felt frustration or tedium while playing and replaying the levels until I was able to figure out the optimal playthrough, and the balance and pacing was really spot on. It was very fun, addictive, and well worth my money, and the time I spent playing through it almost three times.Defense Grid: The Awakening is hands down the best tower defense game I have ever played. It is addictive, fun, worthwhile and ultimately fulfilling. Buy it now.			"

Coming back to it, I found myself actually liking the game itself. It's a cute little tower defense game. Build towers to make mazes and slow the enemies advance to your power generator. The plot is a bit dumb, and it doesn't usually matter, but the game itself is simple and fun. If it's cheap, get it! I liked it.			"

												Back when I used to play many RTS titles, one of my favorite things to do was to build a defensive network with multiple types of turrets, just waiting for the enemy to throw what they had at me.  Then later I found 'Defense Grid', a game that takes this Defensive Network concept and makes an entire game out of it.  And it actually works excellently, perhaps better than any other entry in this 'Defense Tower' genre.  Each level is challenging (sans the first) but by going through the motions, it's fully possible to work out a working strategy for all situations.  But most of all, it's highly addictive and you genuinely feel a level of accomplishment when you beat a level.  It's neither hand-holding nor frustrating.  It even has a story, more or less.  Highly recommended.			"

												     Defense Grid: The Awakening is a good game, but it is also not exactly a game that I would buy outside of it being bundled with another game or discounted. The game has nice visuals, fun gameplay, and plenty of challenges to keep you occupied.      But the problem with this game is what it is, a tower defense game. Tower defense games are everywhere, and you can find better ones that cost nothing and can be played in your browser. The only thing this game has going for it in comparison to an in browser TD game is its graphics, and those aren't exactly that exciting.      Overall, if you find out theres a game bundle or its on a heavy discount try it out. It isn't a bad game, it's just another tower defense game. But you have to pay for it.			"

												I never really cared for tower defense games... then I played Defense Grid and it became one of my favorite games to play on PC. I love Defense Grid so much that I tried a couple other tower defense games but all they made me want to do is play more Defense Grid because in my opinion, it just does tower defense better than any anything else. DG has such a great asthetic that it was not intimidating to start playing for a total tower defense noob, in fact, the voice acting of the AI narrator is actually pretty charming and it was one of the things that made me prefer DG to others. The one feature that is a must have for me after playing DG aside from the fun bit of strategy involved but using your own towers on most levels to block and elongate the paths of the alien forces before they steal your cores, is the replay button. I feel the need to perfect every level (OCD I guess) so I love that if I miscalculated my defenses I can just hit ""backspace"" and immediately keep playing from the last checkpoint, it may seem cheap to a purist player, but I don't care, it makes me happy like when I was a kid and I was about to lose a game of checkers to my little sister and I would just flip over the board, only in DG the board resets in an instant and I get to try again until I win without letting any of those lousy aliens take any of my cores because each time they do I die a little inside (why is that? what is wrong with me?). Anyway, I love the game and would recommend it to anyone because even if you don't think you would like a tower defense game, this is the one game to play before you are sure, if it doesn't turn you, you cannot be turned.

They have a FPS aspect to those games, pause between Waves. etc. And I like that......... But after searching for Tower Defense games here on Steam, looking and  reading about alot of them, I chose to buy Defense Grid: The Awakening. I have not been disappointed!!!  NOTE: DG2 is already out, but i still chose to check out the first game in the series,There is no pause between waves, you can buy/upgrade towers during the whole level. The waves are shown coming on a HUD at the top of screen when new waves are coming along with audio warnings.. Different Towers = Different Effects on Different Aliens etc,, Family Friendly, no cursing that I've heard etc. No blood. Just weapon towers against aliens etc. Strategy Oriented, FUN!!! Also, great interface,  good graphics, fun gameplay, and as I discovered, you CAN even beat the hard maps!1 :)Rcommended!!! c0AXP.S. Looking forward to my purchase of DG2!!!!			"

No tower feels useless or overly-necessary and there is never just one sucessful build solution for a level.  There are also many interesting rule variations you can use to inspire creativity in your design.  All of this is wrapped in some solid voice acting and a story about the contributions the elderly can still make in our society when they are past their prime.			"

Ademas, si añadis los DLC que tiene superais sin probelmas las 50 horas de juego.Recomendadisimo [si lo comprais que sea de oferta, 3'50€ con todos los DLC] ;)			"

												Released several years ago, Defense Grid was one of the first big indie hits on Steam as well as one of the greatest tower defense games of all time. A game that is easy to learn, and difficult to master, it starts out pretty simple and limiting at first, but by the later levels, there are many options to how you set up your route, what weapons to use, and how you use them. The game also boosts some solid visuals, a suprisingly interesting story and main character, and good replayability on all but the initial few tutorial-like missions. Highly recommended!			"

												One of the best Tower Defense games so far. Very addictive gameplay, excellent balance and strategic depth included. The amount of content you get in this game is incredible and replayability is very high - if you want to get all the achievements, that’s gonna be a very long, but entertaining run. Just don't spoil your first playthrough by watching winning strategies on YouTube (well, you can do it sometimes, but only if you're really stuck. Try to figure the solution yourself first). Highly recommended. Grab this gem without thinking twice.			"

												Defense Grid is the most polished tower defense game I've experienced.  It's also one of the hardest.  There's an excellent spread of towers, none of which are ever useless.  There's a good mix of passive and active pathing, so fans of either type will apreciate the level design.  And, for a tower defense game, the voice acting and story are incomparible.			"

The aliens go after things call power cores which are basically your life in the game, so protect them at all cost!  The graphics in this game are great and it runs smoothly.

												 One of the best tower defense games to date with lots of difficult levels and challenges to keep you playing for hours! All the DLC is worth the cheap price because it adds some new levels to play and ways to think about defending crystals in the game. Only problem for me was that there was no sound on my PC with Windows 7, and I suffered for a while until a good patch was released, so it was stable enough to play, but I think the game is in working order. It will run on almost any system, so it’s not a graphics hog, yet it still can be a pretty game on lower settings. Enjoy			"

												Surpringly very fun. I mean I've been a fan of tower defence for a while, but even still.Standard fare tower defence, different tower types, some are better against certain creeps, yadda yadda.The main point of interest for me was you can place towers on the grid where the creeps walk, and direct them through a maze of towers. But you can't just place them willy-nilly, you can only place them in specific areas, which lends to the strategy of tower defence. Often, you'll have many small squares of these bridged, with not all spaces on the square buildable. You have to direct the creeps in the most efficient way, but of course, building towers requires resources. Setting these mazes up is a challenge - a fun challenge.Oh and your little robot companion buddy AI thing has some amazing quips. I did find myself laughing and saying to it ""you're terrible, you know that?"", but that's what makes him so good! It's like listening to Stephen Fry. Even the bad jokes are good.			"

												As far as Tower Defense games go... this game is grand. The visuals are polished and striking, the voice acting is enjoyable and the developer somehow fit a somewhat moving story into the main missions. It's by no means deep, but moving just the same.There is some strategy to the later levels for 'tower defense' experts, but the core missions are accessible to newcomers. I feel as if there are some inbalances, for instance the Flame towers seem under-powered and little used.Overall, a solid recommendation if you can catch it for a reasonable price.			"

												     Defense Grid: The Awakening is a good game, but it is also not exactly a game that I would buy outside of it being bundled with another game or discounted. The game has nice visuals, fun gameplay, and plenty of challenges to keep you occupied.      But the problem with this game is what it is, a tower defense game. Tower defense games are everywhere, and you can find better ones that cost nothing and can be played in your browser. The only thing this game has going for it in comparison to an in browser TD game is its graphics, and those aren't exactly that exciting.      Overall, if you find out theres a game bundle or its on a heavy discount try it out. It isn't a bad game, it's just another tower defense game. But you have to pay for it.			"

												Beeing a bit late to this genre of games (just played a few casual iOS TD games) I managed to discover Defense Grid: The Awakening. It was basically mentioned on almost all Top-10 Lists for TD games on the internet and therefore I had to try it out. What can I say: I'm hooked. I spend way to much time playing this instead of working. Beeing generally a casual gamer I could never be bothered with perfect scores or gold medals etc, however with this game for the first time ever I really want to try hard and earn a gold medal in each and every level.Best thing in my opinion is, that the game makes it easy for a newbie to enter the world of TD, however it seems to offer enough challenge when becoming more experienced in the future to keep me hooked for a long time.Needless to say, that I already spent additional money on the DLC and can't wait for the sequel :-)			"

												Decent tower defense (TD) game.  These guys almost got it.  I miss the TDs that allow you to do your own mazing though.  Most TD developers don't seem to understand what makes a good TD... freedom to build your own defense system from the ground up.  When you take mazing out of the equation, you simplify the game and bore the gamer.  Developers really need to take a good hard look at the pioneers of TDs... in Warcraft III custom games.			"

												One of the best tower defense games. Although some towers are more useful than others, there is no ""god"" tower, which you can just spam the level full and win. Different enemies require different tactics. Levels are mostly ""path""-levels, but some levels allow you to decide where to guide the enemies to get the most out of the route ""un-optimization"". Loads of fun, completed it on PC and XB360.			"

												Excellent tower defence game that should suit all players. Those new to the genre will appreciate the learning curve, for casual players progression is easy with bronze and silver goals, while dedicated players will enjoy achieving the gold medals and beating the many advanced modes.Graphics are fine, sound is good, music could use more variety. The narration is splendid, you really feel for the inadvertently digitised fellow. Top VO.Game has well designed levels, an excellent one button checkpoint rewind and a fast forward mode: these features combine to make even the more challenging maps minimally frustrating.			"

												While most tower defense games are Just the same ""use X to survive X amount of rounds and then preceed to the next round to repeat"" Defense Grid changes it up. Along the game you start to get More Blueprints inorder to make New towers while the story Preceeds. - Yes, this game has a STORY! A Rare occurence with games like these. Besides playing the Story mode of each map, You can also play different versions of the same map with a new twist. There is also the ""Community Maps"" That has new stuff added each time, also there are Mini games that you can do if you wanna take a break. Before the DG2 Kickstarter, there was a Console from the PotatoFoolsDay Portal 2 ARG. I think there might be some way to get it back but i have no idea.Overall, Defense Grid: The Awakening is a Breath of Fresh air for the Genre and this is a game i seriously recommend.			"

												This stayed on my Steam list as a hidden diamond for so long.As far as tower defense games go this is one of the better ones if not one of the best ones (if best being superlative could have multiples) The games is beautiful to look at it does not feel dated even 5 years after its release. The levels are also very varied and interesting there are loads of avenues of replayability either by the set modes or just simply by making things up in your head like this round I will try and win just using gun towers.However i will put a but in here aside from the positives of this game I will throw in one big negative in my viewpoint. There is not enough variety in the aliens and the towers themselves are neither negative or positive at taking out anything. I built up a bunch of teslas to take out bosses when I finally realized what a boss was (I was expecting something much bigger) my very basic cheapo turrets had wiped the floor with them long before they got to the tesla turrets which are supposed to be the boss killers (maybe some defensive bonuses could have been added to them to make other turrets less effective at them).But conclude on the good if you want a great tower defense game that will keep you busy and on your toes this is certainly a great purchase.

												As a big fan of tower defense games since they emerged, I've played many. Defense Grid: The Awakening is head and shoulders above every other of it's ilk. The core mechanics which make for a fun and challenging TD game are represented magnificently; maps are well designed and plentiful, ranging in difficulty from the sublime to the maddening. Pace and enemy flow are spot on, providing a challenge without becoming frustrating  and enemy variety demands careful consideration when placing towers. Upgrades for your towers can be bought using points earned killing the hordes of energy core stealing aliens and give the towers that extra punch required in later waves. For TD games I've never placed much importance on hi fidelity graphics, the game-play just doesn't demand it. Defence Grid however pulls out all the stops in it's designs and renders giving you a diverse line-up of uber cool aliens, towers and backgrounds. Defense Grid is THE shining example of the genre; a must buy for any fan.			"

												This game is a re-enactment of the same war upon which The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers was based. What was it? The Tolkein War or something? Basically there are a lot of these little angry dude who wanted to invade but they had this tower to stop them. There were two towers: one with a big giant flame at the top that shoots lasers at the little guys to heat them up and make them take damage over time and another one with Magneto inside who would like shoot beams of magnetic energy at everything. What a cool guy Magneto was. He's the kind of villain you can really understand because he doesn't just go around destroying everything for fun. No, he does it because he's idealistic and the world isn't as just as he thinks it ought to be. And he's right. But then extra-bald Picard has to come in and use his diplomacy on Magneto, bringing his army of giant talking trees with him to show Magneto that the powers of good beat the powers of grey-area. LOTR is the bad ending to this game.			"

												Tower Defense with serious production values.  Defense Grid is Tower Defense polished to a mirror shine, with a story and DLC to boot.  Various enemies and swarms will keep you busy, while a huge number of towers will let you fine-tune the performance of your play to get higher scores.  The asthetic is clean, and makes all these high-tech towers really meld in to what's going on, while the normal campaign makes picking the game up easy even for those unfamiliar with Tower Defense.

												Best tower-defence game, bar none, IMO.Each tower is distinct and tactically useful regardless of how many others you unlock.The maps have great variety in paths and strategy: some will force you to spread yourself thin and optimize for cheap towers, some will give you limited options and really force you to make every tower count; others will make you front-load your defence while others force you defend on the back foot, some even force a rear-guard action of attacking the aliens as they retreat with their loot.The UI is clean and simple, with the friendliest checkpoint system ever invented with an ""oops"" button to immediately take you back through previous checkpoints, and a fast-forward button for those times when you need to speed ahead.Then there's the storytelling, beautiful voice acting with more than a dash of humour.And finally, if that isn't enough, every level has 4 to 5 different challenge modes that push you out of your comfort zone again.Buy it, and buy all the DLC, it's great value for money.

												Well, I hadn't really played tower defense games before this. Didn't exactly know the concept was essentially a more complicated version of the one casual game where the colored beads come in, and you have to shoot them with colored beads from your turrett to knock them out. Yeah pretty much that but with more turrets and bullets and flames for beads, and heartier beads with different varieties you have to kill off. A decent bit of fun and frustration trying to set up the right towers at the right time to not bone yourself later. While this is still the most polished of the Tower Defense games I've played, others have done far more for play variety and interesting mechanics to spice up the formula. Still good for a bit of fun, even if I'm not a fan of the half hearted addition of a score board to extend play. 4/5			"

												i want to say i really like this game , far better than the second one. as a matter of fact , dont even get the second one. it is not good at all. but my major problem with this game is the fact that there is no structure to the story. you can just skip to any map at any time. you dont need to earn your way by beating the current map. so to me it felt like the challenge had been taken away. and i didnt like that at all.and now when i go back to play it, its  like pick any map and play. i want to play the whole game again. but to do that i have to put myself through each sccessive map and then if i beat it i can pass to the next, even though i can pass to the next map anyway without beating it. its just not right. this style of game kinda takes away the whole point for me. Like i just opened it and would like to play it again , but the fact that every map is just available and there is no game criteria or structure to play.it takes the appeal away for me.so i just closed it and am going to play something else. cause it just isnt worth it to me. the makers of this game made a major mistake doing it like this in my opinion.

												Defense Grid is one of the better tower defense games you'll buy on steam. If you enjoy maze TD's, this may not be for you, but otherwise it's a great value as it has a huge amount of levels, especially if you count DLC and ESPECIALLY if you count the alternate modes for each map. It's got a lot of replay value and overall content, so I'd highly recommend it if you enjoy TD games.			"

												 One of the best tower defense games to date with lots of difficult levels and challenges to keep you playing for hours! All the DLC is worth the cheap price because it adds some new levels to play and ways to think about defending crystals in the game. Only problem for me was that there was no sound on my PC with Windows 7, and I suffered for a while until a good patch was released, so it was stable enough to play, but I think the game is in working order. It will run on almost any system, so it’s not a graphics hog, yet it still can be a pretty game on lower settings. Enjoy			"

												Defense Grid, or, ""Tower Defense taken seriously"" adds a hardcore element to the typically flash-based, casual tower defense genre, and with a scifi setting changes up the mood very well. Easy to learn, difficult to master, some of the later levels can prove to be a genuine challenge if you're going for perfect finishes. The depth and variety of game modes can make replaying the same map quite fun actually. With a leaderboard to see how you stack up against both friends and the world at large, Defense Grid is quite packed for such a ""small"" game, and well crafted. 9/10			"

After only playing for a brief time, I am hooked. If you are looking at this game and on the fence about tower defense games in general or this game specifically, I suggest this is definitely a buy. Few games can hold up this well after so many years and still be so viable. Recommended.			"

												How have I not written a review of this yet? I completely devoured this game.This is hands down one of my favourite tower defence games of all time. Everything about it is on point. Mechanics are good, with lots of varied tower types, and many different aliens, the stages are also quite varied in design, within the limitation of the game mechanics. Graphics and sound are quite good, yet still playable on my tablet (Atom Z3775-based).Which brings me to another point: it has touch support, and suffers little for it. Not quite as accurate as a mouse, which does result in some accidents, but it's mostly a matter of getting used to it.The voice acted story is excellent, both in terms of voice acting quality, and writing. It was a particularly nice element of this game, actually. The player's AI ally is amusing and endearing, while also delivering the game's ""tutorial"" elements.The gameplay is addicting, and the difficulty is fair, which led me to 100-percenting this game's achievements. Replay value is decent as well, with multiple strategies working well enough to pass most levels.The only thing that feels ""off"" is the degree to which some towers are either useless in a given level, or basically mandatory. Missile towers in particular, and the flying enemies they shoot down, seem like they're only in the game to be a backdoor means of draining resources away from your other defences. Not a huge issue overall, but the tower type could use some retooling (like they did in DG2).If you like the genre, I'd definitely recommend buying this, even at full price, no regrets.			"

												If you are ever looking for a classic tower defense done right, try this out; there is a demo. The gameplay is perfect and the map variation and challenges are a lot of fun. There is a great balance of towers and enemy types.  The only bad thing is the dialogue, which is good and often funny, but can get annoying as the same lines are constantly repeated.The You Monster DLC is probably the best part of the game. This DLC is not much like the original game in the way the levels are set up, but the dialogue is great and the levels are very challenging even to experienced players.  The Resurgence map packs and Containment DLC aren't much different in style from the original game, and the story isn't interesting, but if you loved the base game and want more, they are fun.			"

												Back when I used to play many RTS titles, one of my favorite things to do was to build a defensive network with multiple types of turrets, just waiting for the enemy to throw what they had at me.  Then later I found 'Defense Grid', a game that takes this Defensive Network concept and makes an entire game out of it.  And it actually works excellently, perhaps better than any other entry in this 'Defense Tower' genre.  Each level is challenging (sans the first) but by going through the motions, it's fully possible to work out a working strategy for all situations.  But most of all, it's highly addictive and you genuinely feel a level of accomplishment when you beat a level.  It's neither hand-holding nor frustrating.  It even has a story, more or less.  Highly recommended.			"

												A tower defense game with good graphics, splendid balance, superb towers and enemies and an excellent voice actor. These elements make this game an enjoyment to discover and to master. Since release extra maps packs have been made next to updates to fix the blemishes, signifying the developers' will to give us extra content (for a small price).			"

												Maybe the reference of tower defense games out there. Best tower defense game available IMO. Good graphics, nice audio (great speaker), addictive levels and most important for a tower defense game: absolutely great balanced. That's most probably the greatest point on Defense Grid. No other td game has such great balanced levels. I've played through the missions multiple times and still do so since the game is fun. The levels are very good designed and the hordes of enemies are fun to blast away. As I said above this game is the reference in tower defense.			"

												If the game is on sale and you like tower defense games you should give it a try. Please note that there are some things that DG makes different compared to other tower defense games ... - No pause button to help plan your strategy (you can press backspace though to reload a previous checkpoint)- No timer telling you when exactly your orbital cannon will come off cooldown - Mobs can walk through towers in case you manage to block their path by accident - While games like Sanctum 2 or Prime World:Defenders tell you which path the aliens will take and how placed towers will affect them, Defense Grid doesn't (which results in lots of reloading -.-)So it's a 78/100			"

												I'm updating this review, 5 years later.Defense Grid is still a timeless classic, one of the best games full stop as far as I'm concerned, and certainly best in the tower defence.genre.You really need all the DLC, but that's not a problem. There are a great range of towers, a lot of choice how to maze or otherwise place towers, and the plot in the form of narration is epic, rather than just shoving a new map in your face with no backstory.Some people may prefer the slightly more glamorous graphics of Defense Grid 2, for me I'll always come back to DG1. Both are very solid games.The only downside is the lack of multiplayer, but having said that I have seen almost no TD's, ever, which have implemented a decent version of this.			"

												As far as Tower Defense games go... this game is grand. The visuals are polished and striking, the voice acting is enjoyable and the developer somehow fit a somewhat moving story into the main missions. It's by no means deep, but moving just the same.There is some strategy to the later levels for 'tower defense' experts, but the core missions are accessible to newcomers. I feel as if there are some inbalances, for instance the Flame towers seem under-powered and little used.Overall, a solid recommendation if you can catch it for a reasonable price.			"

It has astonishing diversity, across a huge number of levels, all incredibly well balanced... it's fiendishly difficult at times, and no matter how well you do, you're always left with the feeling that you could have done better... it really is a masterpiece of a game!!!That said... if you've never played DG, I would recommend you play DG2 first... if this game didn't exist, DG2 would be my #1... but it does, and if you play this one first, you may find DG2 to be a little disappointing... which would be a shame, because DG2 is great... it's just that this one is better...If you enjoy tower defence games at all... you simply must play Defense Grid... or you're missing out on the genre's finest achievement!!!

												Defense Grid has everything that you might not expect from a tower defense game: original gameplay, a polished interface, great artwork and visuals, and even some nice voice acting. It also has the things that you probably would expect, like an assortment of different towers that may be upgraded, different types of enemies to defend against, and a variety of levels in which to try out particular strategies.In Defense Grid, you must defend your planet from an old, forgotten enemy. You take control of a dormant defense grid to fend off these alien invaders. Unlike many other tower defense games, the goal is not simply to stop the enemies from reaching the end of their path. Rather, you must prevent the aliens from stealing your power cores, which reside in a special housing. Thus each alien will walk from a starting point to the power core housing, and then to the exit. In many levels you have the option of shaping the aliens' paths by placing towers in their way.The cores provide an interesting addition to the gameplay. If an alien carrying a stolen core is killed, the core will slowly float back to its housing unless it gets intercepted by another alien. Keeping your cores in their housing allows you to collect additional ""interest"" on your resources, which can be used to buy and upgrade more towers. A particular core can trade hands many times, so even with a long and deadly path of towers, a large enough swarm of aliens will manage to get a core through if you aren't careful. You only need to keep one core protected to win a particular level, but saving all of the cores is necessary to get a silver or gold medal and a high score.The game features 10 different types of towers, 15 types of enemies, and 20 levels. There are also a number of DLC packs which offer additional levels. Each level also has a number of challenge modes which can be unlocked. These challenges often mix up the gameplay, such as by restricting which types of towers you may buy, or by altering the aliens' direction, and so on.But the most striking feature of the game is its presentation. Tower defense veterans may be used to playing Flash games with crude graphics in their web browsers, but Defense Grid's production values are comparable to most other high quality commercial games. The graphics, sound, interface, and level design were all executed very well, and there is enough content to last quite a few hours. The plot is fairly minimal, but it features a main character who has a surprising level of personality.You really shouldn't miss this one. Defense Grid offers the best of tower defense, whether you're new to the genre or an already avid fan. I highly recommend it.			"

												This game has been a long time favorite, and is a great addition for anyone who enjoys the tower defense genre of gaming. The levels are simple in design, yet force you to think of how you want to lay out your design carefully. Some levels push this a bit farther, giving you multiple ways to maze and build. This really comes into focus during the later maps of the Story Mode, where the enemies have literally a dozen pathing options.On top of the typical story mode there are also many different challenge modes for each map, giving hours of enjoyment. Modes include: Grinder and Super Grinder, 99 waves that get progressively harder as you go; Green Towers Only, where you can't upgrade your towers at all; Story Reversed, that swaps the direction the enemies travel; and much more.There are also a few extra campaigns available through DLC, as well as community driven content with tons of maps to try out. All in all, it's a very solid pickup for any of you Tower Defense fans out there, and an enjoyable game all around.			"

												This game defines the tower defense genre for me.tl;dr: 10/10, will play againIn terms of dollars per hour of entertainment, this is one of the best financial decisions I ever made. :)Disliked:- The story line is a bit cheesy.  But then, I don't play tower defense for storyline.- Absolutely critical hints are given as pop-ups throughout the game, which can be easy to miss.  (Looks pointedly at the backspace and 'F' keys.)Liked:- The game is a pure tower defense.- The challenge level of the game is excellent.  There are maps with no-lose easy modes, and maps for which getting the gold medal will require trial and failure of many different strategies - which means when you finally find a working strategy, you feel like a genius.  Really excellent attention to level balance must have been paid at some point.- The checkpointing/back up to checkpoint mechanic is essential.  I didn't know it existed for the first tens of hours I played the game, and enjoyment went way up when a friend told me about it.- The fast forward capability 'F' is awesome.- The game is pretty.  You don't need absurd gaming hardware to enjoy the visuals.  And, if you have absurd gaming hardware, the visuals look great.  I have midrange hardware and the game is beautiful to behold.			"

												My second most played game on steam, and definitely the best tower defense game I've played.  It has a really good replay value, and the developers have released quite a lot of DLC, both free and paid.  The game is very reasonably priced for the quality, and has been on sale for only a few dollars on many occasions.			"

												Defense Grid is probably the best tower defense game ever made. It's quite standard - all strategy and timing and not much ""action."" The gold rankings are VERY demanding and you can wring a lot of enjoyment out of them if you want, or you can just enjoy the campaign and extra maps.The narrator and story deserve a special shout-out. In a genre that usually has no context or real attachment to what's going on, Defense Grid has a light but poignant story.			"

												Maybe the reference of tower defense games out there. Best tower defense game available IMO. Good graphics, nice audio (great speaker), addictive levels and most important for a tower defense game: absolutely great balanced. That's most probably the greatest point on Defense Grid. No other td game has such great balanced levels. I've played through the missions multiple times and still do so since the game is fun. The levels are very good designed and the hordes of enemies are fun to blast away. As I said above this game is the reference in tower defense.			"

												This is a great tower defense game - possibly the best on Steam.The controls are very intuitive, the towers are diverse and useful, and there are plenty of game modes for replayability.Towers range from the typical machine gun tower to AOE damage towers to utility towers like the slow-movement-speed tower and more.This game has some unique features that differentiate it from other tower defense games. Checkpoints occur at various intervals throughout each mission and the player can simply hit ""backspace"" to return to the previous checkpoint (or hit backspace multiple times to go to a specific checkpoint). An ""orbital laser"" ability allows you to destroy large groups of enemies at one time as a sort of ""last ditch effort"". This ability is on a long cooldown, but lets you get out of a tight spot quickly.			"

												The premise is simple, a slew of alien baddies enter the map in waves and travel the shortest path to steal your power cores, you must build a maze/grid of towers to stop them. You gain more resources by killing the aliens, resources you desperately need to upgrade or build more towers to kill the ever increasing new waves of aliens. Every game is basically a race to figure out the optimum defensive grid. After you beat each level, harder varied challenge versions of the level open up. I never felt frustration or tedium while playing and replaying the levels until I was able to figure out the optimal playthrough, and the balance and pacing was really spot on. It was very fun, addictive, and well worth my money, and the time I spent playing through it almost three times.Defense Grid: The Awakening is hands down the best tower defense game I have ever played. It is addictive, fun, worthwhile and ultimately fulfilling. Buy it now.			"

												If the game is on sale and you like tower defense games you should give it a try. Please note that there are some things that DG makes different compared to other tower defense games ... - No pause button to help plan your strategy (you can press backspace though to reload a previous checkpoint)- No timer telling you when exactly your orbital cannon will come off cooldown - Mobs can walk through towers in case you manage to block their path by accident - While games like Sanctum 2 or Prime World:Defenders tell you which path the aliens will take and how placed towers will affect them, Defense Grid doesn't (which results in lots of reloading -.-)So it's a 78/100			"

Coming back to it, I found myself actually liking the game itself. It's a cute little tower defense game. Build towers to make mazes and slow the enemies advance to your power generator. The plot is a bit dumb, and it doesn't usually matter, but the game itself is simple and fun. If it's cheap, get it! I liked it.			"

												I'm updating this review, 5 years later.Defense Grid is still a timeless classic, one of the best games full stop as far as I'm concerned, and certainly best in the tower defence.genre.You really need all the DLC, but that's not a problem. There are a great range of towers, a lot of choice how to maze or otherwise place towers, and the plot in the form of narration is epic, rather than just shoving a new map in your face with no backstory.Some people may prefer the slightly more glamorous graphics of Defense Grid 2, for me I'll always come back to DG1. Both are very solid games.The only downside is the lack of multiplayer, but having said that I have seen almost no TD's, ever, which have implemented a decent version of this.			"

The graphics and sound are pretty good, and the gameplay is challenging without becoming impossible in the later levels.

But the most important part? This game is fun and never feels like ""work"".  Highly recommended.			"

												Excellent game. On each level you have to place a variety of defensive towers, choosing the position and type of tower carefully thanks to your limited budget. As waves of enemies try to cross the map, your towers will (hopefully) wipe them out, earning you extra funds which you can spend on ... more towers. The strategy element is strong - do you place lots of cheap towers, or keep replacing a handful of towers with more powerful (and very expensive) upgrades? The waves of aliens are varied enough to keep you guessing, and there are dozens of levels to play through.			"

Long sentence that, but gotta get all the positive sentiment I have for this game out in a singular statement. The original maps are the best and the maps that followed, available here on Steam make it almost infinitely replayable. Only thing is the desire to see this game reimagined at a newer point in time without betraying the original masterful achievement of the first, which we all know is nearly impossible. So, play THIS game and be glad for it, if tower defense appeals to you. Yes. This is a game I am very glad to recommend.			"

												One of the best takes on the tower defense genre yet.  It actually attaches a good story, and feasible explanation behind your progression.  The ""cores in / cores out"" mechanic allows you to salvage a setup gone bad, which is nice.  Later levels are impressively challenging.   The game encourages having flexible and useful setups rather than just trying to confuse the routing AI.			"

												Of all tower defence games played, this remains the one I keep returning to.  All the modes and the additions added to it over the years (excelent value for the money) have made sure this game is keeps you going. 9/10 (a no-brainer to pick up at any sale)			"

												So you know those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ online Tower Defence games? Yeah, those. Think that, but with actually good graphics, the existance of a story, well written dialogue and many other challenge modes. Plenty of DLC for reasonable prices, including a portal themed one with GLADOS shouting at you. It's entirely worth your time.			"

So many unique levels each with different games types to master.  Score based rank system that will encourage you to perfect your strategies.  Also comes with a encouraging AI voice that adores you... not sure if that is a good thing...10/10 would be adored again			"

												Beat the campagin + DLC in 13 hours. Pros----Good stroy-Decent sounds-Challenging -Maps designed well-extra game modesCons----Only 8-10 towers---not much synergy between them-Probably about 10 different enemy typesI like tower defense games. I played WoW Frozen throne TD online, Bloons TD, dozens of flash/apps TD's. This game is better then all flash/app TD's. Probably better then Bloons TD. Limited towers and enemies really ruined it for me. The price is fair and it's worth playing none the less.The biggest reason i got this was because DG2 came out and has multiplayer. However, after playing DG1 and watching DG2, not much has changed. Here's what i gather,DG2 has multiplayer, but the story is terrible. All the same towers, i assume enemies too, but with better graphics. After all is said and done i don't think i will play DG2, or revisit DG1 to earn some acheievements and play the other game mdoes. It is a fun game, and addiciting, with a fair price tag, i just always felt like something awesome was gonna happen but it never did....Still a solid 8/10 "

About the game well it is based on aliens that are trying to attack you base and you must stop them.  The aliens go after things call power cores which are basically your life in the game, so protect them at all cost!  The graphics in this game are great and it runs smoothly.  Very fun game to play!			"

												This is one of the best games that I have ever played. The graphics are great, the sound is great, and the number of available missions (and variants) is great. There are a vast amount of different approaches that can be taken with most of the missions, and just upgrading all of your guns usually will not work. The medals, leaderboard scoring, and the achievements provide something to strive for. There is quite possibly over 100 hours of game play in all of the core and DLC missions combined, so getting this title on sale would be an absolute steal, and well worth it at regular price.			"

												What's better than killing defenseless zombies rushing towards you? Aliens walking in straight line, while being mauled endlessly by the defensive measures you have placed in advance. Yes, Defense Grid is a typical tower defense game, where nameless characterless pixels try to move on the screen to steal your resources and making it out alive. Your mission is to stop them, and your arsenal are towers that are equipped with either gatling gun, flame-throwers, tesla coil and missiles amongst others. With an apt in-game voiced commentary, there isn't a dull moment while you keep the alien population in check. Defense Grid stands out especially in the ability to shape the paths for the aliens, challenging the players to best themselves on repeated attempts on the same map, by making the alien's suicidal mission even more grueling each time around. With a number of challenges like poisonous cores, Defense Grid is a title that offers hours and hours of entertainment to the faithful.			"
