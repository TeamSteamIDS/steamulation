								This game is incredibly fun! The simple premise of turn based tower defense type gameplay where numbered cards must be combined and discarded to match the number of a selected group of attacking monsters grows deeper as the game progresses. Potions to add or subtract numbers from a monster's power combined with spells to move them around, stop them, or get rid of them entirely will keep you on your toes. As the numbers get bigger on enemies and cards, it gets tougher to make full screen clearing matches but it feels amazing when you do and you'll score tons of points as well! There is also a free play mode where you can jack the difficulty way up that is quite mind bending as well. This game is highly recommended if you like numbers puzzles and/or have kids who need to practice good math skills. Can't wait to see what else ends up in the game!			"

								The Counting Kingdom has caused quite a stir in my house, as my seven-year-old son is mad at me for pulling him away from the game ater 45 minutes to brush his teeth and go to bed. He picked it up very quickly and became quite engrossed in solving the math problems and finding creative solutions to the latter levels.If you have a child that likes math, he or she will gravitate to Counting Kingdom for sure. If your kid doesn't like math, it's a great way to change that. The addition problems are simple, but how they get solved is addicively fun!			"

								This game is absolutely amazing! The gameplay is straightforward: Select adjacent monsters on the grid and match their sum to one of your available spells. Spells can be combined into larger numbers to take out more monsters at once, and potions alter the values on the monsters. It's easy enough for anyone to figure out, even for somebody as mathematically challenged as myself. As you progress through the levels, the numbers get larger, and new potions with effects like freezing a row are gradually added. The end result is an experience that's both simple and challenging, and most importantly: fun as hell.The only way The Counting Kingdom can disappoint is if you miss out on playing it. If I was still young, this game is the kind of fun that would have made me late to school, but since I'm a an adult, it makes me late to work.			"

								I have to admit, I was not expecting to have as much fun with this game as I did. It's a kids game targeted at children ages 6 - 8 or so, and this review largely is as well (or moreso: any parents reading this)The game is polished & adorable, with bright colors, pleasant music, and cute monsters that are largely nonthreatening and quite imaginative.At its core it's a puzzle game using pretty much the most basic of addition/subtraction- and while the difficulty/complexity of the math problems never really increased, it would have felt out of character for the game to do so.The gameplay is solid & bug free, with a simple premise (matching the values of monsters on the field with ""spells"" in your spellbook. You can modify the values of the monsters, and add your spells for greater sums to be used in combos, not as a requirement- just for a higher score. Though clearing 7 monsters at once with a well placed spell is fairly satisfying, even as a 24-year old adult.It's fairly long too, which is a pretty nice plus for a $4 game.If you have kids learning math, I'd highly recommend this one. It's pretty easy to pick up, no stress, and just as fun as any of the more mindless apps on the market (Angry Birds/Temple Run, that kind of time vortexes.) Seriously, I would have loved to play this as a child, and still had fun with this as an adult. So if you're an adult that's bored and would like a time-waster, this is actually a fairly decent/low-commitment game as well!I also did a video review if you'd like to see gameplay/more in-depth impressions (kid friendly):

								Seriously a fantastic game, for all ages. I just spent a few hours aimlessly counting and destroying monsters.Besides that, it's super cute! The art is absolutely amazing, and really well thought out.The AI also seems really well done. The game won't leave you hanging with your last couple monsters on the map and wrong cards - it will start giving you correct cards.For all those who loved games like Treasure Mathstorm or Math Blaster when they were younger, this will remind you of those good times.

Short and mildly entertaining for people who are already good at math. Either way, well worth the buy regardless of sale status. I have no complaints about it.			"

								Absolutely recommended! This game already has that elusive, addictive quality. Combining scrolls, using potions and adding monsters together is a blast. The production is already of a high quality too. The presentation is bright and cheery enough that children will enjoy it and yet not so cute that adults would feel childish playing it. In short, it's very enjoyable to play.			"

								This game is adorable and is definitely NOT just for kids! If you ever liked games like Brain Age but wished it involved hilarious monsters then you need to get The Counting Kingdom. Kids will benefit from the fun and challenging math stuff but everyone will enjoy the strategy of racking up the biggest combos of monsters you can, then blasting them with spells. I highly recommend this game for anyone who likes puzzle games or wants to introduce kids in their lives to the awesomeness of gaming without letting them play GTA or Call of Duty.			"

								This is a very cute addition game which has surprising layers to it. While it's intended for kids, it's also good for low-impact gaming for adults when you're just not up to the concentration needed for platformers or combat.  It combines tower defense with addition skills, and can be surprisingly twisty! Fun without being laborious for short bite-sized pockets. You won't play this (probably) for an hour or five at a time, but for ten or fifteen minutes between online tasks or while waiting on downloads, it's really enjoyable.			"

												To be short and sweet, this game is one of those classic, ""Good game but for the right price only."" What I mean is that this game is great for what it is. A simple game about counting, defeating enemies by doing simple math and thinking. The game is very short if only doing the story missions, like me, finishing in little under 2 hours. I procured this game for nine dollars but I would recommend getting this game either in a bundle, maybe, or on sale. If you find it for a good deal, buy it for you little one or yourself, if you're really bored. Just to say again, it is a recommended game but only for the right price and audience.			"

								I've only had this game for a short time, but I've already managed to rack up hours of gameplay. It's just so wonderful!!The game itself is a turn based, tower defense game involving math(addition & subtraction), and magic. The design is splendid; the art, the music, and gameplay are all kid friendly. For instance, some of the built-in mechanics will even gently guide younger children to the answers if they become stuck.There are a myriad of ways to clearing the monsters though. You can add spells together, and chain monsters together in various ways. You're also given potions with varying effects as you progress through the game, so there's a lot of creativity in how you beat each level. That creative freedom is what really gets me addicted. My favorite thing to do is take big risks, and let the monsters stack up a bit. Then unleash all the potions, and big spells in an attempt to get 'full clears'.  : )Story mode itself has numerous levels to progress through, and while you can revisit them at any time; there's also 'free play' mode with scaling difficulties. Oh, and each level is generated on the fly; so there's never any sequence to memorize. It's always going to be a new, and exciting challenge!A simply charming game for all ages; I definitely recommend it!			"

												This is a very well-designed game. It presents addition as a fundamental game challenge that increases in difficulty as the player continues. Unlike most education games, it's the game that takes the spotlight. The core mechanics are very strong, and the game develops a one-more-level mentality even if you already understand arithmetic. The potions and sorcery aspects are fun, and the overall aesthetic design is very appealing. If you, or your child, has struggled with addition, I highly recommend it. You won't notice you're learning anything until you already have. If you're already proficient with arithmetic, it's still fun. Perhaps pick it up on a future sale. It will give you 2-4 hours of gameplay. Overall my only complaint is that I wish it had continued on into more advanced math; which isn't a complaint so much as a hint to the developers.			"

												A simple, cute game that kind-of teaches basic addition and substraction - the main mechanic is summing numbers in different combinations to defeat monsters. Overall it's fun and cute (I do keep coming back to that word). Not a lot of replayability for adults, but would be a good game for teaching kids about basic addition and some subtraction. Things that would make this game better: multiplication/division, achievements and some sort of challenge or endless mode that wasn't tied specifically to the ""story"" of the game.			"

												Cute game.  Add numbers, perform basic arithmetic, destroy monsters.  Not much else to say really.  Got this game as part of a HumbleBundle.  Not sure it's worth full price for your average casual player.  If you have kids and they need to learn how to add a great, but if not, then not sure how much replayability this game really has.  It has a little strategy in terms of combining numbers and monsters in trying to get them to match, but the board itself is simple, so it does not take advantage of another features that it could.  The monsters do not really have special abilities or anything, so it really just comes down to how to match monsters with numbers.  So while entertaining for a while, I'm not sure how often, if at all, one would revisit this game after playing through the little main campaign.  Still, worth playing at least once given its unique nature.			"

												In the Counting Kingdom, by Little Worlds Interactive, you will take on the role of a wizard that has to protect various castles in the realm. To do this you will have potions and spells to help defeat the monsters that are invading. In a turn-based, grid tower defense game you will be faced with monsters that contain numbers, only the exact amount of the number, or a combination of the monsters to a number can stop them. Can you take care of all the monsters before the knock down the walls?Graphically this has a light cartoony kids feeling to it. With the light colors, and the cute looking monsters you can see that this game is meant to be played by all ages. I really liked the layout of how everything fit on the screen, it wasn't ever too cluttered but it also didn't feel empty. The map music is this nice light guitar solo that makes me think of story time. The in game music is a fun battle tune. The sounds of the monsters grunting as you select them does get a little old if you play for a long time, but its nothing that is going to cause you to quit the game.The controls are simply point and click. You click on the next castle you are going to have to protect, and then you will be clicking on potions, monsters, and spells in game.As you can probably tell this is an educational game that is masquerading as a turn-based tower defense game. I have to say that they have done a DAMN good job making it both enjoyable, entertaining, and of course educational. Sure it has been a long time since last I had to deal with addition and subtraction, but I tell you what, there was something about this game that made me want to keep playing the next level. My only true gripe about the game is that you were taken back to the map screen after successfully completing each level. I would have liked a smooth transition between at least all the levels in a certain area. There are a couple of different areas, and of course as the game progresses the numbers on the monsters gets bigger, but you also get more types of potions to use. These potions range from ones that increase the monster's number, decrease the monster's number, zero out the monster's number, move a monster to a different row, clear off an entire row, or freeze an entire row for a couple of turns.If you are looking for something that the whole family to play, this is the game to play. There's a difficulty setting, as part of the game, so if you need to make it easy you can do so, or you can pump it up to be a little more challenging. All I have to say is that I couldn't put the game down until I finished it, and I was left wanting more, I wanted to save more castles, defeat more monsters, and though I technically could have started the game over again, I would be very interested to see what the developers could have given us as the next area, or hopefully area(s). This game has to be a 9.2 out of 10.			"

			The Counting Kingdom is an educational game available on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/302750/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your thing: https://twitter.com/TheSocioPsycho...		

The Counting Kingdom is an educational game about adding, as it aims to help teach people about math. The lay out of the game is well done and is fluid during combat. Sadly it only contains adding not subtracting or any other math related subjects. The game makes the player feel in control as they learn, and leaves them with a sense of accomplishment. Its not that long but could be a teaching aid to someone learning the basics of math, as the adding count does not go above 50.  It has no major depth or progression in which would then leave people who just like the game-play style and not seeking to learn to be left wanting more. It is not bad for what it does, and is meant to aid in teaching, and I feel it does that well enough allowing the player to gain critical thinking skills.

 Having a weak spot for maths games in general, I thought, I might give it a try.Before going into the gameplay, as always, we look at the options menu first.Being a unity game, the graphical options are in the launch window with your settings for graphical fidelity and resolution.Audio Options are ingame with sliders for SFX and Music.The gameplay itself is fairly simplistic and whenever a new element is added, it is well explained. Basically you try to match monsters(or the sum of combined monsters) with your spells which are also numbers. Since every level plays out differently there is no preset solution for the level, so you can find a better one.After each level your score is evaluated with a fairly well known system of 1-3 stars depending on your score.With that said, I would not be surprised if the game gets ported to IOS or Android later on.  Apart from that I do not really have any more to say than the tl:dr.Is the game worth it? 10€ for (from what I have heard) fairly short game is quite a high price. Taking it into consideration though that this game is an educational game the price is pretty much right.My recommendation therefore is that if you want a maths game for your little ones, then go ahead and buy it.If you are an avid gamer though, I would wait until the game goes on a sale(~50%). So it is not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination, but the price point is a little bit to high, in my opinion.			"

												More Reviews @ TheVideogameBacklog.comHaving two children now really gives me a different perspective on games as a whole. Will I still play Warhammer: Space Marine? Yes I will. I would like to play games around my kids as well and then I’d also like them to play with me at times. If at all possible, maybe they could even learn something. The Counting Kingdom does this well. With numbers as your spells to cast on the appropriate number of bad guys, you should be well equipped for this challenge.Let’s break down one of the most important things for me lately: difficulty. The Counting Kingdom is as difficult as you want to make it. In its basic form, it’s not that bad. Granted, the equations get a bit more complicated later on by making you count a bit higher. You can overlap your spells to get higher totals to help clear the whole map and get bonuses, but you don’t need to…. but you can. There are potions for you to use to raise or lower the numbers on the monsters attacking your castle to help match your spells. There are also potions to move monsters about the board to help connect and clear the board.So what’s the point to this whole exercise? Well, to keep a sharp mind and save a kingdom! Both of which are worthy goals. Like I said before, you don’t have to race though this game. The game seems to punish you more for bad tactical errors than it does math mistakes. Take your time and try to clear the board for a bonus if you can. Don’t freak, this isn’t a game with a hard grading curve. Getting three stars doesn’t take much effort and that’s fine for building up confidence in my kids when they old enough to know that I’m not just killing monsters, but saving a kingdom using mathematics as well.Score: Tasty!The Counting Kingdom is a learning game based on simple addition math mixed with some tactics and strategy. They don’t have you do more than addition, but I’m not really sure how they could anyway. It’s simple, but can be as complicated as you want it to be while you can sharpen your quick math skills. Little Worlds Interactive went out to make a fun math game and they succeeded! Well played… I now know that I can’t do math with people watching from behind my back.			"

												Excellent game for children; if you are trying to get a decently educational game for your child, this is perfec.t the graphics are great, the mechanics are perfectly executed.Unfortunately, it doesn't have much value for most others. I beat it in about 2 hours, and can't imagine playing again without a major update; it doesn't have much in the way of replayability. I'd be happy to see an update with multiplication!A really good game for its target audience, so it's great.			"

												Plot of the Counting Kingdom: You are a little boy tasked with saving the kingdom from monsters using magic spells (increasingly complex addition problems). At the end, you are rewarded with a giant cake, which you share with the monsters, because you are a sweet boy, although in such case I hope you have not actually been murdering the monsters with your math acumen.Gameplay wise, Counting Kingdom is a turn-based tower defense game. Each monster has a number. You have various “spells” at your disposal, small-to-large numbers that you must add up the monsters to equal. A handful of potions allow you to tweak monster numbers or “cheat” by exploding or freezing a line of combatants. And since spell numbers don’t always match monster numbers, if you can’t apply the right “spells” right off, the monster horde increases next turn, and so forth. I don’t think the game will ever pose a significant challenge to an adult of average math skills, but the sums, and the hordes, still get large enough to require thinking and strategy. And it’s a great help for kids transitioning to big-number addition (look! a big number is just smaller numbers added together. You don’t have to add all the numbers on screen up at once. You can make 10 out of these numbers, and 11 out of these numbers, and bam! 21!). Anyhoo. The Counting Kingdom is an appealingly designed, easy to learn, trickier to master math game.			"

												Extra Credits recommended this game, so I bought it.I am an educator, and I made my 10 year old brother who is in year 4 play this game. He likes it. This game allows him to practice numeracy interactively.Unfortunately, we do feel that it's only mildly fun due to high engagement competition from the already massive gaming market. I suppose all games have huge competitions nowadays.It is still fun, nonetheless, especially if it can be integrated with other digital or online learning management. I do think the game deserves a sequel.This is my first time using it, so I will offer further, more useful feedback after we venture further into the game. :)			"

												Even today it is suprising how little attention and care is given to eucational games. The counting Kingdom was a great find. At first it reminded me of games like Plants VS Zombies but the Counting Kingdom is clever and fun in it's own unique way. The gameplay is simple enough for young kids to easily pick up and play but gives enough options to solve each problem diffently and keep things interesting for all ages. For some one that has only just started learning addition and subtraction it may progress in to bigger numbers a little to quickly but overall it has a nicely balanced paceing that keeps things entertaining as you progress. If the game was extended more variety in music, art and the inclusion of multiplication would be welcome. In this case, for the price and scope of the game it holds up very well. "

												I find it hard to decide whether to recommend this game or not, honestly.  I picked it up when it was on sale for $5 because I saw it on Extra Credits.  I figured it was a math game, and I like math, so it should be a fun little diversion.  It was, but that's where the problem comes in.  I beat the game in less than an hour.In terms of mechanics The Counting Kingdom is quite sound-everything works together, complexity and difficulty are added in nicely as the game progresses.  It all feels a bit same-y though.  The difficulty I also found to be a bit low until the wizard was introduced: then it had the wrong kind of difficulty, and I lost 2 towers on the final level (the only tower losses I took through the entire game) due to the wizard hitting a doubling tile and not drawing any ways to make 30.I wish you could cast spells greater than 30.  That would have added a lot.The game could have stood to be a bit longer, but I'm sure I'll get further playtime out of it with speedrun attempts.Even after writing the above I'm still not sure whether to recommend: it was a fun hour, but it's hard to suggest $5, let alone 10 for an hour of gameplay.  I'd suggest picking this game up if you see it 75% off or more, but I can't justify recommending it for much less than that in its current state.			"

												A great game for those of you with young kids. It nicely balances that delicate tightrope between compelling gameplay and educational content, which is sometimes a challenge if a child thinks the game is more classroom lesson than fun. Take a look. You will not be disappointed.			"

												I grew up in the age where you would play Oregon Trail in class when it was computer time.   That was the only fun educational game I played, until The Counting Kingdom came along.  Not only is the game fun and makes even adults think about the math puzzles, the game is just plain adorable.  The monsters and kid wizard have a great art style and colors that I love.  Even as an adult playing this game, I get a sense of accomplishment when I clear the puzzles.  I recommend this game for kids and adults and it would be something fun for parents and kids to play together!			"

												I'm good at numbers and stuff!  Basic math game at it's finest. Quite simple; easy to learn.  It is quite simply put just an adding game. With only 31 levels to play though; you could quite easily beat this game in a day or less. as you progress though the sections of the map you open new mobs and new potions/abilities.  Got this game though a humble bundle for less than 2 dollars; so I think that was worth it. If you want a casual game that is easy to play.  I do suggest it; If you don't like math or loud noises (could just turn off speakers), then I don't.  I am not entirely for or against this game. So I give it an over all 2.3 of 5  where it falls short is standard volume is over bearing.falls a bit short in length of gameplay. If it had chapters to it, Chapter one could be adding eventually having multiplcation in it; yes at one point there is a tile that multiplys the enemy, but I am not counting that.			"

												I got this game to play with my 6 y/o and it's been great so far. She really enjoys it (although I wish we could customize the avatar to at least switch the gender, but hey this is progress). It's a challenge to find educational games that are entertaining to play and don't feel like shovelware. So this game is great.The UX is quite streamlined and feels targetted towards younger players. The tutorial levels are intuitive and gradual, as they should be. Even after the tutorial levels are complete, I feel like the game's AI is coordinating the presentation of available spells, potions and monsters to encourage abstract thinking and help the player, but I might be giving it too much credit.Overall I'm very glad I got this game for my child. My only apprehension is that it's yet another game where the protagonist is a white boy. And we wonder why women and minorities avoid STEM, heh.			"

												Just as simple, and just as complex as first-graders need it to be.The difficulty is also rather self-paced, and seemless, which makes it easier for little children to digest.UI is superb!Bonus points: the game is almost a-lingual, so kids that do not know English (or any other of the supported languages) can enjoy it just as much!
