If you only play single player, then go to another review, this review is entirely about co-op for the time being.BUYER BEWAREDefinition: Input lag/delay is when there is a delay between the time you input an action on your input device (controller/kb+m) and the action happening on screen.TLDR: The game in ONLINE co-op has input lag. If you are looking forward to playing co-op, please don't buy it yet.Currently Nom Nom Galaxy (NNG) has input lag when you play in co-op. Everyone, even the host, experiences this input lag. It can range anywhere from 200 ms - 500 ms (rough estimate) depending on the connection. So if I press a button, it takes 200-500 ms for the action to happen on screen. This does not happen in single player, and when all players leave a hosted game, the host goes back to single player speed. This input lag is noticeable and gets very annoying overtime as it makes you miss jumps, and makes building your factory a laggy experience. The developer Q-Games has stated that this is currently the case because they have had a rough time with netcode, as the way they do it for PS4 doesn't work here on PC.Here is the discussion thread: http://steamcommunity.com/app/226100/discussions/0/541906348050084830/The developer had every opportunity to delay this game, and fix this massive issue before launch, but chose to release it in it's current, annoying to play in co-op, state. This is unacceptable Q-Games. So I will continue to warn people not to buy your game until you decide to fix this issue.			"

Early Access Review
								This game isn't quite what I expected. I love the polish, the style, and theme. The mechanics are solid and fun.I saw it compared to things like Terraria and Starbound, and while that isn't incorrect, it's not quite right either. This isn't a sandbox  game. At the time of this review, there are ""levels"" and a finite play time. The game is broken down into days with the goal to get 100% of the market from your competitor (which as far as I can tell, is just a virtual system selling soup rather than a physical entity playing in your map). For instance, there is no enemy building a base and harvesting resources.When the day is over, you are transported back to your base to start again, some of the monster spawns and resources will have changed. I couldn't tell if it was randomly generated or based on some kind of ecology. After completing the mission the game does allow you to go back to your mission and ""continue to play"" however, you can only play one day at a time because once the day is over, it quits you out because you already have 100% of the market share.I'm not sure where they plan on going with this, if it's a linear experience or if they do plan to add more sandbox elements in it like the other games in the genre. From what I played I enjoyed every bit of it, but am a little let down on the fact it isn't an open ended, indefinite game type. Maybe that's my own failings for not doing enough research, but I would love to see the polish, art, and mechanics of Nom Nom Galaxy to have a sandbox mode.At this time, it's realyl well done, but there isn't enough content to warrant the sticker price, so for that reason I cannot recommend the game. Hopefuly when more mechanics are added, levels, or what have you, I can reverse my position.			"

												Q-Games' PixelJunk series has always had its own quirky style, and while the developer's experiments may not have always hit the mark, they've at worst been worth a look. With the company's latest game Nom Nom Galaxy landing on  Steam – it's time to find out what the chefs in Kyoto have cooked up with their take on the sandbox genre.As a new Astroworker for SoupCo, you'll be helping the company corner the galaxy's soup market by keeping ravenous aliens supplied with a steady supply of delicious broth. Like the soup that you'll be producing, the game has a number of ingredients thrown into the mix that make for a tasty experience. Starting with a sandbox stock, the firm's added a dollop of base building, a dash of resource management, a smidgen of tower defence, and finally topped it off with a generous seasoning of both online and offline co-op.The main mode that'll introduce you to the game's mechanics is 'corporate conquest' which sees your Astroworker sent to a variety of worlds to gather ingredients, make soup, and blast it into space to your waiting customers. Each planet that you arrive on is presented as a side-on cross-section, and you'll guide your Astroworker across some marvellously rendered 2D cartoon landscapes, burrowing into the ground to collect blue matter and ingredients that you'll use to build your base or make soup respectively.To begin with, you'll have a limited number of structures that you can build, but even with this relatively modest selection, actually getting to grips with what works and what doesn't from a layout perspective takes a little time. Despite a couple of tutorial levels – which feel more like information dumps than teaching tools – you'll need to try and fail a couple of times to get to grips with certain gameplay nuances.The sense of accomplishment when you build a smooth running facility gets even stronger as you unlock more and more toys to use, and whereas in the early stages you'll have been harvesting and delivering all of the ingredients to your soup machines personally, you'll start to introduce robots and conveyor belts to take a lot of the menial tasks out of your hands. That said, you can't rest on your laurels too much as you'll need to make sure that there's a steady flow of the right ingredients, while at the same time ramping up production so that you can deliver the soup to market faster than your competitors. As you gather more and more market share, your business rivals won't take too kindly to you stealing their slice of the soup pie, and they'll do anything that they can to stop you from cornering the market. Consequently, you'll have to repel occasional attacks from their minions as they aim to destroy or disrupt your production plant.Fortunately, there are a few defensive options in your bag of tricks that you can use to protect your base from these assaults. However, even with a few strategically placed sentry turrets, there'll be weak links that the invaders will worm their way through, so more often than not you'll have to get your hands dirty fighting them off yourself.While these skirmishes certainly keep you on your toes – and can really throw a spanner into your well planned works – they're by far the weakest part of the gameplay. There just isn't anything gratifying or impactful about any of the combat, and whether you're defending your base or trying to pacify some of the more aggressive ingredients for your soup, it all feels like a chore, only succeeding in making you itch to get back to selling your concoctions.Thankfully, once you've completed any of the conquest stages, you can replay them either from scratch or with your constructed facility fully intact via the S.O.O.P Simulator, which has all the fun of blasting broth into space without any pesky rivals trying to sabotage your efforts. Adding to the longevity of the game further are 'galactic challenges' which refresh every few days, and let you compete asynchronously with other players in a variety of events ranging from races to sales challenges.Nom Nom Galaxy has an odd premise that's been blended into a surprisingly interesting sandbox experience. While some of the gameplay ingredients don't necessarily work that well together – with the combat in particular leaving a bitter aftertaste – you'll at least be able to cleanse your palate with another draft of its fun base building and resource management, and that'll keep you coming back for more servings.

Early Access Review
								I was reluctant to get this game for awhile because I was afraid it was just another Terarriaesque game but I'm really pleased to discover that isn't the case. It incorporates several different mechanics into a very different and more directed experience. The game is focused around your base, a soup factory. You expand it by building modules; soup making machines, rockets to send the soup off to other planets and get paid, and turrets to defend the operation. In addition to the structural aspect you can also set up a network of robot laborers and conveyor belts to aid in distributing ingredients and soups throughout your factory, I haven't gotten to far into this aspect yet but it is something I'm looking forward to figuring out. You go out into the world and bring back ingredients, combining two of them into a soup. You can farm plants in oxygenated areas of the planet, however most of the planet is devoid of oxygen and you will slowly suffocate there.  Playtime is divided into days, at the end of each day your profits for the day are displayed to you, you are given the opportunity to unlock certain upgrades, and then a new day begins starting you back at your base.At this stage in early access I don't think there is a ton of content.Also the game is lacking online multiplayer.However it does have splitscreen 2 player co-op, which is a major plus.Overall I would say this is a game to watch, and well worth picking up at the discounted price. The base building, day breakdown, and soup selling have the game feeling fresh and it shouldn't be mistaken as just another terraria type game. While it isn't perfect in it's execution of all these different mechanics it has a lot to build on and is quite fun as it is.			"

												It's a sort of economic-RTS Terraria. With maybe a touch of Dwarf Fortress. And good, overall. To begin with, you build a base, run around collecting ingredients, and ship them off (in the form of soup) to hungry aliens. Then, you want to expand the level of automation, because collecting every ingredient by hand is rather slow... but automation is a tricky business. So, you work at balancing the need to keep pouring out soup with the desire to automate just the easiest parts of the process first... and then develop from there.  Some parts of the implementation still feel a little rough around the edges, but I really enjoy the concept, and it's even better if you have a like-minded friend to play couch co-op with. Thumbs up, as they say in the movies.			"

								This game is awesome, feels like a RTS Terraria. The only thing that sucks is you have to play hours and hours of missions to unlock stuff, so its more like a mission based game rather than a sandbox like terraria. But still don't let that stop you lots of fun to be had. Best of the pixel junk games too.			"

								Your typical ""Terraria"" game with a twist. It's quite a bit more arcady then other games in those genres, with a constant threat of losing the market of soup, you must go out, find ingredients, make soup and ship it off, eventually just doing it by manpower alone becomes too slow, so purchasing aids is in order until the entire game turns into a soup making factory. You could think of it as having a slight Tekkit feel to it, maybe even as far as a... simple Tekkit Terraria.The graphics have a nice textured feel to them, it's certainly one of the better looking games in its genre, with colorful characters and plenty to gawk at.The controls feel nice, although the character can feel a tad slow at times, the tank is even slower but well... it's a tank. I found that not all was explained to me too clearly however, but it doesn't take long to figure out yourself.Gameplay's addictive, typical Pixeljunk stuff, I find all their games are really fun, this is no exception.I bought this in Early Access and as of now there's little content, no saves, bugged keyboard and mouse support and a few bugs, but I'd say this has a lot of potential and I'm looking forward to more.Edit: Keyboard and mouse support has been added, saves are in, more content has been added and it's slowly realizing its potential, I could cry manly tears I'm that proud.

Early Access Review
								Nom Nom Galaxy is a strange hybrid of defence tower and resource management, been following this game for awhile ever since it was revealed in March last year and finally had a chance to play it when it released on Steam Early Access.After a 4 hour session with the game, I feel like i can give a suitable verdict based on what I played.A few reviews have drawn similiarities between this game and Terraria and they wouldn't be that far off.The 2D geometry, the pixel aesthetics and controls all feel quite similiar to the aforementioned game, where it differs though is it's execution which I'll get to in abit.Since this game is of course still in Alpha, there is a lot of missing features still not in place but what is there is enough to play through for a couple of hours and then some so its not unplayable.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Good PointsThe aesthetics are pleasing and simple, you can clearly see where your character is and where all the items in the world are so you'll hardly get lost trying to look for a item.The controls (i recommend on controller) are decent with some support for mouse and keyboard which is not quite there yet, rotating blocks was one feature I had trouble with, prompting me to switch to controller and the difference was significant.The sound quality is acceptable, there isn't much in the way of background music but you will notice the punchy and effective sound bites that add to the overall atmosphere, e.g., the sound of you smacking invaders and the gulp of your customers slurping down your soup.Don't let the Alpha label deterring you from supporting this game, there is already quite a variety of items you can craft and plenty of combinations of soup you can make to turn that all important profit.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bad Points*Possible spolier*When buying the tank, the controls felt very stiff and trying to scale any wall of more than 6 blocks were nigh impossible making this purchase a wasted oppurtunity since its concept is generally fantastic*Spoiler end*Oxygen should be extended when outside base, its okay at the moment but if you want to do any real exploring you'll best hope for those precious pockets of air.The robot AI is not very good, Charlie and Charles are great for picking up items and automating some of tediousness of the soup making process but they prioritise storing your ingredients over making that precious soup if they are given the choice.And probably most vexing of all is the limited corridors you can place. *READ* 4 Way Corridor.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------All in all though, I'm happy I picked up this game even if i did miss the early bird offer on their site and ended up paying for the £15 standard price.This game is obviously still in Alpha so there a ton of stuff they can still implement and fix so here are my suggestions:-A 4 way corridor-Jet Pack/grappling hook please, sick of dying to fall damage and the pogo stick is...yeah.-I assume the passive improvments still need implementing (99 research points!)-Smarter AI for poor Charlie and Charles or allowing us the option to choose their list of priorities e.g.,take ingredients to closest relevant soup dispenser > take finished soup to avilable rocket > store ingredient in hand,from highest priority to lowest.-Oxygen mask, you can send mini rockets packing delicious soup through space but a means of external oxygen storage is non-existent?-That vacuum tank is awesome but it's way too hampered by its cumbersome controls and limited jet capability-A clock icon would be useful to track the progress of day-Extending 2 ingredients soups to 3 maybe? -After a day is over and you start off a new day, the player character keeps the same level of health from the previous day. Can a feature be implemented when it's full on the next day? Would remove some of the hassle from wasting potential ingredients on a start of a new day just to get their health back to full.-Implementing a way for Charlie and Charles to use those floating elevators? They seem to be stuck to the platform they travel back and forth on-On that note, perhaps a system that allows the the player to take the current ingredient out of their hands or swapping it with another ingredient, e.g., if they're running back and forth with a ingredient that can't be used for a soup dispenser yet because that soup dispenser is waiitng for another ingredient.Bugs-I'm not sure if it's a bug but sometimes after planting mushrooms or other plants of any sort, they dissappear after a few days, is this meant to happen? If not, then this needs looking at.-One instance when I was invaded, after a enemy died and a rocket turrent just fired a missle after it died, the missle image stayed uprght as it homed to the where the enemy disappeared. 7/10Recommended Purchase.Needs work to get it sparkling but what is there, is already solid.Looking forward to what else they have planned.

												First off, I will say this game is a lot of fun. The idea is great, the gameplay is really cool, and overall it is an awesome concept! So why can't I recommend it?This game has been abandoned by the developers with some pretty serious bugs. Progress becomes lost when you restart the game. Multiplayer and co-op is unplayable. Plants randomly stop working; recipes become lost for no reason. These things happen even in single player mode. I got through the story without many issues, but once I tried to do sandbox mode, challenges, and multiplayer, I basically couldn't do anything because of these bugs. All in all, it's a great game but not recommended due to the frustration you'll encounter.			"

												Abandon ware STAY AWAY from this game.If you like the concept of whats shown in the video you will enjoy it on SINGLE PLAYER only. Multiplayer will still lag heavily, and the game even in singleplayer will lag horribly after a certain point (i believe its about 45+min and many active entities ingame).Be aware, this game has been abandoned, no updates since 8/17/2015. It is currently 9/8/2016, and the game is still exactly at the same point multiplayer wise as it was in late 2015. Broken, laggy, rubber band like gameplay, slows to a crawl, this review applies to both the PS4 version and PC version on steam.Edit: Local Co-op works fine, if you have a very high end beefy spec'd system.Remote (Or more so world wide co-op) is horrible, broken, laggy and just plain garbage.

												While it appears clunky at first, NNG soon redeems itself with constantly adding new tools and robots to create a fully automatic soup factory. Or take matters into your own hand hunting wildlife and doing all the work by yourself. Or just run around the planet until you find the perfect spot and ressources for your delicious goods!After about 6 worlds I got enough robots to create an automatic crop-based soup factory. And as it looks like there are more worlds to come as some are hidden as well. Playtested solo, cannot commend on coop yet.

Early Access Review
								I will admit I have only spent a small amount of time on this game but already feel that this has an AMAZING amount of promise. Though it isn't very big Nom Nom Galaxy offers intuitive gameplay, a simple but enthralling story and PVP unlike any I've ever seen. In this game your goal is simple. Collect Ingredients, Make Soup, Send It Home, ??????????, Profit, Simple. But there in lies the intricacy, the game offers the player a chance to build soup EMPIRES by competeing in PVP on every world. Players best time gaining control of the soup market (measured in days) is saved to a leaderboard on each of the Planets. Players pick the Company they want to compete with and a ""Ghost"" mechanism, much like in racing games, battles you for control of the soup market.That seems a bit dumb? Thats what your telling yourself, I thought so myself when I read about the game to, but its not. This isn't like ""Cook, Serve, Delicious"" There is more to the gameplay then that. In order to become a Soup GOD, you first need to establish a base. This is accomplished by building an office, a soup making plant, and a soup rocket (sends soup home, is not powered by soup... I think). This base can be incresed in size using hallways and more soup infrastructure, it can be made more efficient via conveyor belts and robotic workers, AND it can be defended by Turrets. Why do I need to defend my soup base? Because with all trade markets there are crooks who want to bring down their opponents. So your rival in the game, a soup company ALL players are competeing against, will send waves of enemies in an attempt to destroy your office, Without the office, your base cannot produce soup, so protect it at all costs. This can be done with the turrets mentioned above as well as with weapons and tech unlocked in a semi-RPG item tree shown at the end of each work day. FINALLY: Just as there is gameplay for builders, fighters, and managers, there is also gameplay for miners. One of the elements is digging DEEP into the planets your based on to collect delicious ingredients and Matter to increase the size of your base. Players will need to be warry though, for the only source of air below the surface is pockets of air, so when digging deep mind your distance to a pocket of air, or die a horrible death. In closing: I think this game will be amazing when it hits full release. Though there are a few issues like not a lot of creatures and a limited amount of planets, there is no doubt in my mind that if this game is a success, we could easily see a Nom Nom Universe.			"

The art is beautiful, the concept is hilarious, and everything about this game feels like it has a unique yet unified style. The gameplay, while resembling Terraria and Starbound, has a much faster pace to it with the day/night cycle and the daily scoreboard pushing you to want to do better with each passing day.One great thing about this game is that it constantly had me smiling and laughing whenever I would come across a new enemy, a new type of soup or any other entity that came out of nowhere. It is a breath of fresh air of a game, and I would recommend it to anyone who might be on the fence.A friend and I did a let's play of the co-op mode.

												This PC Steam edition is a no-frills port of their preceding Xbox edition, which becomes pretty obvious once you start playing. Menus don't store settings correctly (I have to change the resolution/aspect every time I open a new session) and a number of controls haven't been transferred across properly; most menus are still labelled with Xbox-style toggles, and some fairly important functions (like an in-game pause/settings/quit menu a la 'start' button) just aren't there.For a game that's based completely on platformer carry-and-throw, it's anyone's guess where most of the objects are going when you throw them. A step to the left or right whilst in a corridor can make items fly backwards out of your hands, straight up, pretty much anywhere but where you were actually throwing them to. 'Automation' also moves so slowly that it's often faster to walk everything around yourself.Even single-player matches are constantly interrupted by 'night' every few minutes, and multiplayer sessions (even over LAN) frequently desynchronize and drop.In short, it's an Xbox party game that's being sold as a PC adventure game.

This is a very fun and unique game, my main critique probably being that the gameplay can get rather repetitive after a while, though it is still in early access.In your overall efforts to dominate the space soup market you must build up your base of operations with factories to make soup and ships to send it out. There are many other things you can add, such as robots for assistance, but factories and ships are the main things you will be needing.For positives, the game is really fun and is a concept that seems very unique. The multiplayer capabilities certainly add to this game as my friend and I had a very good time ensuring that Apache Teeth would be the dominant soup company in the galaxy.While fun the gameplay feels a bit repetitive after a while. I feel this game would greatly benefit from adding some more variety to the game. Perhaps make base defenses a bigger deal or make it so that you can raise your own army of robots to attack the enemy as they do to you. Also, the planets could feel a bit more different from each other.Overall, I definitely enjoyed my time with Nom Nom Galaxy and look forward to where it will go in the future.			"

												I honestly tried to like this game, I really did. I'm a fan of factory games, 2D survival, and platformers- this should have been right up my alley. However, the entire game is a bunch of good ideas that are executed amazingly poorly.On the plus side, the art is quite nice. The backgrounds are richly detailed and animation quality, while choppy at times, is consistent and pleasing. The music is nice and never feels annoying or repetitive during the time I played. Presentation is good across the board.The mechanics are where the game breaks down. There's too many to list here, but I'd say almost every single aspect of this game is executed to a lackluster, and possibly even lazy, degree.> You can build robots and conveyer belts to automate your factory- buut you never will because the robots are slow and idiotic, requiring mass numbers in order to even attempt efficiency.> You can discover interesting new combinations of ingredients- buut just creating as many variations on the most common ones is far easier and more efficient than scouring the map for anything rare and non-renewable. (Not to mention that more valuable soup doesn't seem to affect much: mass numbers seem way better).> You can construct a tank to help collect masses of ingredients- buut it's ridiculously expensive, slow, and only slightly faster than doing it yourself.> You can use special power-up gums to improve your abilities- buut you likely won't because their effects are temporary and not very useful (other than negating fall damage or loss of oxygen).> You get attacked by rival factions, necessitating defence- buut their pathing is so bad that by setting your base underground and walling everything off with blocks, they'll never be able to get at you. Also the turrets are terribly bad at aiming, meaning you'll have to defend everything manually anyway- which is GREAT if you were exploring already.I could go on, but I think I've given the gist of why this game eventually bored and frustrated me. There's some fun to be had here, definitely. I have 9 hours on record right now and I don't regret trying this out, but I do feel disappointed. The slow grind to get upgrades, the terribly implemented mechanics, and just the reptetition that sets in really can't save this game.It's a series of good ideas, executed poorly. If you like factory builders, try Factorio; if you like 2D survival, try Terraria.			"

												Nom Nom Galaxy is a 2D exploration game where you make soup and fight off attacks from competing companies.The basic premise of the game is you crash land on an alien planet, setup a base with soup factory and soup launching rocket, collect ingredients from the surrounding flora and fauna, and make delicious soup to launch into space which gives you market share with each successful rocket. You then have to rinse and repeat until you have 100% market share over your competing soup making companies. Pros: Really fun risk reward gameplay with a good learning curve and freedom to complete each area as you please. Cons: Controls can be mapped a bit strange but you easily get used to it. Online COOP is laggy as hell even at 30 fps.			"

												PixelJunk has once again delivered a well-wrought game.  Nom Nom Galaxy's zany mix of intergalactic soup production will keep you up later than you should be in the never-ending quest to find prime ingrediants and shuttle them to your soup factory.The split-screen coop is a blast, too, my 5-year-old nephew really enjoys playing with his uncle, although he's quite capable of ruining our factory by accident, probably best for 8 year olds+.  As an adult, I enjoy the aesthetic and challenge of cleverly utilizing the factory parts.The main downside of the game is that the scenarios are a bit prefab; you can launch right back into them with your existing factory but then the challenge is gone because the opponents are simulated with the assumption you started with nothing.  Once you've beaten the scenario, you can switch over to an unlimited time mode for unlimited building, but there's little point because the sense of challenge is largely gone.			"

												However, this game is an explorer builder. It is very unique in that your goal is to build multiple powerful factories in a multitude of galaxies and environments. By doing this you can corner the soup market and take out your competitors, who seem to like to attack when you are having a fiesta.Technology is unlocked as worlds are explored, new soup combinations tried, flavours appreciated or critisized and of course markets dominated.The game is a heck of a lot of fun, pretty looking and has music better than an upmarket cafe. Personally I like this more than Terraria, altough I still wish they'd make these explorer characters a bit tougher, they don't like falls. I can't say enough, that this is a great game and as I speak, I'm looking at the download bar and watching the around 100mb update for the game download, hoping I can play offline after it updates. :-)And as it happened I can now play offline!!!(-:			"

Early Access Review
								I liked ""Nom Nom Galaxy"" very much. It's something new, some kind of Terraria, mixed with a automization game like Factorio. It's super cool and the design is raw, but overall pretty complex. The possibilitys are almost endless and every new planet got a new, hard mission to get over! After every planet you got a new technology which would help you to get your next base even better than the old one! I'm thrilled to see how it will be in the end! BUT there are some things that really made me... sick, kinda. 1) My movementspeed and jump speed is nothing like the videos. I ran around with about 30% of the speed shown in the videos. Also climbing and exploring was super ♥♥♥♥♥♥, so you basicly placed your base where you landed and took everything you got there and planted your own garden aside. The buggy thing around that was, that after I ALT-TABBED out of the game and went back, all movements were on 200%. I kindo ran around like a leopard on steroids. Weird, need to get fixed.2) Exploring was not possible. First, the movement i mentioned above. Sedond: Your low air limit. After landing, you had about 5 minutes to find a place either to build your base or, if you were lucky, you found air. Air was pretty rare on most of the planets I was on, so i HAD to build my base, or I let myself simply die to respawn with less gold and stuff. 3) I was stuck on a mission (on Ordsok, you have limited rockets to get your soup out). I destroyed 2 rockets by accident and had the problem, that I didn't get out of 70%, since the enemy always shot his rockets to keep me there and my soups only gave me +5%. So i started running around and colecting all new things to get new recipes. I got over 15 new ones over the time and, in the end, I won. Suddenly a message was shown, that I ""achieved everything in the Early-Access and got every technology avaible"" (remember, I was on the second planet of the second universe, I had like another 8 missions to go through). I was stunned, but sad, because I loved to look out for every new planet to get new stuff. And now I have everything and the fun to play the game and achieve more things really stopped, I don't even want to play the game anymore, the story mode was all that kept me here (because of the problems above).PS: It does show, that the game has 32 achievements. But neither can i see them nor did i laready got one. Is it blocked because of the Early Access? Or do I have another issue (I use the german steam layout).			"

												With a game like Nom Nom Galaxy, the story is relatively simple: the aliens of the universe love soup and it's your job to go to distant planets to discover new flavors, ship them to your distributors and please the audience. You'll be doing this all while competing with your rival soup company, who will send evil henchman to destroy your precious factory that is entirely customizable by you. Building up your defenses is a must, and while your little character can potentially fight off the hordes of enemies it does certainly make things easier when you're helped by turret-like structures that you built. If a player is expecting to go into this defending it on their own, they're going to have a hard time.A lot of Nom Nom Galaxy's appeal is that building your factory and building a strong infrastructure is important. This includes defenses rather than thinking you'll be able to solo a legion of explosive ships with just your fist and buzz saw. You aren't getting attacked all the time, but there is an indication in the upper right hand corner of your screen that lets you know that the attack is coming, how far ahead you are of the rival companies profits and gives you time to prepare. It's a well-executed system, giving the players just enough time to prepare, and not too much time to sit idly by waiting for the invaders to come. If the player is too far away from their home base while harvesting new soup ingredients it can lead to disaster, so careful planning is a must in order to get through the game's “day to day” grind. That's a big part of the appeal of this game is that you can build everything up in such a way where everything works succinctly and perfectly with one another. For you to make a nearly flawless system that will help make you daily tasks easier and for those who really like well-made systems like this, such as assembly lines, this might appeal to those sensibilities.Full Review[www.noobfeed.com] "

												The game should be great, but it's waaaay too easy in co-op (multiplayer). It doesn't seem to scale it's difficulty level when you play with a friend, so you get to the end too soon, very easily, almost not believing it is the end.There's no difficulty level to choose from and the developers, who said would be working in one, seem to have abandoned the game. Too sad, because other than that, it would be a great game, very polished and fun to play.			"

												I enjoyed this game when it first came out on EA, I think I was a kickstarter backer too....unfortunately, the last update was in 2015, and didn't fix multiplayer...  After which Pixeljunk has all but vanished, aside from the occasional comment in the forums about not abandoning the game, they just gotta move offices and complete a different game first so they can return....And yes, the moving office comment has happened EVERY time they talk about the next patch...  so either they're spending all their money on moving all the time, or are copy-pasting a responce every few months or so to try and look like they're still supporting the game...  So if you think you'll like it, grab it on sale...but don't expect the CO-OP to work, or get fixed either.			"

												++++JUST STARTED PLAYING - REVIEW SUBJECT TO CHANGE+++Heres my first impressions of this gameFor starters, PixelJunk is awesome. I absolutely cracked out on Eden when it first came out on the PS3.Nom Nom Galaxy is PixelJunk's latest game, and its something different than theyve ever done before. Its a sandbox Terraria-like game. You own a space-soup-making company, and you must travel around building soup factories and exploring planets to find ingredients to make new receipes and keep your market share high. To do this, you explore planets in a 2d environment, build a soup-making base with modular parts and ""matter"" you dig out of the ground. You are going to need soup refineries, soup rockets to send your new creations to market, and even defenses to protect your base against invading rivals, Therss also both local and net co op and multiplayer, a free build mode, a ""conquerer"" mode, something like 100 soup receipes you can make and even more I havent found yet.Wait, what??Yeah, just bear with me here. Its weird, but its really fun so far.I havent played too much yet, but so far so good. I'll add to this review as I experience more of the game.			"

Early Access Review
								I love the concept, it's sort of like a stage-based Terraria and sidescrolling simplified version of Factorio had a baby. Unfortunately, the formerly merely unhelpful second tutorial level is now just... gone. On the plus side, it means that you won't be stuck trying to win a level while struggling to figure out a bunch of mechanics with what was probably a gimped toolset. On the downside, you're now dropped into the game proper with no explanation whatsoever of the mechanics of farms, conveyors, robot workers, vehicles, half the facility's components, or how and where to start setting up from scratch. I'm just hoping that level was removed pending a more thorough set of tutorials.Besides that the aesthetic is alright although as of yet a bit rough around the edges, controls are mostly okay but awkward on ladders or when trying to punch something without destroying terrain, the game runs at the size of a postage stamp when windowed, and pitches a massive fit when switching to fullscreen.I feel like I'd enjoy the hell out of it if I could figure out what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on but I'm having a devil of a time getting that far. They really need to work on the tutorials. I still feel like I should recommend it for anyone who can figure out how the dickens to play it, though.			"

Grindy casual terraria parodyGame looks nice only on screenshots. But there are nothing to do here.Nice idea about build your own soup fabric and feed aliens, killed by grind. Gameplay is about trying to find on planet, has 1/4 size of biome in terraria, these 2.5 ingridients for soup. Yep - there are rlly not much ingridients... and not much everything - also 2.5 types of buildings and same number of dumbass robots, glitchy between floors.Game was in early access for 1.5 year. Devs added some new bugs cookies, like online multiplayer, achievements and etc. But game still being raw. Multiplayer bugged, you cant play its normally with keyboards (and gamepad, also, get randomly bugs) and physics are awfull.Its have, also, very high system requirments, that can show us so bad optimisation.Game could be awesome after 1-2 moar years in early access. But, right now - it doesnt cost these moneys, it costs on sale.			"

												The game showed MASSIVE promise in Early Access, especially when they added online coop, the sad thing is, it only got WORSE after the game RELEASED, they completely BROKE the working multiplayer by forcing a badly done 30fps cap, sure they added a toggle for 60fps but it does absolutely nothing for online.I was able to flawlessly play with 2 friends online in early access up to the point where they gave you everything unlocked because the story was not done I believe.Now though, post release, I tried to play online with a friend, the game will load and you will crash at 60 fps as well as run around for a few seconds before both your games freeze and you get the loading circle in the bottom corner and then you are greeted with unplayable and badly done 30fps.It doesn't help that the devs have pretty much confirmed they have abandoned the game(for now) to work on a new game. So save your money and avoid this game.			"

												I LOVED this game on ps4, so I decided to buy it on steam since my main system is PC. I bought it for my friend as well and needless to say the multiplayer is garbage. The game itself is amazing but there are so many technical problems with the PC port that it's near unplayable. the Multiplayer has so much lag (not because my computer is bad, I can run the game single player no problem) that when I press a button, the game responds 2 seconds later. To top it all off, now whenever I launch the game, it crashes instantly. I hope they can fix this game because it has tons of potential. I would wait to buy it to see if they fix the problems this game has.			"

												I liked this game, but I didn't even finish the campaign (conquest) mode because it got stale quickly due to technical issues. I'd like to revisit this game when (or rather if) it's more polished. Pro'sFunny visual style.Enjoyable soup production management. It's cool to try new recipies and see how the market reacts.ConsOnline multiplayer apparently doesn't work. I can't try it because nobody plays. That's a shame, because that's one of the things that attracted me to the game when I saw the trailer.Every 5-10 mins or so ""night falls"", resulting in the statistics for the day. You then continue to play the next day. First of all, this happens way too fast, but also all resources that were not picked up during the day despawn. That ties into the next point...The game is all about automation, but the AI doesn't work too well. There is a robot for planting and a robot for harvesting ingredients, but more often than not one of them fails to do their job properly (they just idle around), leaving resources on the floor. This doesn't only ruin the whole ""automation"" aspect, but the resources also despawn like mentioned in the previous point. This unfortunately completely breaks the flow of the game. This is a point that's been discussed in various forum posts and also attempts were made to fix this, but it seems to be in vain. "

This review was written for FREEDOM Community Gaming Collective[freedomcgc.com].Many things are happening in the vast reaches of space. Explorers chart new worlds providing fascinating glimpses of previously unknown wonders, powerful empires vie for supremacy in endless battles across the galaxy. But sometimes, things get really serious. Sometimes you have to take the helm of a soup corporation in a bid to oust every other company that is in the business of producing everyone’s favorite tasty liquid and dominate the market in a healthy monopoly. Oh, and your boss is a robot. And you’re a robot and all your employees are robots, too.Nom Nom Galaxy plays like a side-scrolling action platformer in which you take on the role of an Astroworker tasked with conquering the hard-boiled soup market. But there are so many elements in this game that you won’t find in any action platformer. It tasks you with finding ingredients and combining them in order to discover new recipes, one planet at a time. Each time you land (well, crash) on a planet, you have to set up a factory and take over 100% of the market. Each planet’s landscape is different and each planet is home to a different set of flora and fauna which you can use as ingredients. If the planet’s surface isn’t adequate for your factory plans, you can terraform it by cutting through the softer grassy cubes with your trusty handheld buzz saw. You will also need to mine for resources which are necessary to start building your factory. A certain type of resource buried in the ground will also provide you with pieces of gum which are basically temporary power ups. They range from being able to cut through rocks to running faster. You build your factory piece by piece in any way you see fit. You can either adapt the planet to your factory or adapt your factory to the planet. It is important that all pieces are connected to your base or generators which power the factory thanks to big yellow golden crystals. As your factory gets larger, it will consume more power.Once you set up the basic parts of your factory such as the base, soup plant and rockets, you will need to explore the planet in order to find ingredients for your soup. Depending on the planet, there will be different plants and creatures in the vicinity. Running around and simply harvesting plants won’t work for very long as you will sooner or later use up all nearby resources and trekking along vast distances takes up valuable time which will cause you to lose market share. Just like in the real world, the best way is to industrialize the whole process. Designate a gardening area, pick a few plants and get to farming. Waiting for a plant to grow to its maximum will yield more ingredients. It gets a bit tricky if you choose to deal with creatures. They will fight back if you attack them and some will attack without provocation. Considering that you’re pretty weak at the beginning, dealing with creatures is simply too time consuming to be a viable strategy until later on. As you harvest plants or kill creatures and gain ingredients from them, you can mix and match all of these to produce various types of soups. There are over a hundred different recipes and some are worth more than others which brings us to another resource at your disposal – gold.As you start building your factory and shipping your soup (via interplanetary rockets), you will start to earn gold. Gold is used to hire robot workers who will help you carry and ship soup, pass on ingredients to other workers, guard your factory and so on. You can also buy better weapons, namely a sword and a shotgun which are a substantial upgrade to your fists and the buzz saw when dealing with enemies and hostile creatures. However, the most crucial things you will spend your hard-earned gold on are defense towers. As you start taking over the market share, the rival corporation on each planet will underhandedly send their battle robots in an effort to shut down your operations. There are only several types of both enemies and towers, which means that this element of the game isn’t particularly involving. However, it does provide a nice amount of diversion from the factory business. You can also help out your towers and get straight into the fight. Once you hit 100% of the market share, you’ll be very close to completing the planet. All you have to do is maintain it until the end of the day.The biggest issue I had with the game is the absolutely abysmal tutorial. It barely covers the essentials and it doesn’t really explain many elements of the game, even some extremely basic ones. For example, I knew that I could reload and repair my towers and the game prompted a button as maintenance. But that button led me to the store. I had to go online to learn that I needed to hold the button in order to open up the maintenance window. Most things you will need to learn on your own by playing the game through a lot of trial-and-error, especially early on. This could have been avoided by properly explaining the game to the players.Apart from a fairly large campaign during which you will unlock all the workers, weapons and towers as well as discover loads of recipes, each planet you discover can also be played in sandbox mode. You can choose to start from scratch or continue with the factory you set up as you played through the campaign. Here you don’t have to worry about market share which basically means you can, if you are so inclined, build a vast factory and drain the entire planet of its resources, plants and wildlife. Each planet can be played in local or online co-op. There’s also a separate challenge mode which focuses on different elements of the game. Sometimes you’ll be tasked to go through an obstacle course in the fastest time possible or defend against a wave of enemies. You will be scored based on your performance and compared to other players via the leaderboards. This mode isn’t particularly compelling simply because none of the separate elements of Nom Nom Galaxy stand particularly well on their own. The jumping mechanics aren’t as tight and responsive as you want them to be, the tower defense element is rather rudimentary. It is precisely the synergy between all of these disparate elements that make Nom Nom Galaxy work so well. Building up your base, running around terraforming the planet and harvesting plants, dealing with wildlife, and then having to rush back to base when it is attacked to set up defenses and join the fight – all of these elements placed together create a dynamic environment that makes Nom Nom Galaxy so special and different.The game uses a lovely, vibrant art style reminiscent of old-school 2D side-scrollers but with a more modern and unique touch. The soundtrack compliments the style of the game nicely, however, it is a bit repetitive and could have used more standout tracks.Even though the recipe for success in Nom Nom Galaxy is sometimes a bit too straightforward, this is still an insanely addictive game that I simply could not stop playing. A classic case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts, Nom Nom Galaxy provides a charming, rewarding and emergent mix of action gameplay, business simulation and tower defense.8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT) "

												I've had to revisit this review.  While we had a really good session on release, this game has been less stable since.  While playable - the game has network issues as well as a few problems with the way it handles multiplayer generally which kill it's long term appeal.  While these were to be fixed with a patch - that patch never came and I must correct my review to reflect that.  If they do fix these issues then I would heartily re-recommend this game.After starting a multiplayer game there is a period 'in time' where the render and netcode feels 'tight' and together across all the players.  After a short period it will appear to restart the game and  resyncronise.  We are now out of time with each other, the game plays in a slight slow motion and the rendered screen feels behind with the state of the game on the network.  So while at 60fps the effect is of being in a laggy slow motion.  This did not occur at release quite quite as it does now.No real thought has been given to coop play.  If people join my game they do not gain the unlocks and progress that I get - this is just half finished.  The devs have said that this  would all be fixed in a patch months ago.********************** original reviewBought one copy to check the ""lag even in local coop"" - didn't have any so bought 3 copies to play with gf and brother.15 minutes later we are making soups together-  no problems whatsoever.My machine i7 GTX970, brother AMD 965 with GTX670, gf (laptop) Core2Duo GTX650m.  No lag, no frame rate issues.  I seem to be the one that likes to automate the corridors with robots and work out new soup recipes, find out which sell for the most, but also to keep the variety up (if you keep making the same soup you will lose market share eventually).  Meanwhile my brother is making security arrangements and building underground ingredient farms.  Meanwhile gf is off exploring and finding new ingredients - and better sources of existing ingredients.We fell into it really naturally - I really think this is one of the best, truly co-operative games I've played in a while.  I doubt it'd be as much fun if I had to juggle ALL those roles - but playing with friends that each have a 'thing' they want to get into is wonderful.  I started to give more and more direction to my team as I worked out what we needed from my soup research - and the guys really liked fulfilling those missions to find more cornbugs - or workout a better way to defend the conveyor belts so the soup doesn't backup.  We haven't unlocked anything much - but we played for hours - just exploring and (for me) mapping out all the different soup combos on the first map.  Can't wait to play more.  Thoroughly recommended			"

I got it as a Playstation+ monthly game, and when I cancelled my subscription I bought it on Steam so I could still play it. It's silly and fun and the gameplay is souper entertaining, but it can be a bit buggy. Do not use a keyboard, and stick to solo play.			"

												I mostly played this game in local co op, only a few times in online co op.I enjoyed Nom Nom Galaxy alot in local co op. The playstyle for Nom Nom Galaxy is quite different from what I am used to - competitive with AI instead of sandbox. Also you have to follow the progression to unlock all the robots and tools. Also you need to be ok with invaders trying to blast your carefully-crafted factory to smitereens. Also there is the possibility of your factory or soil collapsing due to certain conditions.Pros: + Love the game concept of exploring to get ingredients to make soup. + There is a bit of thinking involved in how to build your base strategically.+ Exploration is difficult at first, but as you play you'll discover ways to make it easier for yourself to explore. + Quite casual in co op, and it's great having someone else around to help build the factory. It might be slow to win if both players prefer to explore. I tend to stay in the base whilst my sister explores.Cons:- I played in campaign mode. At first it was a bit strange when you are in the middle of building up your factory, and you end up having to stop because you reached 100% market share by the end of the day. There was always the option of reloading your factory in sandbox after completing the campaign but I never bothered because the momentum felt cut off. I'm more used to Tropico 3's style, when you do win a campaign, they ask you if you would like to continue. - Very laggy for my sister's laptop. Not sure why. Whilst playing the last campaign on my beefy PC it slowed to a crawl. Reloading the game helped for my beefy pc.- Pumpkins seem to disappear after a few days... can be solved by reloading the game.

												Very hard to give this a positive or negative rating since I have been able to enjoy the game despite the flaws in the game.Some of the positives would be the graphics, the look and feel of the game, and the overall objective...which is to get that soup out to the galactic masses.It's a fun concept, and i do enjoy the many quirks and challenges presented on each planet. The more you play however, you'll notice a lot of things that don't seem right. A big gripe for me would be the issue of the black screening, which happens in many different situations it seems, and is an issue which has remained unfixed. Another negative would be on lag, and how on certain stages, you'll get to a point in which everything goes slowly and there'll be nothing that you can do about it. This is a consequence of having too many things on the stage at once, which to me seems like it shouldn't be an issue, but you'll soon find out for yourself if you play this.Though i bought this game solely for the solo experience, i can't help but read the complaints that have been made for multiplayer mode. From what i hear, the multiplayer on this game needs an overhaul in order to get it to a state which is satisfactory. Another negative, is the lack of an update to this game. I was excited to play this game back during the early access stages, and looked forward to all the changes and additions being brought to the game, but then once it was officially released, I believe there was one more update and then all updates were stopped cold.There's no bigger annoyance than to have a developer stop maintaining a game that they put out for people to buy. It's literally a slap in the face of the consumer and i really expected more from this developer. Though they will work on other projects, and release new games, but the respect and reputation will take a hit from these kind of incidents. Even though i wish i could truly recommend this game and say that it'll provide many hours of entertainment, given how things are going now a days, i just can't recommend this game since there are still issues here and no determination by the developers to make this game better. If you do have this game already....then soup on!			"

												The controls in this game are pretty bad. The game registers me as using the controller. I'm able to use it in the pre=game menu, but when I get into the game I'm forced to use the keyboard. When I go to the options (which I had to click several keys to figure out how to get to) it said I was still using the controller. I thought this would be a great game to play online with friends/family, but as of right now it's frustrating just to get out of the tutorial.			"

												Nom Nom Galaxy is an interesting game that doesn't quite fit into the expectations you may have of its overall genres. It's a platformer mixed with a real-time economic component, and it's incredibly engaging. The basic setup is that you run around a 2D world harvesting ingredients from plants and animals (kind of like Terraria), and turn those ingredients into soup, which you then fire off into space in rockets to try to out-compete other companies. The ingredients have their own ecological relationships, too - some animals attack you or eat plants, the resources all spawn and reproduce differently, some are hazardous and others provide you and plants with oxygen, and so on.Most of my time was spent rushing around a level, digging and harvesting resources, desperately trying to out-produce my competitors while keeping in mind resource ecologies and market trends, and it was a blast. Tinkering with your factory, trying to figure out how to invest your money and resources and time in order to get the optimal return on your soup business, is something that easily devoured several hours at a time if I wasn't paying attention. Most games felt like I was struggling to compete at first, only for victory to sneak into reach so I could pounce on it. Good times!There are really only two bad things I could say about this game. First, a few of the controls are kind of weird and poorly explained - it took me way too long to realise that where my mouse was relative to my character controlled which direction my character threw or deposited objects in. Also, whenever I placed objects my character punched or swung their sword, meaning I often accidentally punched or chopped ingredients or my own robots or equipment. Yeah. Second, most levels decide to throw combat events at you. Your ""competitors"" will throw goons at your base, forcing you to spend money on defenses and rush to fight instead of harvesting. That entire part of the game felt superfluous and unenjoyable; it detracts from the skills you're practising in the main game and draws thing out, and all for what? The combat isn't very fun at all, in no small part because the controls just aren't as snappy and crisp as they need to be for combat.Besides those, though, the aesthetics and core gameplay of Nom Nom Galaxy were enough to pull me in for hours at a time. If Dota and LoL are RTS offshoots without infrastructure or resource exploitation, then Nom Nom Galaxy an RTS offshoot without much combat. It's great fun, and I want more games in this genre!			"

Early Access Review
								Soup, the final course. These are the diggings of the Starship NomNom. Its never ending mission: To eat strange new vegetables, to seek out new creatures and eat them, to boldly devour all that comes before it!This game is full of potential and already packs quite a punch in delivering fun. Tasked by your overlords to explore the galaxy and find new worlds on which you'll create massive factories devoted to the glorious task of producing soup. You'll encounter creatures and vegetables and more that you'll shove into cans and send off into space. The goal of each world(stage) is to beat out the competition and win over 100% market share.The time really pushes the pace of the game. Gameplay is broken up into days and getting as much accomplished as you each day is the key to victory. There is no out lasting the opponent. The longer you take the more and more resources of the planet you're consuming which can make finding enough resources to secure a large push to win very hard. The gameplay is a mashup of a few different styles. Theres exploration, building, tower defense, and business simulation just to name a few.There's a few rough edges to the game. I mentioned before that taking too long to get to victory can actually make the game much harder. There comes a point where you might have to abandon a map you've been working on for some time simply due to resources becoming too rare to make it feasible. There's also the fact that time doesn't stop when you enter the building menu which can make planning your base much harder as time is very valuable and can't be wasted. This can lead to mistakes in your building planning that you'll have to overcome. The combat is straight forward, but lacks any real punch or variety(at least in the early stages I've seen). There's enemy ships that show up that you must deploy buildings to help defeat and monsters(weird vegetable creatures) that you defeat to gain ingredients, both are straight forward and haven't offered any challenge as of yet.However, despite the rough edges I find myself playing more and more like it's a drug.

								This is pretty fun, but very alpha-stage (you have been warned).  I can see the direction it is going in though.2D world - you start with a barebones base.  You deform/mine the area around you for INGREDIENTS and RESOURCE as well as to make space for expanding your base.  Mix INGREDIENTS to discover RECIPES of differing value.  Make a SOUP which must be loaded onto a rocket and launched, which generates MONEY.Meanwhile, a RIVAL corporation is doing the same thing, hostile CREATURES - which can also become INGREDIENTS - are popping around, and you need to shuffle ingredients back to base.You can PLANT the things you find to FARM close to base.  You also can research BLDGS (like conveyor belts), ROBOTS (which can move stuff around for you), BUFFS, and WEAPONS.  You also have to worry about collapsing your base if you dig under it.I think it has a lot of potential, and overcomes the ""What I Do?"" problem that sandbox games sometimes have... this has a very clear goal and cycle, without bogging you down with ""COLLECT AND ORGANIZE ALLLLLLLL THE CRAFTING INGREDIENTS""Tooled about in the game for a while, then tried digging down just to explore... there are some interesting game mechanics to be found, and already several creatures of varying size.  Dirt falls, water flows, Tomato Plant pops out killer tomatoes at you, Giant Dino thing stomps you flat...Once the tutorial and UI/controls become better explained (You have been warned) and fleshed out, it will be quite amazing.

But, I don't have fun playing it like this, so I'll wait until the developers hopefully add in the option or perhaps just optimize it so it doesn't play so slowly.  ========[edit: my original review contained some snide snarky comments on my part and I'm revising it to show more respect to the developers][here was my original, so you know what I changed]=========I'll keep this simple.

												Wanna Launch Soup Into space? Then this is for you. You crash land into planets and get materials to make soup. Put it into rockets, and sell it. Defend against attacks. Is it Senseible to attack someone over soup? Not at all. Does it make a interesting game? Of course! And later on you can fully automate the factory and you just rake in that cash.			"

												Nom Nom Galaxy really is a great game, it's way better when your playing with friends though, personaly I had no problems with the multiplayer. The gameplay is very engaging but this is not about story, so if you like a story game, this is not what you are looking for. But here is what happens. (No spoilers!), Or you can scroll down to the pros and cons. :)You start of with your friend (or alone), wow, your a bad pilot, your ship crashes on the planets surface... You begin mining for blue stuff (Don't know what it's called) to build your office, which is the start of your factory, if it gets destroyed you lose, (or your troll-like friends break it with there buzz-saw). You build a soup machine which creates soup! There are lots of recipies, some give more money and some give less. There are right now around 40 ingridients, some are rearer than others. But around different planets there are different resources. You build that rocket and you SEND that soup to the sky! Once it comes back you are free to send more soup!But hey, that seems too simple? Don't worry, there is another company who will compete with you for stock market and they will send raiders to destroy your factory and more importantly your office! Also some ingridients are difficult to farm, they might be spikey, they might be plants, they might be monsters which will fight back as you hack at there nest. Or even space pirates!At the start you don't have much technologies, but the more planets you conquer, the more technologies you unlock, different planets give you different technologies. You start with manual labour for that sweet sweet minimum space wage! Until you get enough techs so you can automate your factory and have robots work for you with awesome names to make them memorable! You can also buy turrets to protect your precious factory from invadars!This is really great to play with your friend. The more friends, the more fun, up to 4 people max! There is also weekly chalenges which chanlenge you to compete with other factories for galactic gums, which are really useful buffs to build your facory.Pros:-Fun gameplay-Amazing coop experience-local multiplayer support-Lovely GraphicsCons:-Your internet should be at least 1 mbps, unless you want to do local coop-You need friends to play with-Singleplayer gets repepetiveAs you can tell this game is based heavily on multiplayer.8/10 - Would delibretly deliberately crash rocket again.

But, occasionly, at least for me and my son (who played that majority of the time) well, we get a 'black screen of death' where you get the sound, but no video, and well, that is not fun at all. Went through the discussion board, found no answer, other than other gamers are reporting the same issue.If the fix the bugs, along with some lag on co-op, then very best get it, but I'm done with this one!Cheers!

Early Access Review
								This game is seriously addictive.Mix a bit of Lemmings, some retro platformer, a pinch of tower defense, and you get a marvelous soup called Nom Nom Galaxy which has a bit of everything. Strategy, action, RPG, resource management, etc.Like all previous PixelJunk games the art and music are fantastic. I have only played it with an Xbox 360 controller and it works great.It's already great in EA, I can't imagine how great it will be once they reach 1.0.The only con is that it takes a few hours to really get into the mechanics of the game which may turn some people back at first.

Early Access Review
								Looks good, however ive yet to play it properly. My negative reveiw is subject to change, as and when full controller support is added as advertised, then ill update my review (looks like to the recommended), till then its a big no for false advertising. yes i know what early access is, i also know its not ok to lie about an early access game's selling points on a store front, imagine if a game said online multiplayer and it didnt have online multiplayer, any other game that is in that situation puts up a note in the description something along the lines of; ""we plan to add online multiplayer in the near future"" not advertising it as a feature. Had Nom Nom said 'partial controller support' or mentioned somewhere on the store front that controllers are a mess and will be fixed or that a k+m and a controller are required for local co-op it would be a different story.edit: i dont care how many fan boys i make cry, this is my oppinion; controller support is back in and so far working correctly, however, after playing for a while i simply couldnt care less if i play it again...ever, combined with bad advertising ethics and the constant bombardment on self praise in developer blogs i really cant recommend it. thats not to say its a bad game, just boring as all hell. may return but i doubt itedit 2: so strangely me and the house mate were looking for something to play together co-op and when she suggested nom nom i almost threw my controller at her head. reluctantly i agreed just so she could play for 5 minutes, realise how boring it is and we can all move on with our lives, we played for and hour and a half and laughed all the way, i didnt find myself liking the game any more, i didnt find myself hating the game anymore, i did however find myself wanting to come back and play it again co-op.... so take that for what ever it was but i thought for a game ive negativly reviewed i didnt half enjoy the time i spent with it. still sticking by my review but may have to revisit this sometime after ive played some more..... againedit 3: ""lets make soup"" is now code word for lets play something co-op, still not liking the game myself, but i have reluctantly changed my review to recommended for my fellow astroworker :@			"

												Used to run slow as♥♥♥♥♥♥ but I started playing it a bit later, and I'm not sure why but the game is now smooth as silk no matter what. Could be an update for the game or windows, could have been something weird with my PC. Either way, This pretty much changes my opinion quite a bit.So if you don't already know, Nom Nom Galaxy is like one of those side scroller exploration crafting games.Let me put it this way: It's like one of those games if farming was the main focus of the game and crafting is only to make differnt soups so you know what is profitable to quickly earn cash and reach the end goal. 2 ingredients to make one soup and then send it away. Rinse and repeat.So it's unlike any of the other ones. That alone gives this an edge.You'll start out having to do this manually and explore the planet for ingredients. Eventually you'll have enough money to buy robots (which you unlock by completing planets). These robots are dumb. Really really dumb. But don't fret! Use ingenuity and you'll find these robots useful.Once you unlock almost all of the robots, you'll be able make a factory that pretty much runs itself.Building the corridors and all of the machinery is super simple. All you need is one resource... which I'm not sure what to call. Let's call it blue stuff. You need blue stuff, which there is plenty of in the ground. Visible and all. Almost immediately after maybe a minute of gathering blue stuff, you'l have enough to build everything you need. It's extremely easy to get, so go crazy with the building. Just make sure you use supports. This time gravity applies.Like a tower defence game, sometimes you're going to be warned about incoming attacks.You'll have to build towers to defend the factory from flying enemies and buy robots for ground enemies. Both towers and robots require a different resource: Cash.You'll get cash from selling soup, killing enemies and daily salary.The enemies will seek out and destroy your base. If they destroy your office, it's over.At the beggining of the operation, you won't have enough cash to spend on enough towers, so you gotta use some old fashioned fisticuffs.I've seen some people here having an issue with the combat, and while they're usually right about it, I can't agree that it's a problem. It's very possible to defend yourself somewhat effectively, but it's very clear that it's not recommended. It should be last resort to go at enemies yourself. You can get weapons that are pretty effective too.Anyway... enough explaining the game, here's some criticism:Music and sound effects could be more... energetic. The music basically sounds like something Boards of Canada would make on a rainy day (and I like some BoC). It's incredibly depressing and repetitive. Soundeffects are pretty lacking. It's hard to explain soundeffects, but all I can say is that they're few and very limp. There's no punch to any sounds. Not a huge complaint, I just appreciate satisfying sounds and lots of atmospheric flare to the sound design.Sometimes, on certain planets, the enemies get stuck in weird places. They'll appear under the base stuck inside the ground or have trouble flying down to your base and be stuck in the sky.This isn't that big of a problem most of the time, but it's god damn frustrating.When playing the game in split-screen in particular, when messages pop up in the lower right corner, and they're big too.This means that half of the screen is now obscured by these repetitive messages. This also means that the player on the lower half on the screen can't see♥♥♥♥♥♥Making them smaller or transparent would help a lot. But until then, good luck seeing anything player 2!The game is way too easy. The game stays super easy throughout all of conquest mode.100% the market share everytime by making pretty much any soup and taking note of the current trend, which is as simple as reading a message that pops up at times in the lower right corner.I kinda wish it had more to it. More details to take note of and some more micro-management to make it a little more dynamic.Closing my little view on the game, all I gotta say is, it's great fun, especially in split-screen multiplayer (and probably online too).

												I have loved everything PixelJunk has made on PS3.  This is my first purchase of a PC game of theirs and it has not ceased to amuse me in the first 12 hours of play.  This plays like Terraria in some ways.  You make soup, yes soup.  However, to do so you need to explore different planets and compete in different markets against different opponents.  The game touts local coop, however I have not tried it yet.			"

												The soup must flow...The whole crafting aspect of the game is very appealing. Automating the factories speaks very well to the pipeline technical artist in me. There were a couple of issues with the dog bot not doing its job properly, but just takes some working around.The enemy attacks can get pretty tough and annoying in some stages, such as the ones with the guys that come dropping bombs and are very annoying to kill. But overall it's quite alright, and by then you'll have enough money to start your defenses.I think there should be more rewards for doing different kinds of soups. You can go by most levels by just mass producing the same soup, which is a viable alternative I guess (and done in real life) but would be more interesting if there were added bonuses for doing the rare soups, other than cash as that can be farmed pretty easily.Great game though.

												I haven't played this in about two weeks now even though it's decent fun, and that's attributable to mostly one thing:This game is stressful, to me. Having to juggle the tower defense, the outpacing rival companies, having to manage your power, having to find new ingredient sources, worrying about the end of the day, worrying about your oxygen sometimes, it's just a constant need to move around to keep ahead. I never went out of my way to construct complex facilities because I never needed to, as far as I played at least (which is around half of the game? It's certainly long, but I'm not sure it needed to be as long as it is... the 15 level standard of other pixeljunk games could've been done here for better and more diverse planets, I feel). Most cases the ingredients to get soup shipped the cheapest are close to where you start, hunting for rare ones is only worth it when you're trying to make new recipies. I vaguely recommend this game because the mechanics are decent fun, but it did wear on me and I don't see myself returning to finish it up. It's a unique game, for sure, just not quite for me, in the end. Too stressful.			"

												This game is quite fun as it is, but I would enjoy it a considerable amount more if the character's walk cycle didn't take 3 years to complete. It really slows the game down in an unnecessary manner, making any exploration at all harder than it needs to be. If this were changed, it would be 10/10, but sadly it rests at 6/10.			"

												The soup must flow...The whole crafting aspect of the game is very appealing. Automating the factories speaks very well to the pipeline technical artist in me. There were a couple of issues with the dog bot not doing its job properly, but just takes some working around.The enemy attacks can get pretty tough and annoying in some stages, such as the ones with the guys that come dropping bombs and are very annoying to kill. But overall it's quite alright, and by then you'll have enough money to start your defenses.I think there should be more rewards for doing different kinds of soups. You can go by most levels by just mass producing the same soup, which is a viable alternative I guess (and done in real life) but would be more interesting if there were added bonuses for doing the rare soups, other than cash as that can be farmed pretty easily.Great game though.

												Very rare factory game that keeps me interested. The only ones I can relate to are Minecraft redstone system and Theme Hospital. The length of levels and amount of micro-management required are nicely balanced so I can discover/experiment without getting bored.Cons: Controls are focked up. Very peasanty options(controller layout only). F1 for main menu, really? I want to go back in time to witness the moment they made the decision. Moving feels clunky and annoying at times. Some building mechanics are counterintuitive and will confuse you for a good while. Multiplayer is buggy -- randomly skip current day, frame drop, friend can't join etc. I didn't experience the input delay issue as someone declared, which may be because I only played with friend near me.

												Very Fun game been playing the campaign through in split screen coop (just 2 player) and having alot of fun with it. Its got a good learning curve i think, It adds in new toys and ideas as your progress without overwelming you too much. the challenge is always there and although it ramps up its never been too much (so far) to stop us having fun and being able to beat the levels,though it does keep you on your toes and can be tense at times. Pretty sure ive played more than 6 hours must have played some offline. I have been playing with xbox controllers which id recommend. not sure how it handles with keyboard/mouse control. We havnt played any Online MP yet but will do after completing the campaign, may revisit this review only to add thoughts on that.I think the game is brilliant and easily worth the price and personally i think its the best pixel junk game released			"

												Design a soup factory from the ground up in several single player or co-op missions. 100 recipes to find so that you can shoot delicious soop to the space on rocketships.The game is pretty unique in its take on management / factory simulation, all automation is actually done by cute little bots that you buy to help around the base.Some considerations:- multiplayer is pretty much dead, but playing this game co-op can be quite fun!- maps last as long as you take to win against your rival, that can be very quick most of the time.- you never actually see the rival base, you defend yours only.

												This game is worth buying as long as you're aware of the multiplayer issues. At the time of writing I've played the majority of this game with my partner who is on a different computer in the same house. The connection is very stable, with no other games demonstrating problems. I'm assuming the game is remotely hosted (no LAN), based on the problems being encountered, but if not then there's really no excuse.Fundamentally the multiplayer works, but suffers from numerous problems. It's laggy, up to a one second response time for input in some cases. Almost unpredictably the game will pause, process for a bit, then reload the level as if a day transition had occurred. Neither of these problems are as bad as the third though.The third problem is the desynchronisation between players. You could be playing a different game and not know it, as there's no way to know if you're out of sync. I've played for an entire in-game day not knowing that the game on my screen was different to the game on my partner's screen. Very frustrating.If you want this for multiplayer, don't buy it yet. For singleplayer it's fine.			"

								First Impressions:I'll say this...this game is certainly unique.  I suppose with a name like ""Nom Nom Galaxy"", I should have expected no less.  In this title, you'll be constructing a base and gathering resources with the intent on making soup and shipping it to hungry customers off-planet.  You'll also need to place towers around your base to fend off assaults from time to time, adding a bit of tower defense to the ""Terraria-esque"" gameplay.  Rather than face AI soup competitors, you'll be facing the imaginary ghosts of other players' previous saves.  I honestly would have preferred an AI setting that I could rely on (so that I could practice without fear of being slaughtered), though you can opt to play local co-op via split screen. Personally, I enjoyed my time with this title.

												My wife and I play co-op, building a underground lab to test on our loving fans.  The food network has nothing on us as culinary masters of our craft.  We set our standards high and above all the customer.  No matter how many eyes or tenicles they might have, each with their own favorite flavor, we shall reign in this fight for soup supremacy! This game is fun in that it's a little collecting, base building and a slight dash of tower defense.  There is a tutorial that gives you an idea of what to do in game and how to win.  You are pitted against a rival soup kitchen and have to defeat them by sending huge cans of soup in a rocket.  Soup rockets will launch just by placing said soup in said rocket, there isn't any control over the rockets, which is a good thing in this game.  Your main objective is two fold. To discover new soups by combining new ingredients and giving the customers (who are on the other end of the rocket)  what they want.  You build your base by using a huge red circlular saw to break down everything even the ground to make room for your base.  You have a health bar and oxygen which you do run out of outside of your base.  The rival company who is trying to take your market share will send flying attacker aliens who all have different abilities and can seriously destroy your base and you loose the game.  There isn't a death penalty only that you drop some currency and best to go pick it up before the end of the work day.  Work days at what make the game a little more challenging in that a day lasts about 10-15 minutes and any ingredient that has been harvested that's on the ground will be lost.  To win the game is to have 100% market share by the end of the day to win.  Some levels we have gone 30 days before a had 100%.  Just sending any soup won't do.  The customer may not like that soup and for it you will loose 5% of the market. Or they may love it and you gain 10% market share.  I could go on and on but that's the game in a nut shell.  My wife and I really enjoy this game of soup making.   "

												Only played an hour, so take my review with a grain of salt.I love the concept for this game and was excited to play it, but once I had played for a bit I quickly became frustrated. The game's progression happens very slowly, and certain mechanics can only be used once the tutorial decides you can use them. The gameplay is very basic, and the game itself is very poorly optimized. In just one hour I had the game crash three times. As far as I can tell there is no way to remove something you've built or replace some earth you've destroyed, although those mechanics may have come later in the game, I couldn't get very far before I decided this game wasn't worth my time.

Hills and cave scatter the land with unbreakable bloks in places stoping you from expanding your building. The player walks slow the player doesent jump high and falls slow. Its like the world has low gravity but the player has weak legs. And the Other buisnesses are to good making you spend hours on the third level. And there is no pause button so you cant take a break and come back you just take a break every 10 minutes. If this game was 20 US dollars i would stop my freinds from buying it.			"

								Fantastic game. I bought it for 9 bucks and I'd say it's worth it. I would think twice about buying it for $20 at this early alpha stage. It is very enjoyable though. Definately an investment.I have some issues about the game. For example, you unlock items at the end of each day, then you have to buy those items with your money, and some of the items like Hoverboard and Pogostick only work when you aren't holding anything so then what's the point? You leave your base to collect stuff and you only come back to base when you hold something so then what's the point? Once you've explored the planets there isn't much else to see because it is NOT randomly generated like I assumed. The worlds are pre-built.			"

												Here is all you need to know, made by yours truly, a tale of a refund request.Although this game is meant for controller, I wasn't aware of that when I purchased this, and it is compatable with the computer now but the problem is, THE ONLY BUTTON THAT WORKS IS THE ESCAPE BUTTON, this game is rendered unplayable, the menus work fine but when I go to play it, the only gameplay I get is the feeling of exiting a game because it is completely broken, I am aware I have had this for years, and played over 2 hours, but  the years part was because I never played the game, when it used to work, the game was prone to crashing, lagging and random things would be invisible, and the hour thing, I was simply trying to enjoy a broken game, and now it is 100% broken, If I can't get a refund for a product that is as interactive and as fun as a bottle of bleach or a rock, I don't know what I can get a refund for.As you can see this game should be called esc simulator and paying 10$ for that is a waste of money possibly could be spent on bleach so I may cleanse myself of this game, I've has more fun in a 4 hour exam than this game entirely.

												This game is a cool concept but at the moment it is VERY broken. There are so many bugs, it crashes constantly, multiplayer lags to hell and the controls feel awful on the PC. Do not buy this game at the moment, it may get better when they fix it in the future but at the moment it is not worth your time			"

												(My previous review of this was pretty meh. Here's to starting over.)Nom Nom Galaxy is an interesting take on all of the Minecraft/Terraria-like game. Instead of a seemingly endless adventure or quest to do, you instead complete several levels making soup, unlocking new things along the way. Your goal is to basically create enough soup to beat your opponent, all the while upgrading your soup production and protecting your base with robots.Each planet seems to have a certain generation to it instead of randomly generated levels, which I found a tiny bit disappointing. It'd be cool if the landscape and ingredients changed up, even if it was a side level away from the story mode. That aside, there are still tons of planets to go to, some even including restrictions like low-gravity or not being allowed to create extra soup rockets to send soup, so that makes up for the lack of randomization.The controls are okay but can feel a bit awkward sometimes, especially with mouse + keyboard, but it won't take too long to get used to them. With that said, it's probably better to use a controller for this game. Sometimes everything can feel a bit floaty but it's not too much of an issue.I've also seemed to notice a few strange glitches while playing which aren't too awful but are glitches nonetheless. Sometimes the game may crash when on the main hub area or you might ping off somewhere else since you were in the way of something getting built. Stuff like that.Overall, this game's a fun change from all the sandbox games coming out. I'd probably watch a few videos to see how everything works before getting it. To be honest, I'm a fan of Pixel Junk (and Q-Games in general) and bought the game since it looked cool to me. Either way, Nom Nom Galaxy's awesome.			"

												A mashup of terraria and a tycoon sim game, you get various materials and use them to make different kind of soup to sell in the soup market until you achieve 100% market's stock, you have to build a base to do this obviously. There are different planets with different terrain, ingredients and characteristics in general.One of the games that actually came out of early access in a playable state and with enough content to be called complete and I totally recommend it, 10 euros its a steal for this little gem			"

The input for jumping is slow, movement feels awkard and throwing also doesn't work that great.I played this game to make an automated beast of a soup dispensary but there just isn't a great amount of ways to automate properly, your force to explore, yet again would be ok if the controls wern't so sluggish..If anything changes i would ofc change this but atm i'd wait.*Just realized this isn't early access...

												Like many others here, I wanted to like this. There's a fun little game in here somewhere. Others have detailed the odd controls, which can be negated with the ability to remap keys (not currently available), but I am more confused/upset with the fact that the game recognised my xbox 360 gamepad and registered it as Player 2. I started the main campaign game and the first non-tutorial mission loaded me into a splitscreen world. Confused, I moved my character with the controller, to see I'm P2. I'm able to then hit start and exit/back out, but then that leaves P1 on keyboard which others have already detailed how fun that can be.I picked this up during steam summer sale for a couple of bucks, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it for the 9.99 asking price. Even if the controller worked fine, I suspect I'd still be disappointed by what other reviewers have said about gameplay and feeling. Honestly, my friends and I play ""bad"" games on stream for each other all the time, but this was just a shame. It all looks nice but plays horribly.			"

												I'm glad this is early access game. It looks fun, but it's not actually fun at all. I'm not fighting a game all the time but those CONTROLS. Can't recommend it right now, but I hope this will be fixed for people with more than 2 fingers (e+left mouse). Is that so hard to separate kicks and robot controls? Every time I'm fighting someone near robots I need to reconfigure all those robots sh*t again - move them around, switch up/down direction. Building controls is another problem. When I'm clicking Ctrl on tower and then move left to reload it, I'm actually moving left in addition to reload. And what if my tower is on the cliff? I'm FALLING DOWN!This game not in early access now but it's still annoying as hell. I just rage-quitted this ♥♥♥♥♥♥-controls crap. Now I have a rule of thumb of my own - NEVER buy game made by console game developers. Every great idea will be ruined by CRAP CONSOLE CONTROLS.			"

												THIS WILL CHANGE WHEN ACTUAL PRODUCT IS RELEASED.Nom Nom Galaxy is a fun game where you have to build a way to succsesfully make soup whilst fighting monsters and competing against other soup companies.Though the game is fun I couldn't find myself sticking with the game. I feel like this is a case of Early Acsess that just isn't at a point where the game is fun enough to sustain someone.I am glad I have the Early Acsess now, so I will be able to play this game in its finished state. (Thanks to Q Games and Valve for the amazing Holiday Auction where I got this game for about 5 dollars worth of gems :D)EARLY ACSESS SCORE:6/10			"

												I can't really recommend this game. I like the concept--you collect resources and they combine to become soup cans that are sold for varying market values, but it's actually really boring in action.Maybe the upgraded/unlocked abilities play more into building a working conveyor/factory, but the first few hours are boring enough to just turn me off the game entirely. You start with only access to robots to move left/right and up/down, but no logic (only throw cans, throw 2:1 ratios)? Immediate turn off. Especially when you're then forced to do a lot of stuff manually, and progress is almost an hour per level.			"

OK this looks awesome can't wait yo plug in 2 controllers and play some couch coop.  OK ill suffer though a tutorial with a keyboard and mouse kinda weird that the controller doesn't work.  ""hold on babe"" i says in frustration almost done this tutorial on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ keyboard.  OK time to play coop... WRONG!!!! i must be a complete idiot that can t play games with controllers.

												Seeing as how I even bother writing a review (maybe the first and the last one ever) on a game I Insta-bought probably sums it up on how irked I am on the current state of the Online component of this game.NNG has everything it needs to qualify as the ultimate indie coop game. Terraria-like sandbox platforming and terraforming -- CHECK Base building complete with various production automation ranging from funny robots to conveyor belts & escalators -- CHECK Indie Survival components while farming and hunting for materials -- CHECK Tower defense raids while competing for market share tycoon style -- CHECK Quirky characters with retro-styled graphics and musics -- CHECK FUN SOUP MAKING WITH FRIENDS -- err...check?Currently the Devs are working (I SURE HOPE THEY ARE) 24/7 on resolving a sync/lag input issue with the Online MP feature (read: NOT LATENCY PROBLEM) which renders the game near-unplayable in ONLINE COOP mode (no issue whatsoever in split-screen local coop) where there is a perpertual 500 ms stutter in game every few seconds.Some control and minor issues aside, I WHOLE-HEARTEDLY RECOMMEND this game purely for all the gameplay, features etc that you can experience IN SINGLE PLAYER MODE. It's worth every single dime... (10,1 h straight in 1st playthrough never lies)BUUTT...as the tagline goes in the game while you search for online goodness: SOUP IS BETTER TOGETHER!I impatiently await the day they managed to solve this online issue and for us to be able to Nom Nom the soup up to the Galaxy with my fellow Astroworker!Until then, it's solo mission time for me...back to work Astoworker!

								An interesting and fun game that will please any fan of the PixelJunk series. The visuals, sound and mechanics are all awesome - as per expectation. The lack of full tutorial since the last update is a bit of a problem, but once you pick up the robot-automation mechanics yourself and start using them, the game becomes a very exciting experience.My biggest issue, all that said, is that there doesn't seem to be a relationship between the scarcity of the resources and their value. Sometimes the easiest to create recipes yield the greatest payoff, which leads to you going through the same motions level after level, relying on high paid recipes rather than being more imaginative.It doesn't quite feel like the game achieves the gameplay it intends to generate. It's like 80% of the way there, which is sad as it is unlikely to have many gameplay-related changes now that the PS4 version has been released. I hope that the game is successful enough to justify a sequel as I love the potential game here, but as it stands, it leaves me feeling a little unsatisfied. Still - a definite recommendation purely based on its uniqueness and style.			"

												This game have lot of potential but clunky and unpolished controls ruin all fun from it :/Lots of times due to how camera work in construction mode you will place building blocks in wrong places and have to demolish them, very very annoying. Robots you can use to automate you production process are brain dead, god damned this is unbelievable how bad they work and you don't have more advanced controls over them. Because of simplified controls adjusted to controllers you have the same button to pick up item or robots and lots of times you will need to try couple times before you pick up item you want. Another thing is platforming, this is also very, very clunky, even some simple obstacle can be painful and tedious to overcome. When day is ending every resource item laying on ground disappear even if every single other thing in world stay exactly the same, even falling ground froze in mid air, so no time passes but every free resource will disappear and this is also annoying :/Building base is fun, making soups, getting ingredients and so on but there is way to much flaws in this game to truly enjoying it and most of the time you will be annoyed by design choices, ai and cutted corners here and there.

												Stupid, stupid name. It should be like, ""Soup Masters of the Universe,"" or... almost anything else, really.Aside from that objection...It's a very solid, very thoroughly enjoyable gaming experience. It's a great way to have a roaring good time with a friend. It's silly, but you can push the game very hard. The game itself is a little too easy - we never found the opposing NPC team to give us an ounce of trouble - but if you try to build as fast as you can, your own pride can make the game extremely difficult. That feeling when something is almost perfect, and you just have to make it better... it's gorgeous.Tons and tons of fun. Highly recommended.			"

												As of writing, this game has been out for a month and a half, and yet it remains a horribly buggy mess of poor coding. It truly feels like this is a game that should still be about midway through its beta, not a full release. It could be a really fun game, if it was properly polished and finished, but I have a lot of doubt about the developers actually being capable or committed enough to do that at this point. Only get this if its on sale for a couple bucks at most, and only if you're going to be content playing only single player.Edit: It is now getting close to a year since release. No bugs have been fixed and the game has been thoroughly abandoned by the devs, as expected. Give this game, and probably anything else the devs ever do, a pass.			"

												Great game (I completed all levels). You have to take the time to experiment and find the best ways to automate your soup making. At first you don't have very many unlocks, so you have to play more levels to unlock more items which inturn let you automate more efficiently. I never lost a single game except for one when I didn't watch baddies killing my home center. It's not a difficult game at all, but some things can be challenging at times.			"

												Looks like a really fun game but the performance is dismal and the controls have issues. The forums indicate that the developer has abandonded it.It's a shame really. So much potential.			"

												It's a funny game with a lot of content.But you have ""just"" 5 planet's (so far I can see) an in the MP the FPS drops to 30 and a delay comes, but just in the MP. In the singleplayer mode it have 60 FPS and no delay.			"

												Stupid, stupid name. It should be like, ""Soup Masters of the Universe,"" or... almost anything else, really.Aside from that objection...It's a very solid, very thoroughly enjoyable gaming experience. It's a great way to have a roaring good time with a friend. It's silly, but you can push the game very hard. The game itself is a little too easy - we never found the opposing NPC team to give us an ounce of trouble - but if you try to build as fast as you can, your own pride can make the game extremely difficult. That feeling when something is almost perfect, and you just have to make it better... it's gorgeous.Tons and tons of fun. Highly recommended.			"

												Really awesome game, innovative, nothing like what you've seen before, and fun.Pros: - Digging, exploration, and finding resources are fun- It's cool that you can automate your factory, and not just run back and forth- You can ""terraform"" the world, bring resources from far away and plant them near your base- Lot's of content- Fun experimenting with new ingridients and soupsCons:- Messages come and go, and if you did't read or missed, no way (that I could find) to re-read them. Add a log please.- Tutorial is a bit lacking. Explains the basics, but missing a lot. For example, does it matter if you make the same soup all the time or many different soups?- Give us a soup chart with numbers! There is a huge chart of what ingredients make what soups, but you have to hover them one by one to see their value.- Table view for soups that can be sorted/filtered by value, ingridients, etc would be great to help making decisions.- Automation is nice but a bit too simplified. Very hard to make an efficient factory without being able to tell the robots what to cary, etc.- A bit too easy... I always win on my first try.Overall this is a great game, lots of enjoyment. Mainly it's missing more info for the player.			"

												I just finished the single-player campaign. It took about 20 hours at a leisurely pace. Not very difficult to outsoup the opponents, but I did get my base destroyed a few times. The game as a whole feels rough around the edges (it's really easy to mess up your farm and really hard to fix if you do), but the core mechanics of collecting ingredients, discovering recipes, and automating production are quite fun. Would make space soup again.			"

												A very fun game to play when your free. From getting ingredients, to creating a base and automating it, it never gets boring.  And even if you do get bored, you have daily challenges of most of the different aspects of the game.For the cheap price it is at, it is very worth it and you can have many hours of fun on it.			"

												Great concept, horrible execution. The game has some good gameplay but the game fails to teach newcoming players how to automate production making it very difficult to beat the different planets in solo. The game is much easier to beat with more people but multiplayer has a LOT of lag. I don't recommend new players to buy this on PC. If you've played the game before, knock yoourself out. I also recommn=end only buying it on a sale.			"

												A cool idea, but there are a lot of small annoyances, and I can't help but feel something is missing. The game is sort of bland. Oh, and co-op mode is pretty much broken, sadly, and the game seems to have been abandoned. On sale? Yes. Otherwise, you might find more entertainment elsewhere, for less.			"

												Cool game. Tricky to setup for local multiplayer (the first level is a tutorial so the other person can't join, and see here to configure 2 players with 2 gamepads: https://steamcommunity.com/app/226100/discussions/0/358415738215122224/ ) Once you have it sorted it's grand. It's damn stressful running an intergalactic soup company, but very fun.			"

												I've played this fun and alloring game on the Play Station 4. It's fun and always adding something new to the game as you play. Although for those of you who suffer similar problems with your computer, this game may not function properly on all computers. Enjoy and take precautions before purchasing due to the condition of your computer.

												There is a lot to love in this game. It tries to do a lot of genres but sadly falls short. Some of the AI is broken and automation of some tasks become frustrating. Levels have a good variaty but that kills the concept as you will always move on to new levels after beating them. You can return to those levels for a ""free play"", but you will still have the plant constraints (e.g. could not build rockets after mine got destroyed on free play).Some patches might fix this game. But I feel like there are better alternatives out there. I enjoyed the game at the start, but I am disapointed that I could not get any deeper into it because of the bugs.			"

												This game is so fun!At the start, you have a soup machine and a soup rocket, and you mainly run around, gathering ingredients for your soup machine(s). Then you build a farm, and get some robots to carry the ingredients to the machines, and the soup to the rockets, where the soup gets sent of to be sold. You then automate your base so that all you need to do is collect the ingredients and throw them at a robot. You then build a 850 square meter factory, in order to get rid of the annoying ladders that you accidentally placed all over. And then, you get 100% market share at the end of the day, and you start all over again!			"

												I love it, so simple, so addictive!Update:Since it's release, the rosy promise of excellence is tarnished by the strange changes that the devs have made and the black-screen not quite crashes that plague me at the worst possible times.The option to quick use gum was an option I'm sure no-one asked for, and I'm a little angered by the removal of the research system.Unrelated to steam, I bought this on PSN as well, and it's EVEN WORSE ON PS4!!! It's nigh-on unplayble on PS4! Build a decent base and the game lags to half speed! Unskippable tutorials!Being bluntly honest, this game is NOT FINISHED on PS4 OR Steam!I honestly am not sure if I would give it 100% thumbs up. Maybe a 70%. Buy it on special.			"

												     Nom Nom Galaxy is a game about building a soup factory on different planets to sell and get currency units in order to build bigger and better factories. It is extremely creative allowing your factory to be as you want it, also you can build defenses against rival soup company attacks and create all manner of soup flavours from the large amount of soup ingredients in game. Exploration is amazing and there are many places to explore, and there are cool gadgets and tools you can use to mine and move about. 10/10 AMAZING GAME!			"
