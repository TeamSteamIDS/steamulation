												A fun time-managemnent game--similar to Ranch Rush or Farm Frenzy but slightly more involved. Very enjoyable casual gameplay. I only wish it was longer.			"

												Cute time management game with a pretty good story line.  Has some replayability with coins chests and gold times. Well worth the money I payed for it.			"

												It is a task and time management game. I like it. The story is good enough, characters are positive and bright. The game mechanic is simple and yet hard to master. The learning curve is not sharp.			"

												Casual time management game with top-notch visual production values, tight gameplay that has some fun concepts and twists on the usual formula and perfectly calculated gold medal times. 10/10 for its genre.Now bring Gardens Inc. 3 to Steam! :D			"
