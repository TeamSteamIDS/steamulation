												Yeah don't buy this game. This thing has a whopping 23 levels and almost as many lines of dialogue, and features a great cast of characters with such interesting personalites as ""Old lady in space"" and ""Old cowboy in space"" and ""Guy with a banjo"". Literally the dude has a banjo and calls himself the banjo king. Because banjos are inherently funny I guess. And the gameplay, you send your dudes to take planets that make more dudes for you. There's typically some sort of gimmick like your opponent has invisible dudes or one of your planets blows up every minute but this barely adds anything. There's vastly more strategically interesting options in this genre for free all over the damn internet, with a lot more than 23 levels. Like Phage Wars.Don't be a dumb idiot like me, don't waste your money. I beat this in an hour. Maybe if went back to beat it on every difficulty I'd get another hour out of it			"

												I acquired my copy of Galcon Legends as part of the recent Humble Bundle, though if I had picked up the game on its own, I think I’d feel somewhat ripped-off.  The entire game feels like a single-player tutorial that ought to have been included with a multi-player release.The gameplay itself fairly interesting: a quick, boardgame-like strategy game that plays out at an arcade level pace.  Each player sends ships out to take control of planets which in turn continuously produce new ships.  When two players have ships at the same planet, they are traded at a one-to-one rate with the larger fleet’s remnants taking the planet.  Galcon Legends is simple and very easy to pick up with very little time commitment.  The longest individual matches I played ended after only a minute or two.While Galcon Legend’s core gameplay is good, it is otherwise exceedingly lacking in content.  Its 23 missions are completed very quickly.  These missions do explain the game and teach strategies for it, but once they are completed, there’s little reason to continue playing.Overall, it feels like this entire game could and should have been part of a multi-player offering.

												So i got Galcon Fusion and Galcon Legends out of the Humble Bundle.Since they advertise this as sort of  Tutorial Campaign  the price is way too high for that.I wouldn't pay more than half the price of Galcon Fusion just for a Tutorial.Galcon Fusion offers way more than this, having Multiplayer and the 8 different Gamemodes. About the Game itself It has an okay funny story and when you try out the higher difficulties you will find yourself struggling hardSo if you plan to beat it you will take more time than those 1-2 hours people here assume they would take.Hope i could help anyone with his decision			"

												Remember playing a game silimar a few years back on NG. For its hour lenght, yes hour to complete the story, a bit more if you want to play on higher ranks, its seem to rely on replayability if your going by achievements. To put it blunt, Is Galcon Legends worth playing and replaying for its cost? Not exactly, the story is quarky but short and the price point might be too steep for a short remake of an already existing game with a few new mechanics.			"

												Galcon Legends is technically a real time strategy game though I think of this type of game as “virus” games. You and your opponent(s) scramble to take over planets on the map, with each planet acting as a factory for more units. You send units between planets to conquer new planets or reinforce against enemy attack. The game “Oil Rush” is like a high graphics version of this game style (with a good story too).Galcon Legends definitely counts as a casual game though, where you can burn 10-15 minutes or so when you have nothing better to do and want to use your brain. There are multiple difficulty levels (like 6 or 7) but in reality each level can be impossibly hard if you mess up in the beginning. I gave the game a try since it has some easy to reach achievements and trading cards, but ended up playing through it (whole game took about 2 hours). Gameplay can become repetitive but the later levels throw some random challenges at you like randomly exploding planets. There’s no real “story” to speak of, but a bit of humor between levels with your opponents threatening you. Overall I’d give the game a thumbs up if you can get it really cheap. I got it through a card trade so I have no regrets. You can play similar (superior) games on java game websites like Kongregate, but they don’t come with Steam achievements and trading cards.			"

												A nice addictive point and click strategy game in which your aim is to go through your galaxy and fend of evil aliens either by yourself or with help of some support you come across along the way.You travel from universe to universe where within each universe you have to try and take over all planets under control of your opponent.Once you have complete control over a universe you can move on to the next. There is an underlining story line to make the progress more interesting which is entertaining and nicely done.The game mechanics are quite interesting. You start with 1 or more planets containing a certain amount of troops. By simple click, drag or double click action you can tell your ships from a planet to attack another planet.If you take over a planet you get a boost in ships, the bigger the planet the more ships you get, though sometimes it makes more sense to take over several small planets with little to no resistance before taking over the bigger ones with higher number of defences.Your opponent will do the same off course and while you can take over neutral planets as well as planets of your opponent the chaos is great and you find yourself in a constant race without it every getting boring.The game is very short and on easy you can complete it in 1 hour or less. Though as you increase your ranks (difficulty) you find it quite challenging indeed to complete each universe.The increase in difficulty is not just the speed in which your opponent makes there moves but on the highest rank you will find that there is also less information displayed making you play more ""blind"", such as the removal of the number of units displayed on each planet forcing you to hover over a planet to see if you should attack it and take it over.All in all very entertaining and I definitely would recommend the game. The only small complain I would have is that in my humble opinion €8.99 is a little pricey seeing it takes only about 1 hour to complete it on the easiest rank.The game is great fun though nonetheless!

If you are wanting to play against friends get Galcon Fusion, it's like Galcon Legends but not campain, its arcade mode. A feature in both these games that I was thankfull for was a color blind mode. Im color blind and got the team colors mixed up and this setting helped a lot. I got Galcon Legends and Galcon Fusion together with some other games in a humble bundle, if the deal is still going I really think you should get it.			"

It's not easy being a space taxman going from world to world collecting space taxes from cattle rustlers and beings of pure energy.It's also rather boring, selecting groups of planets to send swarms of ships to capture planets in hopes of getting ahead on production to send bigger swarms of ships to take over other planets.At the core this game doesn't offer enough variety or strategic choice to pull it up from being a strait numbers game.

												I'd say worth about 15-20 minutes of your time however much you vaule that, reasons below.Made for a tablet and ported with no thought to changing the control system/timing, without any adaptation is impossible to play at the harder difficulties due to trying to navigate a full size screen with a mouse compared to a 4 inch touch screen with hopefully yours finger. Meaning difficulty goes from walk in the park to balls in a vice in the blink of an eye. As Ron would say ""Boy, that escalated quickly... I mean, that really got out of hand fast.""			"

												Full review: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/galcon-legends-game-review/Galcon Legends can be described with two words: ""Chaotic Clickfest"", and that's a good thing. Galcon originally released on mobile devices, but Galcon Legends is one of the few in the Galcon series to get released on Steam.Without knowing anything about Galcon, it just looks like a stupidly simple RTS game, but it is so much more than that. I found the gameplay rather addicting and quite fun, although I beat the game in 45 minutes, I still had a fun experience nonetheless.In Galcon Legends, you're tasked with eliminating any enemy players in the given level. You can accomplish this by way of sending swarms of your own spaceships/cursor-looking things towards any enemy-occupied planet. Each planet has a number on it, representing how many enemy units are stationed there. Each planet generates new units depending on the size, with larger planets making units quicker. To take an enemy planet, you must send your own units to take it.When taking a planet, you lose one unit for every unit destroyed on the planet, so in order to take a planet, you'd have to overpower them by sending more than what is already listed on the planet. Once all enemy planets are taken, the level is won. This brings me to my greatest complaint, the length of the game. It takes roughly 45 minutes to beat and that was really disappointing. For $10, the game should be a lot longer. However, there is a lot of replayability, as there are plenty of difficulty levels. I tried the highest one (Grand Admiral) and couldn't get past the second level. That was intense.Galcon Legends is certainly not for everyone, and it isn't really worth the price, but if you can catch it in a sale, be sure to pick it up.

												Definitely not worth the money. I got it through the Humble Bundle and I can safely say that if I had not received it that way, I would never have purchased it. It doesn't look that entertaining and that's because it isn't. The entire game is based on a debt collector who apparently gets money from people by sending ships to other planets and taking them over. Totally makes sense... if this had been a completely different game with a completely different story.However, the worst part of the game is the fact that the difficulty curve is just outrageous. By the time I got to level five, I found it impossible to keep up with the increase in difficulty that the game suggests at the end of every single level. Granted you can just play it on a lower difficulty, but that makes having higher difficulties a bit pointless if they simply make the game unplayable. Now don't get me wrong. It may just be me trying several strategies that just didn't work. Yet given the reviews that I have read, I don't seem to be the only one who has noticed that the difficulty curve is in need of repair.It's not a bad game in EVERY sense. The gameplay in itself makes for a decent puzzler. However, what lets it down is pretty much everything else. If the developers happen to read this, do not mistake my criticism for disdain. I want to like this game. I want to like every game I get. However, this one is going to need a lot of work to make it more desirable.			"

												Awful. Just awful. Got it in humble bundle android and pc 10. Would not buy it EVER otherwise. All you do is select your planets and click to send ships to attack other planets. Your ships each take a point off the planet. When it reaches -1, it is captured. Captured planets generate more ships. Thats it. Of course, the game can be challenging, but even so, it is too simplistic. The only thing it has going for it over the other Galcon game in that humble bundle was its ""Story,"" which is just pitiful. But, this Galcon game also has no multiplayer. This game is a joke. Unless you are into dumbed-down RTS gameplay, horribly cheezy dialogue, and a single-player game with less story than even some multiplayer-only games, do NOT get this game. I cant believe that they charge $10 for this.			"

												Coming from Galcon Fusion, this game is just a bad short game. The dialog of the campagin is terrible and cheesy. Beat the game in Grand Admiral rank in 1 hour, not to mention not enough game modes either such as crash or assassin. There is a new gamemode called grinder where you have 3 seconds or so to move to another planet each time or else your planet is destroyed, it sounds impossible in Grand Admiral, but there is a loop hole to that. Overall, I say if you never played Galcon Fusion, just play that instead, it at least have multiplayer and more game modes. 1/10			"

												Imagine taking the very core of a 4X game and simmer it down to the simplest form possible. Now imagine something simpler. What you get is an easy to pick up arcadey strategy game that seems more suited for mobile platforms than on the PC. Each game takes about a couple of minutes at most, providing frantic action that is more often than not surprisingly enjoyable. Each stage provides a unique twist that keeps gameplay engaging and the addition of having a slew of different difficulty levels that are interchangable on the fly will keep players from feeling that the game is too easy or too challenging. The controls is the biggest downside to the game as I found it really hard to deselect planets and selecting ships that are in transit. While its not game breaking, the control issues are probably what is going to keep me from continuing to play the game past the initial play through.There isn't much to talk about outside of gameplay. You will definitely not be playing this game for the story but it does the job in setting the levels up. The music is very much listenable and ended up being the biggest surprise for me. The addition of highscores is a plus but a very small one as highscore lists can be fairly barren without many friends who own the game to compete with.It's a solid game to pick up on the cheap, especially if you want a very casual strategy game. Perhaps the game will stick to you and provide you with lots of replayability, but I suspect one will get about a couple of hours of enjoyment out of it.			"

												As someone who loves to collect achievements, I can't even stand going through half the game.Super boring simplistic gameplay coupled with overpowered A.I. (after lieutenant) for starter gamers, this game isn't the kind where you will win with only strategy alone; try clicking faster and drag faster.I would rather just leave the game open and collect trading cards and sell them in the community.

												If you have an integrated video card as your only option to play this on then don't bother. It works every now and then for me but it's just a level then back to ""broken"". The idea of the game is cool and when you do get to play it the game is sorta fun if you enjoy slight strategy.			"

												A quick and dirty RTS-lite that feels well more at home on mobile, which-surprise- you can also find it on. Probably the intended audience. This being said, it's a rough little game, but it has some charm. Said charm dies within 30 minutes though, sadly. For me, it was when Banjo King decided to fight me for the umpteenth time while trying to join forces with yet another nearly-MS paint quality character.  It grows stale even in the parts where it tries to innovate, and given how this is the only other Galcon game in 4 years, to have it do nothing new is utterly depressing. Sure, all the enemies have special abilities, but it's half-hearted at best, and the answer to just about all situations is ""flood the planet with ships til it's mine,"" even on the higher difficulties. Even then, EVEN THEN, it could've carried it with some interesting planet placement, or hell, even planetary bonuses or status effects or something, but nope, the only new element is the bad guys, and they run out their interesting quirks real quick. Of course, you'll have to fight them over and over again. Sometimes you'll fight with them. Sometimes you won't. There's a plot of some sort here, but even in a fun cringe-worthy sort of way it fails. Banjo King, whom has every right to be wonderful and stupidly awesome, isn't. This also goes for every other villain that was in the game, whom I've already forgotten.Seriously, Banjo King is the only redeeming quality of this entire game, and even then they couldn't make him interesting. For all my spite, it's still Galcon. You might love it or hate it, and it's not terrible, but I can't help that this is a cheap, halfassed version just to make back a quick buck. Also, somehow it looks over all worse than the original. How?Trust me, just stick with Fusion. You'll have a much better time.			"

												Definitely not worth the money. I got it through the Humble Bundle and I can safely say that if I had not received it that way, I would never have purchased it. It doesn't look that entertaining and that's because it isn't. The entire game is based on a debt collector who apparently gets money from people by sending ships to other planets and taking them over. Totally makes sense... if this had been a completely different game with a completely different story.However, the worst part of the game is the fact that the difficulty curve is just outrageous. By the time I got to level five, I found it impossible to keep up with the increase in difficulty that the game suggests at the end of every single level. Granted you can just play it on a lower difficulty, but that makes having higher difficulties a bit pointless if they simply make the game unplayable. Now don't get me wrong. It may just be me trying several strategies that just didn't work. Yet given the reviews that I have read, I don't seem to be the only one who has noticed that the difficulty curve is in need of repair.It's not a bad game in EVERY sense. The gameplay in itself makes for a decent puzzler. However, what lets it down is pretty much everything else. If the developers happen to read this, do not mistake my criticism for disdain. I want to like this game. I want to like every game I get. However, this one is going to need a lot of work to make it more desirable.			"

												Got this game in a humble bundle some time ago. So happy I didn't pay full price. You'd be mad to pay full price. It's barely worth $5. It's barely worth $1.You'll get about an hour worth of play out of this, unless you are the completionist sort. There are around 20 levels. That's it. Nothing changes except the difficulty and the placement of the planets. Difficulty curve is like running headlong into a brickwall. You'll hit the 5th level and unless you turn it waaaaaay down the game is basically unplayable. The AI gets to start with all planets and there will be two of them against you. I phrase it that way even though it is supposed to be a 1v1v1; both the AI will pretty much focus all efforts on you. It doesn't require skill to pass, just an insane amount of luck. If you like repetatively doing the same task over and over again and hoping it works, then this game is for you! If not, avoid it.Overall, a really poor port of a tablet game. For an ""intro"" game to Galcon Fusion, way out of the price range. This game is clearly nothing more than a money grab. 2/10			"

												Pretty sure I got it in the humble bundle. I didn't notice it until today, and I ended up beating it in a little over an hour. Most of that time was spent trying to beat a level on the hardest difficulty, which ended up being basically impossible. On the next difficulty down it was a huge amount easier, so balance isn't the game here I suppose.The art is pretty mediocre, as well as the generic story. Really the game is just here for the mechanic, which is basically the same thing as phage wars, but less extensive if you can believe that. If you really want to play this game, just google phage wars 1 and 2 and play thoseAll in all, it would be pretty fun as a flash game, because that's where I would put the quality of this. It might be worth your time, but not much more than that. Certainly not 10$...			"

												As a longtime fan Galcon, please, don't buy this. It's a port of a barebones single player mobile version and it lacks value in every regard. If I hadn't bought it, I'd have though it was a demo. It's not, though. It's a standalone game with no alternative modes of play and some cutscenes, which nobody will regret never seeing, that sells for the same price as many other, better games.The gameplay is still Galcon. The previous entry, Galcon Fusion, is leagues ahead of this in content and features. Fusion includes several different modes of play, some of which are really great, multiplayer and a small community of players still playing online.  Please, if you're looking for Galcon then buy Galcon Fusion instead.			"

												The game itself is fairly entertaining and has fun mechanics integrated into it.Unfortunately for the price and the length of the game I would definitely not recommend this title.I beat the entire game in one hour on the (3/10) highest difficulties and was hoping there would be something more to do besides grinding through the game at higher difficulties.  With no multiplayer and only one playable character this game offers very replaybility to an already extremely short story.  Overall I would give this title a 4 out of 10			"

												Please let this style of gameplay die.  Every single one of these games, from the flash origins, to these games desperately trying to make it out to be more than it is play the exact same boring way.  There is nothing new provided here, and certainly no reason to spend any money on any game with this play style ever.  If you really want a planet swarming game, go to a flash portal and play one for free.  There are plenty.  And they are exactly like this one.  Exactly.			"

Doesn't mouse capture in full-screen and doesn't pause when clicked away from. Story is 100% linear, painfully disconnected from what's actually happening, and lacks any depth or interesting elements.3/10. If this is in your library you have better things to play.

												It's an entertaining puzzle game & well worth playing. The difficulty does swing a bit wildly, but you can drop to something easier any time you lose.
