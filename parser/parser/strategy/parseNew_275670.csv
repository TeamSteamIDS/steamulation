												This game had promise, but later levels become a function of tedium with constant need to adjust turrets. I enjoy the premise and I enjoy Tower Defense style games, but I don't find micromanaging turrets any fun. If they add in a tactical pause option I may find myself going back to those levels and changing my review accordingly. If you happen to enjoy that sort of gameplay mechanic you will probably enjoy the games later levels, but if not I really couldn't recommend the game. There is also the problem of gamebreaking bugs, see below for details here. That is the short summary of why I can't recommend the game personally. For further details keep reading.Pros+Great premise which freshens the stale Tower Defense genre.+Voice acting is generally humerous.+Variety of turrets/upgrades is relatively small, but generally each feel unique.Cons-Micromanaging turrets, which may be a plus for some people but not for me. Also, here a tactical pause would alleviate this con.-Gamebreaking bugs, after my 6 or so hours playing the game the game froze and or exited to windows a dozen times. This usually happened when a new unit was introduced and then it would freeze/exit and I would then have to start all over on that level.-Turrets/Upgrades while unique feeling would benefit from more upgrades or options. Also, the idea that all the later turrets take up more space on the ship and thus generally undoing what benefits the stronger turret gave.That is the overview of the game, in my opinion. I will update my review, if/when they update patch fixes for the tactical pause and gamebreaking bugs.			"

												I am a bit mixed about this game, but overall I would not recommend it. At first, you would expect the game to be possibly Rouge-like or a Tower-defense game with no specific story in mind. After you've realized that this is not the case and you're given a specific ship template per storyline mission, you then think: ""Well, even without the sandbox ability to create your own ship, the missions do get progressively harder and you do get cool upgrades as the game progresses.""  You then realize, that there are only 5 different types of missions and the upgrades become less relevant after completing all of the weapon upgrades. Mid-way into the game, you start to get frustrated by how unforgiving and repetitive the missions are and it simply becomes a memorization game where you memorize where the waves come first and plan accordingly to achieve the much desired 5 star rating. You start to rely on hotkeys to fend of waves of new enemies that come in every 10 seconds and you have no time to pause the game (no pause button) or just look at your ship in great detail. Only at the end of the mission, do you have any time to realize the beauty of your ship, but by that time you're so frustrated that you just want to get to the next mission.In the end, I had to view walk-through videos for the last 5 missions since I was simply tired of memorizing when each wave comes in and when to build what structures at what locations accordingly. The upgrades became worthless after the last 10 missions since your guns do not get stronger, but the enemy gets tougher and more numerous. Overall, it was a cool looking game and a good concept. However, I don't think it was a good idea to leave out the sandbox ability of building your own ships and how tough the time limits are for the 5 star missions.			"

												Space Run provides a lovely twist on your regular tower defense game. You make cargo runs through space, and enemies and asteroids attempt to destroy your ship every step of the way. You can place guns, rockets, thrusters and all other sorts of useful resources on your ship that will take down the incoming hordes, and keep you relatively safe -- at least for a while. Space Run keeps you on your toes at all times, and can be brutally difficult if you're aiming to go for the top scores. Well worth investing in if you like your tower defense games. You can see my playthrough here:

												I want to start by saying I LOVE this game.  However, myself and several others have noticed a bug that seems related to running Win 7.  About 2/3 of the way through the game, there is a long level with lots of astroids called Asteroids on Steroids.  We cannot get through this level because the game crashes during or right before the boss fight.  It seems to be an isolated experience because I've only noticed about a dozen people complaining of this issue on the forums.  Most people seem to have skipped this issue.   That said, I cannot recomend a game with a completely game breaking bug.Ever.  Until this is fixed (and I have no reason to expect that it will be; the developer seems to have abandonded support for this game,) it is terribly disappointing.   I continue to check back every week or two to see if the issue has been resolved, but so far it has not been.  So to reiterate,  this is absolutely one of the best tower defense games I have ever played, it just happens to break for a select group of people in a manner most frustrating,  3/5 as long as the bug exists5/5 for the rest of you.

												For Tower Defence genre lovers this is a great spin on the game play.Just surviving each mission was quite fun and challenging in itself, but now am going back to each mission to try and not only beat it but do it at 'light speed' to get full marks. Very challenging on the later levels.Voice acting is good, and illustrations for the story visually hold up well on a high resolution display.The game does randomly crash to desktop with no explanation or warning, though it has only happened a handful of times in my play time so far (>20hrs)If you like space games and tower defence, this is a must.

												An objectively solid game. Decent voice acting, nice graphics, and so on.What the game description doesn't mention is that Space Run is the most irritating type of puzzle game; the player must build exactly the right type of turret in exactly the right spot at the right time, or fail the mission. After about 4 hours of play time, you'll just be restarting missions until you figure out the sequence the level designers want you to follow, or looking up the solutions on YouTube; this is where it stops being fun and starts feeling like work.

Amazing tower-defense game, rough diamond in stagnant genre.It's about: delivering goods to its destination through waves of space pirates; finding a compromise between weapon power and speed to deliver goods fast, but keep them ""safe & sound"" at the same time; searching the best rational way to position goods on your ship; searching the best rational way to install equipment among the goods on space which has left with a limited amount resources you get; reposition the equipment during the fight, recycling ""obsolete"" one to position more powerful or change it with another  kind which fits more for the new conditions and enviroment.Why you should play this: you've never played tower-defence games before because they look too ""static"" or even boring for you - this one certainly won't let you be bored; you like tower-defence games, but looking for ""new experience"" in this genre; you like planning or developing strategy, choose tactic and do not consider such things boring; finding a solution being limited in time and resources brings you as much satisfaction as headshot after which your team wins; you like space setting, but don't have much time to spend on 4X strategies; you don't mind to repeat the same levels few times or more; unlike in many others tower-defence games here going through the same level is still fun, it's not morphing into working even after some amount of failures; game encourages you to think on-the-fly and out-of-box; game makes you react fast, but calm and implement options you have not off the top of your head, but with a forward-looking solution.Why you may not like it: irritating loading screen each time you launch the game: have no idea what kind of data files game aggregates every time, but 30-45 seconds for the game where no extraordinary graphic or complex / generating-from-scratch levels or other sophisticated features is way too much; late stages rather difficult to get perfect score, but what's worse, searching for the right approach looks more like stab in the dark than an analytical attitude; there's no ""tactical pause"" mode (available only as a special and costly equipment's feature) - it's not just tower defence, it's also a real-time strategy: here you will have to click a lot and do it quickly.Try, earn some money, upgrade, repeat - here you won't get tired of that unlike in most of other tower-defence games.

												Less of a ""Tower Defense"" and more of a ""Point Defense"" with a tactical twist. You build onto free hexes on your ship, as you fly towards your goal, and try to defend yourself and your cargo from a constant barrage of enemies. Competently amusing story-dialogues, and genuinely exciting bossfights spice it up rather nicely.The challenge is derived from the way the game forces you to split your considerations while managing a limited budget: You must choose between weapons, defenses, engines, and other specific needs based on the ""client"" you are running the mission for. Focusing on firepower is easy enough, but youll lose speed and get a lower score, which limits your tech-tree advancement. Focusing on speed will get you killed. Choosing the right pieces, at the right times, is vital to getting the best outcome. This becomes more difficult as the game advances, because larger/more-advanced constructions require various levels of power, and because components must be built adjacent to each other in certain ways to function.If I had to complain about anything in this game, it would be that there is no ""free-play"" or ""random"" mode. Only the campaign exists, and there is no variance within said campaign. Once you have played all of the levels once, all there is to do is to go back and play them each again, and try to get a higher score. The game ended, for me, before I was ready to put it away, and I was sad to see that no expansions or DLC exist to get more playtime out of it.But, to say that a game was good enough that it left me wanting more is a compliment in its own right. Definitely worth the price at 15 dollars, and maybe worth more.			"

												Not what I was expecting.Marketed as a spin on the tower-defense genre, but it feels far too fast-paced. There's too much micromanaging of turrets. Every construction I make requires constant babysitting. Each level, while replayable, restricts me to a specific ship layout. I was under the impression the ships would be customizable.There's also this whole ""race against the clock"" factor present on each level, but if I put all of your money into engines (speed improvements), the stage doesn't seem to end any faster, and I just get cut up by all the enemies I'm unable to kill. No dead enemies = no more money. Seems like the developer designed a perfect layout for each stage and then tailored the enemies to that build. Leaves me feeling like I'm being pushed in certain directions instead of being able to fool around with different layouts.This game desperately needs a free-play mode, where I could build my own ship layout and fight off waves of enemies. You know, like a tower-defense game.The game looks and feels polished, but it's just not what I was told I would be buying.			"

												At first the game was fun... but it quickly started to be a race of micro managing and fustration. There aren't many stages in the game so the difficulty ramp too fast and a few gimmicks are designed to seriously annoy you more than giving a nice challenge...Most of the strategy consist of playing the stage, learn where the enemies will pop up, build turrets there, restart stage if strategy failed, and plan ahead your new strategy from what you've learn previously. Keep repeating several times until you finish the stage with your ship in one piece and hopefully ahead of the fastest time...I would only recommend the game only if it was actually longer and had a way to design/play new stages from the workshop.

												Great idea marred by lack of a Tactical Pause or Slow Time function (like FTL), or checkpoint system (like the tower defense classic Defense Grid). There's just too much clicky micro-management expected of the player to really call it a ""strategy"" game.   Your ability to employ strategy disappears the second you leave the space dock.You have to manually do 12 things at once (building, upgrading, repairing, aiming weapons, recharging shields, etc.) while being attacked from every side.And with no checkpoints, one frantic mis-click and you're starting from the space dock, AGAIN.I play games to relax and enjoy myself, not get stressed out and frustrated.Could be a real strategy game if some kind of Pause or checkpoint rewind is added.

												Move over Han Solo and Malcolm Reynolds, meet Buck Mann. Space Run puts you in Buck's pilot's chair, and lets you try your luck at taking on (sometimes dubious) delivery jobs for cash. As you pour your earnings back into technology and upgrades for your ship, the jobs you successfully complete will increase your reputation, which will let you earn even more. Meanwhile, your android business partner will give you helpful advice and constantly let you know how badly you are doing at any given moment along your runs.This game is a great little twist on tower defense that has you fitting out spaceships in order to hold cargo, passengers, engines, and of course, weapons. As you carry your cargo from one space dock to the next, your ship will be attacked by other ships, pirates, and asteroids. You can mine resources from the scraps of the stuff you destroy on the trip, and that lets you build and upgrade more weapons and engine power.There are a lot of different components involved, and figuring out how to best layout your ship's ""deck"" with the stuff you need to take is definitely a challenge. To add to the challenge, you generally launch with very little equipment in play and you have to add the rest on the fly (literally).My only complaint is that weapons have a limited wedge of fire and rotating the turrets manually can be a bit tedious in the midst of a pitched battle.  Overall, Space Run is a lot of fun. I mean, really who hasn't dreamed of being a rogueish space pirate? And have fun spotting all the sci-fi references in this one because they're all over this game.

												***This review was written using a Press key provided by the Developer for review purposes***Space Run is a rather unique Tower Defense/Real-time strategy game where you place your towers on a ship travelling through space to fend off attackers from all directions.

												This game starts out quite fun but there's one glaring flaw that prevents me from being able to recommend it at full price.First I'll mention some of the positives. The game is an innovative entry into the tower defense genre with a very hands-on style. (Significant micromanagement is required at some points, however, so this may be a turn-off.) The graphics, sound, and music are good, certainly more than adequate to the task. The mission types are rather varied, with there being four distinct types of cargo that pose different challenges. (Technically there are five, but two are almost identical.) The game also has a good sense of humor.On the minus side, some parts of the game require significant micromanagement to activate the various special abilities of all your turrets, and it can be difficult sometimes to locate the specific turret you need in a hurry. There are also numerous spelling and grammatical errors in the game text, but it remains understandable.But the biggest problem by far is that as the levels become more difficult, they require prescience to beat, but the game has an inadequate warning system and no mechanism for rewinding time except restarting the whole level. The effect is that you'll start a mission, and since you can't afford to build guns and defenses in all directions you'll have to build them only in the directions from which threats will come. And generally you won't find out until it's too late that you needed, for instance, anti-missile defense in a particular direction. So you start over and shuffle things around so you have enough money to build the anti-missile defense at the right time. Then you find out that you need a shield or a missile launcher in some other direction, but only too late, so you start over again. I suppose if you don't care about your reputation then it doesn't matter, but if you want to achieve the ""fast and safe delivery"" then you'll have to restart the harder missions a bunch of times. This whole problem could have been avoided if the game included a checkpoint system like Defense Grid or a warning system that gave more detailed information about the threats.As a result, the game becomes a bit of a drag once you're about two thirds of the way through, and that's why I can't recommend it at full price. I do recommend picking it up on sale, though. You'll probably get about 12 hours of fun and 8 hours of somewhat less fun gameplay.			"

												Quality finish but becomes frustrating quickly and offers no incentives to continue. Not the best casual game.As nicely as the visuals are done, the core mechanic of managing every object every second of every run distracts you from them and gets really old really fast. The mid-onwards levels especially have nothing fun about them: every mission feels like a white-knuckle tweaking rush, not something you can just get into every now and then and have some fun with. Maybe it's because I aim for full stars every run, but still. You do unlock items and grind credits to buy them, but that's where the reward system ends - and on many runs you can't even utilise the advanced stuff because the basic cannons will still be your best option! The game just seems poorly designed in the later parts, it does not flow or play well.I bought the game because I liked the idea and the voiceacting and dialogue, but there is no plot to carry the latter and the ""idea"" was not what I thought it was. I wanted to build ships, not obsessively micromanage them, and I was hoping for some fun times, not this extreme timing challenge stuff. Note: you do not ""build"" a ship so much as get shoved onto a pre-formed platform that you can slap parts onto by grinding credits during a run.If you want to challenge yourself with a glorified mobile game then this is for you - but why would you do that? For me it was not fun after the start and hence not what I wanted. An afternoon's fun was not worth the asking price; I wish there had been a demo (and next time I will ""borrow a demo"" before I buy this stuff).			"

												Space Run is a hybrid Tower Defense game, and a pretty good one. It's actually closer to space games/shooters in style but with the mechanics of a TD game. You're put in charge of corporate cargo ships and tasked with making a dangerous delivery. The ships themselves are made up of hexagonal cells (in a different configuration each time) onto which modules can be placed. These modules include the cargo you're carrying and one engine which you build before takeoff and the rest you build along the way.The game does a good job of quickly getting you up to speed and explaining how different modules behave or what placement restrictions they may have. For example engines require a free space behind them, while turrets may require up to several free spaces ahead of them.You gain construction points slowly over time or by collecting scrap leftover from destroyed asteroids, hostile fighters or larger vessels. This way you put together a fearsome (hopefully) and quick (allegedy) ship that can take on whatever you may encounter (citation needed). It's possible to recycle modules to free up space, recover resources or re-arrange the ship.In between missions new modules of various kinds become available for purchase. Modules can also be upgraded to unlock new abilities or improvements. Bits of storyline dialogue also take place here. The story isn't all that much of a much, but it's not bad either. Some of the dialogues are contrived though.Overall it's a pretty nice concept. You build the ship from bits and pieces, hoping to use starting resources to cover the right flanks against initial attackers/asteroids and cursing the cargo modules or the wonky ship configuration. Though you don't know which way danger is coming from, you get an early warning and some time to adapt. Spend cash on upgrades, take a new job, rinse and repeat.My biggest problem was that the game was fun in short bursts. Either that or i just wasn't hooked enough to keep playing after a few missions. It would draw me back after a time, so that's good. Regardles, it was a bit tricky to pick up where i left off. Previous missions are still available though.At first i wasn't a huge fan of fast paced building, rebuilding, repairing and using a multitude of special abilities. I'd be more comfortable if i was allowed to be a slug and play at a glacial pace. Perhaps it's just as well that Space Run gives me a jolt to take me out of my comfort zone. Your mileage may vary but i think that's a good thing. From time to time. Normally i think i could write a tome of memoires, sketch ideas for ship builds and make a presentation with fancy charts and graphs, plus write some fanfic before i finished a turn of Sword of the Stars. SOTS is pretty fast for a 4X TBS, I'm THAT slow.Being a cleverly disguised Tower Defence game, Space Run plays quite quickly and requires balancing several things at once. Usually while facing increasingly difficult attacks as the mission goes on. Not only is it important to deploy weapons to cover your vessel, you'll also want to invest in engines. Engines cost you resources and give little in return, but speed is the only way to outrun the competition and that multiplies your final payment. In addition, there is the cargo on board, and it's wise to protect it with shields. This will divert your resources away from firepower and take up valuable space on board. And then on top of that, some modules require power generators adjacent to them.Doing all this requires a mix of planning ahead (where to place thrusters, cargo, shields etc.), and quick wits under fire that will seriously challenge your multi-tasking competence (adjusting arcs on turrets, activating special abilities of shields and generators, rebuilding destroyed stuff, etc.).This is why ultimately, Space Run wins my respect. It makes what i described above fun to do, which i didn't really think would happen. As i said, i'm not a fan of Tower Defense nor RTS. It's not easy, but it's a good challenge, fun concept and the game is polished and well presented. Sure the voice acting could be better but i think only with a major league professional actor and a major league fee. Plus i enjoyed some of the voices.Artwork is very nice and shiny while the music doesn't really pop but isn't offensive or annoying either. It does the job. Some of the character portraits didn't really hit home with me but that's just a personal preference. 3D models are cartoony enough to be fun and serious enough to not look stupid. Overall nothing about the game felt lazy or bland.If i had to nitpick to find flaws, i'd say maybe it would be nice to have the ability to zoom in a bit closer, but it's fine. The icons in the construction menu DO need text labels, but i got the hang of it.Recommended! If you're affraid of real time multitasking, it could go either way. It won me over, but you might get frustrated quickly. If you're a fan of Tower Defense, you'll be right at home.			"

												The fact that you can't reorient the weapons more easily, even the guns that are specifically meant to be reorientable, makes the game feel more like whack-a-mole than some kind of strategy neo-tower defense kind of thing that it tries to be. I can't say I enjoyed my time here too terribly much.That said, the production quality was pretty alright. If you _really_ like tower defense, you might enjoy this more than I did.			"

												Appealing game indeed. Visuals are pretty good. It requires to react quickly and precisely to get top score. Though, there's a drawback - because ship's space is very limited, there aren't so many options to build modules. In most cases I used offensive ones 'cause defenses are not so helpful to bring foes down and they're space-consuming. I certainly do recommend to try this game.			"

												I love Tower Defense games, I really do, since Warcraft 3 maps.What Space Run looks like is a Tower Defense but what it really is (after a few hours in) , is an unforgiving memorization puzzle game where you seem to have only one way of completing the later missions. And not just for those full star ratings, but even to simply finish the levels.At first the game was great and unique, with lots of possibility and sufficiently challenging. Then the possibilities narrow and the fun becomes irritation and frustration.What makes things worse is that missions are long, up to 5 / 6 minutes, and losing any missions is just that, a loss.With this degree of difficulty, one might expect to get some kind of reward à-la roguelite, but you don't, and will simply try to get a few more stars from earlier levels for unlocks, as well as money for upgrades.What is a great and novel ides for a new TD genre is strangled by this one-way-to-play difficulty later on.A shame, the game itself could be great.

												A clever twist on tower defense that mixes traditional tower defense with a bit of Gratuitous Space Battles.You are the rakish captain of a delivery ship that is built out of blank platforms that, upon launching into space, can have various traditional tower defense modules (canons, shields) built upon them along with engines to increase thrust. The game consists of starting at a port, accepting a delivery assignment, buying upgrades, launching your ship, then racing from the starting point to the destination with your deliveries intact, while defending your ship against asteroids and other ships and drones that you'll pass along your way. You'll acquire currency for upgrades and repairs by mousing-over floating golden nuts which appear in space after things are destroyed.Once you reach your destination, you'll have rather long dialog scenes with your ship's droid, CEOs of the companies you are delivering cargo for, and others. These have a basic level of humor, but can drag on for a bit too long. Fortunately, they are fully voiced, which makes a big difference. If you were forced to click through these long bits of text, otherwise, it would detract a lot from the overall game.If you're a big fan of tower defense games, this is worth checking out.			"

												TLDRSpace Run is a simple game, with 30 linear levels in which you attempt to deliver your cargo ""fast and safe"". It's a tower defense game at its heart, with action elements such as no pause and activated abilities on all your constructs, and puzzle elements in the form of ship design and planning. It's awesome and flawless in its execution.Normally before buying a game, I read negative reviews, to find out its shortcomings (""helpful"" positive reviews usually say nothing about the game itself). The reviews on this game almost scared me off, but I'm very grateful that I bought it anyways.I must de-bunk some of these negative reviews.1) ""The characters talk too much.""-> You can reduce the chatter to ZERO in the options.2) ""You have to memorize levels in order to beat them.""-> Just like any Tower Defense game, if your strategy fails, you can adjust according to the level.-> In this game, you don't get to pause; half the challenge is pulling off your strategy without getting blown up.3) You don't get to pause.-> Isn't it a nice break, to have a little more action out of your Tower Defense?No, you won't be watching netflix while playing this one. Split-second decisions combined with skillful execution will bring you that 5 star victory you're aiming for, even though it may take a few tries on the harder levels.			"

												I love this game. I love this game so much. But it's important to know what this game is. This is not a tower defense game. This is a game about ship management and balancing offense and defense. I'd almost say it's more akin to an RTS base building game as opposed to tower defense. You don't build your ship, then send it off into space and watch what happens. Oh no, you spend the whole flight turning cannons, activating abilities, launching volleys, repairing damage, and collecting currency. If you're not into micromanaging your ship, you will hate this game. But if you're willing to learn the hotkeys and enjoy managing chaos, you'll love this game. I think the introduction of speed and asking the player to sacrifice space on their ship for engines in addition to cargo and weapons adds a nice twist on ship building that keeps each level more interesting. It's not all about safe delivery, it's fast AND safe delivery! I'm not crazy about the levels spawning in a static pattern, so you can simply restart the level and pre-build up your defenses, but the game definitely takes this into account. It challenges you with some pretty beefy bosses that clearly expect you to spend the lion's share of the level preparing for the impending attack. I enjoy the characters and the voices a great deal. Each contract feels unique to me and each type has special needs.The game is a challenge, and it can get really stressful at times, but it's totally worth it.			"

												A tower defence game in which you build up a space ship and keep cargo modules safe from enemy waves? Sign me up!Except it's less a tower defence game than it is a frantic micromanagement one. Things happen very quickly in this game and you aren't allowed to pause and consider your options. Rather than carefully managing the balance between resource accumulation and firepower buildup, you are going to be semi-mindlessly building, selling, rotating, and rebuilding parts to try and keep up with constant, unpredictable changes in the playing field.Yes, since each mission plays out exactly the same way, I suppose you could learn a (very long) build/sell/rotate order and try to play an almost perfect game by staying constantly ahead of the curve. Which would make this a memory/production line game instead. Still not tower defence, still no fun at all.Granted the aesthetics are great and I keep firing it up every few months hoping that I would like it better this round. But, no, it's still the same old twitch-based firefighting, and each time I almost immediately give up and uninstall this again.In my opinion this would have been playable if the game were slower paced and great if enemies came in waves with unlimited build time between waves. Knowing ahead of time what was coming next would have been nice too. This wouldn't have been bad as a turn-based game either. But as things stand, this is a very pretty game that I hate to hate.Recommended for people who like constantly and frenetically building things only to soon after have to tear them down and build other things elsewhere. Not recommended for people looking for a tower defence game or a thinking game.			"

												Space Run is great; a very enjoyable tower defence type game! The concept of the spaceship works well, that resonated with me, and I liked the added depth of not only needing to fend off the onslaught of other space craft, but also sometimes ramp up the engine power to beat the clock. The learning curve is well balanced, giving you time to get used to the concepts, before making it more involving and frantic with numerous different types of structures and needing to adjust turret angles and so on. Don't think you can go far wrong with this for at least a few hours of quality entertainment.			"

Sorta like an open-ended FTL.In reality, your ship starts from a blank state of a set size at the beginning of each level. The levels aren't randomly generated either; outside of the esthetic, this is a straight-up tower defense game. Not necessarily a bad TD, but not a great one either			"

												Space Run  features high speed spaceship combat that plays out much like a puzzler. You’ll spend your time lining up your weapons and powering your thrusters all to protect your cargo and make it to the end to collect your pay. It does this beautifully by fusing an unlock system both during delivery and between deliveries all while begging you to think ahead while the alarms are screaming that another set of enemies are on their way.The unlock system is impressive. It features laser guns, rockets, point defense, shields, disabling cannons, warp drives, healing generators and each of these has a variety of special attacks and moves. You might for example enjoy a laser gun that can be reoriented over one that has an incredible rate of fire. It also pairs nicely with the games 30 deliveries. When you finish missions you’ll be given money depending on your score. You can use that to purchase or upgrade existing weapons. As you unlock new weapons you also unlock new deliveries with unusual and often times very hazardous cargo that could explode or shut off your shields. This means that the entire time you’ll play Space Run the game will be ramping up the complexity. By the end you’ll be able to appreciate going from just a ship with three or so lasers and some thrusters to fighting hundreds of enemies with dozens of ship defenses all while under the clock.The clock and indeed the overall method and means by which you plan is worth giving Space Run a shot. It asks you to look at your ship, anticipate where attacks are coming from, put your cargo and defenses in way to defend them both from the immediate threat of incoming ships and the long term ability to fend off future attacks. But this isn’t just some planning game. As I mentioned before all your weapons have special abilities. You will have to get used to running your ship to defend yourself. You’re not merely watching a well planned defense, you’re executing it.Which leads me to the sticking points. For example you might beautifully crush all your forward facing opponents but then found you’ve spent all your resources and are now unable to defend yourself from the rear. Or you might have proved an excellent defense but unable to make your delivery in time. This is of course is fine and certainly better than being too easy but the game has a tendency for deadly “gotcha” moments. Retrying with a different setup is often fun but eventually it loses it’s charm. You’re not given the opportunity to immediately try again. You’re given the opportunity in about 3:00. It’s short but it definitely could use some check points. I do have to say however knowing the level means knowing the route which does seem thematically appropriate.If you like short puzzlers with a good dose of action and planning then you’ll have fun with this one. That being said it’s 30 levels are a bit too short for the current asking price of $14.99. You’ll probably get five stars on all levels in about 20 hours and that’s heavily replaying the levels. I recommend this game at $10.			"

												A great indie tower defense / starship buidling game with lots of polish.   The game starts you off gently, but quickly adds lots of cunning strategies and varied options.    The joys of meticulously configuring your pre-launch build are equaled by the sweat-wiping satisfaction of limping into port with bits (or most) of your ship blasted off.      If you've ever played the board game ""Galaxy Trucker"", you'll feel right at home with this title, but this game takes frantic decision-making and starship loadouts to the next level.$10 wisely invested; highly recommended.

The missions are no to long that if you don't need checkpoints or anything. It was made around the quick choices to see if you made the right one. If you didn't an asteroid could hit your ship and destroy 4 tiles. Than you have to adapt your strategy even more. This game is great the way it is.

Now, while I 5 star things on the first try, I still have to put in a lot of attention.Normally my experience with TD games is it's fairly laid back, and you can speed up when you're confident and just sit and watch or take more of an active role while the towers do their job.With this it's more frantic and while it's not bad, it's not what I was really hoping for.No real graphics options either, which is disappointing.

												Fun but only worth a couple hours of your time.They have a very good idea, solid tech progression, but like others have said, the campaign is lacking and the need to constantly adjust turrets and such is tedious at best.For some reason I thought that you could set up the look of your ship and thus put the tiles where you want, making room for your cargo, weapons and more. Unfortunately you cannot, and thus lose an aspect of the game that could have made it stellar instead of meh.I'd recommend it if it's on sale for $5, (I bought it for $9 and think I overpaid), any higher though and it's really just a slightly fun game with a tedious endgame that makes you want to stop playing.Good effort and a cool idea, just kinda falls flat after a few hours of gameplay.

												This is a tower defense game with a twist. There is no path which the enemy will follow like he's supposed to. Enemies will attack you from all sides, it is up to you to build defenses on your ship to keep you alive. It is not an easy game, after a few levels you will be killed. The idea is you go back to your spacestation and rethink your defenses. The voiceovers are well done, the jokes are funny, and the graphics are polished. It is a little sad that there are only about 20 to 30 levels in the game, it should have been deeper or randomly generated.Since the game isn't very easy at all, it will take you a while to complete it. In short, it's pretty enjoyable.			"

												This is an interesting twist on the Tower Defense idea, but the sword cuts both ways. The need to pick and choose which blocks you prioritize and generating clever solutions for 360° of kicking♥♥♥♥♥is  challenging/fun. However, because the blocks on the ship change between missions, a lot of the time I feel like I'm being forced to figure out one specific solution to the level. My own creativity, my desire for certain types of guns, my desire to push for speed -- these were all blunted by the nature of the block changes. After a few hours, playing it stopped offering the great value of games like ""Grid"" --- there was no reason to replay the level and try different configurations.			"

												This game is a strange conversion of Astroid Defense and Tower defense. The sound effect is in this game is awesome but the commentary from your character and robot gets repetitive after a few games. There is nearly no story and you need to spend time farming levels to get enough credit to upgrade your ship. The action is very intense. Even though i played easiest diffciulty it still seems pretty hard. You just simply don't have enough time to build new component and use ability. To play this game effectivly you must learn to use fast key shortcuts. To complete each level plan out your ship before it launch. I actually have a piece of scarp paper that i draw the basic layout that i want my ship to look like and set it beside my monitor before ship launch. Depend on where enemy come from just change the pace on what to build first. Planning is very important for this game since action is very fast intense after just a few levels. I would recommend everyone to try this game out.			"

												Space Run a tower defense game with a twist! (Completed the game took me roughly 22 hours) well worth its price tagThis game will bring you comedy, thinking skills, planning, and all that in space!On a serious note: Space run is a tower defense game in real time, where you have to fight against the clock and pirates and asteroids while all making sure your cargo gets from point A to Point B in time and intact.Each mission will gradually get harder and harder but happily with the money you get from each run you can buy new modules for your ship, guns, shields, power supplies etc.While this game requires allot of fast reaction skills (especially later on in the game) there is a module that will slow down time (the best engine)While not the best in-depth review I would if you have doubts to check out the Playlist I set up on YouTube so you can decide for yourself: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNCxq2TSuDbCUKvEMDhIfGFUlaMr5LjQR there are a total of 30 missions.A highly enjoyable game well worth its price tagKorpah "

												Sometimes a game comes along and reminds us that even a tired old genre can still be interesting if it's done exceptionally right.  Space Run is one of those games, as it turns tower defense on its head by casting you as running cargo through hostile sectors while controlling a ship that can convert resources (""hexnuts"") into additional generators, shields, weaponry, engines, and the like.  The end result barely looks like tower defense at all, but manages to capture the best parts of the genre while possibly creating something even better.    In the most basic sense, it's a game about placing things on hexagons to survive various attacking threats.  However, this game goes far beyond the basics, and delivers a rock-solid good balance and great presentation.  It's great to see a PC game that was not rushed to market - THIS is an example of how indies are revitalizing the platform.			"

												This game reminds me of both Starcraft and FTL, as you progress through the game, the deliveries you make become more difficult than the last. Especially the importance of how you place your packages/defenses. The only thing you should be worried about though, is that you might need to use your brain. It's a strategy game... you need to use yo head.Once you get to the higher tier weapons, it can be pretty difficult to place generators and guns while also trying to defend yourself10/10			"

The missions are fun, the graphics are very well done, the build and upgrade options are expansive, and the action is heated.  My largest complaints are that the campaign is very weak and there is no pause button, speed setting, or checkpoints.  With all that being said, I strongly recommend this game.  It's very entertaining for the price.  With some simple changes, it could be epic and totally remake the genre.			"

												FYI I did not finish the game.Space Run is a tower defense esque like game. I said esque because you need to control some of the defense turrets (shifting their angle), operating some support system (generate backup shield, extra power supply, boost the speed).  Your mission is to get as many stars as you can for each of your trip (scoring highest point). This can be done by ensuring your goods arrived intact AND you use the shortest time possible (there are three ranking for speed/time).I like it because I like tower defense. I like how you can configure your defense to your preferred style. However, the control takes a bit too much (need more micro managing skill) which takes more effort to play. Further, some of the mission it is difficult because they enemies attack you from all angles and you need to react quickly with your limited supply of money (money is required to build turrets). I think I left probably 5 more missions or so but I decided I do not want to grind the game anymore. I do recommend it though (casual at the beginning, but now things gets tough, I AM BAILING!)			"

												Very good game.Not AAA material, but nice indy and fun game. You got a ship with limited space and you need to deliver different types of cargos (with different effects on your ship!) to its destination through asteroids, pirates, competitors and even boss pirates!Your ship is built with hexes and you can put weapons, engines, shields and energy booster on one or more hexes. To do that, you have to destroy things in your run that gives you bolts and when you have enough, you can buy the part you want and place it anywhere you want. It becomes a strategic positioning of weapons, shields and energy booster and also your cargo. Everything can be destroyed, your cargo included!You don't control your ship, it always go forward, but by adding engines it can go faster. You can buy upgrades and new components after the run with the star credit you earn depending on how fast you did the run.Quite a fun little game and it becomes more and more challenging as you transport more exotic cargo (Like the energy draining crystals!).I recommend in the 10$ asking price. Well worth it.			"

												I am a huge fan of tower defense games.  Space Run is a fantastic addition to the genre.  As with any great tower defense game, there is a delicate balance of resources and tower types, and in the case of Space Run, it goes a few layers deeper (see below).  Instead of protecting the exit or in the case of Defense Grid for example, power orbs, the emphasis is on your space cargo.  Structures and shield generators can be used to shield the cargo from enemy forces.  All towers receive active and passive upgrades through in game credits earned from completing missions.  In addition to safeguarding your cargo and taking out waves of enemies encroaching on your ship, your delivery rating is based on how fast you got to the destination (this is separate from the cargo arriving intact).  This is based on the amount of thrust the ship has (based on the number and type of thrusters).  I also forgot to mention that many of the towers types can be rotated to improve their effectiveness.  This is crucial early on in most missions to maximize income for the mid to late game of a specific mission.  The average length of a mission is 5-10 minutes and is a ton of fun.  I suggest that anyone who enjoys games like Defense Grid, Sol Survivor, Prime World: Defenders, and Kingdom Rush give Space Run a try.			"

												With the tower defense genre being somewhat stale as of late, Space-Run is a decent attempt at trying to ""spice things up""You pilot a hex-based ship which serves as you your platform for turrets, shields and cargo. The intrigue comes down to how and where you place them as you place them in diffferent directions to cover particular directions the enemies come from (conviently, 6 directions). As you fly through space you encounter meteriods and pirates which attempt to damage modules and cargo. You also get some passive trucker ships (which oddly enough, you blast out the sky.. no reason given). In the end you are given a rating on how fast the delivery was and the state of the cargo you were suppose to deliver. More cargo delivered faster = more cash to spend on building upgrades to the modules you make.The result is a rather satisfying TD, where you get the urge to go back to give it another try so see if you could do it better this time round. There's a number of small faults. It's mostly just lacking some polish in this regard.-Don't expect anything in the form of a story. The voicing is good and the script has a cheesey humour, but aside from that there's little tale to tell.-Missions are scripted. All of them. Which this gives way for for some decent level design, the way the game plays feels akin to FTL and thus it lends itself to being roguelike. There isn't a randomised gametype or any sort so there's a lot of replayability going to waste here.- Similar to FTL, you aim weapons and power shields as and when you need them. FTL has a tactical pause that allows you to issue all the orders simultaniously. However, in space run, you are expected to micromanage you modules' orientations and active abilities on the fly. While this increases the pacing, the module based system can make this process somewhat fiddly and can cause mistakes that make you restart you ten minute pefect run. If you're a fan of TD games, it's worth a look at in it's current state. If the developers decide to apply the polish, I would recommend this to anyone else, especially the rouguelike fans.			"

												This game is tower defense with a rather unusual twist: Your spaceship is the center of attention and from all planar directions, pirates and asteroids come in to bombard you. As if that weren't enough, you have to balance speed (one more engine) with defense (one more shield) and aggressive defense (one more weapon).Those decisions are made on your hex-based ship, different weapons, defenses, engines and generators feeding the former  having increasingly complicated shapes to fit. It's all about finding the right combination of modules in the right places at the right times.In your first tries, you may fail, but later come back with a vengeance, after having reinvested your earnings for fast and possibly safe delivery of goods into the newest technology upgrades. Still, especially the later missions will keep you occupied for quite a while.For the perfectionists, there's a good 30 hours of gameplay, until you unlocked every achievement, doing everything perfectly.Definitely recommended.

												It's an interesting enough spin on tower defense type games since you have to more actively manage your towers (repair them, change their firing radius) as well as your defensive tools (shields, ion cannon, et cetera).If you don't like games that require a lot of trial and error (and subsequent experimentation) or just don't like tower defense in general, then don't bother. If you do like either of those two type of game design aspects, then it is passable. Not great, just passable.			"

												The good: it's tower defense in space. You take your hex-grid and enemy waves attack it with something like a 30 second warning of the next wave's composition and path. Blowing up enemies gets you a resource which you can then use to build turrets or activate special powers of existing turrets. You also get a constant basic income, so, while it is possible to screw up badly enough to get shot down, you can't screw up to prevent yourself from being able to build (though you may not be able to build in time).There's a good array of offensive, defensive and support modules to unlock and unlock powers for - completing a run earns you currency, which you can spend to unlock upgrades and new buildable modules.Weaponry comes as missiles, which are high damage, can be intercepted, but can be built anywhere, and lasers, which have to be built overhanging the edge of the ship, and do less damage, but are harder to block. Then there are ion guns which just shut down enemy modules temporarily (which is much quicker than destroying them through damage) and, like lasers, have to be built on the edge of your ship.Shields have to be powered (usually by building them next to power generators) but protect several hexes around them from all damage while they last, and regenerate automatically.Engines have to stick out of the back of your ship, and control how long the flight takes - finishing a given course within a set time gives you a bigger payoff; be too slow and you get nothing. The game does a good job of showing you whether you need more engines to qualify for a given bonus or will collect it if nothing disrupts your engines.Power generators provide power to the adjacent hexes, allowing advanced modules and module powers to operate.Each type of module comes in several versions, with the basic version taking up just the one hex and often not requiring power for standard operation, while more advanced equivalents will take up multiple hexes and require (more) power in order to do anything. Balancing space and power requirements is a key part of later runs, and where the game shines.The bad:The game does reward successful micromanagement - and some of the later runs require it. That's not a bad thing in itself, but it is when the controls are occasionally sluggish and unresponsive. Having to repeat mouse-clicks three or four times to get them to register in the midle of an intense fire-fight makes a big difference to the outcome. I can understand not wanting to go down the pausable real time route, but if you require the player to input their decisions in real time, then the game needs to reliably accept that input in real timeIf you mis-position a module when building, your only option is to wait precious seconds for it to finish building, dismantle it to free the space and get back some of the resource investment, and then rebuild it in the right space. Again, not a bad thing in itself - if the user makes a mistake, it's fair enough for them to have to pay some sort of penalty - but in this game, whenever an engine comes online, the entire play area moves suddenly - if you're lucky, the module you were about to place is now in an illegal position and nothing happens; if you're unlocky, you've just put the right module in the wrong position and have to face the penalty.Neither of these is a fundamental design flaw - though the degree of micromanagement required may not be to everyone's taste - but they are real problems with the game.The other stuff:The game gets compared to the boardgame Galaxy Trucker - in fact, that's how I first came to hear of it. Yes, there are things both games have in common, and it's easy to believe that this game was partly inspired by the board game, but there are also enough differences, and significant enough differences that this isn't just Galaxy Trucker: the Video Game. That said, there's enough overlap that if you enjoy one, there's a good chance you'll enjoy the other.			"

												I was lucky enough to pick up Space Run on sale, and after 20 hours of playtime, I think it's safe to say I find this game a worthwhile purchase even at full price.  As you'll see in a lot of reviews, Space Run plays like a tower defense game.  For all intents and purposes this is true, but rather than trying to channel your enemies into traps, or choke points, you have to setup your ship to deal with enemies from possibly any direction (though your radar gives you fair warning of where the baddies are coming from).For anyone on the fence, here's my list of Pros and ConsPROS:- It's quite easy to install and get right into the action with this game.  The information and pop ups on things that happen for the first time are designed well and not excessive (so restarting a level won't make you redo a help window).- It's a great puzzle-based tower defense game.  Sometimes you can attack a run with all offense, other times you have to take a defensive position... and in the most fun, a combination of both is often required where you have to decommission a turret to make room for something more appropriate for the upcoming enemy.- Even the lower level turrets come in handy in the later levels.  With most tower defense games, once you are able to pick up the better weapons the ""entry"" weapons loose their value.  Not so in Space Run.  Based on ship design, the direction/type of enemies coming at you etc., ""entry"" weapons are actually better options than the beefier ones.  It's a nice way to balance out the game and make you plan your run accordingly.- Great Voice Acting for an Indie title.  Seriously, bad voice acting can quickly take away from a game.  Thankfully the good voice acting actually you around looking for more.  While you can skip the dialogs, I found myself enjoying the scripted banter between our hero and the various characters he deals with.Cons:- There's not enough turrets.  There are basically 3 types of each turret, which are guns, missiles, defensive (anti-misslles and anti-turret cannons), shields, engines, and power plants.  I'd love to see more variety and weapons, but it is an indie game after all, and the lack of options will arguably add to he difficulty of the later runs.- Money is easy to get.  I think a lot of the negative reviews stem from the MISTAKE that you have to pick a playing style and go with it.  Frankly, I'd rather that be the case.  If you don't feel like you're equipped enough to make a run, quite and replay a run you've already completed to get more money and upgrade your turrets.  Fame and Money limit your ability to upgrade turrets, but money is easily earned (by replaying missions) and your fame level at the 2/3 mark is sufficient to unlock everything.- Once you play a mission, you know the mission.  It's fun to replay a mission and try different turret combinations/combos, but the level really is unchanged.  You encounter the same enemies at the same time that use the same weapons, etc.  I would have loved to see some level of random enemy generation, but I understand why the developers didn't take this approach.All things considered this is game about strategy.  How do you setup your turrets?  How do you configure them, etc?  Yes, there are times when you have to activate a turret's abilities at a key time, but if that weren't the case, you'd basically be looking at a screen watching enemies get wiped out (or alternatively wiping out your ship)? If you want that, save the money and head over to youtube.  If you find yourself devolving into turret management, than you're approaching the level wrong.  Try something different, each run presents different challenges, so take the opportunity and try different tactics.My rating: 4/5I think the Metacritic score is a touch low, but it's a fun game worth picking up, especially if you can catch it on sale.  Just be warned that you will easily find yourself losing hours trying to figure out the best way through a run.			"

												Very good game.Not AAA material, but nice indy and fun game. You got a ship with limited space and you need to deliver different types of cargos (with different effects on your ship!) to its destination through asteroids, pirates, competitors and even boss pirates!Your ship is built with hexes and you can put weapons, engines, shields and energy booster on one or more hexes. To do that, you have to destroy things in your run that gives you bolts and when you have enough, you can buy the part you want and place it anywhere you want. It becomes a strategic positioning of weapons, shields and energy booster and also your cargo. Everything can be destroyed, your cargo included!You don't control your ship, it always go forward, but by adding engines it can go faster. You can buy upgrades and new components after the run with the star credit you earn depending on how fast you did the run.Quite a fun little game and it becomes more and more challenging as you transport more exotic cargo (Like the energy draining crystals!).I recommend in the 10$ asking price. Well worth it.			"

												Good tower defense deviation.Requires long-term strategies (as in how can I optimize the space I have available?) as well as fast decisions (activating abilities, adjusting turrets).It's a good and fun mix, but is rather short and has no endless mode. As the enemies always appear in the same pattern in the missions, there is a lack of a challenge, even on the highest difficulty, as soon as you figure out the optimal strategy for yourself. A little bit of RNG could have made the game much more challenging.Although it has its shortcoming Space Run is worth its time and money and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a new and refreshing experience in the tower defense genre.

												A fun and unique take on tower defense. Your ship has a hexagon grid on it where you can place modules like laser turrets, missile batteries, engines, shields and more. Although you can't control your ships movement, you wont really mind as you'll be busy placing and tweaking modules throughout each run, and you can control it's speed through placing thrusters.Do you go heavy on the weapons and smash the opposition? Build up a lot of thrusters to fly through quickly? Build up a lot of defense like shields for survivabiltiy or a mix of all the above?As you rank up and gain reputation points, you unlock new turrets & utilites and each one has unlockable abilities you can purchase. Each mission has a 5 star ranking and is repeatable so you can try to max out your rating in each mission.Comes with a fully voice acted story too.			"

												A good little game that takes inspiration from Tower Defence games, but mixes it up a little. A bit repetetive and lacking in variety, perhaps, but a fun and addicting game for the most part. Only minor bugs I noticed were subtitles that didn't match the vocals correctly (or contained typos) - a minor greivance, but something that should have been easy to fix!Not sure I'd pay full price, so I'm glad I picked it up in the sale (but I'm still glad none-the-less!).

												Space Run has humor, charm, wit, and a very decent challenge that is well designed. The basic concept of Space Run is tower defense, but it takes things in a surprisingly exciting and original direction. Given a ship, a cargo, and an engine, the player constructs weapons, shields and many other devices as needed, all constrained by the limitation of space that the hexagons of the ship represent.The feeling of flight, of speed is palpable, as the ship soars past planets and asteroid fields, threatened from all sides by every manner of trouble. Pirate ships, tumbling rocks, and even other space truckers all present either a danger, or an opportunity to make cash on the side.The goal is to protect the cargo and deliver it as quickly as possible - the faster, the better the payoff. But there are strategies that pay well in doddling too, and there are times when it is sensible to hunker down, and times when putting everything into engines is better. It is the diversity of choices, and the continual unlocking of new weapons, shields and engines that make the game entrancing.Cultural and media references abound - there are nods to everything from Red Dwarf and Blake's Seven to Babylon 5, and more. Above all, the game is just plain fun. I highly recommend it as a light, enjoyable diversion. Each run takes about ten to fifteen minutes, making it ideal for a quick break or that waiting time before dinner.This is a casual, but not unchallenging game, that holds a lot of fun in a small package.It is worth the price.

This is a long review, so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend Space Run skip to Results and read from there.Passtech Games pushes out a rather unique tower-defense game that draws upon all new features. Space Run offers a unique combination of space tactics, tower defense, and arcade combat systems.Story:You play a rather cocky captain Buck Mann, a space runner, whose mission is to deliver goods across the universe. He normally doesn’t chase the credits, but some debits with the notorious gangsters has caused a change of heart. Buck is given a chance to by Big Cargo executive Susan to delivery some highly important cargo. This first mission unlocks the opportunity to prove himself as a reputable Space Runner. As the deliveries continue Buck Mann gains new clients Nuclear Star, VIP Travel, Out of This World, and AI Squared. Can he make all the deliveries and become the best Space Running in the Galaxy?Campaign:The campaign is composed of 30-missions, each company offers Buck Mann six missions each. Throughout each of your clients you’ll face ever stronger foes and have to fight off fearsome pirate lords: Captain Black and Brownbeard the Pirate. Not only do you have to fight off meddlesome pirates, but you need to protect your ship through asteroid belts and ever more deadly cargo. The campaign is ever changing as every mission new enemies and challenges are introduced keeping the game fresh and entertaining. Gameplay:Space Run plays like a traditional tower defense, in that you place turrets in your base and they target enemies without your control. Each tower has special abilities you can unlock with can give you a higher degree of control over them. Every tower has its usage and you’ll notice as you play you will be switching out between them continuously. A mixture of anti-ballistic missile systems, machine gun turrets, mass rocket launchers, super shields, engines that can control the space-time-continuum, and much more. This game has a fantastic difficulty curve from Easy to Hard offering gaming for all player-types. Hard is more difficult and will require repeat plays to get 5-star while on the other hand easy is so simple you can gun through it on one run and get a perfect game. Hints:>Anti-ballistic missile systems are going to be incredibly useful and in-fact may be more important than your shields.>The maximum laser turret is worth every penny and if you place them right you won’t need to worry about other laser turrets.>In order to get 5-stars you will need all the engine upgrades.>Play this game on easy for achievements, as you are not limited by difficulty.>Make sure your ship has got lots of engines early on boss levels, as they stop your ship in its tracks. If you are not far enough ahead of the timer you will get pulled behind and lose the 5-star rating. Results:Space Run is an incredibly interesting new take onto Tower Defense games that puts high speed micro-managing with unique map concepts to provide a fantastic gaming experience. Each map requires speed as well as a protecting cargo which requires proper management of the player’s resources. The unique bosses pose new threats not just on the players cargo, but they also stop the player meaning if he/she is not far enough ahead of the timer they may get pulled back and lose the 5-star delivery. If you like Tower Defense Games, like micromanaging, enjoy space combat, or want a unique gaming experience then Space Run is the game for you. I definitely recommend this game and based on how you play it you can easily get 10-20 hours of gameplay out of it before repeating yourself.Pros:+Unique enemies that keep the game interesting.+Interesting ship dynamics and management.+Loads of engineering upgrades and abilities.+Awesome boss battles and strategies.+Clean graphics and smooth user interface.+Fast paced space simulator with highly diversified playing methods.+Smooth difficulty curve – made for all players.+Cargo dynamics that require the player to have to play in unique ways.Cons:-Sadly no survival mode.-Turrets almost always annoyingly target enemy ship engines rather than their weaponry. Seeing as Engines do nothing for enemy ships it almost always results in your turrets getting beat up a lot more than they need to.-Enemy EMP weapon seem to always seem to switch targets while your EMP weapons shoot the same thing over and over. Result is all your systems are down and the enemy only has an engine down.			"

												After playing through this game twice I would now say I cannot recommend it. There are some design choices that just bother players and the designers seemto be quite stoburn about it on the forums. For example the ability to slow down time. There is some advanced item in the game that can give this, but it is so essentialthat it should really be much more accessible, for example an upgrade on your commandmodule  (instead of the ridiculous upgrade to collect credits without using your mouse, that should always be the case!).Once you have completed 80% of the runs with 5 stars you got probably enough creditsthat you unlocked all the weapons and upgrades. At that point the rest of the game is just a chore, as upgrading is probably (and regrettably) the most fun part of the game. The missions are 8-12 minutes long, and there are no checkpoints within. If you played for 7 minutes and made a single mistake... too bad you have to start all over. Please add some checkpoints half way through to reduce the frustation!Give a ""skip all"" button for the dialog. It's fun and quirky, the first time around only!I do hope a sequel comes out that addresses these and other issues people have been complaining. The gameplay is nice. But I wouldn't put the time to play in Hard. I only do this for games I like and I feel that the game system and the design are worth my effort to master them. This game does not. Thank you for you try. Please do better next time.			"

												Wow, this is a little gem. I've seen it floating around on Steam since it came out, but I never really looked into it too closely. I'm not sure what I thought it was, but I wasn't expecting it to be so good. It's listed as a tower defense game, and while it does have elements of that, I think it's selling the game short to call it a tower defense game. It's so much deeper than that, sliding back more towards RTS territory, which of course is where the tower defense genre came from.Essentially, you control a space ship that is trying to deliver cargo for various companies. The flights are always a straight line from left to right. In practice, this means your ship is mostly sitting in the middle of the screen as hazards approach from all directions. These hazards include asteroids, pirates, and competitor ships. Every time your destroy something, you get money, which can be used to build more guns and other ship systems like power generators, shields, and engines.The entire ship is made of interconnected hexagons, upon which you must place your ship components. The variety of guns is nice, with a handful of different lasers and projectile weapons to choose from. The bigger weapons need power to run, as do the special abilities you can add for all the weapons. There is a lot of strategy involved in placing weapons and the support systems, and on the later levels, you'll sometimes have to retry missions with different layouts to get an optimal configuration. But once your learn the ins and outs of weapons, and figure out how to set arrange your support systems, the game can become very satisfying, as you tear everything up with your big guns.Each company has its own type of cargo with its own special needs, and the cargos can hamper your ship in various ways. The most basic is taking up space, but they can also take up precious lines of sight needed for your guns, or explode violently when destroyed, inflicting extra damage to your ship. Another actively drains the energy from hexes around it. These add some interesting flavor to the various missions.You get credits for completing missions, with more credits for more perfect completions of missions. The great thing is, you can retry missions for more credits as much as you want, so if later missions are too tough, you can build up your ship powers on earlier missions for a while until you're able to pass the later missions.The great thing about this game is that even losing is fun, and you never feel like the game is being cheap. You get warnings for all ship and asteroid approaches, so you have time to plan for whichever direction they're coming from. Things can get pretty hectic, but I often find that better planning can alleviate the problem enough to make levels passable. And on the tough levels, it's pretty great to squeeze through by the skin of your teeth. I've never had to retry a level more than maybe five times at the absolutely most to beat it, and I've been having an absolute blast.The audio design is nice, with big sounds for all the weapons and other effects, while the voice acting is solid enough that you won't think much of it. But the story is thin at best. It's all about the gameplay here. The graphics are pretty nice, with cool visuals for most for the weapons and other systems. Destroying enemy ships is nice and satisfying.I can't really find many flaws with this game. It's very focused on what it's trying to do, and it does it well. If you're looking for a deeper action/strategy game. Highly recommended!			"

												One hell of a beast game, got me hooked for hours.......Hours..... You can get very creative with your building placements. Very immportant where you place your buildings before you launch becuase they will be your key objectives that you need to protect. A lot of angles enemies or astriods will come in, your best weapon is constant replays so you can start adaptiing to the building placement, timing on which side of the ship you need to strenghten. Always aim for the most expensive building as you progress through the game, they are worth it.			"

												Best tower defense game I've played in a very long time, graphics are really well polished and the whole experience felt very smooth.Micromanaging of towers is simple and rewarding, keyboard shortcuts are well thought out and easy to use... the only thing that I can fault is that some of the lines that get said by the Android character grated against me a bit. Even then, totally passable.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a tower defense game that pushes you to do better, encourages intelligent resource spending and well timed micro management.

												Starts great, first couple of missions are really fun, but altogether this game has the same problem as many others, too many restrictions that slowly creep into gameplay. Cannot alter the shape of the ship which has influence on the cargo which has different amount of slots and other requirements thus heavily limiting the use of the given shape.It would be great if you could work out your own ship around the cargo but thats not possible leaving you with very few (good) options.Another thing is the different factions that you can work for but in the end you cannot choose who to work for, one mission follows another, you cant choose the order.Looked good at the beginning, becomes disappointing after the first couple of missions.

												I regret buying this game. I love the tower defense genre - having played Fieldrunners 1 & 2, Gemcraft Labriynth, Anomaly, and various other free / paid games.Space Run is a good game with a good concept, decent graphics, and a sizeable tech tree with a single big problem - it uses the same arcade mechanics that I used to play / like on my Spectrum ZX. To state it explicitly:1. Every time you kill an enemy, you get the game currency - only you have to hover over it to get it. I am not the kid I was 10 years back. I don't like the repetitive part of games.2. There is no pause functionality. The developer has explicitly stated that they will not introduce one. Lots of people have asked for it.Without a pause, the game becomes un-necessarily difficult, stressful. And this is not a RTS. You are not playing aganist your friends. "

												This is one of the few games I regret buying on steam. This game requires a lot of micro management which would be fine except for the fact this game has one of the worst control systems ever. You have to click several times and use the mouse wheel to point your turrets (which is something you need to do al the the time). It just feels a very overcomplicated and unsatisfying way to work. Also the level intro cut scene can't be skipped so you have to watch it everytime you restart a level. Blurgh.			"

												Yes, this is one of those immensely addictive tower defence games, but a different one at that. The sci-fi setting definitely brings some of that sweet deep space atmosphere into the game. At later stages the game can become a bit overwhelming and you will need to play a stage several times in order to know and predict the risks that come with deep space travel. The dialogue is nice and some of the puns even made me smile every now and then. No phenomenal writing can be expected here though.If you're a strategy fan and like the idea of micromanaging your space ship, which happen in exotic but dangerous deep space environments similar to ones found in Star Wars, Star Trek or even Dead Space, you may very well like this game.I heartwarmingly recommend!

												Very good Tower Defense game... I've played all the popular TDs and beat 'em all. Space Run is perhaps the most challenging, and yet real fun.  The voice-acting is pro, and sometimes funny too :DThere are 3 difficulties.  I completed 'Normal' (medium), and I felt like I achieved a lot.  *Phew*  I had to restart most of the levels many times to work out how to beat the levels. As others said, you gotta memorise the early waves (~5) a little, to help you prepare the ship.  This isn't a negative at all.  Most challenging TDs require you to do the same... A criticism is switching tower direction.  That is only for the first half of the game.  Later on, I was building mega towers that have wide range.  A few of those, and I'm covered. Guys, pls don't keep using the cheapest tower that allow you to switch direction; the other 5 towers are better in every way.Space Run is 9/10.  Perfect score would require checkpoints and pause. I'm gonna try out the sequel.  Yes I'm a little late, as usual, but I take my own sweet time :)			"

												4 days, a couple of 5 hours a head cold and a will to defend my space deliveries against retro space pirates. That is my experience with space run and it was an excellent one. What better way to relieve my brain swell than to blow **** up! Space Run challenges you to build to order like your a fast food restaurant that specialises in ammunition delivery into the heart of your enemies boarding ship and every space pirate is damned hungry. Seriously though I had a ton of fun completing Space Run. It was the most fun I had in late 2016. Whats not to like if your a fan of small time RTS style gameplay. Space Run kept gameplay simple and fun in all categories, placement of your weapons and defenses means everything, with combat/defense/utility upgrades that were very simple and fun to understand. Even the delivery times were perfect and easily doable. Now not all the mission types were easy for me (thanks A.I. Squared), but they were also doable and very rewarding. Space Run delivers that sense of accomplishment very easily especially when your coming down the finish line extremely hot being attacked from your flanks with your cargo still intact because you had the better sense to build those sweet shields and jammers. Your defense is just as important as your offense. Remember as long as you have met the indicated time, your cargo is intact and your cockpit doesn't get decimated you should be golden to cross that line with at least a 3 star reward. Fail timer as well as 3, 4 and 5 star timer goals are indicated on the mini map to the bottom right of the screen. Fast and safe are literally the requirements its damned beautiful!I would consider Space Run to be my 2016 tower defense of the year. Very fun kb+m only game and easily affordable.			"

												4 days, a couple of 5 hours a head cold and a will to defend my space deliveries against retro space pirates. That is my experience with space run and it was an excellent one. What better way to relieve my brain swell than to blow **** up! Space Run challenges you to build to order like your a fast food restaurant that specialises in ammunition delivery into the heart of your enemies boarding ship and every space pirate is damned hungry. Seriously though I had a ton of fun completing Space Run. It was the most fun I had in late 2016. Whats not to like if your a fan of small time RTS style gameplay. Space Run kept gameplay simple and fun in all categories, placement of your weapons and defenses means everything, with combat/defense/utility upgrades that were very simple and fun to understand. Even the delivery times were perfect and easily doable. Now not all the mission types were easy for me (thanks A.I. Squared), but they were also doable and very rewarding. Space Run delivers that sense of accomplishment very easily especially when your coming down the finish line extremely hot being attacked from your flanks with your cargo still intact because you had the better sense to build those sweet shields and jammers. Your defense is just as important as your offense. Remember as long as you have met the indicated time, your cargo is intact and your cockpit doesn't get decimated you should be golden to cross that line with at least a 3 star reward. Fail timer as well as 3, 4 and 5 star timer goals are indicated on the mini map to the bottom right of the screen. Fast and safe are literally the requirements its damned beautiful!I would consider Space Run to be my 2016 tower defense of the year. Very fun kb+m only game and easily affordable.			"

												The game itself is fast, frantic and fun. It requires quick thinking. The game progression is good. I like the missions, the voice acting, the style. Even once you've completed a mission, it is good fun to have another go, try to achieve better time and score. For each play of the game, you can try different strategies of guns, missile launchers, shields, reactors, etc, trying to optimise your strategy. It has decent replayability.Playing it with a GTX 960 4GB (mid-range gaming graphics card) at 4K resolution, and it's working great for me.			"

												This is a tower defense game turned on it's head.  While it can be a bit fiddly, especially at the earlier levels with the need to manually orient some of the weapons, this is less of an issue at later levels where you have access to more powerful guns with wider fields of fire.I agree fully with an earlier reviewer who said the game needs a pause button to let you build and adjust things when things get really tense.I think the difficulty level progresses smoothly and trying to get ""5 star"" runs on some of the later levels is definitely a challenge that extends the play time for those looking for more.One thing that bugs me is that once you've built all of the upgrades, there is nothing to do with your money.  You hit the fully upgraded point with a few missions left and then the money just keeps piling on (hitting the $99,999 limit fairly quickly).  Even if there was some dumb achievment for getting to $1 million, it would give something to do with that excess cash.7.5/10			"

												This game surprised me; I liked it far more than I was expecting! For saying it's an indie game, the visuals are actually very good, and the gameplay mechanics are both unique and fun. It took me 12 hours to beat on easy (I didn't realise there was a difficulty modifier until my second playthrough), but it is definitely good for several more playthroughs. And as it's only £10.99 (or less when on sale), it's extremely good value for money. Can't wait for a sequel or expansion pack!			"

												If you're into Tower Defence games (TD) then this is the game for you. Whereas normally creep travels through your tower maze and gets obliterated by your defences, Space Run takes this concept and reverses it. You pilot a cargo spaceship equipped with weapons and defence systems and have to deliver urgent cargo.By destroying foes you get money and can upgrade your ships weapons and stuff. This is often necessary in order to beat the levels. The game is quite stressful since there are some RTS elements included (e.g. changing the alignment of your gun). Sometimes there are some nasty difficulty spikes, especially if there is a pirate to combat.The story may be forgettable but the replay value is quite high, since you'll want to get all the possible stars, right. Graphics are okay, nothing to write home about, though. To sum things up: this is a nice, fun and easy accessible game, that is hard to beat if you're a completionist, but rather easy if you don't mind third places.			"

												For a Tower Defense game Space Run comes in as an odd duck, but leaves you wanting more missions. Many other reviews say that the game could use a ""pause"" feature for building but from someone that is new to tower defense games I honestly like not having it. The need to think ahead and on the go is a challenge, and there are times when the game can be difficult but for myself that like a challenge this is a great thing. For anyone that has never played a RTS (Real-Time Strategy) game or any tower defense game, Space Run can be a pain, but FUN. Only thing that is a miss with Space Run is the campaign can feel a bit short for time wise compared to other RTS games. But for the money, 30 hours of first time play though is not too much.  Picking you the game on sale would honestly be the best bet.			"

												As you can see by my hours played I enjoyed this game. The replayabilty is off the charts, and for those who demand perfection this game will test you. That is you must be perfect to get all 4 stars in each run (ok maybe not the first three or four, but the last 26 for sure). The voice over is actualy really good for such a small scale game. You can win by just placing and watching, but if you want to max it all out you will be managing turrets and don't forget to make sure you have enough power for that special skill that will save you. Also remember what Han said, ""entering light speed ain't like dusting crops"".....you will cringe the first time you drop out of light speed in an asteroid field. It is not pretty but it will bring a smile to your face! If you like tower deffense or Gratuitous space battles than you will like this game, if you don't then you will probably still enjoy this game.			"

												While Space Run is a novel idea, there's still room for significant work to be done to make this a real stand out product.  It's worth a look, but I'll wager that once players finish the game, it won't have the replay appeal that it deserves.  The Good:  A catchy story that engages the player in the sci-fi genre.  IMHO, I feel engaged in the story to want my character to make the fast, safe deliveries.  I've even played the same job a few times over to get the highest rating and to see what the next job offers entail.  This is also necessary as ship options and upgrades aren't cheap. The Bad:  The controls aren't smooth and there's no zoom feature so unless you have a good idea what things look like while they're all clustered together, you may find some frustration when you're placing pieces and even orienting them during the heat of battle.  Maybe it's just me, but sometimes the bad guys seem to have too much of an advantage...I'm also open to the idea that I'm not that good of a ""tower defense"" player, but this isn't about me.  Another aspect I disliked was the fact that destroying a pirate's boosters does not affect their speed.  They manage to keep up with you with their one booster while all seven of mine where giving me maximum thrust.  The Superficial:  There's some variety in this ""tower defense"" space battlefield even though it's simply flying from point A to point B (I would have liked to have seen a navigation screen so that I could at least choose the path my craft is going to take a la Starfox navigation screen on the SNES).  The story line adds humor, though your android's responses are repetitive.  Maybe the next iteration, we'll get to chose our crew and even chose a different android.  I for one would find a sassy female android better company than the annoying Addam-12.  I would have also liked the option of selecting the layout of the transport for my deliveries, but the ""one man studio"" developer made it work with the one you end up using.  Speaking of layouts, Star Wars fans will be happy to see a familiar shape on the BC mission ""Asteroids on Steroids"".  While I get that space is vast, I was hoping to see more engaging celestial objects in the background such as a comet, black hole, nebula or star.    Though I do recommend the game, I would hope to see a quantum leap in game controls and other improvements should there be another Space Run.  After all, they made a Cannonball Run 2....			"

												Space Run is an interesting little take on the tower defense formula. It is good that for the most part what you are defending is immobile(as far as gameplay is concerned), and it lets you concentrate on enemies coming to you, which is how I personally define a good basic Tower Defense game. The game is not difficult to understand, and the upgrade paths are reasonably forgiving, at least at the beginning when you're starting to get comfortable with how -you- plan to play. Gameplay can get a little frantic, and could probably use a pause button to let you catch your bearings when things start getting overwhelming(and to let you focus on easy-to-forget things like repairs), and the way it judges performance is entirely fair for the context of the game.Most importantly, the game pushes you into situations that make you think creatively. You have to decide whether you'll use space on your ship for your cargo that could be used for valuable engine and weapon emplacements. You have to decide -which- weapons to use, and what will be most useful for the trials ahead. The game does reward replaying missions, both with currency for upgrades, as well as the reputation needed to unlock new equipment. The fact that you can easily replay missions, even coming back later with better equipment to earn better ratings, and get a sizable reward for doing so very much evens out the game's inherant difficulty level. Because the choices are so diverse and useful in their own ways, this has the effect of making it not feel like grinding is required.I would recommend that anyone seeking to play this game be comfortable with the idea of learning hotkeys(they're simple and laid out around the WASD keys) because every second you can squeeze out of your interactions will save you time later when you need it. Said hotkeys would be a lot less necessary if they later patch in a pause button.Good luck, and may the winds be at your backs! "

												So far I'm pretty hooked on this game.  I’m a fan of Command & Conquer style RTS & Tower Defense games so I may be bias. This game seems to quell my desire for both. GameplayThere are several advanced equipment (modules) that you unlock by leveling up your character & 3 upgrades are available to each individual module. Multiple options for equipment lends to more tactical options.  It seems as though there are several tactics for each level, thus offering a lot of replay value. Each successful completion of a level rewards you with cash for unlocks/upgrades, including replays. I especially like the “time-line” game mechanic in Space Run because it provides an additional challenge on top of the regular game play. "

												I had a lot of fun with this game. You build your ship as you go fighting space battles and protecting your cargo, while at the same time racing the clock to get a perfect five star finish.It has a good progression system unlocking new and more powerful weapons and upgrades as you go, as well as presenting you with ever increasing cargo complexities.I'll definitely recommend this game for any RTS or tower defence fans; it has just the right mix of complexity, stress and progression which makes for a very enjoyable experience.The only quibble I have with the game is that it is limited in the game play modes on offer; there is a lot of potential to use the core game mechanics for lot more playstyles.For example I would love to see a game mode where you would build up your ship at the start and then fight against random enemies; alternative to start with basic parts and instead of nuts collect upgrades as you destroy enemies, etc...Overall a great game, that has a lot of potential to be built on.

												Yet another awesome concept suffering from poor execution. You're building stuff on your ship that's made of hexagonal platforms, placing turrets, engines, containers, power generators and many more. Your goal is to make it to the end while fending off enemy attacks and protecting yourself from asteroids and other stellar phenomena. Basically, it's a quite clever and original tower defense.Sounds great on paper, but I only ended up frustrated. Later levels are impossible to perfect without preparing way ahead to what's to come. The interface seems like it was made for a mobile device, even though - to my knowledge - the game is not available on any mobile platform. All the ship modules cluttered together are difficult to distinguish, which makes the already fast and micro-focused gameplay hard to get used to. Add to that the fact the visuals, music and sound effects are bland and boring, and that the storyline tries so hard to be funny it ends up being cringeworthy, and you've got yourself just a mediocre game.You might find more fun here than I did, especially if you're not a ""perfectionist"" when it comes to this genre. Personally, I ended up disappointed.			"

												What is it?It's a tower defense game, but only in the broadest sense: you have your (two-dimensional) space ship, consisting of various hexagonal spaces. On these you can build propulsion devices, weapons, shield, generators or place your cargo. On each mission your ship flies automatically from A to B (faster if you build more engines) in real-time, and you have to defend your cargo and your ship from being destroyed by enemy ships and asteroids, which can come from 360&deg;. Destroying them brings you resources which you need to build more devices.So, is it any good?Oh yes, it is. It is actually great. In the first missions you have only a few devices and a small ship. Later the ships get larger, the devices get bigger and need more energy, so you have to place bigger generators next to them. That might sound a bit cumbersome, but it is not. The game leads you from mission to mission to the more complex setups, and you can choose in which order you unlock new devices and upgrades. Later missions are difficult and a little grinding is necessary from time to time, but the balancing of the game is very well made, so they never feel unfair.What about game length and replayability?There are about 30 missions to do. There are achievements, which are a must these days. You can replay all missions to get a better rating and to unlock new devices or upgrades (=grind). Considering the price, that is more than fair.Obviously this is a recommendation. Any criticism?This qualifies as an Indie game. So in regards of graphics, music and sound design, you can expect solid work, but nothing extraordinary. The story is pretty basic and generic: acerbic trucker and android sidekick quarrel with pirates. Voice acting was good. The game can get rather hectic, and the design of some of the devices makes it hard to keep track of everything: A few times I built the mid size shield and not the mid size generator, or forgot to build a missile defence, because I saw too late that the enemy ship had a missile launcher. Enemies and asteroids can come from 360&deg; degrees, but in most mission they do not. But even when replaying, you have to remember the directions.Final Verdict?I really enjoyed the game and gladly recommend it. I am looking forward to the sequel. 4,5/5=9/10			"

After mucking through piles of festering green-lit feces and dried pig vomit, I came upon this gem ""Space Run"", a creative new take on Tower Defense. If you'd like more info on the game read other people's reviews because I'm too lazy to describe it, I just wanted an excuse to rip on ""New Releases"". But really, this game is good, buy it.			"

												Its a nice twist on Tower Defense where you're the one racing through the level but its way too stressful to be considered fun.  There's just too much going on.  You have to micromanage every single turret to make sure they are facing the right direction, then there's a very small margin of error with your turret placements so one mistake could cost you the game, and you have to do all this while racing the clock to make your delivery.Plus most levels you have to play twice just to beat it once. 1st try is to see the enemy waves and the 2nd try is to be prepared for them.  And you'll need a 3rd attempt to get 5 stars on a level if you're that kind of person.			"

												An exciting and fast-paced inverse tower defense game. One of the best I've played.Many tower defense games have you set up towers and then watch as they do their thing while you have minimal interaction with them. This is quite different - every tower has one or more abilities that can be activated, and you will constantly be triggering abilities and building things during the game. There is no downtime. Personally, I find most TD games a little dull and found the frenetic gameplay of this one to be a refreshing relief. However, people who like more traditional TD games may be turned off by the micromanagement.Much of the technique involves memorizing the build order -- you play a mission once, lose, then try it again while knowing what will attack when.Normal mode was fun but a bit easy. Hard mode was poorly balanced - you gain resources so slowly that you need to replay missions a lot to unlock new ones and the grind is not fun.There is about 20 hours of content here, which will stretch out to about 30 if you want to get a perfect score in each level. It is well worth the purchase price.			"

												Space Run is an interesting Tower Defence game, with some slight differences. I'm not a huge fan of these games but I did enjoy this one enough that I felt like I got more than my money's worth even more so if you get it on sale.The premise being you perform missions for various corporations and individuals with some nice voice acting and the odd chuckle humour. Once the mission starts you build various turrets, shields and other devices to stop the onslaught of asteroids, fighters, and larger spaceships. Beyond that it's pretty standard Tower Defence game, kills things for points, use points to build more towers, complete map for upgrade points to buy upgraded towers.After a while however it did get repetitive doing some missions in order to get enough upgrade points to upgrade myself for future missions. Also some of the cargo loadout missions just ended up handicapping the play through since I'd have no idea which parts of the ship would be hardest hit during that mission on the first go, meaning I would just have to do it again knowing where the bad guys would attack. I would however say it’s worth a look in even if you’re not a fan of the genre and it something to just jump into for a few minutes of mindless fun, thumbs up!			"

												I have very mixed feelings about this game.And even though I do like it, I can sadly not recommend it in the end.When I started playing I was having a great time. I really loved the concept of freely being allowed to build my own space ship and then fly though a TD-like map.But the more I played the more I realized that you are surprisingly restricted, and later in the game you pretty much HAVE to build very close to this exact layout that the devs had in mind, and that just sucks...What makes everything even worse is that every mission you take has some sort of gameplay-modifier in the form of cargo/passengers that you HAVE to bring with you.They add more difficulty since some of them can for instance explode when destroyed which will destroy a part of your ship.That would not be a problem if it weren't for the fact that all these things that you carry with you are INCREDIBLY BULKY!They take up SO much space that you are always forced to sacrifice room that you would otherwise be able to fill with turrets and machines.This is so incredibly annoying since it forces you to actually sell, rebuild and replace most of your defences during the mission so that you can fight off different kinds of enemies and obstacles that you are facing at different times.I can only guess that the point of all this is to make the gameplay more difficult or dynamic, but honestly, this is what's ruining the game for me.I would have been perfectly happy to just be allowed to design my own space ship and fly through these spac-TD maps, but the missions quickly go from being fun, to fun and kinda challenging, to annoying as hell.

												June 14, 2014Ive played an hour long game, the combinations of towers, turrets and modular ships are endless. Its really a game changer for TD.Notable:- Two games in one, in the hanger, make strategic decisions on where to place cargo, where to place THRUSTERS! and choosing upgrades. Then once the ship is flying, place towers, re-orientate lasers.- Constantly juggling whether to go faster* by placing more thrusters or preparing for attacks from asteroids, pirates, and other container ships flying past.*There is a 5 star rating, the faster you get to the end, the more you are paid.- Intelligent towers. Eg. lasers cant be placed behind others. And thrusters can't be pointed at other towers or in the same direction as a laser/missile launcher.- Each hex has its own ""hit points"" when it runs out, the hex blows off the ship, taking the turret with it.- Asteroids, and other ships ram into the ship destroying turrets and the ship itself. Which kills off area's to place turrets, this is not scripted.- No bugs, no resolution problems except ""high resolution fonts"" setting in windows 7.			"

												This game is a strieght up tower defense set in space; there is a slight twist in needing to make your delivery time but that's not perticually difficult. I thought this might be more of a kind of hybrid game but it's completely and utterly a tower defense game. The game world moves around your ship which is nothing more then a cargo barge which you can build defenses on and you defend it from asteroids and pirates. You do not pilot the ship at all and the extent of control you have over it is how many engines you build to get to the stage end faster. You are ranked depending how well you protected your ships cargo and how fast you beat the stage.It is a very entertaining game and I definately enjoyed it, however it's really not that difficult and once you 5 star all the stages there's no further replay value.If you enjoy a good TD then I certenly recommend getting this game next time you see it on a steam sale.

												A really nice twist on the tower defense genre.  I'd love to see more customization with the turrets you can plop down, but it's a very good and challenging game.  The missions are fun.  The ""AI"" companion is funny, but very repetitive.  I'd like to see more audio files -- especially those that play at the end of the missions.The graphics are nice.The astrophysics upset me as an astrophysicist.I like that each level usually requires multiple playthroughs to get 5-stars -- even with upgraded parts.I recommend this game as a fun game you can play for 20-30 minutes at a time.

												Definately an interesting take on tower defense, and who doesn't like exploding spaceships? A wonderfully stressful experiance (somthing the lack of a tactical pause contributes to), though it does suffer a bit from the 'play the level once to know what's coming' problem. I think it could do some slightly randomized levels to get around that. Overall pretty enjoyable.			"

												Refreshing tower defense/tower defense like game. You are a space Runner, your job is to bring your cargo as fast and safe as possible to its destination. Replayability of missions is kinda high, cause you want to get the five stars. The game starts very slow and easy. Much time to learn the mechanics and tactics, and cause of the fact that missions are about 10 minutes long, it is no problem to restart them if something goes totally wrong on the way. Later in the game, the difficulty is getting higher.With money and reputation (stars) earned through the jobs you can unlock new moduls (weapons, shields, booster) and upgrade your old stuff. Just don't expect too much from the story. Cause there is not really one. There are some dialogues between and before missions, and the synchronization is good, but thats it. All in all very nice game and worth the money it costs. Pros: - fresh tower-defense design - starts easy but is getting harder later, so you can learn the mechanics pretty well - replayability of missions - different mission designs Cons: - no real story			"

												Looking for a fun short little game that's worth its weight in gold? Look no further. This game is fantastic. I'm not usually a fan of tower defence style games and this loosely fits that category but, this was exciting, challenging and rewarding. I found myself putting off playing triple A games until I could finish the game it was that good. It did take a little bit to get use to and sometimes things are happening that quickly it's hard to keep up but it made the victories even sweeter. The music, vocie acting and special effects were all done to a high quality and to be honest my only real issue with the game was replayability. Once you learnt the ship design and the flow of a mission you can 5 star it within one or two more attempts. Overall this game great and it you even partially enjoyed the video showing the game play I would encourage you to pick this up and try it for yourself. 9/10			"

												Amazing towerdefense game... If you stop to think about it, yea its a deploy turret, kill, earn, deploy type of game. BUT!! they added 1 thing that completly changed the classic boring tdf into something tough that baddies cry about. Movement... yes... with movement you have to constantly think about building thrusters to get a better time and with that, more money. Plus you can work with thrusters to slow the ship while giving you time to finish missions. Its actually sad to see people struggle so much with this game. But its awesome for hard core tdf fans.Brilliantly crafted and makes an old concept new and refreshing. Its not only graphics or intensity, but the whole customization/priority mechanic that will get you running more missions.Definetly a game i want to see a sequel or some dlcs to.Basicly the classic we like in a refreshingly new serving.

												Bought this game on a whim.  Not quite what I was expecting in some ways, but pleasantly surprised in others.  It's more of ""mobile tower defense"" title.  You don't really have any control over the ship and where it's going.  Your job is to position your guns, manage repairs, place weapon and shield, etc. to keep your cargo safe from Point A to Point B.  Sounds simple enough, doesn't it?  Got this one during one of those wonderful Steam sales and I don't regret the purchase.  If you're looking for something simple without a lot of complicated controls and playable with just your mouse, this one is a definite buy.  Sometimes I just like having something to play while I'm eating lunch. . . It definitely fits that bill.  :-)			"

												You are Pizza Hut in space!  No, oh right, you're just a delivery guy, delivering...stuff.  Lots of stuff, people, nuclear waste, cargo, whatever they toss your way.  The point is to get that stuff to its destination, fast and in one piece.  Easy right?  No.  Not so much.  Passtech has done a moderately decent job at taking a genre and making it fun.  You cant just drop a bunch  of guns and missiles and plow your way through, it actually takes some level of thought to get from point A to point B.  The genre is overcrowded and after awhile it gets tired, but this spin, like i said, is pretty fun.  So, in the spirit of hateful rants, here is what i hate about this game:You cannot zoom the camera.  Zoom would be nice, cuz, you know, it gets crowded.Your ship is a fixed point in the game, everything moves around it, which was annoyingThats it, thats all i can gripe about.  Its challenging, graphics are good, sound is...well there is always room for improvement there.  A few issues with the guns not responding, but overall a decent game for the price.  Keep in mind, it is still nothing more than tower defense.			"

												A very good tower defense game, Space Run manages to be pretty addictive. I keep coming back to see if I can do a run a little bit more efficently and squeeze out that last star on the rating.The basic idea is this: You're a space runner; someone who ferries cargo from point A to B. At the start, you place your cargo onto a ship comprised of empty tiles, and off you go. Along the way, you'll be attacked by pirates and you'll need to place shields, weapons, and power systems to survive your trip. You'll also need engines to get monetary bonuses for arriving quickly. Space on your ship can fill up quickly so you'll need to find that perfect balance depending on what your current needs are. It's very original and very well done. It reminds me of the top polished tower defense maps you see in the modding community for Blizzard RTSes.There are a couple of bad things...The default view being zoomed out so far that it's hard to see anything is one. I find myself having to hold down the zoom button frequently just to be able to see what I'm doing. It needs a toggle key. The other slightly annoying thing is the upgrade system. You can upgrade your towers with various powerful abilities, but sometimes it feels like you'll never be able to five star a mission until you get them.Still though, those are minor things and the game is well worth the money if you like tower defense.

												Great Game,good balancement for an atypical very good and funny tower defense.Managing turrets directly  means no dead-time and no boredom.This game is really frenetic and exciting and you also feel like you're really in charge of your starship.No luck factor only skill can get to you to the end of each voyage.Do a Mission upgrade your ship then redo it trying to obtain better results and to unblock better weapons and systems on your starship and thrust me some results can be obtainable only with advanced upgrades.the game is also really well balanced.Just one advice for new players ""tactical break"" is very very important and useful do it as soon as you begin each mission and pay attention to the lightning speed delivery indicators behind and to where your starship is.You have to bring cargo safe but also to be fast to get good results. Probably Best tower defense with Plant vs Zombies , far far better then Defense Grid.			"

												Highly addicting and an interesting take on the tower defense genre.  Gameplay was solid and enjoyable.  I had little difficulty five starring the missions.  I found that many of the various ""towers"" were either used little or not at all.  Still, the diversity is there so you can try different loadouts.  I pretty much stuck with the same emplacements throughout the whole game, only having to adjust it when a specific cargo got in the way of my usual layout.As you progress through the game you will unlock numerous upgrades and new emplacements which you can use on previously completed levels if you are having trouble.  A nice touch was that while in a mission you can see the various mission times mapped out as you travel (IE Normal, Lightspeed times) so you could see in real time how you are doing.  If you see yourself falling behind it is easy enough to allocate more engine power and fire up the afterburners to make up the time.All in all, a fun game.  If you're a fan of tower defense games and want to try something new check it out.			"

												For a person who loves the tower defense genre I enjoyed Space Run quite a bit, the building mechanics in tandeum with the time mechanics created a pretty compelling experience that I enjoyed playing the levels over again to get all the achievments in the game. It was definately fun for me and didn't fell like a chore like others might feel. As an indie game I found its polish on a technical level to be pretty impressive, but I still don't think its worth the full price of the game. This might be the cheapskate in me talking, but I suggest picking this game up during a sale. But even if you don't you will still be getting yourself a pretty solid experience that should keep you entertained from twelve to eighteen hours.You can read a bit more about the game as I break it down in this review: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2015/09/space-run.html.

												I've played this game to near completion, its very pretty and got some good graphics with a nice array of different enmies to blow up and lots of lovely towers to build and certainly unique twist requiring you to be able to deliver your cargo fast while in tact making it challenging to decide between building engines and building defense.But it really has no replay value and mostly its simply going through a mission and if you failed remembering where the enemies came from and unable to really complete some missions unless you've brought a certain tower not to mention incredibly annoying boss fights which puts all that money you spent on engines at risk and useless sometimes. Not to mention the voice over is actually very annoying and much too repetitive.Its dfeinetly not a Defense Grid, once you've played a missions there is no reason to play it again unless you need money for an upgrade you need to complete a mission. Honestly, while it might be enjoyable for a bit, you're best picking a different game when it comes down to it as there are other TD games that can offer much more, or get it when its on sale but I don't think its worth its current price.

												I have very mixed feelings about this game.And even though I do like it, I can sadly not recommend it in the end.When I started playing I was having a great time. I really loved the concept of freely being allowed to build my own space ship and then fly though a TD-like map.But the more I played the more I realized that you are surprisingly restricted, and later in the game you pretty much HAVE to build very close to this exact layout that the devs had in mind, and that just sucks...What makes everything even worse is that every mission you take has some sort of gameplay-modifier in the form of cargo/passengers that you HAVE to bring with you.They add more difficulty since some of them can for instance explode when destroyed which will destroy a part of your ship.That would not be a problem if it weren't for the fact that all these things that you carry with you are INCREDIBLY BULKY!They take up SO much space that you are always forced to sacrifice room that you would otherwise be able to fill with turrets and machines.This is so incredibly annoying since it forces you to actually sell, rebuild and replace most of your defences during the mission so that you can fight off different kinds of enemies and obstacles that you are facing at different times.I can only guess that the point of all this is to make the gameplay more difficult or dynamic, but honestly, this is what's ruining the game for me.I would have been perfectly happy to just be allowed to design my own space ship and fly through these spac-TD maps, but the missions quickly go from being fun, to fun and kinda challenging, to annoying as hell.

												Before today, I had never even heard of this game, but boy am I glad it came to Steam - otherwise I might have missed it completely.Anyone who is into tower defense type of games should take a serious look at this game. It has its own unique way of approaching the genre by making your 'base' a forward moving platform (a spaceship) with variable speed - depends how many and how good engines you've built on it - and a time limit that will determine the rewards you gain from each mission. The fast and frantic pace of the game is one of its good qualities, and even though I'm sure there are those who will be put off by it, I'd still recommend you give it a try. Yeah, it's faster than most other from-top-to-down view tower defense games, but trust me, you get used it.I also liked the comic book style look the game has. It fits with the humor thrown around by the characters in the game, who are each voiced by above average voice actors, in my honest opinion. The sounds in the game are familiar sci-fi laser blasts, explosions and whatnot you'd come to expect from a game where you fly around in space. The music is also very typical to the genre; by no means bad but neither are any of the pieces I've heard so far something I'd like to listen outside the game. Still, they fit with theme of the game well, and thus I'm forced to give them A- grade.All in all, game I'll recommend to anyone who likes tower defense type of games and who are looking into trying out something new and different for the genre!

												Space Run is an interesting take on the typical Tower Defense gameplay, and while I'm not a huge fan of these games I did enjoy this one enough that I felt like I got more than my money's worth (Note: I paid ~$5 but I do consider it worth $15 if you can't get it on sale).Instead of building towers on a stagnant map with a maze like path for lines of mobs to run through toward their goal, you build on a platform (your spaceship) which ""flies"" through space and you encounter asteroids, fighters, and larger spaceships.  Beyond that it's pretty standard Tower Defense fare, kills things for points, use points to build more towers, complete map for upgrade points to buy upgraded towers, rinse and repeat.This game also has fun little snippets of dialogue between missions, and good quality voice acting.  The graphics are decent, as is the UI, and there were no major bugs during my playtime (the worst things I had happen was it would occasionally glitch after resetting a map, but exitting out to the mission select and starting again always fixed it.)I had some issues with the game though.  For instance, I really didn't care for the tedium of being forced to repeat missions in order to get enough upgrade points to not gimp myself in future missions.  Nor did I like the cargo loadout part of the game, that just increaed the odds I would end up handicapping myself since I'd have no idea which parts of the ship would be hardest hit during that mission on the first playthrough.  It also seemed like a mistake to force the ""ship"" design on the player when in my opinion that should have been a big part of the upgrade system, do well, get a bigger ship, etc.  In that way the ""ship"" could have also been a persistent RPG element and made the game more interesting.Again though, that first half was a lot of fun, more than I have in most other games at the same price.

												I'm fond of this one. This might just be one of the best Defence games on the market, combining the genre with both puzzling, management and Space Sim. Imagine a tower defence game, but set on the lay-out of a hex-based spaceship traveling through space, beset by dangers of all kinds, from all sides. What greatly distinguishes from other defence games, is how compact and dynamic your defence is. Your entire ship needs to work as one and there are several modules that can boost, shoot, power, shield and add income to the affair, but need specific spots, angles and adjacency to pull it off. This adds a great deal of overlapping synergy, need for strategy and the feeling that your defence is an organic whole. Rather than a bunch of towers or units slowly whittling away at innumerable mobs, you really feel like you've carefully constructed a single entity - your ship - that can be carefully maintained to swat away at pesky enemies.Because your lean, mean fighting machine needs to be carefully maintained as a single whole that needs to remain whole, you'll frequently have to take specific actions at specific times. This can cause the game to get rather hectic, which is both a pro and a con. Frequently, the game will throw an amount of distress at you that can only be overcome by focussing your ship's entire effort towards the oncoming threat, by activating abilities, investing in upgrades, arranging firing angles; all things more than you'd have to in other defence games. The only way to manage this sort of frenzy, is to play it smart. Don't build 3 smaller shields or cannons that all need individual attention, when you could have just build a single, larger cannon or shield that could have done the job just as well, but would have required far less micromanagement. Sometimes however, even that isn't enough, simply because you couldn't have known what was comming. You'll be warned an enemy ship is arriving, but nothing could have prepared you for just what kinds of weapons it would carry or from what angle it would fire them from. When this happens, the game does tend to become a game of memory, where the only way you could have pulled off an encounter flawlessly, is because this is your second, or maybe even third run and you know how to prepare.This sort of trial and error can rightly be seen as a negative, but if you're the sort of player I am, you'll simply see it as a challenge. Having a bigger enemy come in for the third time, but on this run, your ship has been expertly designed to handle it without a scratch, can be very satisfying. The hectic hands-on approach and directly seeing how your actions are contributing to the battle, are rather thrilling. Like Hannibal Smith from the A-Team states: ""I love it when a Plan comes together.""On top of that, the production values of this product are just amazing for a defence game. There's solid voice acting and the writing - though hammy - is often worth a chuckle. The ship itself, the battle effects and the graphics are amazing. Rockets whiz by. The more engines you add to your ship, the faster the stars in the background blurr across the screen. Bigger components like the chaingun have a satisfying whir to them as the bolts rend through enemy ships. They blow up in a impressive explosion. The UI is smooth, comprehensible and Intuitive.It's a bite-sized game, none too long, but it's a satisfying snack. Reccomended!			"

												Amazing towerdefense game... If you stop to think about it, yea its a deploy turret, kill, earn, deploy type of game. BUT!! they added 1 thing that completly changed the classic boring tdf into something tough that baddies cry about. Movement... yes... with movement you have to constantly think about building thrusters to get a better time and with that, more money. Plus you can work with thrusters to slow the ship while giving you time to finish missions. Its actually sad to see people struggle so much with this game. But its awesome for hard core tdf fans.Brilliantly crafted and makes an old concept new and refreshing. Its not only graphics or intensity, but the whole customization/priority mechanic that will get you running more missions.Definetly a game i want to see a sequel or some dlcs to.Basicly the classic we like in a refreshingly new serving.

												Bought this game on a whim.  Not quite what I was expecting in some ways, but pleasantly surprised in others.  It's more of ""mobile tower defense"" title.  You don't really have any control over the ship and where it's going.  Your job is to position your guns, manage repairs, place weapon and shield, etc. to keep your cargo safe from Point A to Point B.  Sounds simple enough, doesn't it?  Got this one during one of those wonderful Steam sales and I don't regret the purchase.  If you're looking for something simple without a lot of complicated controls and playable with just your mouse, this one is a definite buy.  Sometimes I just like having something to play while I'm eating lunch. . . It definitely fits that bill.  :-)			"

												You are Pizza Hut in space!  No, oh right, you're just a delivery guy, delivering...stuff.  Lots of stuff, people, nuclear waste, cargo, whatever they toss your way.  The point is to get that stuff to its destination, fast and in one piece.  Easy right?  No.  Not so much.  Passtech has done a moderately decent job at taking a genre and making it fun.  You cant just drop a bunch  of guns and missiles and plow your way through, it actually takes some level of thought to get from point A to point B.  The genre is overcrowded and after awhile it gets tired, but this spin, like i said, is pretty fun.  So, in the spirit of hateful rants, here is what i hate about this game:You cannot zoom the camera.  Zoom would be nice, cuz, you know, it gets crowded.Your ship is a fixed point in the game, everything moves around it, which was annoyingThats it, thats all i can gripe about.  Its challenging, graphics are good, sound is...well there is always room for improvement there.  A few issues with the guns not responding, but overall a decent game for the price.  Keep in mind, it is still nothing more than tower defense.			"

												A very good tower defense game, Space Run manages to be pretty addictive. I keep coming back to see if I can do a run a little bit more efficently and squeeze out that last star on the rating.The basic idea is this: You're a space runner; someone who ferries cargo from point A to B. At the start, you place your cargo onto a ship comprised of empty tiles, and off you go. Along the way, you'll be attacked by pirates and you'll need to place shields, weapons, and power systems to survive your trip. You'll also need engines to get monetary bonuses for arriving quickly. Space on your ship can fill up quickly so you'll need to find that perfect balance depending on what your current needs are. It's very original and very well done. It reminds me of the top polished tower defense maps you see in the modding community for Blizzard RTSes.There are a couple of bad things...The default view being zoomed out so far that it's hard to see anything is one. I find myself having to hold down the zoom button frequently just to be able to see what I'm doing. It needs a toggle key. The other slightly annoying thing is the upgrade system. You can upgrade your towers with various powerful abilities, but sometimes it feels like you'll never be able to five star a mission until you get them.Still though, those are minor things and the game is well worth the money if you like tower defense.

												Great Game,good balancement for an atypical very good and funny tower defense.Managing turrets directly  means no dead-time and no boredom.This game is really frenetic and exciting and you also feel like you're really in charge of your starship.No luck factor only skill can get to you to the end of each voyage.Do a Mission upgrade your ship then redo it trying to obtain better results and to unblock better weapons and systems on your starship and thrust me some results can be obtainable only with advanced upgrades.the game is also really well balanced.Just one advice for new players ""tactical break"" is very very important and useful do it as soon as you begin each mission and pay attention to the lightning speed delivery indicators behind and to where your starship is.You have to bring cargo safe but also to be fast to get good results. Probably Best tower defense with Plant vs Zombies , far far better then Defense Grid.			"

												Was a little nervous at first, but I've found that this game is very well worth the money if you can get it on sale. Even at full price it's a good game. I found its blend of real time strategy and tower defense to be rewarding, if a bit difficult. I would recommend this to fans of either. Also, in regards to people saying they had game breaking issues in other reviews, I found that disabling steam overlay works wonders, and I haven't crashed once since my time playing. So overall, get this game if you can.			"

												Highly addicting and an interesting take on the tower defense genre.  Gameplay was solid and enjoyable.  I had little difficulty five starring the missions.  I found that many of the various ""towers"" were either used little or not at all.  Still, the diversity is there so you can try different loadouts.  I pretty much stuck with the same emplacements throughout the whole game, only having to adjust it when a specific cargo got in the way of my usual layout.As you progress through the game you will unlock numerous upgrades and new emplacements which you can use on previously completed levels if you are having trouble.  A nice touch was that while in a mission you can see the various mission times mapped out as you travel (IE Normal, Lightspeed times) so you could see in real time how you are doing.  If you see yourself falling behind it is easy enough to allocate more engine power and fire up the afterburners to make up the time.All in all, a fun game.

												Looking for a fun short little game that's worth its weight in gold? Look no further. This game is fantastic. I'm not usually a fan of tower defence style games and this loosely fits that category but, this was exciting, challenging and rewarding. I found myself putting off playing triple A games until I could finish the game it was that good. It did take a little bit to get use to and sometimes things are happening that quickly it's hard to keep up but it made the victories even sweeter. The music, vocie acting and special effects were all done to a high quality and to be honest my only real issue with the game was replayability. Once you learnt the ship design and the flow of a mission you can 5 star it within one or two more attempts. Overall this game great and it you even partially enjoyed the video showing the game play I would encourage you to pick this up and try it for yourself. 9/10			"

You can increase your speed by building more engines or power plants (which help boost your engines) to beat set speed goals. But while you're trying to fly your cargo to the other end, pirates and asteroids are in your way. So to stop them, you have to build weapons. Weapons only get a limited arc in which to attack, which means the first time you play a level you're building as a reaction to incoming threats. However after the first time you can build defences where the threats will be. Again, power plants can boost your weapons like they can for engines. So basically you're playing a tower defense game with you buliding the defenses on a platform. As far as tower defense goes, I've played a lot of better TD games. But with one has a few nice qualities to make it it's own thing and not just a rehash.The story is sort of bland, but the voices are decent (though some are, perhaps purposefully, a bit annoying). All in all, if you buy this on sale, you'll probably get the money worth. For the full price, you're taking a bit of a risk. I'll likely continue playing this game until I beat it.			"

												I havent played the game long.. but its been fun so far ;)fairly easy game play .. you got a ship with a hex based grid.. each level the grid is different and the enemys come at you in set patterns (wish it was kind of random.. as you can learn the levels fairly easily so far atleast)..you can place guns on the hexs some guns you can rotate once placed (with an upgrade).. some are fixed so you kind of need to be ready and know where the enemys are coming from.. you can of course sell what ever you place and put something else down.. but its at a fairly big loss ;)..anywayz go grab it and have some fun.. or wait till steam sales and buy it anyway			"

												I loved the idea but not the execution. The ship design should have been left to the player and I often felt like I would have made a better ship. I also would have liked a persistent ship design that I upgraded as the game went on, not just random♥♥♥♥♥♥ I didn't play long and wont likely return.			"

												Space Run is a very solid TD (Tower Defense) type with a twist title. I highly recomend it. I have enjoyed it very much and have no complaints about it at all. I find myself playing and replaying the same maps to unlock the upgrades before moving into the new maps because the game is quite hard at times. There is a small amount of micromanagement, there are multiple possible ways to complete maps. Planning, timing and strategy are a must... If you enjoy a good Tower Defense game, This title will not disapoint! You may be able to complete it before me, because I am still not able to myself.			"

												This is an interesting twist to the ""Tower-Defense"" type games. It's by no means a game where you'll play it non-stop for a couple weeks. It is however worthy of your purchase as it is a solid game with a unique approach to Tower-Defense.I personally wish that the developers had gone deeper with this game with some player vs player and other online gametypes as I feel it could have been really awesome with a few more additions.I recommed this game			"

												I really like tower denfense games, and when I saw the trailer I thought, wow, this game looks like fun.Well, sorry to tell you, but this game suc*s balls.negative points:-The game is extremely stressful because its super fast real-time tower building. Theres a huge number of people in the forums debating why the heck they didnt add a tactical pause button to issue commands.-Everything is extremely linear, you can repeat levels and the same enemies always come a the same time. So your task is actually to memorize the levels (due to lack of the pause button) to respond fast enough. Then repeat the same level over and over to farm money and upgrade your weapons. Otherwise you have no chance to survive the next levels due to the insane difficulty.this quickly becomes a boring chore, and there is no room for creativity or individual play styles, as each level kind of dictates how the ideal ship setup should look like. As one other reviewer mentioned, this is actually a puzzle game rather than a tower defense game. It's kind of like Tetris, instead of blocks you have to arrange your gun towers in a very fixed order to win the map.			"

												- There is no rewind or pause function for a Tower defense.  - It's a  trial and error memorization game. Screwed up from one small detail? Oh well back to the beginning.- Range of the weapons are horrible. There is always some BS blindside.- Trying to place the weapons are horrible to. It's like trying to put a ""square peg into a triangular hole.""-  There is no information about anything in the game is no help. Once again, trial and error in order to find out what the weapons and systems actually do.- When a cutscene plays, and asteroids are coming at you... your ship doesn't fight back, it takes heavy damage while the cutscene happens. Good job.This game has potential, but ultimately the game looks rushed. Frustrating game without the basic functions that suppose to seperate ""professional"" tower defense from the ones made in WCIII modes or flash.After the incident with the cut scene, I rage uninstalled the game.

												This game is great in its take on the Tower Defense genre (TD). It's attractive, well-balanced and incorporates elements from several similar genres to make for a new and different twist. I wish I could say that I loved every minute of it, but sadly I have stopped playing it after only two hours. See, during the awesome combat scenes, it gets hectic. Very hectic. Attacks of varying types from all different directions. And it happens in real time! But therein lies the problem: the entire game is in real-time. There is no ability to slow down or pause the action to adjust your ""towers"" to react to the current and upcoming threats. This games potential is fully and 100% lost on the lack of time-control. If it's possible to patch the game to add this functionality, Passtech Games must do it. Until then...I'm on to the next game!			"

												Fun and really well made, but give it a miss if you think this is a ship building strategy game. It's a puzzle game, plain and simple, where the penalty for not being able to see into the future is a drawn out and frustrating death as impossible waves of enemies tear you apart. On the upside you can grind early missions to upgrade your ship where possible, but most of the upgrades are locked behind reputation, which is built only by completing missions perfectly.More frustrating than fun, the novelty wears off after about 3 hours.

												To preface this, I won this in a giveaway...I really enjoyed this little title... I spent 21 hours or so playing it... I mean perfecting it.  I think it has a ton of potential to be a better game though.  The interface is a bit lacking at times... and it has the ascetic of a mobile game.  However, I don't think it would work too well on mobile.  The default controls were lack luster, but after I changed the hotkeys (which is great - keybinding in this day and age are a must) to WASD orientation with numbers it worked awesomely. There is a ton of trial and error here in this puzzle/placement game.  Overall I would highly recommend this if you enjoy Tower Defense and placement type games.			"

												The name of this game is disappointment. Don't get me wrong, I loved the game. I played it all the way through, and I keep trying to play it some more. The entire design and game concept is brilliant; hexagonally laid out ship designs that you mod and improve, and upgrade your mods. ...then they took that amazing design and flushed it down the toilet of structured levels and prefabricated ships. You don't get to build your own ship, you don't get to choose your own runs and missions for profit; each level is like a puzzle, they assign you the ship, and you have to figure out the configuration that will make it succeed. *sigh*, what a waste; this game could have been epic!

												How good is this game?  I don't regret buying during the summer sale, and... IT WASN'T ON SALE. ಠ▃ಠI'm tired of tower defense games but I enjoyed this one so much I've played it constantly.  I only have a few minor complaints, most of which could be easily fixed:- There's sometimes a bit of trial-and-error required to get 5 stars on boss missions because you don't know what direction the boss will attack from.  You have around 5 seconds of warning at most, during which time you'll potentially need to recycle a bunch of towers and then set new ones constructing.  If players had more like 10 seconds it would seem more fair I think.- [EDIT: The developer confirmed they're fixing this in a patch] The voice volume setting only affects menu voices, not the ones you hear while you're actually playing the game.  Since there are only a handful of different spoken lines, it can get annoying to hear your pilot say ""Yahoo!  ...I can't believe I just said that"" three times in a row on the same mission.- [EDIT: The developer confirmed they're fixing this in a patch] Cutscenes are unskippable.  Every time you launch your ship there's a 10-second cutscene and you'll be seeing it a lot.  There's also a 20-30 second cutscene before every boss battle.  Since you often need to repeat boss battles several times, it'll start to get on your nerves. - Tower balance could still use a little fine-tuning.  Rarely do you need the lighter versions of turrets once you have the stronger versions unlocked.  Some constructions and special abilities never seem to be useful or practical, while others seem much too powerful - for example, the heavy laser's Death Ray ability can one-shot pretty much any boss ship and only costs a tiny amount compared to how much you'll have saved by the end of a level.Overall though these are minor annoyances.  It's an excellent game for a very good price.  You'll get easily 20+ hours out of it if you want to 5-star every mission.			"

												As much as i want to like this game, since it offers a new take on tower defense, i just dont like how most upgrades have to be activated.  The battle are quick and i never use activated skills since im looking for damage and placing new weapons.  After playing over 10 missions, this is my major dislike in this game.  Another major problem is changing the direction of weapons to face new threats... I feel like that is a totally stupid in the far future where space ship travel thoughout the galaxy, after all even today warships have auto targeting systems. The guns should track automatically within the gun placement allows accordingly to your outer hull.  Missiles with a firing arc? that so lame, since missiles just home in on targets in any direction they are programed to hit.  This game just forces you to micro-manage everything to the point that your frantically working and not enjoying the game.			"

												Quick & Dirty Review: Excellent fun, 10-15 mins mini missions, tower/ship defence. Worth it.Slow & Clean Review: Space Run had a lot of similarities to a board game called Galaxy Trucker which I am a big fan of.So I was curious and managed to get it cheap (Thank you Special Deals) but if I had paid full price... it would have been worth it.Graphics: They are clean and decent for what you need. The 2D space setting makes it a bit weird but considering the gameplay it would be too difficult to add a real 3D element so your ship remains flat and it doesn't really need to be given that extra dimension.The laser, ion and missile effects are nice. Any system should be able to run this so it's nice knowing your MB's onboard GPU is what is needed.Sound/Music: The voice acting is enjoyable. It's not out of this world but it gives a really nice depth. The main character comes off likeable and his android 2IC has some great dialogue. Only issues is there isn't more. If they released a DLC with additional audio dialogue esp. for the wise-cracking android I'd buy it immediately.The music is decent for what you want but it does become repetitive but that's understandable given the music is often the cue for pirate attacks and can be a forewarning before you even detect astroids and other ships on your rader.Gameplay: It's fun. It doesn't give you any time to prepare and you basically need to build and de-construct on the fly. The missions run between 8-15 minutes with 10 being the average. There is no downside to losing which is both good and bad. Good because there is no real tutorial and sometimes you just don't know what to build until you've failed. And no one likes to lose credits, reputation or XP.Bad because there is no down side to dying, you are never really at risk and that means the equiv of having God mode/reset switch on the universe. I think if the pirate factions got upgrades or bonuses it would have shook things up a bit or at least a change to difficulty but all in all it's moderately difficult the first time and getting that 5th Star Rating can be quite difficult if you don't adapt your tactics.I think a survival mode or iron man mode would be a welcome for the hard core gamers out there.Overall: A fun enjoyable game that is great for when you just want to kill half a hour or need to de-stress from the day. I hope to see a true sequel and looking forward to what Space Run Galaxy might have to offer.Hope the review helped.			"

												If you're looking for a cheap, casual game I recommend you try this one. You are an intergalactic delivery man/ smuggler just trying to make your way through the galaxy. You get jobs, and finishing those unlock harder jobs. Its fun to replay these jobs later when you have more upgrades to try and get all the stars for it. You are judged by how much of the cargo you get to the point with, and how fast you get it there. you start out with basic modules, they take one space, and need no power to work. Eventually you will get parts that take lots of space, and need power to work, so you will have to plan out where you place weapons, generators, and defensive systems. Each system also has three upgrades, two active abilities, which take the same resource as building them. The third is a passive boost that happens when you give the system enough power. I just wish there was a pause feature so that you could build stuff and activate abilities without being overwhelmed from all of the enemies on screen.			"

												Yasuo and batman's Butler own a space freighter.This game is a tower defence.  But backwards and sideways.You build the towers on a pre-assembled ship, the loot you're protecting goes on the ship as well.The ship then flies (on rails) though the course where enemies will pop out and attack.Your job, should you choose to accept it, is firstly to use your guns and shields to protect your cargo at all costs.And secondly, to get the delivery quicker than all over delivery men for bragging rights.

												I actually feel bad not recommending this game.  If it was a star rating it would be a 3 out fo 5 for me.  The game is a fun twist on the tower defense...unfortunately, it seems it has a very narrow ""win zone"", in that if you don't run through the levels many times and then optimize in one or two specific build orders you will not do well.  One of the things I use to judge a game is how fast I feel like just finding the youtube video walkthru to just get thru the level that feels like work.  This happened fairly quickly in this game for me.  In addition, the action is fast-paced and becomes like a FPS click-fest pretty quickly in some levels. Anyway.  Great idea.  Fun dialog and ""story"".  Poor execution.  So, to sum up:  Creative and innovative, but it stumbles in execution.  Compare to Defense Grid for a well-designed ""multiple ways to win"" tower defense game.  I rarely feel like that game is ""playing me"" like I do with this one.			"

												This game had so much potential for me.  It boils down to memorizing and grinding though.If you want 5 stars to progress there is no freedom in how you will do this.  Maybe I'm spoiled by FTL, but a pause feature would have been greatly appreciated.  At some point you're going to realize you can't keep up with what's going on regardless of how well you can hotkey, one misclick and you're going to have to waste another 5-10 minutes.I really liked it initially, but once I realized everything I wrote up above I can't really recommend it.  I think the game would have been vastly enjoyable without the mission timer, there's so many cool combinations of ships I'd love to try if only the game had such flexibility.Also, I think it would have been much a better design choice to have the ship templates be purchasable, so you could at least choose which ship layout you'd like.

												Seem pretty like a pretty cool twist on a tower defense game at first.But you quickly find out this game turn into a memorization puzzle.Few if any different ways to beat a level with all 5 stars unless you built in a specific orderNo you can not pick your ship build tiles. Every mission just pops a pre designed ship down for you.So you just add towers in a memorized manner to win.Stick with Defense Grid series, much better experience and allows you the freedom to change up your tower strategy to win. Over all I rate this game at $3.  If its selling for more, don't waste your time.			"

												At first this was a good game.  difficult, but workable with patience and some planning... and a number of restarts.But then it decides to put unmovable 'cargo' in your way and force you to have to leave a clear path from those to your command bridge... making it impossible to load on the equipment you need to actually survive the level intact.You can make it through, just not with a 5 star completion, which you need in order to fully complete the game.I extremely despise games that deliberately set you up to fail, then penalizes you for failing.It was almost an appropriately challenging game, then they shot the difficulty curve up way too high.

												This is one of those games that is hard to say ""yes"" or ""no"" for. It's an ""okay"" game. if you get it on sale like I did you won't feel ripped off, but you won't be eager to return either. I did not find any bugs and everything ran smoothly, so it's not that they rushed it and cut corners to make money off of it quick, but it also doesn't feel complete to me. After unlocking everything there's nothing to do with your currency that you win at the end of each mission, so it just sits there. Also you get a specific size/shape of ship for each mission that you build onto. That would be fine but those ships are a bit too small for all but the last mission, so you end up feeling very restricted. I went back to the first missions after unlocking everything thinking it would be fun to go in and overkill it, but I couldn't. The game is more of a puzzle than anything else. For most missions you ""have"" to start in a set pattern, so it's a bit dull when you realize you have to put this here, that there, then do this, now add that...The game would have been much better if you were allowed to spend some of that extra, now useless, currency to add more hex's onto each ship, giving you a larger platform to build on. That would give it alot of replay value.			"

												Space Runner is more about memorizing every single encounter than it is about tower defense, which is unfortunate because if the game featured randomized levels I would probably still be playing it. The other things the developers got horribly wrong are the boss fights that cause you to lose your speed bonus, forcing you to replay the exact same map over and over until you figure out the right combination of turrets (and placement timing) and providing turrets that aren't worth investing in. The strange thing is that even though you might be able to finish the map faster, you will still fight the same amount of enemies. Don't play this game if you hate spamming keys, by the way. First few levels might seem like a breeze but at some point the need to press more buttons than you'd like comes in to play.			"

												So as to not say too much of what other reviewers have said, the building needed in this game to succeed is too fast paced without sufficient gaps between attack ""waves"" to build up properly. You're having to manage temporary power-ups for each individual turret/structure, changing the aiming degree of each laser turret, one by one, repairing each damaged structure, moving your mouse around to collect scrap for constructing, selling individual structures you won't be able to repair in time, picking a permanent aiming degree for missle launchers while hovering your mouse over others to see which direction they're angled to make sure you have coverage in all directions, trying to keep adding more thrusters because you have to go faster to get enough credits and reputation points to get better unlocks, and moving individual turrets' aim because those turrets are blocking -other- turrets from aiming.It's a micromanagement nightmare. Anyone who takes pride in their twitch skills or who is good at micromanaging or just playing stuff like Starcraft online and being fast and skilled might get a kick out of this game. However, if you're kinda ADD, OCD, or just awful at micromanagement in games, then it's very possible you may not enjoy this game. It's not an awful game, but it certainly is not a game for me or others who lack the ability to do well micromanaging in games. I did not enjoy the game and cannot recommend it to others who lack similar talent/skill for playing it.			"

												Incredible gameNo bugs, flawless audio, clever mechanics and a reasonable difficulty if you want to 5 star each mission.Space Run is a rolling tower defense where you build on a hex based ship with all the usual turrets that you could expect from any TD. Enemies and also environmental hazards periodically spawn from any direction (scripted) rather than just an awkward path, which means for some of the tougher levels you actually need to try a few times to get the feel of the rapidly changing field.At times the action can be frantic as you balance the ships outgoing damage and weapon facings while managing the repairs and protection of your sometimes volatile cargo. All this while trying to maintain velocity to hit the high scores and get extra credit for upgrades.The upgrade system itself is simple and clear with early option still retaining value in the later missions as the more powerful items usually come at a balancing cost or are more specialized.Honestly I wouldn't change a thing in this game worth the price of admission even at twice the price.

												It's a good game, the premise is good. Efficiently spacing modules and finding room for cargo is fun, easy to play in bursts, and it doesn't overstay its welcome. Having to balance spending on engines and offensive equipment is another interesting mechanic. The only problems I have with the game is that shields over the first tier are pretty useless, I've used the T2 shield once to any really effect, it's better just to have overwhelming firepower instead of protection, that being said building  as many gattling lasers as you can fit is usually the best choice. Another thing I felt was a little weird is that enemies always come from the same direction on each stage, so the game feels a little more like a puzzle game in that reguard, rather than building a balanced spaceship, You'll often have to restart the stage once you find out what direction the 'boss' spaceship comes from.I'd definitely like to see a sequel with new mechanics, and rebalanced modules.

												It's a cool game and I'll put a thumbs up on it but I didn't enjoy it myself. Because of, solely, that the game demands quick mouse/hotkey action. Add ""pause to do things"" and we've got a stellar game(pun intended).Every single structure in the game has several abilities to be used strategically. And, one of the cardinal no-nos of TD games, mouse over the money to pick it up. Every level also demands a fast finish time to unlock further tech.So, while there's thinking and strategy to be done, the challenge is just being fast.Solid game, but not for me.			"

												Its fun..... but alot of effort for a TD, constantly reorienting turrets, needing to replay missions over and over until you learn every pattern so you don't build the wrong turret facing the wrong direction. You also get alot of useless things you have to put on your ship that take up space and will even drain your power in some instances forcing you to build in stupid patterns and waste slots on power cores, it makes the ship look like a slop pile.One mission I had over 1k resorces at one point but stuff was flying around me so much I could not build fast enough (no pause feature).The fact that you have to not only build turrets but engines as well to try and get to your location fast enough can be a pain, slot management has made me replay too many missions far too many times because of not knowing which direction what was going to come after me.There is no ""meh"" option for recommending this, so I have to put yes, but honestly its fun to a point, but very frustrating at the end of the day. If you want alot of challenge in pointing your turrets in a direction, and the nessissity of constant reorientation and snap decisions in placing turrets while being overwhelmed this is a good TD, however, breaks are few and far between especially in the late stages. My suggestion, build a small amount of turrets on the outer ring, then spam missles, throw a shield in every now and then and pray a boss lines up with your missles.			"

												Great tower defence game, solid graphics, nice mechanics and hilarious voice acting. They guy voicing Buck Mann is the same that gives voice to James Raynor in Starcraft 2, which is nice.It is not a game to spend 200 hours on it, but getting all the stars in all the deliveries will give you some headaches if you are in for the full star achievement.Good to chill out and just kill pirates. The main problem I found is that since the games are scripted, the first run you are most of the time running against time, but the second one is piece of cake if you had noted where and when the bad guys attack.

												A fun and challenging tower defense style game based on hexagonal tiles. This makes placement of towers and items difficult but victory even sweeter.You are forced to balance cargo safety with offence/defence as well as trying to get a delivery under a certain time frame. Not an easy task.As you progress you earn points in rank (or fame) and money per mission. These can all be replayed to full completion out of a rank of 5. This in turn unlocks more weapons/sub-systems should you spend the money on them. I found most of these to be a meaningful path of progression, although some I still have not used to this day as I found them counteractive to how I like to play. This should not be taken as being a negetive, this game can be played several ways.It has a really ham style approach to humor, but this works out well. It never takes itself seriously and you should get a couple of chuckles from the corny jokes and horrible puns. Voice acting is really sound for this genre although some times you will find the text not lining up with the voice component.Weapons are very novel in approach. All have at least two modes of fire, which will force you to think not only about placement but of what they can do to what. Missle turrets will not attack small craft for instance, but its secondary will kill off an area of effect. Another cannon can be rotated if it has a direction available on the hex grid, but can also fire in rapid fire on cast and locked into one posistion for a time.If you like learning missions and micro managing a few items with solid graphics/sound/gameplay in the turret defence genre, this game is for you. Full price or on sale you won't regret this.			"

												This is a very nice approach for a tower defense game. for each mission you get a different ship (pattern of available fields to place items). An item can be cargo (you need to place a given amount per mission), attack towers, defense towers and utility towers. Once you placed your cargo the mission starts. The map starts moving around you == your are flying to your destination. You build and change your tower layout and change settings of the towers throughout the mission, while different types of enemy ships or asteroids are heading towards you. You destroy them and collect points, which you can use to build more towers or enable special functions of your towers.It starts easy enough and accomplishes to bring in new towers and cargo, while not overwhelming the player. But also without boring him or her to death. I like how you can use multiple approaches that all lead to success.The missions do not change, so if you play one mission again and again, you will know what enemy will come next, even before it shows up on your radar.My only fear is, that it has only a fixed amount of levels and afterwards you are done. But at the moment I am still struggeling to manage the last couple of levels. Update: I am at 100% missions and 100% achievements on medium difficulty after 34 hours. But as I said, I really like this tower-defense approach and I think I made a good decision buying this game.First things that come to my mind:+ The steam achievements are connected to reasonable events.-  Before each level starts, you set up your ship. It would be nice if there was a free-build mode to see what tower-cargo-combination will fit on the ship.I really like this concept and I want to see more games like this.			"

												A whole lotta fun!This game goes beyond standard tower defense in a good way. Instead of sitting in one spot and placing towers and letting enemies follow a path, you move and enemies come to you! This means you have to be careful about placement of offensive and defensive modules, as they can come from anywhere. There is radar, so you have a heads up where they're going to be. You command your ship, and decide what modules would benefit the situation. However it's more fun than that, as you're in a real Space Battle. Over time, you are stronger, and the enemies as well. Be sure to get upgrades, as they're necessary and many come with fantastic offensive and defensive features, changing the outcome of many situations.In the beginning, I was not good at this game. Then I tried different strategies and found a few that work more often than not. If you're having trouble, you can instantly restart the map and choose a different course of action. Use your rewards to get upgrades, and you can revisit past levels and get more stars and money, and continue to invest in yourself.My tips for this game are place your cargo in the center of your ship, but not jumbled together as you'll likely want to place modules in-between them. Get upgrades to help with tricky situations, and use them. The space battles become very intense, and extremely fun to the point I played them over and over, it is exhilerating!This is by far the best tower defense game I've played, and I reccomend it highly. Here's hoping for a sequel! "

												This is a great tower defense variation. By way of comparison -- I didn't enjoy it quite as much as Defense Grid, but it was more fun than DG2.I found myself compelled to play at least until I'd survived every run, but I don't feel the need to unlock every upgrade, achievement, or to eke out perfect scores on every run.There is some surprising depth to the game as you acquire new offensive, defensive and engineering upgrades and learn how best to use them together.One tip: don't engage hyperdrive in any runs that include the words ""rocky"" or ""asteroid"" in their names.

												Decent voice acting, bare bones story that provides structure to the gameplay, but never strived to be any more than that. Game play is amusing, there is a decent difficulty curve you can partially diffuse by repeating some older missions for cash. Its a bit annoying that one level every enemy attacks from one direction, the next from all sides, and the one after only from the north. while the game never gives any indication. Especially vexing if the boss turns up from a blind angle not yet attacked before.Nothing that ruins gameplay however.			"

												I would like to say first off that I loved the game, and would wholeheartedly recommend to any Tower Defense fans. Now I want to address some of the common complaints.First: Micro-Management. Many people complain about not being able to keep up with the need to micro-manage their turret orientation. There are really only 3 turrets that change direction and one of those works only as a toggle on way or another. My only suggestion about this is to stop using the basic turret (and the ion) altogether. Except in very specific circumstances, the second tier laser is more powerful than the same three tier ones that it costs to build one and leaves you one extra space on your ship for something else. It is also much easier to micro manage than the tier one since all you need is one press of the hotkey. So use the tier 2, and if you don’t have the tier 2 yet be patient better solutions are coming your way soon.Next, a pause button. While be nice to a have pause button as part of a lower difficulty setting, I don’t really think it is necessary. If you take my earlier advice about the main turrets, that will reduce the actions per minuet needed to keep up. As for repairing, try using the second and third tier generators when you get them. They both have an option for repairing the whole ship at once (and it is often cheaper too, if you have taken some heavy damage). And of course, learn your hotkeys.Lastly, memorization. Another complaint is that the only way to win is through memorization. While this is mostly true, since the ship layouts can be pretty restrictive, having too much randomization in the levels would make the difficulty change significantly depending on luck. Also, not to brag too much but I managed to five star many of the (non-boss battle) levels in the 80 to 130 rep range of the game on the first try. It is possible you just have to not panic, analyze your ship for good weapon placement possibilities, and keep some tier 2 and 3 missiles around to use their targeted attacks.In short, I liked it. Most of the complaints about the game are indeed valid, but are compensated for later, once you get deeper into the game.			"

												Space run is a really good game that really thread on the fringes of the tower defense genre without overstepping it. In simplest terms you build towers to protect your core, how space run differs is your core isn't at the end of a corridor it's on the middle of the map and enemies attack it from all directions. Another huge difference is you don't fend off feeble hordes of mobs but instead other ships that use the same towers you do.Gameplay wise space run has a very good mixture of action and strategy. Towers in this game don't have permanent upgrades but instead short time boosts. You can also rotate or change modes of the turrets, when you combine all these you get a very hectic gameplay that requires you to do a lot of apm in order to survive. There is also a tech tree where you can upgrades towers permanently with a resource you get by completing levels.There is wide selection of towers that really enable you to mix things up. Shields, power buildings and defensive buildings play a very important role and you have to find a balance between defense and offense to beat the levels.Game does come with annoyances though. Your android buddy keeps making stupid remarks which were intended to be ""so bad that it's good"" which simply end up being bad and annoying you. Which is exacerbated by the fact like he has like 4 lines of dialogue and keeps repeating them. There are pointless cutscenes, that are unskipable, which are just camera rotating around your ship for 15 seconds and takes away all control from you. But perhaps the worst of it is the fact that you have almost no chance of recovery once you slip up in a level. For example game tells you an asteroid is approaching from behind, you build 2 towers to fend it off, asteroid comes and it turns out your 2 towers weren't enough, it hits your ship destroying 25% of it. Now you have to restart the level because you can't beat the level and there are no check points, when you restart the level you just repeat everything you previous did before the asteroid at the same pace because you can't speed up the game. Because of these mechanics levels turn into: play for 3 minutes, die, restart, get to minute 5 , die restart, get to minute 7 die ...  Another gripe of mine is that there is no endless/survival mode which i believe would have been really fun. But despite everything space run is a great tower defense game if you keep an open mind and it's very well worth it's full price.			"

												Not for those quick-tempered people; a bit of trial-and-error involved, and please learn from your mistakes. This is basically a tower defense game, as Steam categorised, and yet you may expect some SF actions, too. In my opinion, this game is more like a cheap-yet-well-fermented wine; you would not expect fancy CGs or killer plots, and you are right, this game does not have those. You may simply start this game light-heartedly, then face some frustrations, doing many restarts in some levels. Then a bit of creativity and planning will let you finish this somewhat short game, with a somewhat lame ending. In other words, at first, you just want to chill out with this casual-looking game, then you face some moderate challenges, getting slightly annoyed; after several hours of frustration, you might start to think this is fun, and the fun does not last long. A good game, not good enough to start a franchise, or allow Steam to harvest millions of dollars, yet good enough.			"

												Awesome game. Perhaps the funnest tower defense formula I've ever played, the whole ship construction thing works beautifully and the speed delivery mechanic naturally caters to all skill levels while giving it replayability. So, if you're looking for a challenge, you can load up with engines and shoot for ""lightspeed delivery"" speed or even far past it, pushing your micromanagement and your APM to the limit (yes, it can get very frantic - you can't pause or *slow). Sadly though, the game lacks a leaderboard for this.Also, the levels don't change (or at least that I know of) so each one can be played over and over again until you learn the timings of where and when things happen.*There is an ability in the game that will allow you to slow down time for you to build, at a cost.

It works quite well and has a good average mission time, with very little unfairness. Some of the modules I never found use for, or they didnt seem to have a commesuate usage - but overall the game is quite solid for balancing out the module value.... though you will basically never use the base laser cannon once you're able to build the dual laser cannons which are great for the rest of the game. (with 1-2 exceptions where they're all you can place)For the other modules though you'll probably use them all for the duration of the game, which is definately saying something.So yeah, give it a shot, you'll likely not be dissapointed.

												Space Run has been quite an adventure for me. I spent 22 hours on this game and I finally beat it, 100% with all achievements.I encourage everyone to play this with that intent; it is very possible to 100%. Getting all 150 reputation points is how I felt accomplished, and it adds to the game. First 2 stars are for arriving with all the cargo intact, next 3 stars are given for how fast you deliver the product. (It is a delivery game) in order to get all 5 stars, you have to be tactical, witty and plan your every move. It is well made and very well balanced. The entire game has 3 types of modules (Offensive/Defensive/Utility) and 6 modules within each type. The best part is they all have a purpose and work very well to fend against all the dangers you will meet. Do not be afraid to experiment, this game encourages you to try different methods and layouts. Test new purchasable modules and tinker with their abilities. The main thing you should learn to do is space management, since it is so limited, pre-planning will allow for less headaches midway through the run. You may see many people complaining about micromanagement and constant re-orienting weapons, just ignore them. They aren’t worthy of this game. They are more likely to have quit and wrote a poor review before they had given the game a real chance to shine. What they are talking about is the first laser cannon provided to you, has limited FOV and requires constant management by the user by changing its direction of aim. Fret not my fellow space runners; less than 15% into the game I had already retired it. All the other modules don’t even have the ability to re-orient, once you placed it, it will only aim in one direction and it will cover much more area as well. As for others who wish that there was a pause button, personally I also wish it had one, however it doesn’t break the game. I feel like it is added tension which is a plus if you see it that way. There is no pause button in real life, if you make a mistake learn from it.It is graphically beautiful and it really is a great game.I felt so proud of my creations that I screenshot every ship that I liked. There is also plenty of variety for this game, you work for 5 different companies, each of which asks you to haul diverse material, and each of which has different properties and characteristics. From plain old boring creates, nuclear devices, humans which want a great view, to alien artifacts that mess with your equipment, they all bring something different to the table. Each mission also provides different ship layouts, no two are alike and each one brings a unique experience.For the retail selling price of $15 I highly recommend this game. It is an absolute gem.  I can’t wait for a sequel or additional DLC, maybe even user content?			"

												Space Run is an excellent indie title. I must admit, from the screen captures I was a bit sceptical but I took the plunge and purchased on the strength of other reviews. I can add my voice to the chorus and say, just buy this its excellent fun and very well polished.There is plenty of replay value and more than one way to complete a mission, you can always return to a mission after getting more equipment if you don't get a top score on your first run. It's fast paced and makes you think on your feet. Although the graphics don't look fantastic in the screen captures; in game they are surprisingly detailed and the whole art style just works. There is plenty of tongue in cheek corny humour to keep you amused and the sound effects are also very fitting.I have found the game to be a very stable and very well polished, bug free title. I genuinely can't level any serious criticism against the game and have thoroughly enjoyed every minute of playing it. Along with 'Don't Starve' this is one of the best Indie games I have ever purchased.			"

												I bought this because it was tagged as tower defence. If you are looking for a good tower defence game this ain't it. Try DG2. It's more of a top down space shooter/build game. It would be interesting if the game mechanics weren't so lousy. Most of the weapons require you to aim them or to otherwise control them to gain the use of a special feature while at the same being attacked from 4 corners. It's just too unwiedly trying to redirect weapons, repair, build and turn on shields at the same time. It also has no pause or slow speed. The build components are odd shapes and you have to sit there and try and figure out how to fit them in and rotate them to direct fire or effects all the time you are being attacked. Just one difference like more build credits to start, a slow speed or uniform hexes would have made this game enjoyable.			"

												Space Run has been quite an adventure for me. I spent 22 hours on this game and I finally beat it, 100% with all achievements.I encourage everyone to play this with that intent; it is very possible to 100%. Getting all 150 reputation points is how I felt accomplished, and it adds to the game. First 2 stars are for arriving with all the cargo intact, next 3 stars are given for how fast you deliver the product. (It is a delivery game) in order to get all 5 stars, you have to be tactical, witty and plan your every move. It is well made and very well balanced. The entire game has 3 types of modules (Offensive/Defensive/Utility) and 6 modules within each type. The best part is they all have a purpose and work very well to fend against all the dangers you will meet. Do not be afraid to experiment, this game encourages you to try different methods and layouts. Test new purchasable modules and tinker with their abilities. The main thing you should learn to do is space management, since it is so limited, pre-planning will allow for less headaches midway through the run. You may see many people complaining about micromanagement and constant re-orienting weapons, just ignore them. They aren’t worthy of this game. They are more likely to have quit and wrote a poor review before they had given the game a real chance to shine. What they are talking about is the first laser cannon provided to you, has limited FOV and requires constant management by the user by changing its direction of aim. Fret not my fellow space runners; less than 15% into the game I had already retired it. All the other modules don’t even have the ability to re-orient, once you placed it, it will only aim in one direction and it will cover much more area as well. As for others who wish that there was a pause button, personally I also wish it had one, however it doesn’t break the game. I feel like it is added tension which is a plus if you see it that way. There is no pause button in real life, if you make a mistake learn from it.It is graphically beautiful and it really is a great game.I felt so proud of my creations that I screenshot every ship that I liked. There is also plenty of variety for this game, you work for 5 different companies, each of which asks you to haul diverse material, and each of which has different properties and characteristics. From plain old boring creates, nuclear devices, humans which want a great view, to alien artifacts that mess with your equipment, they all bring something different to the table. Each mission also provides different ship layouts, no two are alike and each one brings a unique experience.For the retail selling price of $15 I highly recommend this game. It is an absolute gem.  I can’t wait for a sequel or additional DLC, maybe even user content?			"

												Unique tower defense with a fun campy storyline.Unlike most tower defense games this one has a bit of twitch gameplay to it. You need to respond in real time to incoming threats and build/turn towers.You can pause to think (ESC), but you can't build while paused. It's an intentional part of the difficulty. Not that it's really that hard, I had 100% achievements after a bit of practice.Not much else to say. I really enjoyed this game and I'm now spending even more time with the sequel.			"

												I want to like this game, I really do.  But with the ammount of micromanagement involved in some of the tower placement/re-orientation mid battle I really wish the game had a pause button where you could tweak your ship.  I know this is a hot button issue on the forums and I am not going to rehash it all, but the dev's have stated that they dont want to put this function in and my preferance would be to have that ability in the game.  It seems foolish on the part of the devs to not give people the option.   Fix this one thing and I would probably enjoy this game enough to change my verdict, but for now, no recomendation...			"

												It should be a good game. It has everything I like: tower defense, modular ship building, upgrades. Yet I can't warm to it. I can't get into it. It's just missing something.The most obvious thing I can think of is the fact that there is way too much micro-management. You can't simply place your guns (towers). They HAVE to be managed or you will fail the level. That just isn't fun for me. Most of the upgrades just lead to more micro-managing.			"

It's not as simple as tower defence, you have modules to protect, asteroids to avoid (well... blow up!)The game does not get boring easily -which is one of the reasons I hated PvZ- Each mission is different from the last, and there is no ""standard build"" as the placement area for your spaceship changes each time, forcing you to adapt.I have not had this all that long but so far it is my 2nd favourite Tower defence game, right after bloons!

It has following characteristics: 50% is about building towers and strategy of building towers 50% is about management of towers (using their abilities in right time) it doesn't have a path in traditional sense about TD enemies do come in predictable way (fly-path, directions)Huge pros for me are funny chats with recorded human voice "

												united postal service. in space. with guns. hell yeah!i totally loved playing this one.if you like to manage, optimize and refine your tactics while your guns blast away at pirates and asteroids till they glow white then this is THE game for you!however at first you are probably going to suffer a little. i know i did.you have no idea what to do or what to expect. the game mechanics are new and you don't have access to upgrades or better units yet. but that will change and you will improve quickly.you can't just build a flying bunker with one tiny engine or you will be late and therefore not get the full reward.at the same time you have to keep your cargo safe from pirates and asteroids so you can't just build engines all over the place.for every mission you get a different ship layout consisting of hex cells. you use these cells to build units and obviously to store your cargo. everything else is up to you. engines, guns, shields and generators need space to build. higher level stuff performs better but takes up more space and usually needs a specific formation of hex cells. and costs more of course. so it's up to you to optimize your placement of units and combine them in the best way possible to get your cargo to its destination quickly and in one piece.and as soon as you get into this game you realize just how many ways there are to combine and optimize your units and their special abilities to max effect while reducing building costs and not wasting a single hex cell on your ship.it's truely awesome.even after 21 hours i could keep playing this game forever. but you know how it is.suddenly a wild steam sale appears and you aren't even finished with half the stuff you bought last sale.sooner or later you just have to make room for something new.

												This game is fun two ways:Its a lot of fun just to put a bunch of modules on your ship and try and complete the runs. The management of your turret positions and power ups keeps you busy, but its not an insane click fest so folks with less coordination can enjoy it.It is also not so easy to get five stars (or even four) on the levels beyond the basic ones. You really have to plan your strategy: which turrets will you use, how to position them (space on the ships is limited, and often taken up by bulky or inconvenient cargo), and managing your power ups so you have 'nuts' (money) when you need them.It does seem that you can replay levels endlessly, which allows the player to max out every turret. It might be nice if this were limited, forcing players to choose a strategy (offense or defense) and run with it.Worth every bit of the $10-ish it cost. I hope it makes its way to iPad. It would quickly become a favorite!			"

												As mentioned in other reviews, it's a tower defense game but the viewpoint is flipped.  Instead of the enemies coming to you across a map, you move across the map and run into enemies.  You can build varying turrets and activate temporary powers (like a speed boost or increased firing rates).My main complaint is it's heavily micromanaging-clicky in a Starcraft kind of way. You need to build, sell, and repair parts of your ship, activate temporary effects, and reposition turrets to point at enemies. Difficulty ramps up in the game by just throwing more stuff at you and so you have to click faster and faster, as well as adding more layers to micromanage. I never liked this in Starcraft and still don't like it here, but if you like this sort of thing you may be right at home. If the game had a pause button so it was more about planning and less about click speed I would probaly enjoy it a lot more.It's kind of a step backwards in tower defense evolution when you think about it. The entire tower defense genre came from RTS games as a way to simplify micromanagement into a streamlined experience. Now Space Run puts it all back in and that's not a good thing.However, the game does some cool things which makes it a decent 'check it out on sale game'. I applaud them for trying something new with the tower defense formula. The RPG-lite elements is a great way to keep the game interesting as you progress through the story. The 'story', while minimal, is a nice layer to add to the game that many arcade games just ignore entirely.  I don't regret buying it, but I got it on sale.			"

What the hell?You don't really get a chance to plan and strategize and you end up feeling frustrated.			"

												Disappointed.  The game is really well made, but the challenge style leaves me frustrated.  Most games of this type give you the basics, then fold in more options which help refine your strategies as you progress.  You build your understanding of the game and develop layered strategies to overcome new challenges.Each level in this game felt more restricted, like I had less and less to work with. New tower options seemed no better than the options I already had.  Increased power, balanced by increased bulk and power requirements, but nothing new with regard to functionality.I really wanted to like this game, I think the concept is great, but the level design was not my cup of tea.

												5.5 out of 10.  Barely worth recommending.The enjoyment is in figuring out which weapons are worthwhile and which ones are red herrings.  There might be multiple builds that work.  I don't spend too much time pointing things, but that's a repeated complaint that the game doesn't pause and it becomes very frantic.  I stopped playing for years and just tried again.   It's not a bad little game.  But it does get tedious after a while.All the levels are canned, all the timing is fixed.  Once you figure out a level there's not much challenge other than trying other builds.  If you play long enough every level becomes easier as upgrades can be unlocked with enough play.And yes it is a tower defense, but the theme AND the puzzle of fitting components on the ship are nice features.The audio control is inconsistent, so you're stuck listening the robot say the same thing unless you turn off sound effects, rather than voice.

The progression seems to be very short lived.It's not a bad game don't get me wrong, but there are other tower defense games I would rather invest my time in.If steam allowed for neutral rating it would get just that, but since steam doesn't allow that it's a no.

												Starts off fun but becomes frustrating and annoying.  There is no general strategy to this game.  If you are good at tower defense that may not help.  To do well, you have to play the levels a couple times to figure out what to expect.  Sometimes you want shields instead of guns, for example, but there is no way of knowing that until you play.  This also effects ship layout before the mission starts.  The more powerful weapons only shoot in one direction so you better know where the biggest threat is coming from otherwise you end up wasting your building currency.  Mistakes are very unforgiving.

												tl;dr: Too much micromanagement.I like tower defenses and this one has a very good idea: instead of monsters running through your maze, your platform (spaceship) moves through enemies.When you place your tower, you have to give them a facing, i.e. this tower can only shoot to the front, that one only in the 1 to 3 o'clock direction. A very early upgrade you get is the ability to re-orient you towers. In mid-fight. And repairing, burst fire and other manual actions that you can activate (of course for a single tower, not for all) will block your ability to re-orient. Maybe that is intended to make the game strategic, but this is not what I am looking forAfter an enemy wave, you can (and should) repair your towers. Another point where the interface got very clumsy: You can only repair if the tower was not damaged in the last 5 seconds. No, you cannot just queue the repair, you have a grayed-out button and wait for the damage timer to expire before clicking. Sounds annoying? Surely is annoying.The cool voice acting you see in the trailer is not as cool in the actual game.Good for people who like hectic, micromanagement and clickfest. If you are not one of these people, play some other tower defense.			"

												The game is close to a great game, but where it fails it fails very hard.  The experience is pretty much completely destroyed by target micromanagement that isn't natural to the Tower Defense genre.  It is ok that they wanted to use this as an element of their game, but the way they do it is nothing short of clumsy.  Managing the targeting sectors of all the standard cannons leaves the player fumbling with context menus that are easy to misclick.  I'd give it a 4/10, and almost solely because of the horrible controls on the standard cannons.  Fixing this would move the game a very long way into the 7/10 or even 8/10 range.			"

Posted: June 22, 2014
												I'm terribly split when it comes to Space Run, but in its current form, I have to lean towards not recommending this game.  In its addictive fun is frustration wrought by issues not dealing solely with the genre itself.The good: Reverse tower defense!  I've always enjoyed a good TD, and despite its issues, this is still a very fun game; ever since playing old TD mods on Warcraft 3, I have immensely enjoyed the ever mounting challenge that they always seem to provide, and this game is no exception as the challenges come from outside as well as within.  That may come across as being hypocritical seeing as how I don't recommend it, but please, continue reading.  The bad: Unbalanced modules.  Save your space credits and don't invest in anything except laser cannon, heavy laser turret, force field, and all of the utility modules.  Why?  Use laser cannons until you can buy heavy laser turrets (despite their extra range, missile weapons cannot hit small targets), use force field because most everything will be dead from your heavy laser turrets by the time they fail (and if they do, just recharge them), and the utility modules allow for quite a bit of flexibility (e.g. fitting in power or engine modules in tight spots).  The rest of the modules either take up too much precious space on your ship or they lack the adaptability necessary to get you through missions.  Once you realize this, you'll quickly find that your reputation unlocks a plethora of items that you'll never use and/or upgrade, you'll be swimming in space credits after a few hours that you'll spend on modules only for the sake of spending them, and there's a disturbing lack of options for new tactics and module positioning when you restart missions.The ugly: Well, I just said it: restarting.  What makes me say that?  Because you'll be restarting the same missions over.  And over.  And over.  And over.  It will get to the point where one module might get blown up because you were too slow or an asteroid will get too close to the ship and you may as well just restart right then and there.  Did you just invest eight minutes in that mission?  Start over from the beginning, however, because you lack a wide array of useful modules (try using an advanced defense complex against a huge asteroid or a heavy missile system against small pirate bombers) to change things up, you're inevitably stuck using the same setup again and again.  And that eight minutes?  No big deal?  Eight minutes here, three minutes there, five minutes from yonder... they add up faster than you would think.  Without any save option or checkpoint system or even a fast forward button, you have to plod along through the gauntlet from square one every time.  Don't misunderstand me; I've died thousands of times while playing Dark Souls, but every time you do, you can almost hear the game saying (maybe even taunting) ""I know you can do better than that"", but this game?  All I hear is ""Well, sucks to be you"".Space Run has the makings of a great game.  Robert Clotworthy (the voice actor of Starcraft's Jim Raynor) is the voice of the main character, the graphics are simple yet aesthetically pleasing, and each company's cargo you carry brings its own unique set of challenges in order to shake things up a bit.  I'm two missions away from finishing the game, and while I've had my fun, I feel no compulsion to go back to get reputation stars I missed on earlier missions let alone replay the entire game.  If the game developers fix the shortcomings (maybe even throw in a ""Survival: Endless"" mode à la Plants vs Zombies where you can build your own ship sans cargo and just get wave after wave of pirates sent at you where you're forced to recycle modules in favor of ones that can handle particular enemies better), I'll come back to waste more of my life having fun with this game, but as it is now, save your money and hope that this gets the tender loving care it deserves.

Video Walkthrough - Expert 
A Guide for Space Run
By: Alex

			Video walkthorughs of all space run levels in mode expert (hard)		


-Pros:PrettyWell optimized.Reminds me of Stratosphere, sorta.Alt-tabs easily and cleanly.Account progression.Space rpg, sorta.-Cons:No real choices. You're punished for all but the ""correct"" ones.You can't build your ship in advance, you cannot layout hexes as you'd like, and your ship is erased each time.Shooter type level design, as in no randomness, and required blind level attempt as recon for real attempt.No sense of engagement because there is no ship progression.I don't like having to mouse over kill rewards to collect them. Cheap APM inflation is not gameplay.I don't like being unable to zoom out to see the entire relevant area, especially if I'm required to micromanage so much.Modding not possible, apparently intentionally prevented.Boss fights are awful because your weapons intentionally target the enemy bridge last even if there's a clear shot/path.Can't pause to send commands or examine the situation. Cheap way of forcing twitch gaming.-Summation:Game is extremely rigid. Worst of both worlds, a grinding arcade game. Plenty of arbitrary requirements to keep you on a rail in various contexts. Essentially a guessing game where the objective is to figure out the one correct sequence of choices needed to ace the test. You're basically forced to beat the game before you have any freedom. Doing new missions is the only way to get reputation, which unlocks parts, which unlocks more reputation. This leads to only one viable play strategy. Low hanging fruit (do untouched missions first) then buy everything you're allowed to buy, and do the next least completed mission. -Suggestions for Dev:Give funding for mission up front, then let us build ship in advance.Let us lay out ship hex shape.Persistent ship.Missiles need to fire 360.Eliminate reputation system.Surplus hex should be converted to SC at the end of missions.

												I really want to love this game. I also really want to be able to play it without constant frustration, but the developer has intentionally made sure that isn't possible. Space Run starts out really fun and interesting, but quickly turns into a tedious mess of micromanagement.I love the ability to turn your turrets to face new threats, but when you have 8 or more of them on one ship, along with dozens of other modules that all have their own unique abilities, it gets borderline impossible to manage them all simultaneously. This could all be fixed with a simple active-pause button, or a speed slider. Instead, you get waves of enemies thrown at you before you have any time to react, and it only gets worse as the game progresses. I realize that some people enjoy that kind of gameplay, but many don't.This same sentiment has been shared with the developer many times in the forums. Their reaction was to let everyone know that there would never be a pause feature, while at the same time acknowledging that a huge number of players want it. I suppose if they don't want my business then they won't get it. I certainly won't be buying the sequel.			"

												I love the concept of this game, but the actual game disappoints.  Too much ""guess the exact arrangement of towers the designer had in mind"", too little flexibility.  Plus, you spend too much time clicking around to aim towers and manually collect resources  - tower defense should be about watching you devious plan unfold, not about reaction time and actions-per-minute.

												I was waiting for the developer to listen to the players to implement a tactical pause button before giving it my positive recommendation. It's a pretty good game, a nice and different take on the Tower Defence genre, and looks pretty good.The lack of said pause button makes the game literally unplayable for people like me that have a bad memory and don't play the game from start to finish so everything is in memory. I have to press Esc to pause the game in the middle of a level, and think to myself along these lines: ""Ok, I want to put a missile turret here now, and then realign that turret. What does the missile turret button looks like again? No time to read tooltips after I unpause... Where is the realign button going to be? Oh, what does this turret in my ship do? I can't really remember just by looking at the mesh, specially at this zoom level.""The third time I had to do that, I decided that this didn't make any sense, and I'd wait for the tactical pause that I was sure would eventually come out, sinse so many people were asking for it.Now the developer has come out and stated that no, tactical pause wouldn't be implemented. The players wouldn't be interested in not having ""challenging real time threat management"". I'll be interested in just being able to play the damn thing, and I'll be the judge of what I will or will not be interested in, thank you very much.If you have a good memory and lots of time so you can play it from start to finish without a long hiatus so you don't forget what everything is, then by all means, It's a solid, 8/10 game.For me personally, with bad memory and not much time, without a pause button, it's unplayable, so I won't even bother to give it a score.

												If you came here looking for good Tower Defense, turn back now.While their is some tactial decision making in the form of resource management, tower choice and orientation, the gameplay has too much micro-management for what you normally would want in a Tower Defense game.There is no tactical pause feature, everything is done in real time. Most of the towers have one or two activated abilities that need to be manually activated. In the heat of things, you'll be frantically going from tower to tower adjusting their orientation or activating an ability, just to make it through.A good Tower Defense should be about the strategy, not about how fast you can click everything.Imagine playing an RTS game with 20-40 units, and you have to command them all individually. That's what this sometimes feels like.So if you wanted to try a cool and fresh Tower Defense game, while still keeping with the feel and flow of what you've come to expect from the genre, stay away from this game.It looks polished enough, but this is less of a tactical game and more of a click-fest madhouse.

												Very dated graphics, unispired dialogue, poor story telling, no zooming in or out, no pause button, no fast forward.Think a 3D tower defense flash game that seems to honestly believe it has an interesting story.The mechanics are nothing to write home about (and having the enemies along the path has been done to exaustion in on-the-rails-shooting games), the ""modules"" are bland and the upgrades are uninteresting for the most part (nevermid rotating the turret so that it covers another angle is an upgrade) The enemies are also amazing at grabbing your attention since they're essentially:  flies, pebbles and other ships biult not unlike yours.It's relatively slow paced after positioning the first few towers and before the final wave (so surprising!) and did I mention there's no zoom? It feels like an attempt at mobile gaming (and the way the currecncy system works makes it seem like it was designed for microtransactions that were scrapped in this version).Oh, and the cheesy-yet-not-cheesy-enough -to-be-funny voice acting is another thing to suffer through.Avoid if possible.

												Basically, in this game you have to figure the ""exact"" part in the ""exact"" order of assembly at the ""exact"" right time in order to complete the levels.  Not so bad at first but around the ""Crazy Party"" mission it simply becomes INSANELY impossible to accomplish.  Despite being a modular type system, the attacking waves are going to require a specific combition and order of assembly else it's quite simply an epic fail so basically it's not about being effecient with your placement but a puzzle in trying to figure out the single configuration they came up with in order to complete the level.  I'm so frustrated with it now I'm unistalling it and probably won't be back for a few patches to see if they've made any improvements to game play.			"

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Space Run 

			Views: 228		

			Space Run is a Tower D where you command different ships, transporting goods across deadly space. Available on Steam here http://store.steampowered.com/app/275670/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if...		

First off I would like to state that making this review was harder than I thought it would be, due to what I felt it was missing. The game runs great and really wraps you into the world as a transporter. Some small issues in how I feel the Tower D aspect is played out, too limiting and not enough options when it comes to allowing you to decide how to build your ship. From no upgrading towers in combat, a level one gun will always be a level one gun. Even writing this I am torn on this game, some will love it for what it has, but sadly I see what it doesn't, and because of what its missing, I feel that hurts the game play greatly. All I can say is watch the video, see for yourself, the game is not bad, but due to what it lacks you may not want to get it. Thanks for your time and viewership.

												Asteroids change their trajectories on the fly to hit your ship at the same spot every time.  That's ridiculous.Start a map that begins with an asteroid, see that it hits mid-ship.Start over and immediately use the skill Tactical Break.  The asteroid hits mid-ship.Start the same map, add two engines.  The asteroid hits mid-ship.Start again, boost.  The asteroid hits mid-ship.Wait until the asteroid is on the screen, break or boost and you can visibly see it alter course to hit ... mid-ship.That alone irritates me enough to thumb it down.  But if you don't care about things like that, it's a fine game, especially if you get it on sale.			"

												Rather controversially, this game does not allow the player to pause the action and realign, repair or reposition his turrets - actions that the gameplay demands in spades as the player is asked to react with rapid precision to an ever changing battle! I enjoyed the first few levels but when things soon got hectic, the fun drained out of the game. There's no check-pointing either so if you die near the end of a 10-minute level (and you will, a LOT) you need to redo the whole thing. Some of the more hardcore players like this about the game, no question. But for me, the result is a frantic click-fest of a game  that I personally find stressful instead of tactical or fun. We play games for enjoyment, not for stress!The weird thing is the gameplay is crying out for such a feature, imo. It feels like a grossly over-looked feature that absolutely should be there, which makes its absence all the more grating. I'd play a lot more of this and recommend it highly with such a button implemented, but without it I just didn't want to play on after only a mere half dozen levels, and I feel the result is a below average game. The devs have confirmed they will not be adding an active pause. Shame. Uninstalling after a hour.So just through a single small omission, the devs made a grate game instead of a great game. Ha! See what I did there?			"

												A generally good strategy game, but full of bad writing, even worse voice acting, and casual misogyny passed off as cool that could only appeal to the intellect of an uneducated teenager.  It is clearly trying to not take itself too seriously, but it's hard to treat the writing as cute and funny when the jokes are so horribly sexist.  The game itself would be a lot more enjoyable without having to endure that writing and unfortunately turning it off completely is not an option.Pros:- Innovative variation on tower defense- Plenty of strategy and more replayability than the average tower defense gameCons:- Misogyny everywhere- Horrible writing- Inadequate flexibility in adjusting graphics options to suit different computers			"

Modifing defenses, changing turret orientation/mode, activating specials, collecting salvage all keep you at the edge of your seat.Pros:Fun new take on tower defenseKeeps you always involvedCons:Getting new towers is bittersweet since they are often hard to place.Many levels require a bit of trial and error to get right "

												It's tower defense with a different facade.Position your weapons carefully; in addition to choosing the right weapon you have to take firing arcs into consideration.  Turrets cannot be upgraded directly, however they do have special abilities that can be activated at a cost.  Timing those abilities can be a huge difference maker.Most tower defense games revolve around killing the enemy quickly.  Space Run takes a different approach, it's about arriving at your destination as fast as possible with all of your cargo.  Thus you'll have to balance adding engines and other defenses such as shields and anti-missle turrets in order to get the best possible score.Your reward for success is reputation and money.  Reputation unlocks missions, weapons and upgrades.  Money is required to purchase those upgrades.  These unlocks include new turret types, faster engines, special abilities you can use in-game or flat passive bonuses that make a certain turret more effective.One thing that keeps things interesting is varying types of cargo.  Some cargo simply needs to make it there in tact, other cargo introduces new difficulties such as draining nearby modules so they're harder to power, or modules that must be connected by the end of the map (costing you space and resources).   When carrying nuclear warheads you even have the option to use one of them on the enemy, though doing so will cost you as that warhead can't be delivered for obvious reasons.Overall, it's fun.  My biggest complaint is it's too easy. I've gotten a perfect score the first try on most missions, the remaining ones have been a narrow miss.  There's also little to replay and unfortunately weapons just aren't varied enough.  In general building whatever the best weapon you have access to is the right decision.  Maps also have a tendency to favor sending enemies in from one direction, it makes planning your build up rather easy and predictable.  Additionally, while the game offers something like 30 maps they tend to feel very redundant.Expect to get about 10 hours out of it, 20 if you're struggling and have to replay a lot.			"

												Wow-- get this.  Simple premise: you've got a ship which you place cargo, engines, guns, and support modules like power generators and shields on.  You need to go fast enough-- building enough engines during the run-- to make a deadline, or go even faster to get bonuses.You don't actually navigate the ship, the flight plan is pre-set.  Don't worry, though, there'll be plenty else to do.Asteroid swarms, waves of enemy fighters, ships and so forth get in your way and/or try to blow you up.  Destroying them instead gives 'hexnuts' which is the resource used to build more stuff on your ship.  You need to also keep building and repairing your guns/missiles/etc, and readjusting their facing to be prepared for the next waves.  There are powerups available for your modules, and using them with the right timing can make a huge difference.  You almost certainly want to also build some shields at least around the bridge, the cargo, and the engines.But then, you almost certainly wanted to build guns facing in all directions as quickly as possible.  And power gens and shields next to them also.  And another engine...decisions, decisions....Survive the run with ship and cargo intact, and you get paid, which you can use to improve the tech available on the next run.  New missions become available, although you can and should repeat existing missions to be able to afford better tech.			"

A trail mode where you can test the weapon's function would be nice too.Can't wait for expension.			"

												Space Run is inspired by Vlaada Chvatil's board game: Galaxy Trucker, and it is a fantastic interpretation. This game is most easily summarized as an action tower defense game, with some very notable exceptions. The premise is simple, build stuff on your ship to protect cargo on it, while building enough engines to get to your goal in time. You're given a 30 second warning for incoming threats, with a tracker showing the path that it will take, so you get a little time to quickly plan what you'll do. You buy constructions with currency that builds over time or from destroying other ships.What makes the game a little different is that time really plays a big factor here. You'll be struggling to work out what to fit where, while still managing what's actually on your ship. Make no mistake, there's a good deal of micromanaging going on here. Practically everything you build has activated abilities, and you'll need to make use of them to do well. When you destroy other ships, it feels incredibly satisfying, and the game does a great job of making it feel rewarding when you do well. Similarly, tight situations feel stressful without being impossible, making it more likely you'll try to work through setbacks instead of resetting. I played through the whole game, and wholeheartedly recommend it. It's a great mix of puzzle with reflex and disaster mitigation.Some negative points for those looking: -There is a lot of time-critical managing. You can kinda cheat the system by pausing with escape, but activating one ability can be the difference between succeeding with a perfect score and utter failure.-Levels always play out in the same way, and to get a perfect score on a later level, you generally have to know where some ships are going to appear far ahead of time so you can allocate resources effectively. This means memory does play a role here. Sometimes you just have to know that something is going to appear from one direction over and over again.-There's no real reason to play defensively. Early in a level, maybe, but you'll generally never use the upgraded shields or defensive items. Because destroying ships gives you more money to use for construction, it's generally easier and safer to just rebuild guns that get destroyed by enemies rather than use a shield which won't bring you any more money. This point being said, it's also way more fun that the game plays out this way. Yeah explosions!			"

												Very compelling take on the tower defense genre, however in this you're on the fly arming a cargo vessel to fend off enemies and objects to make your deliveries quickly, efficiently, and of course alive. There is a decent upgrade/tech system here, precision and intensity are required for the more challenging runs, and there is a lot of replay value on the more complex missions especially after you gain more tech unlocks. In my opinion, one of the best indie single player experiences of 2014.			"

(oh well there's always a rerun)The games worth a play through due to it's near unique way of handling the tower-defense genre.			"

												A brilliant and competent addition to the tower defence genre. Excellent mechanics which you will find in no other game, Cool graphics, although picking each individual module out of the cluster on your ship can be challenging. You'll likely want to turn off the sound alerts too. The voice overs are limited and become repetetive really quickly.			"

												Love this game. I've always liked Tower Defense type games, and this one bathes the tired and formulaic genre in a new light. The addition of whitty humor is a huge plus, as the story seams to rely mostly on joke to get by. With that said, voice acting is solid, and the experience as a whole is very enjoyable. The ranking system will have you retrying old stages to get a higher score, 10/10.			"

												A nice spin on tower defence with a great risk/reward mechanic where you have to choose between guns, shields, power to enable special abilities - or engines to speed up your space ship and chase that elusive fifth star for ""light speed"" delivery. The enemy patterns do not vary - so you can learn each level - but the number of design choices is very high and your performance can also be impacted by timing special abilities and where to point your guns. I'm not certain it will be something I stick with long - but as a short diversion it has clear quality.			"

												If you are looking for an addictive and fun tower defense style game then I would highly recommend this game. The premise is to build towers on a spaceship which is made of hexagons. Asteroids and other nasty ships will try to do damage and you can build a mixture of lasers, missle launchers and defenses (ie shields) to fend them off.As you finish levels you earn a currency to upgrade and purchase new weapons and defenses.All of the towers have specials you can activate (costing resources) which leads to a lot of active micromanagement, keeping you on your toes all throughout the missions.The mechanics of the game are really great, much better than the standard tower defense.

												I had a tremendous amount of fun playing this. It's a very slick twist on the tower defense genre, where you built turrets on your spaceship  to defend against pirates and asteroids. In an almost rpg like way, you level up your guns and get abilities. Each level is an engaging puzzle to be solved by placing the turrents in the right place at the right time.			"

												Surprisingly fun! I thought I would be turned off immersion-wise by the hex grid ships, but I found myself giving the ships names like corvette and freighters. The placements of weapons are vital (as they take up space and they take up space for the turret), and every building on the limited space on the ship becomes a decisions of pro and cons. Even the objective of the game is a decision (do I forgo weapon and defense for speed and get paid more or do I build defense and attack so I can actually survive the run?).Very very fun game, and the upgrade system lets you rediscover new uses for weapons after they gain abilities (like a double laser turret becomes a split wide angle cover gun but can't shoot forward)			"

												An exciting and fast-paced inverse tower defense game. One of the best I've played.Many tower defense games have you set up towers and then watch as they do their thing while you have minimal interaction with them. This is quite different - every tower has one or more abilities that can be activated, and you will constantly be triggering abilities and building things during the game. There is no downtime. Personally, I find most TD games a little dull and found the frenetic gameplay of this one to be a refreshing relief. However, people who like more traditional TD games may be turned off by the micromanagement.Much of the technique involves memorizing the build order -- you play a mission once, lose, then try it again while knowing what will attack when.Normal mode was fun but a bit easy. Hard mode was poorly balanced - you gain resources so slowly that you need to replay missions a lot to unlock new ones and the grind is not fun.There is about 20 hours of content here, which will stretch out to about 30 if you want to get a perfect score in each level. It is well worth the purchase price.			"

												I bought this after watching Totalbiscuits WTF is of it, and it is rather fun. Some other reviewers have criticized the lack of pause button. Currently you can pause it by hitting escape, but I assume the others want a way to survey and make changes without time movingI do not feel this would help the game as it removes the element of urgency and skill in micro-managing everything in real time. Re-aiming cannons, activating abilities and choosing the placement and type of weapon to place is not particulary difficult until you have to do it in real-time while being attacked by waves of varying enemiesOtherwise the game is fairly good looking. It functions as a 2d game but has a nice compliment of 3d effects and animations. The voice acting and story are .. skippable. Its mostly about the gameplay, which is quite solid.			"

												Nice take on the tower defense genre. The game is fairly micro intensive on most levels, especially later on. The game manages to keep the pressure on with a thrust system which moves you along a linear track with timed runs. Thrust takes up the same space your guns do, so a significant amount of planning is required. The first few missions are very easy to get perfects playing it by ear, but the later levels will require you to take into account which waves come from which direction when, what sorts of defense is needed, and how much thrust you need to maintain during replays. Content-wise the game is a bit light at the moment. Hopefully, this game will be expanded upon with free updates or some significant DLCs. 7 out of 10.			"

Review for ""Space Run""Genre: Tower DefensePrice at time of purchase: 14.99€Time invested at the time of writing: 28.7hA really fun TD Game. It has enough diversity in the objectives to keep you interested for a long enough time to justify the price. The levels are not too difficult, but to finish inside the time limit is where the real challenge lies. The later stages can be pretty stressful, but it never gets too frustrating.

												This is a very welcome addition to the tower defense genre.  Loads of fun and a very novel approach!  The voice acting detracts from the game's personality when it should have added to it, but that's the only downside for me.  Replayability is also limited because there are a limited number of levels.  This game would have benefited greatly from either randomized missions or some kind of ""forever"" mode.  Aside from that, it's still very fun while it lasts.			"

												Went on special offer today, been keeping my out for that and i must admit this game is pretty fun.Only played an hour so far, but if it weren't so humid and hot today I would continue playing.Very much as commentated upon by a curator on the store page.Great story, nice graphics and nice gameplay that is introduced to the player in a light and humerous manner.Tower defense with a twist i would say and not too easy, but also not back breakingly hard so far. The story leads you through different missions and I am really looking forward to finishing it again.Already had a mission i wasn't able to complete with full points and looking forward to revisiting it later on but going to finish the storyline first.For everyone that enjoys some slap stick space humour á la han solo and a good round of Tower defence. It's only about 6 bucks and that's totally worth it.Graphics are great and only have to concentrate on equipping the weapons  and thrusters.Upgrades after each mission, too.Lovely so far.			"

												I like tower defense games and this one has some definitely good qualities about it. I like the strategy and the consideration you have to give to placement to your turrets and cargo, it makes it very interesting and offers a lot of replayability. But it has a few issues which I will elaborate on below:1. It is clearly a port from a touch screen game and the devs didn't really bother themselves overmuch with fine tuning it for a PC. E.G. In order to collect money from enemies you have killed you have to mouse over them. Modability does not appear to be a priority, if there was workshop capabilities added in I think this could be amazing.2. There is no pause for you to react to things. I would really like the ability to pause like the ability in FTL. I haven't gotten super far into the game but I think we need the option to pause and make decisions, there can be a lot going on in the game and as things progress I think there will only be more activity.This is a pretty solid game, that, with a little bit more effort from the devs can be a really great game.

												Great gameSimilar to the ""Galaxy Trucker"" board game where you have to design your ship and go through missions, with some significant differences.1) you must place a number of ""cargo"" peices, and usually one engine peice prior to launch. You cannot place weapons at this stage.2) you don't get to change the shape of your ship (its a pre-determined shape that changes each level) you only get to determine what is built on what part of the shipI haven't had any significant problems playing this game after installing the betapatch. It is a well designed and coded game.Suggestions for the dev, maybe have a DLC where you can modify the shape of the ship, and take it through longer/harder missions. Also, being able to design the ship before launch would be great, along with creating more of a ""career"" feeling if the money  you can spend on your ship tied in with your net worth at the time.

												Love the idea.  Just wishing for a little more depth.  Mission Progression:I wish the each mission was not an isolated event.  You basically have a different, non-custom ship every level.  Upgrades:The upgrade system is no as indepth as I would like.  Your have three single upgrades for each item.  To me it would have been was better to give us a list of the stats and upgrade each stat for each weapon choice.Advanced Tech:The advanced tech is great but the size and power requirements make it almost impossible to place on your ship.Overall it is a good game that I would recomend.  Replayablilty is low.  Just know what your getting into.Hopefully, space runner 2 will address these issues.			"

												If you are looking for an addictive and fun tower defense style game then I would highly recommend this game. The premise is to build towers on a spaceship which is made of hexagons. Asteroids and other nasty ships will try to do damage and you can build a mixture of lasers, missle launchers and defenses (ie shields) to fend them off.As you finish levels you earn a currency to upgrade and purchase new weapons and defenses.All of the towers have specials you can activate (costing resources) which leads to a lot of active micromanagement, keeping you on your toes all throughout the missions.The mechanics of the game are really great, much better than the standard tower defense.

												The game just got updated 16-06-2014 and it fixed my problems at least. I like the game, so with the technical problems out of the way I'm gonna change this to a ""yes"" recommendation.It is a different kind of tower defence game than I'm used to - without any mazing or control of where the enemy will be coming. This can be good and bad because it sometimes forces you to replay a level. This is a minor detail though.Overall a good game for 11€, so grab it while it's on sale if you are into these kind of games.*** Old review below ***I played the game a little on my surface - it is quite fun.But... why would I play it on a surface? The reason why I play it on my crappy surface was because I couldn't run the game on my regular monster PC. A lot of others have experienced this (read forum). So I can't recommend buying it right now. The little I played before it crashed on the surface was good, but it kinda sucks to buy a good game that you can't play.So this is more a warning, than a critique of the game. I'll change the ""no"" to a ""yes"" recommendation when/if this problem is fixed.			"

												Awesome TD! There are a lot of TD out there, some bad, and some awesome. The awesome are: Defense Grid, Desktop TD, Kingdom Rush (some of the brilliant SC2 mods/arcade of course) and this; Space Run. Had my doubts since it looks a bit weird floating around in space bulding on something that does not look like a space ship, but I was wrong. This is great!Space Run requires a bit more reaction time than the most of the otther TD´s (mentioned above), and is a little bit more hectic/action, but all in all a great game for all fans of the TD genre.Agree with this, as found in the reviews:“Really good spin on tower defense!

												The game itself can be addictively fun, provided you can push past the first hour.  There is so much the game does not explain, that you have to find out the hard way, it can get discouraging when you start to reach the more challenging missions.  I suggest watching some videos to pick up what the game fails to teach you, it will make for a much more enjoyable experience.Apart from that the game nicely remixes the tower defense genre with some fun new twists.  The tagline says it all; get your cargo to its destination as fast, and as damage free as you can.  This can be done numerous different ways, but as you fine tune your technique, you'll arrive sooner with less damage.  All of which translates into a better payday to go buy upgrades.The dialogue isn't revolutionary, but is is comical enough to add some humor between runs.  A fun little game for the money.			"

												A pretty nice change of pace for the ole' tower defense genre. If you hear ""tower defense"" and just groan, this game likely is not for you. However, if you've enjoyed the genre in the past, and think you might have more left in you, but maybe are bored of the usual formula, give this a shot!Gameplay is as follows:- you build a ship, hex by hex, supplying turrets, missiles, shields, and power.- your ship launches and travels a straight line path from A to B. Your job is to make it to B as intact as you can.- on the way, you will be assaulted by all manner of ship and asteroid strikes, hoping your turrets and shields etc. can adequately defend you.- Providing further depth and keeping with the theme, your job is also to transfer cargo of various kinds from A to B, getting more cash the more cargo you deliver intact. Each cargo takes up valuable hexes on your ship with various mechanical complications, like cargo that MUST be placed on the vulnerable exterior edge of the ship, or cargo that drains power from all adjacent hexes.I was definitely very happy with this out-of-nowhere indie TD, at full-price no less.

												I've had my eye on this game for quite a while. Probably since the first feature of this game came out. It looked exciting and fun overall.  Space Run did not disappoint. If anything, if you would forgive the pun, Space Run has delivered. The graphics are great but you won't be able to get a close-up of anything much since the game will either rain laser death or gigantic asteroids (yes, still of death) on you if you're caught unawares.  The sound effects and tracks are just downright awesome.  The gameplay can be a whir of clicking this and that most of the time but that's what sets it apart from other tower defense games. This game deserves to be in your library, I think.  Though be it too short and a tad bit high on the price range.			"

												An exciting and fast-paced inverse tower defense game. One of the best I've played.Many tower defense games have you set up towers and then watch as they do their thing while you have minimal interaction with them. This is quite different - every tower has one or more abilities that can be activated, and you will constantly be triggering abilities and building things during the game. There is no downtime. Personally, I find most TD games a little dull and found the frenetic gameplay of this one to be a refreshing relief. However, people who like more traditional TD games may be turned off by the micromanagement.Much of the technique involves memorizing the build order -- you play a mission once, lose, then try it again while knowing what will attack when.Normal mode was fun but a bit easy. Hard mode was poorly balanced - you gain resources so slowly that you need to replay missions a lot to unlock new ones and the grind is not fun.There is about 20 hours of content here, which will stretch out to about 30 if you want to get a perfect score in each level. It is well worth the purchase price.			"

												The game is a nice version of tower defense in space. You are limited by the design of your ship each mission  where you place your modules on hex fields. You can upgrade each module, which offers active and passive features.The first missions are very addictive and you always try to solve the mission at lightspeed.Unfortunately, the mission setup itself is not random. The same objects and enemies approach the same way they did the try before, which makes it pretty easy to adjust your strategy after a few tries but can still be challenging sometimes, even if you already know what happens next.If you can get it below 10 € it's worth the buy.

												Simple, easy to learn, and addictive. A unique approach to the tower defense genre which works out quite well. The gameplay is hectic yet manageable. The mechanics of this game are very easy to grasp, but can use some refinement. In particular, the rotation of turrets can be finicky to the point of disadvantage. A tactical pause feature would be worth looking into, but may detract from the action. A few text descriptions could be a bit more clear. The voice acting is excellent, and the dialog and characters are entertaining. There are also some sweet easter eggs.			"

With the level of difficulty it begins its missions at, you will find yourself going back to those missions to improve, especially with the games credit system for system upgrades.  A difficult, fun, strategy game that will also puts you into the deepist of space battle reactionary combat.  If  you're a fan of anything tactical and strategic, do not hesitate to purchase this game and play it through with the goal of 5 stars on all levels.  You will not be disappointed.			"

												Addictive take on the tower defence genre. The mechanics are similar, but the gameplay's different, as you fly through space towards your destination. Certain turrets can be re-aligned on the fly, to maximise your attack in a particular direction, and it can get quite hectic in the harder levels. You will also need to manage your speed by building boosters, not just to make it on time, but also to pick up the quicker time bonuses on offer.Lots of fun and replayability as you strive to perfect your run through each mission.

												A really interesting and inituitive take on strategy bult up with a simple but good looking graphics system. This is the next level of Indie games.In space run you are given the task of making it from point A to point B, you fly a space ship holding valuable cargo and it must make its way to base via a route as quick as possible, this basicly means youre flying in the face of danger. Worry not, for your tools against imminent doom are plentiful. As you fly, topspeed, you must find a balance betwen speed, survival and offence using resources gained in the heat of battle to build extra engines, turrets and other spaceship goodies.The game has the basic addictive tenets of most tower defense games, but suffers slightly less replayability since its basic premise is to complete a combative time-trial, meaning that there is no ""endless mode"" as is for most tower defense games, and yes this is a tower defense game. Although space ships are involved, your ships ""movement"" is a direct path orchestrated by your cargo supplier in each mission, and your opponents invariably show up to lay the hurt on you.The intesting extra twist that makes this game fun is that you are not protecting a base,but rather, you ARE the base. As you take damage your cargo gets destroyed and your ship gets dismantled, that means your reward and rank for completing the mission goes down and the space you have to build stuff shrinks. Furthermore, because youre on the clock, bunkering down is not a valid tactic, you need to go fast enough to complete the mission (with extra rewards for accomplishing it post-haste) and you need to be tough enough to survive attacks (and preferably kill the attackers to harvest their loot, lest you become too starved for cash to survive against the ever tougher enemies).I highly reccomend this game to fans of RTS, TD , Strategy games and Indie games in general.

												This game is a lot of fun. The simple name made me leave it to linger on my wishlist for quite a while, thinking it was probably just another simplistic indie game that wouldn't offer much. But that was a snap judgement that this game did not deserve. Space Run has plenty of depth, a pretty great upgrade tree for your barge to incorporate into itself as you go, and ultimately the most important thing of all; fun gameplay. More than just fun, it's also quite challenging and the game manages to land that perfect balance of easy to learn but difficult to master. That isn't easy to pull off, but Space Run does so with aplomb. This one is worth a look at full price. If you are lucky enough to land a copy during a sale like I did, then it's really a steal. Well worth your time. To the developers I say ""great job"". I will keep my eyes open for more work from you guys. This is a fun imaginative use of a reasonably tired genre that I keep thinking has crested. But folks keep coming up with ways to make Tower Defence interesting again and again, and this one is worth the time and money to play.			"

												Awesome.  Hits the adrenaline booster just right.  Replayability is so good, that I just seem to hang around the same stages so I don't wear the game out too fast.  That said, the upgrades you unlock with each mission spur you on to get that extra burst of speed to beat your best time.  I'd love to see a 'Ghost Ship' toggle option, ala racing games, pop up now and then, marking your best time, or where you exploded in previous mission runs. Try to make it look spooky.A tip to newcomers, you can just reorient your guns by clicking the gun and moving the mouse, you don't have to click the 'Reorient' button and remember, only your ""Cargo"" has to get there fast, for the best possible score, regardless of how many other modules you lose. Still, Nuking every last threat is a fun challenge also.			"

												Space Run is a clever little game, a nice twist on the tower defence gameplay. Lots of different weapons and modules with which to outfit your ship make for some interesting combinations. Some micromanaging is required during some of the more intense fights, as you are constantly trying to maximise damage output while minimising risk to your own vessel.the only downside I can find so far is the fact that some, if not all runs, can not be completed with full points on the first try. Unless you're lucky off course. Enemy waves pass your vessel from all sides, but during levels not every side of your ship is attacked with equal ferocity. This means that building a symmetrical ship is usually a bad idea, either because it costs too much, or because you have dps pointing in a direction that is seeing no action. This problem is most felt before the mission begins, when you place your key delivery structures. These take up space you might need. If placed on the wrong side of your ship, you may not be able to defend against the enemy waves effectively. This means several plays of the same trip will probably be required to find the right set up for each mission.A good game, nice mechanics and gameplay, allthough a little frustrating from time to time when you get blindsided by that last enemy wave coming up on the side of your ship you can't effectively defend.

												Ah, trucking of the future! Build turrets to deal with pirates, shields to protect your ship and cargo, and engines to make sure you get there on time.The game is functionally a tower defense where the enemies are trying to destroy you and your towers instead of ignoreing them to reach an objective. The fast pace of the game provides a good challenge, as do certain cargos.The only downside to the game is that the main characters can become very grating over time. But they can be muted.			"

												A variant of tower defense where your ship is made of tiles in which you can buy and place a variety of offensive, defensive, and utility structures. Story is minimal and is just something to string together the scenarios but there's enough flavor, humor, and characters with personality (although one-dimensional/no development) that it strings it together well enough for me.You need to balance your combat structures (that destroy things to gain more money and let you survive to the end) with engine structures (that are necessary for speed bonuses). You unlock new structures by spending points you gain by completing mission objectives. You'll have to grind a little but it isn't so bad if you like to spend time repeating missions to try and get a 5-star rank. However, sometimes it's better to just come back later when you've unlocked the better (although more expensive to place) structures.There are four types of scenarios, each with unique structures you're forced to place onto the ship that waste space and sometimes have additional negative effects.It feels like scenarios aren't randomly generated. There are set tiles and seemingly set enemy spawns and patterns. It's pretty nice from a puzzle/high-score aspect because you can figure out and optimize the best build order. I'm pretty surprised that there is no score attack mode/leaderboards because it feels like it would fit well. However, not having randomly generated missions also means that anyone who really likes it will run out of 'fresh' content.I would have liked to be able to switch difficulty (rather than be locked into one difficulty the whole time). Or at least be able to have all difficulties on the same profile so you can easily switch between difficulties (and progress is separate for each difficulty). As it is you'd have to go back to the main menu to switch profiles for a different difficulty.Worth a look for people who enjoy tower defense and would like something with a little spin on it.			"

												Space Run is a twist on tower defense where you protect your ship from all angles while traveling through space. There are lots of weapons and upgrades and many levels require a different strategy. The story is a bit clique, but for a tower defense game to have story at all is nice. The game is fairly long, but each level only takes about 10 minutes. Space Run is definitely worth a buy if you are fan of the genre or want to kill some space pirates in your free time.			"

												Essentially a mobile tower defense game. Rather than defend against a stream of raiders attempting to steal stars/hearts/life points/whatever from your base, you're a space runner. You run goods, nuclear waste, or people through space. The faster and more in tact your cargo arrives to point B from point A, the greater the rewards. Your ship starts off each round with a set number of hexes in which you can place add-ons of your choosing. These add-ons cost credits (of course) which are earned constantly by travelling or intermittently when you destroy objects (such as asteroids, other ships, or pirates). These credits are called hexnuts and float around as debris until you mouse over them to pick them up. Later on you can pick up add-ons that help magnetize them to your ship (this helps when things start getting hairy). The other add-ons include weapons, shields, power generators, and other goodies that can work synergistically with other systems on your ship or bolster your reward.Orientation of your weapons matters, so you have to sometimes change which way they're facing while in combat. Placement also matters, as some weapons require a certain amount of hexes for the guns to move properly. In addition, some require power to operate correctly or to power special abilities. Pirates have some cheaterish moves that they can do to your ships, so the game expects you to think on your feet and be able to respond to certain conditions.After each run, you earn credits and reputation. Rep unlocks the ability to purchase new items, while the credits allow you purchase the base new add-on or expand existing add-on abilities (for example, expanding the power thrusters tree allows for the thrusters to operate at a higher efficiency).Space Run is a fun game with good replay value. The levels are not random though, so you have an opportunity to learn at what time and from which direction threats will come to you. At its core, SR is another tower defense game, however it's a very polished and fun tower defense game that changes enough of the basic mechanics of a TD game to keep it unique and fresh.			"

												OK... I think I lost track of time playing this game which should be a pretty good sign. This is a tower defense type of game where you place progressively gun turret, thruster and the such on your ship while trying to deliver precious cargo.  After play phase, you can use earned credit for upgrade and purchase new items (some being unlock based on your reputation... that make the game a little bit more difficult).The game is well done but there is fews cons in the game:-  The view of your ship might be too small to see exactly what is going on - No way to zoom in as far as I know-  Navigation around your ship (to see what is coming to hurt you, or at least trying) is done with the arrow keys... That is darn old way to do it but it is necessary since the WASD keys are use as other shortcut.- The dialogue can be humoristic but there are too many repeats during the game mode to be enjoyable (like three or four phrases used randomly for key moment).  If you ever played Sacred 1 or 2... you see what I mean.It is currently bundled on the weekly humble bundle in the pay what you want tier... that means you can get this game for less than a dollar... That is sweet.			"

												I used to play a ton of tower defense games back in the day when they were all made in Flash and playable only in your browser. But after it became overcrowded with generic clones, I thought there was little hope in the genre and left it for dead and moved on with my life. And then came Space Run.Space Run revived the tower defense love in me, scratching a long-forgotten itch in a really great way. It's intentionally hectic (which is almost akin to playing a game of Starcraft, so if you don't like having to be twitchy with your fingers, this may not be the game for you) with a great dose of strategy in how you want to build and optimise your ship layout.Decent voice over and plot that gives just enough meaning to doing the runs, which is really all you need without it getting in your gaming.A solid recommend for tower defense fans who can click fast.Really looking forward to the sequel Space Run Galaxy!

												There is a lot to like about Space Run and few detractors.  Visuals and color pallet are good, the music is enjoyable without being too mellow or overbearing, and the limited voice acting conveys the story appropriately.  Space Run follows the traditional build towers as the level progresses and the warning radar informs you where to best place towers for the upcoming wave.  This game would be much better with more levels available (or a randomizer), but the client differences are the spice of this game.  Most tower defense are the same thing beginning to end, but, in Space Run the client's containers change up the level approach significantly; kudos for making the cargo affect the game.  Big Cargo pods can be located anywhere, Nuclear Star material is best kept safe toward the interior of the ship or you risk massive explosions, VIP Travel cabins are forced to the edge where you lose valuable turret placement options, and the other two clients also throw curves into their missions.  The missions themselves are paced correctly, are not overly long making it easy to replay for five star rankings, and any difficulty can be overcome with a tactical alteration.  I'd like to see some challenge zones with upfront tower building and some configurable ship layouts choices, but as it stands, Space Run is a unique and fun tower defense game.			"

It gets very difficult pretty quick and I had to go back and play previously completed missions to get enough upgrades to make it to the next area.

												A Tower Attack game?!The most important thing I want to mention here is, Space Run is a tower defense game. A pretty simple one, mind you. But in depth, it's much more than that.While the basic of the game consist of building offensive and defensive weapons to keep your ship alive, as well as thrusters to actually move through space, the active part of combat is much more complex than a simple tower defense game. Every structure comes with 3 upgrade slots that can be purchased with credits earned from previous runs. These upgrades mostly consist of 2 active upgrades and one passive upgrade. The active upgrades range from reorienting weapons, over massive single-time attack to quick-repair.All in all, the tower defense aspect of the game is just one part of it. Using active abilities wiesely, adjsuting to your stubborn cargo and handling all the micro-management, is the really big part of the game. And no, we don't need a pause button or anything, be fast or die, that's it, that's the challenging part of the game. - And really, it's not thaat hard.Space Run is an interesting and fun mix approach that will kepp you well entertained for ~10h if you want to complete it. With the current number of 30 runs, I have to say, I'm not sure if I would've bought it outside the Steam sale however.			"

If you enjoy TD games then ~$4 while this is on sale is an absolute steal. You will be surprised by the production value of the game vs. the price tag.I also recommend Space Run as it attempts to do something different which works.7/10			"

												This is a really amazing game if you like tower defense, you get a hex-based frame to load cargo on, then you have to power and defend the ship and cargo through set levels of enemies and obstacles. The mid game suffers a bit from wonky ship frames that make it really hard to fit what you need(want) on them, but once you're through that part of the game it gets a lot more fun. My only real critique is that there isn't an easy way to plan out your ship in-game or to re-orient or use abilities right when you need to since it's all in real-time, being able to pause in the way you can in say FTL would be very welcome, but I could see how that might ruin some of the action. It probably doens't have much replayability since all of the levels have static spawns, but it is a real blast.			"

												Space Run is a very nice `inbetween game'. I do not have a lot of time to spend on gaming which makes it extra attractive since you can finish a level within a minute or 10.. I can imagine being hooked to get further and get better weapons etc over time so it is probably also for those who do have loads of gaming time.. Overall it feels like a well balanced game with enough rewards to keep you delivering some weird stuff they seem to transport in the future..			"

												Only Played the first 4 missions and already im practically in love with this game. it takes strategy when placing things. at first it's either gain speed or gain firepower. i can only imagine how the later stages play out, for a tower defense it does have an interesting story with interesting characters with good dialog and for me getting it for $3.74 is a pretty good deal and I'd highly recommend you reading this buy this game and try it out.

												This game changed my life. 10/10!Would love an update with more runs, more companies, more ships, more Star Wars jokes, more guns, anything. Everything in this game is awesome though, so you still get a great review - I just want more someday because I'm a greedy consumer. :D			"

												A nice take on the concept of a tower defence game.A fair bit of micromanagement is required to play this game, especially in the later levels, but if that is your thing, this is definitely worth your time.			"

												Fun but unfogiving. Having to micro your turret positions gets old fast, but it keeps you on your toes. Some levels are a chore to get through requiring trial and error while you memorise the directions the spawns come from (you are attacked from all sides but it takes several waves before you can afford guns covering all areas)It definitly needs a planning mode before you start as its impossible to plan your layout without seeing firing arcs and shield radiiI got this on sale and had fun playing it. If you want something a bit different from the usual maze style TD's then give this a go.			"

												In this game you are basically a space trucker transporting cargo to point A to pont B. What's the fun of that? Well i forgot to mention that between point A and B: There will be pirate ships eager to blow you up, asteroids wanting to give you a hug and other truckers trying to be faster than you.At the beggining of each level you start with your cargo (can be destroyed, so protect it), a engine a couple of hex (resource used to build things at your ship)The good+""Towers"" as the game progresses you can upgrade towers, engines, buy new stuff such as shields, better engines, rocket launchers, etc...+levelsShip layout and enemies change at every level making the game interesting+StorySometimes there will be dialogues, some of them are not that good but most of them are nice and funny.+gameplayKinda like a tower defense game but your enemies  doesn't cross a path (they show up and simply that to blow off your ship) and there's a minimum time that you have to beat the mission ( to get 5 stars you have to be faster than other truckers), basically you have to balance in what you spend your hex (should i buy i engine now or a turret?)Towers also have special abilities that can be purchased. Ex: the basic tower when powered can activity an ability that allows it to fire like a machine gun .The bad-Can be difficult for some people to adapt, after all it's a different concept (i personally didn't have any problems)OverallFor tower defense fans who want something different this is a must buy.ignore semajaguar review, micro managing towers isn't difficult (sometimes you don't have to micro at all and you can pause by pressing ESC)			"

												What a treat!This is an exceptionally fun amusement.It's a tower defense game ... in  space!  :-)What it does with gameplayand audio/visual presentation is especially satisfying.The way the music and sound FXare coordinated to the player's actionsreminds me of a similar feeling I getfrom playing the arcade game, Raiden,if that makes any sense.Let's just say,it feels solid and fun.Another feature I appreciate,is being able to change which directionthe turrets are aimed.In fact,with all ship components being hex-shaped spaces,I was pleasantly remindedof all those hex-based tabletop starship gamesthat I got to play in the 1970's and 80's.In the later stages of the game,you'll know if you haven't quite conquered a mission.It can be rather overwhelming,particularly trying to micromanagewhen many things are happening at once.However, if you figure out a missionand get your module placement and timing correct,then you are rewarded with an entertaining Space Run.A few final notes:There are at least a few references to other sci-fi showswhich was great.  There's probably more.  :-)The game has only glitched a few timesthat I've noticedin the hours I've played it.Seems stable to me.And ... this game can be addictive.It can easily suck hours of your life away,before you know it.  Buyer beware!BOTTOMLINE:Should you buy it?It's a spaceship tower-defense that I thoroughly enjoy!Check out some gameplay video on youtube to judge for yourself.			"

												Very nice little game, worth every penny (especially at half price !),That's a tower defense in space, with a twist of real time strategy + makes you feel like a space pilot. You must build thrusters for speed, reactors for energy, shields for protections and of course guns, with limited space and budget - and time. Every mission feel new and tense. There are new towers to unlock between the missions. Nice graphics, well tuned difficulty (always challenging but not impossible) and the small ""dialogues"" before the missions are funny. I took me roughly 15 hours to complete it (but will take more to get all the stars and all the achievements).			"

												'Easy to play, difficult to master'. This old ad line comes to my mind after playing Space Run for 3 hours straight after purchase. Interface is great, graphics are fine, voice acting is excellent, and the game has great replay value. It has taken me maybe 4-5 runs of each mission to achieve maximum score but replaying does not feel like grind: the missions themselves are (so far at least - I have unlocked only 6 or 7) relatively short, the longest one I clocked at about 8 minutes. Space Run makes it quite easy for us obsessive-compulsive gamer nerds to let go and come back to it later.As I write this, I am thinking really hard to find something wrong with this title but really the only thing I can come up with is that *maybe* somebody might find the soundtrack a bit too repetitive. But given how much Space Run has to offer, and considering how cheap it is, that's really not an issue. You could always play your favorite music in the background and turn off game music from the menu.If you're hesitating, I'd say give Space Run a go: chances are, you will like it, and the price is great (there is a 25% discount as I write this, but even without it, the game is worth every penny).See you in space!

Played the game for 12 hours straight by accident because it is very addicting My only complain is you can't create your own ship in some kind of endless survivor mode. A trail mode where you can test the weapon's function would be nice too.Can't wait for expension.			"

												Tower defence disguised as space exploration with strong puzzle elements.You place different structures on preset ship layouts so that your defences adequately deal with the hazards for each level. As you proceed you get access to better structures, which allow you to complete new levels and replay earlier levels and finish them more completely. Different levels have different hazards, but also different handicaps on your ship.The story is funny at times, but not really a big part of the game. The later levels are hard, and just surviving is often a challenge. There are some subtle (and not-so-subtle) references to various sci-fi series, and plenty of replayability. For a completionist there's easily 20 hours of fun. Just to complete each mission will give you at least 10 hours of enjoyment.			"

												If you're a Tower Defense fan like me, you're going to love this game. It brings with it some of the basics you've come to love, while adding a ton of new features. While in a standard TD type game you are just defending a path, in this game you're a moving ""platform"" that asteroids and enemy ships come from unknown directions at all time, forcing you to fortify every position properly.Add to it that you're transporting cargo for a specific company each time, and every piece of cargo takes up space on your ship, which further limits your building space. In addition to forementioned things each cargo type also have special abilities that will hinder you even further. Things like drawing power from your towers, Nuclear waste that can blow you up if hit or just snobby travellers that need to be positioned on the outside limiting your guns shooting angles.Overall a great game, and definitely worth it for the price, even outside of sales! I sincerely hope they add more through DLC's or even a second, third, fourth etc game!			"

												Fun twist on tower defense. Some of the missions, you basically need to play first so you know whats comming from where, so you can plan your defense. This leads to restarting missions quite a bit. Unlike typical tower defense, there is no set it and forget it here, you are involved constantly. Modifing defenses, changing turret orientation/mode, activating specials, collecting salvage all keep you at the edge of your seat.Pros:Fun new take on tower defenseKeeps you always involvedCons:Getting new towers is bittersweet since they are often hard to place.Many levels require a bit of trial and error to get right "

A pause button is only going to encourage you to continue being a weak, demanding, immature child.I applaud the developer for standing his ground and refusing to add a pause button.

												Space Run is a very good game.It is stressful and strategic, forcing you to make make quick decisions about where to place weapons, shields, engines and cargo. More engines means a faster ship, so you get more money for a fast delivery at the end of the level. But the engines takes up space that could be used for your guns to protect you from attacks from the rear.Do you build the powerful high-end equipment, for maximum shield and fire power, or the cheaper low end stuff that takes up far less space on your ship? That is up to you to decide, based on your playing style.A drawback to the game is that several levels can be very trial and error, but on the other hand the game does encourage you to replay previous missions with your new upgrades to make more money. Some players want a pause button, but to me that would ruin some of the intense stress that helps make the game more fun and a challenge.All in all a very enjoyable action/strategy/tower defense game that I do recommend.

												I've had my eye on this game for quite a while. Probably since the first feature of this game came out. It looked exciting and fun overall.  Space Run did not disappoint. If anything, if you would forgive the pun, Space Run has delivered. The graphics are great but you won't be able to get a close-up of anything much since the game will either rain laser death or gigantic asteroids (yes, still of death) on you if you're caught unawares.  The sound effects and tracks are just downright awesome.  The gameplay can be a whir of clicking this and that most of the time but that's what sets it apart from other tower defense games. This game deserves to be in your library, I think.  Though be it too short and a tad bit high on the price range.			"

												Space Run is lots of fun, quite simply put. It is a strategy-action tower defense game, the strategy being the careful (or purely random, as you fancy) placement of towers and the action being the pleasure of watching lots of enemy ships (and platforms) explode on your screen. Space Run has you coming back for more, with difficult runs (missions) that require multiple play-throughs to understand the best way to tackle them. Some runs are worth doing several times, even though you beat them quite easily.The power-ups, weapons, and various 'towers' that you can build have you coming back for more, not to mention the good graphics and rather funny story (you're a courier boy and sometimes, you courier toxic waste... go figure).I would recommend this game to anyone and warn them of the many hours they'll spend playing it. Good job game devs. God bless.			"

The controls are straight forward though a bit tricky to master, they are not completely nesscary though may help later on. For a new look casual Tower Defense I reccommend it.			"

A pause button is only going to encourage you to continue being a weak, demanding, immature child.I applaud the developer for standing his ground and refusing to add a pause button. Today's young need to be encouraged to become strong men. They don't need to be catered to so they remain immature brats.			"

												Smart tower defense game. The hex-building mechanics keep each mission feeling fresh and every cargo you have to haul has its own unique challenges (eg. they take up awkward amounts of hexes and drain ship power etc). There is a lot you are asked to manage somewhat frantically - collected resources (which requires weapons, which you also need for defense), the speed of your ship, and how your components fit and work together. There is even a witty android co-pilot to wisecrack at your progress. There is definitely enough here that any tower defense fan will love and find very fresh. This is a must buy if you enjoyed Defense Grid or pretty much any other tower defense game.			"

It is intense yet so addictive and its combat system and upgrades are so easy to pick up which means the fun isn't delayed by endless google searches of how to upgrade. It has delibirate cheesey humour which complements the action and has a way of calming you down when you don't have enough hexnuts to buy another weapon.			"

												(my first ever review) I highly recommend this game to any strategy fan.  There's enough variety to keep you enthralled for a few hours, lots of action during later missions so quick thinking and quick responses are essential.  Thoughtful placement of cargo at the start of later missions is critical, so it's a bit like a puzzle game as well.  I've had lots of fun with this one and it was well worth the money so I just had to write a review.			"

												I was really impressed by the balance in this game. It's a fun tower defense game to start with, but add in a lot of interesting upgrades, each with their own tactical implications, and thiis game becomes truly engaging. Add to this a loose story line with excellent voice acting, stunning visuals, a heckling sidekick, and you have a winner.The only criticism I can offer, and it's light criticism, is that I rarely used or never even touched some of the most upper-tier upgrades in completing the game. I still have no idea how much they add to my ship. Even so, this was an excellent game, and I was glad to spend my time and money on it.			"

												An excellent take on Tower Defence games, surrounding it with a delightful coating of fun story and atmosphere, humour and simply awesome gameplay. It works so well that I've having so much enjoyment, which is telling, since I really don't generally enjoy tower defence game. But it manage to bring out my love of spaceships and space, especially when it involves lots of LAZORZ. This game is an absolute must have for all tower defence games and if you are like me, who enjoy anything that have you flying amongst the stars or games set in space, GET IT while Steam Sales last. Although this game deserves its full price as well. "

												This was a great little time waster. Totally worth the money. The ""campaign"" itself is fairly short, but I still managed to spend 30 hours in the game. The tech tree is well designed, and varies enough that you never stop using the early technologies. They remain useful (often the best choice) all through the game.The little shout-outs to other sci-fi franchises are a fun addition as well. You'll recognize many of the ship silhouettes.As long as you realize that the game doesn't have a ton of content going in, I'd give this game a 3+ with a re-roll. It could definitely use some DLC though...just a few more new missions. Please?			"

												Pretty fun game so far. I would buy it if it's on sell if you enjoy the genre. I have not beat the game but have played quite a few levels and bosses.  What it is It's a typical get from point A to point B type of game. There is a backstory involved. You have to protect your cargo from all of the enemies space throws at you as well asteroids, other ships, and bosses. Story Not much to speak of here. It's mainly there just to supply a context as to why you are transporting the cargo across the galaxy. There are factions that you work for to transport different types of cargo or people. It's very short and to the point, the clear focus is on the gameplay with this one and not so much the story.  Audio Well it's voice acted, nothing mind blowing but it gets the job done. The sounds are typical SCI FI sounds. Some Pew Pew, rocket thrusters when you put them on your ship, and explosions when appropriate. GAMEPLAY Here's the important section. First off, this game DOES NOT hold your hand for long. You will die and die some more before you get the right combination and strategy to beat the numerous levels and bosses. It's very fastpaced and click intensive at times. If you don't move your guns fast enough or point them in the right direction quickly then it can easily be a game over. I really like the gameplay, if you are someone that can't take failure well then you might want to move on. I like the challenge and it requires alot of management. If your gun you just purchased is facing the wrong way and you can't reorient it, then you have a useless gun. Overall I really enjoy the game play, you have to strategize correctly. That includes where you place your cargo, where you put your thrusters, guns, missiles, shields, generators, etc. Your ship will get very large and will take alot of critical thinking to utilize the space available on your ship to win. If there is a smoking gun, easy mode skill that makes the game easier I have not discovered it yet and hope there isn't one.  RATING   7.5/10	    - They could have improved the story, maybe something that you could be invested in. It seems to be just there to support WHY your guy is speeding through the galaxy. IN a game like this it would be awesome if we had a way to create levels for each other that would challenge even the best players. Another hit on them is the ship is stationary in your lane. It would be great if we could move the ship around the lane to potentially avoid enemy fire or asteroids. Choosing between reorienting that gun, adding another thruster, repairing your missile launcher, OR moving your ship around the lane in an already fluid environment would be great and add in another element to choose from. TL;DR: 7.5/10 I would reccommend this game. Most of my complaints have nothing to do with the developers obvious purpose with the game, the GAMEPLAY itself. They definitely succeeded there, but I feel like they could have accomplished alot more to add new elements to the game and increase its logevity.  "

There is a decent upgrade/tech system here, precision and intensity are required for the more challenging runs, and there is a lot of replay value on the more complex missions especially after you gain more tech unlocks.

												Absolutley an amazing game. Very strategic and fun, with great design and character/style elements in the weapons and ship.Several people here are whining that ""it's too hard"" ""can only beat by looking up walkthroughs"" this is absolutely pathetic; the game is meant to be strategic! Figuring out how to build your ship, and what is the best design for each level is the goal and is what makes it so much fun in the first place! I'm almost done with the game (have two levels to go) and have thoroughly enjoyed it all the way through.Highly recommend, I purchased it for $3 on a mega steam sale, and even though I wouldn't have gotten it if it weren't for that, I would gladly pay the $20 pricetag for future sequals. Two thumbs up to the developers.			"

												It's tower defense with a different facade.Position your weapons carefully; in addition to choosing the right weapon you have to take firing arcs into consideration.  Turrets cannot be upgraded directly, however they do have special abilities that can be activated at a cost.  Timing those abilities can be a huge difference maker.Most tower defense games revolve around killing the enemy quickly.  Space Run takes a different approach, it's about arriving at your destination as fast as possible with all of your cargo.  Thus you'll have to balance adding engines and other defenses such as shields and anti-missle turrets in order to get the best possible score.Your reward for success is reputation and money.  Reputation unlocks missions, weapons and upgrades.  Money is required to purchase those upgrades.  These unlocks include new turret types, faster engines, special abilities you can use in-game or flat passive bonuses that make a certain turret more effective.One thing that keeps things interesting is varying types of cargo.  Some cargo simply needs to make it there in tact, other cargo introduces new difficulties such as draining nearby modules so they're harder to power, or modules that must be connected by the end of the map (costing you space and resources).   When carrying nuclear warheads you even have the option to use one of them on the enemy, though doing so will cost you as that warhead can't be delivered for obvious reasons.Overall, it's fun.  My biggest complaint is it's too easy. I've gotten a perfect score the first try on most missions, the remaining ones have been a narrow miss.  There's also little to replay and unfortunately weapons just aren't varied enough.  In general building whatever the best weapon you have access to is the right decision.  Maps also have a tendency to favor sending enemies in from one direction, it makes planning your build up rather easy and predictable.  Additionally, while the game offers something like 30 maps they tend to feel very redundant.Expect to get about 10 hours out of it, 20 if you're struggling and have to replay a lot.			"

												Awesome.  Hits the adrenaline booster just right.  Replayability is so good, that I just seem to hang around the same stages so I don't wear the game out too fast.  That said, the upgrades you unlock with each mission spur you on to get that extra burst of speed to beat your best time.  I'd love to see a 'Ghost Ship' toggle option, ala racing games, pop up now and then, marking your best time, or where you exploded in previous mission runs. Try to make it look spooky.A tip to newcomers, you can just reorient your guns by clicking the gun and moving the mouse, you don't have to click the 'Reorient' button and remember, only your ""Cargo"" has to get there fast, for the best possible score, regardless of how many other modules you lose. Still, Nuking every last threat is a fun challenge also.			"

												brilliant game. it gets hard on the later missions, but it bloody well worth it's price. this game shares it's core with the tower defence games, but gives it a competitive edge by making the attacks coming from everywhere, following a pattern that needs to be understood to be used at it's finest. dont expect to use the fights to breathe a bit, like in Sanctum, you NEED to stay active all the time and to repair as soon as you can damaged modules, and  unlike Sanctum the assault waves are timed, so you cant loose any second when building.you have to balance defence, assault and jetpower to get the score. not enough firepower? you die. no defence (situationnal)? you die. not enough jetpower? you dont finish the job, you dont get paid.Tense is the word.endorsed.

												Space Run is a clever little game, a nice twist on the tower defence gameplay. Lots of different weapons and modules with which to outfit your ship make for some interesting combinations. Some micromanaging is required during some of the more intense fights, as you are constantly trying to maximise damage output while minimising risk to your own vessel.the only downside I can find so far is the fact that some, if not all runs, can not be completed with full points on the first try. Unless you're lucky off course. Enemy waves pass your vessel from all sides, but during levels not every side of your ship is attacked with equal ferocity. This means that building a symmetrical ship is usually a bad idea, either because it costs too much, or because you have dps pointing in a direction that is seeing no action. This problem is most felt before the mission begins, when you place your key delivery structures. These take up space you might need. If placed on the wrong side of your ship, you may not be able to defend against the enemy waves effectively. This means several plays of the same trip will probably be required to find the right set up for each mission.A good game, nice mechanics and gameplay, allthough a little frustrating from time to time when you get blindsided by that last enemy wave coming up on the side of your ship you can't effectively defend.

												Spaceship Building and tower defense clash perfectly in this fast paced game. It keeps you on your toes most of the time, if you arent trying to keep pirates from destroying your cargo, theres more than likely asteroids coming right at you. The story is great and the ability to upgrade your weapons is very nice. My only complaint is you cant pick how your ship looks before you start building, there seem to be ""preset"" ship chassis that you put pieces on, but i can overlook that for the fun gameplay.Recommended, would make an amazing mobile game.

												'Easy to play, difficult to master'. This old ad line comes to my mind after playing Space Run for 3 hours straight after purchase. Interface is great, graphics are fine, voice acting is excellent, and the game has great replay value. It has taken me maybe 4-5 runs of each mission to achieve maximum score but replaying does not feel like grind: the missions themselves are (so far at least - I have unlocked only 6 or 7) relatively short, the longest one I clocked at about 8 minutes. Space Run makes it quite easy for us obsessive-compulsive gamer nerds to let go and come back to it later.As I write this, I am thinking really hard to find something wrong with this title but really the only thing I can come up with is that *maybe* somebody might find the soundtrack a bit too repetitive. But given how much Space Run has to offer, and considering how cheap it is, that's really not an issue. You could always play your favorite music in the background and turn off game music from the menu.If you're hesitating, I'd say give Space Run a go: chances are, you will like it, and the price is great (there is a 25% discount as I write this, but even without it, the game is worth every penny).See you in space!

												A unique game worthy of a second playthrough (to see if you can get 5 stars every time without repeating missions for cash). It is complex enough to have strategic depth, but still elegant and just the right difficulty for an intelligent, quick-thinking gamer (admittedly with a few spikes).Its only mechanical flaw is that you will need a high APM to micromanage optimally, especially since they made the silly decision to make you pick up resources manually. Some people will wish the game had a way to slow or stop time without restrictions.The story has a few funny moments, but it has way more cring-worthy ones, and sometimes they won't let you skip cutscenes (you can skip the dialogue but the visual doesn't speed up if you're in a mission).

												Have you ever played the tabletop game 'Galaxy Trucker'? If yes, imagine a single-player version of it, mixed with Real-Time Tower Defense.If you haven't, well, a few more words.Personally, I'm not a fan of regular tower defense games, but generally the more irregular ones (e.g. Dungeon Defenders) do strike a chord for me. So, along comes Space Run. I bought it more on a whim, because it reminded me of the above mentioned tabletop game, which I immensely enjoy.So, what is it with this game?Essentially, you're a guy tasked to ship stuff from A to B, as fast as possible, and hopefully without losing any of the stuff you're supposed to ship. To fulfill this task you get an empty ship made from hex-tiles which you can then populate with weapons, defenses, and of course the cargo you're supposed to transport. However, you only place the cargo (and generally a single cheap engine) at the beginning of the round. The rest you have to build, rebuild and manage when and as the situation demands with funds you gain during the rounds from destroying random asteroids, enemies and such. The placement of your constructions is a key feature, e.g. engines can only be built on tiles that face space behind the ship, while turrets can be placed in any direction at the edge of your ship, but then can only fire in the directions they can reach. So you'll soon find that one of the most important creeds of your game is going to be 'Location, Location, Location'.While the first levels (imo) were starting out pretty easy, the latter ones do have a tendency to become rather hectic and challenging, especially when you have to start to compromise (or rather, optimize) wether you need more space for engines to meet a higher quality deadline or rather place another turret to prevent your other engines from getting wrecked by enemy fire.Inbetween rounds you have then the Engineering section where you can upgrade the constructions you already have or unlock new ones from the money that you received during your missions. You can repeat your missions as often as you like, so running your favorite runs multiple times to gather up some money is not a bad idea, especially since getting the best ratings in the later levels really requires the good stuff, in addition to your knowledge how to best use what in which situation. All constructions have 3 upgrade, 2 of which are active abilities, that all differ immensely (at least in the weapon section), and one passive.The ""story"" of the game is pretty weak and is basically nothing much more than an explanation of 'You're a guy shipping stuff from A to B, so here, ship some stuff from A to B.', but honestly, that doesn't really matter, because, hey, shipping stuff from A to B is a lot of fun here. The game is split into several 'chapters', each with their own type of freight to be transported. Those freights will give you different handicaps that make your life only harder.As for replayability: Well, I'm not sure what happens when you have all the high-scores on all the tracks with all items unlocked, but I guess nothing. So even if I wouldn't say it has insta-replayablity value once finished (which might take some time; I haven't unlocked all the missions yet, and don't have the top-scores on several of those I've done already), but I definetly can see myself coming back to it from time to time just for a few fun rounds.So far I've been enjoying the game very much and would recommend it. I've heard that some people complained about lags and crashes, but it seems that I had the luck of not being affected by any of those, so the game ran fine for me.			"

But what puts it above and beyond is the humor in the game, which as time passes really will bring a smile to your lips.I got this on 50% discount and it is a wonderful buy, I easily rank it in enjoyment with the some of best at that price.

												Wow Am totally exhausted Steam I owe you for this but then again I Loved every second of it! You guys always put the best Games out there, along with the Best Reviews, support, workshops. I started soaking up all the classic games around 6pm est...scrolling getting flashbacks and being put into a state of total amazement...I only wanted to buy a game is that asking to much? I compared graphic capatabilities, popularity, omg even production teams...you guys have turned me into a computer WHIZ. I've learned tweaking even complex programing. One almost always has to know the limits of their CPU but now because am aware of memory I am paranoid about filling it up with all the great games you offer espcially when weekend specials roll around!! Its now 6am EST.So let me review Space Run besides being the best priced game Ive ever found its so much fun you really have a hard time quiting. Each level grows in difficulty but with your equipment updates youll have a good chance if you place your gear in the right position and repair it often. Speed is the key here because the AI is great at taking out your engines, shields etc., plan accordingly. The sound effects are fantastic the stories fantastic playability fantastic...and now I have to explain to my spouse How I managed to get a secound great game at another great price. I am to tired to give a secound review otherwise I would besides I need Breakfast LOL. I will say this Distiny Original Sin Enhanced Yersion omg and I'll leave it at this If you haven't played either of these and you own a PC shame on you. Steam I've been a customer for along time now and your selection, support, policies, products are simply amazing. Thank You for feeding my Gamer appitite again.

												This is a good game and fun to play, but it is not great. The reason for this is that you cannot take too many different paths through the generic levels.You basically have to find the best way and stick with it. Having random levels or randomized aspects of levels could improve the replay value of areas, but this is sadly not available. Difficulty ramps up dramatically and you either repeat exactly the now boring levels of before to get credits or you do something that will probably kill you several times before you do exactly what the game wants you to.All the while this is decent fun and I don't regret buying it for 2.5€ at 75% off, but given the miniscule variety and stagnant level design, what could otherwise be a great game is now only (still definitely) a good game.7/10 - would buy again at 75% off.

Product received for free
												A fun retreatment of the tower defense genre.  You have a lot of flexibility with how to place your weaponry, equipment and payloads. There is no one loadout that always works; you've got to plan ahead and improvise while balancing where you're spending your money. Every choice matters and surviving a mission is very challenging but rewarding. You are also limited by the shape of your spacecraft. Each mission has a differently-shaped ship which forces you to make difficult choices about where to place which parts and when.The writing is pretty fun as well. There are a few dialogs between some of the levels and they never go overboard.However there were times that the game felt a bit grindy. You are basically forced to repeat some of the earlier levels to earn more money to buy later upgrades, and yes you can use late-game upgrades to get better ratings on early levels. It made the 5-star victories feel a bit cheaper; it seems like they were never balanced to be beaten on pure skill alone, and getting a perfect rating in the game will simply require unlocking all the upgrades. This won't be a big deal to most, but true completionists will know what I'm talking about.All in all I definitely recommend this game to fans of TD and strategy games. It's well polished and easy to pick up.			"

Because you don't know what locations are important, you don't know what to do without restarting, and you need to restart to get a better score, and need a better score to get better equipment, and need better equipment to do better on levels.

												Nice take on the tower defense genre. The game is fairly micro intensive on most levels, especially later on. The game manages to keep the pressure on with a thrust system which moves you along a linear track with timed runs. Thrust takes up the same space your guns do, so a significant amount of planning is required. The first few missions are very easy to get perfects playing it by ear, but the later levels will require you to take into account which waves come from which direction when, what sorts of defense is needed, and how much thrust you need to maintain during replays. Content-wise the game is a bit light at the moment. Hopefully, this game will be expanded upon with free updates or some significant DLCs. 7 out of 10.			"

												This is a very welcome addition to the tower defense genre.  Loads of fun and a very novel approach!  The voice acting detracts from the game's personality when it should have added to it, but that's the only downside for me.  Replayability is also limited because there are a limited number of levels.  This game would have benefited greatly from either randomized missions or some kind of ""forever"" mode.  Aside from that, it's still very fun while it lasts.			"

												Went on special offer today, been keeping my out for that and i must admit this game is pretty fun.Only played an hour so far, but if it weren't so humid and hot today I would continue playing.Very much as commentated upon by a curator on the store page.Great story, nice graphics and nice gameplay that is introduced to the player in a light and humerous manner.Tower defense with a twist i would say and not too easy, but also not back breakingly hard so far. The story leads you through different missions and I am really looking forward to finishing it again.Already had a mission i wasn't able to complete with full points and looking forward to revisiting it later on but going to finish the storyline first.For everyone that enjoys some slap stick space humour á la han solo and a good round of Tower defence. It's only about 6 bucks and that's totally worth it.Graphics are great and only have to concentrate on equipping the weapons  and thrusters.Upgrades after each mission, too.Lovely so far.			"

												There is a lot to like about Space Run and few detractors.  Visuals and color pallet are good, the music is enjoyable without being too mellow or overbearing, and the limited voice acting conveys the story appropriately.  Space Run follows the traditional build towers as the level progresses and the warning radar informs you where to best place towers for the upcoming wave.  This game would be much better with more levels available (or a randomizer), but the client differences are the spice of this game.  Most tower defense are the same thing beginning to end, but, in Space Run the client's containers change up the level approach significantly; kudos for making the cargo affect the game.  Big Cargo pods can be located anywhere, Nuclear Star material is best kept safe toward the interior of the ship or you risk massive explosions, VIP Travel cabins are forced to the edge where you lose valuable turret placement options, and the other two clients also throw curves into their missions.  The missions themselves are paced correctly, are not overly long making it easy to replay for five star rankings, and any difficulty can be overcome with a tactical alteration.  I'd like to see some challenge zones with upfront tower building and some configurable ship layouts choices, but as it stands, Space Run is a unique and fun tower defense game.			"

												If you're a Tower Defense fan like me, you're going to love this game. It brings with it some of the basics you've come to love, while adding a ton of new features. While in a standard TD type game you are just defending a path, in this game you're a moving ""platform"" that asteroids and enemy ships come from unknown directions at all time, forcing you to fortify every position properly.Add to it that you're transporting cargo for a specific company each time, and every piece of cargo takes up space on your ship, which further limits your building space. In addition to forementioned things each cargo type also have special abilities that will hinder you even further. Things like drawing power from your towers, Nuclear waste that can blow you up if hit or just snobby travellers that need to be positioned on the outside limiting your guns shooting angles.Overall a great game, and definitely worth it for the price, even outside of sales! I sincerely hope they add more through DLC's or even a second, third, fourth etc game!			"

												A really interesting and inituitive take on strategy bult up with a simple but good looking graphics system. This is the next level of Indie games.In space run you are given the task of making it from point A to point B, you fly a space ship holding valuable cargo and it must make its way to base via a route as quick as possible, this basicly means youre flying in the face of danger. Worry not, for your tools against imminent doom are plentiful. As you fly, topspeed, you must find a balance betwen speed, survival and offence using resources gained in the heat of battle to build extra engines, turrets and other spaceship goodies.The game has the basic addictive tenets of most tower defense games, but suffers slightly less replayability since its basic premise is to complete a combative time-trial, meaning that there is no ""endless mode"" as is for most tower defense games, and yes this is a tower defense game. Although space ships are involved, your ships ""movement"" is a direct path orchestrated by your cargo supplier in each mission, and your opponents invariably show up to lay the hurt on you.The intesting extra twist that makes this game fun is that you are not protecting a base,but rather, you ARE the base. As you take damage your cargo gets destroyed and your ship gets dismantled, that means your reward and rank for completing the mission goes down and the space you have to build stuff shrinks. Furthermore, because youre on the clock, bunkering down is not a valid tactic, you need to go fast enough to complete the mission (with extra rewards for accomplishing it post-haste) and you need to be tough enough to survive attacks (and preferably kill the attackers to harvest their loot, lest you become too starved for cash to survive against the ever tougher enemies).I highly reccomend this game to fans of RTS, TD , Strategy games and Indie games in general.

												Ah, trucking of the future! Build turrets to deal with pirates, shields to protect your ship and cargo, and engines to make sure you get there on time.The game is functionally a tower defense where the enemies are trying to destroy you and your towers instead of ignoreing them to reach an objective. The fast pace of the game provides a good challenge, as do certain cargos.The only downside to the game is that the main characters can become very grating over time. But they can be muted.			"

												When I first saw this game, it was quite an interesting concept. A combination of a Tower Defense style with some additional strategy added into the mix. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. I decided to give it a shot and it is certainly worth the price tag. As I am progressing through the levels I find myself needing to go back and redo levels to get better scores and achievements. You have the ability to upgrade your ships abilities and turrets whether it be a more defensive approach or just all out offensive. This is definitely something I can see providing hours and hours of a good time.The learning curve is quite small. After a couple levels it was easy to catch on and it throws you right into the mix which is very enjoyable rather than a long drawn out tutorial. There is some relatively comedic banter between the android on your ship and others that offer you jobs as well as your characters random one liners. All in all it's a pretty good looking product with a lot of potential for multiple play throughs of each of the levels whether it be making sure you deliver all the cargo without any losses, to trying to get the quickest delivery to get the higher reputation score. The reputation equates to unlocking more levels. More levels mean that you have so many new ship designs which keep you on your toes when it comes to the placement of your turrets. Thumbs up. I definitely recommend giving this one a shot.			"

												Spaceship Building and tower defense clash perfectly in this fast paced game. It keeps you on your toes most of the time, if you arent trying to keep pirates from destroying your cargo, theres more than likely asteroids coming right at you. The story is great and the ability to upgrade your weapons is very nice. My only complaint is you cant pick how your ship looks before you start building, there seem to be ""preset"" ship chassis that you put pieces on, but i can overlook that for the fun gameplay.Recommended, would make an amazing mobile game.

												Tower defence disguised as space exploration with strong puzzle elements.You place different structures on preset ship layouts so that your defences adequately deal with the hazards for each level. As you proceed you get access to better structures, which allow you to complete new levels and replay earlier levels and finish them more completely. Different levels have different hazards, but also different handicaps on your ship.The story is funny at times, but not really a big part of the game. The later levels are hard, and just surviving is often a challenge. There are some subtle (and not-so-subtle) references to various sci-fi series, and plenty of replayability. For a completionist there's easily 20 hours of fun. Just to complete each mission will give you at least 10 hours of enjoyment.			"

												A pretty good TD for OCD players like me.My main beef was that the DPS option was much better than the ""trying to be clever with defense items"" option, and that the dialogue was as bad as can be.i enjoyed it while it lasted though, but I can`t find a reason to replay.			"

												While not the best of tower-defense games, it is quite addictive. Fairly hectic and with unknown enemy directions, it forces you  to replay the same levels several times to get the best result. That part could have been better, but hey, the game doesn't cost much.			"

												One of the best Tower Defence(TD) game I have ever played! Very fast pace, lots of micro, and entremely engaging! You get a set ship layout for each mission which you than build towers and engines on. Engines make it so you get a bonus to how much cargo you kept alive. Towers help you make it to the end alive. You have many upgrades which you unlock throughout the game. Missions can be played more than once and which time you beat it you get money to spend on upgrades. Anyone who likes TDs get this game! Totally worth $20+			"

												This is a verry hard game, but nice to pop in and out. Unlocking new structures is fun but expensive. The story is pretty bland. Basically you are a space trucker and act like you're the♥♥♥♥♥♥even though the cargo is usualy delivered full of laser holes. Its a backwards tower defence game where you can only place the towers in your base and instead of a path enemies screw you from all directions. You have to decide whether to spend you cash (hexnuts) on defence, offence, or utility. None of your decisions will matter though when asteroids destroy you entirely. You can murder innocent fellow space runners with no attack for money yet somehow even though you are doing the same thing as the pirates no one seems to care. It a really fun and strategic game. A pause button might be nice as the game makes you want to rip your♥♥♥♥♥♥off at every corner. I give it 89/122 AmeriPoints			"

												A variant of tower defense where your ship is made of tiles in which you can buy and place a variety of offensive, defensive, and utility structures. Story is minimal and is just something to string together the scenarios but there's enough flavor, humor, and characters with personality (although one-dimensional/no development) that it strings it together well enough for me.You need to balance your combat structures (that destroy things to gain more money and let you survive to the end) with engine structures (that are necessary for speed bonuses). You unlock new structures by spending points you gain by completing mission objectives. You'll have to grind a little but it isn't so bad if you like to spend time repeating missions to try and get a 5-star rank. However, sometimes it's better to just come back later when you've unlocked the better (although more expensive to place) structures.There are four types of scenarios, each with unique structures you're forced to place onto the ship that waste space and sometimes have additional negative effects.It feels like scenarios aren't randomly generated. There are set tiles and seemingly set enemy spawns and patterns. It's pretty nice from a puzzle/high-score aspect because you can figure out and optimize the best build order. I'm pretty surprised that there is no score attack mode/leaderboards because it feels like it would fit well. However, not having randomly generated missions also means that anyone who really likes it will run out of 'fresh' content.I would have liked to be able to switch difficulty (rather than be locked into one difficulty the whole time). Or at least be able to have all difficulties on the same profile so you can easily switch between difficulties (and progress is separate for each difficulty). As it is you'd have to go back to the main menu to switch profiles for a different difficulty.Worth a look for people who enjoy tower defense and would like something with a little spin on it.			"

												Space Run is a twist on tower defense where you protect your ship from all angles while traveling through space. There are lots of weapons and upgrades and many levels require a different strategy. The story is a bit clique, but for a tower defense game to have story at all is nice. The game is fairly long, but each level only takes about 10 minutes. Space Run is definitely worth a buy if you are fan of the genre or want to kill some space pirates in your free time.			"

The game just feels right, the general idea, the mechanics, the balancing, the different abilities, the difficulty, the length of the missions, the graphics, just everything. Even the dialogue is entertaining at times (I didn't think it would be!).I can recommend this game to players who like: space games, strategy games, tower defences or even as kind of a time management game, as Space Run combines them all into something great.

												I really like this game. It is an interesting take on tower defense but it's even more fun to upgrade a spaceship than to just put towers around a map.The only thing that seems to need work is the progression. Everything is fun and smooth until 53 stars. (Level 53?) It's not the end yet,  but it's now almost impossible to get new stars. Furthermore, the currency is so worthless at this point that it's really hard to buy further upgrades. How about allowing unused nuts to become currency at the end of each map? I don't want to keep running the same maps grinding out money to update something insignificant. Without doing so, you'll never get to the true upgrades that will help you progress.Games don't have to last forever. Artificially preventing me from completing a game by forcing me to grind is not the same as actually building in more hours worth of content. I stopped playing Final Fantasy for just this reason. Let's not pretend this is a good idea.The game is fun and worth the money I paid for it. The only thing lacking is my sense of accomplishment from finishing the game. Unfortunately, at this point I'm tired of running the same maps over and over....			"

												Space Run is a very good game.It is stressful and strategic, forcing you to make make quick decisions about where to place weapons, shields, engines and cargo. More engines means a faster ship, so you get more money for a fast delivery at the end of the level. But the engines takes up space that could be used for your guns to protect you from attacks from the rear.Do you build the powerful high-end equipment, for maximum shield and fire power, or the cheaper low end stuff that takes up far less space on your ship? That is up to you to decide, based on your playing style.A drawback to the game is that several levels can be very trial and error, but on the other hand the game does encourage you to replay previous missions with your new upgrades to make more money. Some players want a pause button, but to me that would ruin some of the intense stress that helps make the game more fun and a challenge.All in all a very enjoyable action/strategy/tower defense game that I do recommend.

It works so well that I've having so much enjoyment, which is telling, since I really don't generally enjoy tower defence game. But it manage to bring out my love of spaceships and space, especially when it involves lots of LAZORZ. This game is an absolute must have for all tower defence games and if you are like me, who enjoy anything that have you flying amongst the stars or games set in space, GET IT while Steam Sales last.

												This was a great little time waster. Totally worth the money. The ""campaign"" itself is fairly short, but I still managed to spend 30 hours in the game. The tech tree is well designed, and varies enough that you never stop using the early technologies. They remain useful (often the best choice) all through the game.The little shout-outs to other sci-fi franchises are a fun addition as well. You'll recognize many of the ship silhouettes.As long as you realize that the game doesn't have a ton of content going in, I'd give this game a 3+ with a re-roll. It could definitely use some DLC though...just a few more new missions. Please?			"

If you are not satisfied with the first run, you can do the mission again, probably with improved gear, and an idea on how to beat it.Great feeling when you finish a 5 star run with a ship that barely flies, with a single engine and all your cargo on their last hp.It's not a heavy nor deep game, but a small, fun game to waste a few minutes... or hours.

												Smart tower defense game. The hex-building mechanics keep each mission feeling fresh and every cargo you have to haul has its own unique challenges (eg. they take up awkward amounts of hexes and drain ship power etc). There is a lot you are asked to manage somewhat frantically - collected resources (which requires weapons, which you also need for defense), the speed of your ship, and how your components fit and work together. There is even a witty android co-pilot to wisecrack at your progress. There is definitely enough here that any tower defense fan will love and find very fresh. This is a must buy if you enjoyed Defense Grid or pretty much any other tower defense game.			"

												Similar breed to the amazing FTL, Space Run is a real-time strategy game where you are supposed to repel fixed enemy attack waves from level to level while delivering different cargo and keeping an eye on your speed and available time. After a successful mission, depending on your combat performance you can upgrade your equipment that is necessary to defeat later levels and vapourise the stronger and stronger opponents. Fun!Apart from the addictive gameplay, the thing that I like really here is the clean game design and attention on details. Great work.I'd recommend this game to everyone basically. If you are a casual gamer, you will surely have some fun during the 10-minutes gameplay. Also, deeper strategists will find maxing out the levels challenging at places. So, go get it, it's the 2016 February game sales, X-mas reloaded.			"

												OK... I think I lost track of time playing this game which should be a pretty good sign. This is a tower defense type of game where you place progressively gun turret, thruster and the such on your ship while trying to deliver precious cargo.  After play phase, you can use earned credit for upgrade and purchase new items (some being unlock based on your reputation... that make the game a little bit more difficult).The game is well done but there is fews cons in the game:-  The view of your ship might be too small to see exactly what is going on - No way to zoom in as far as I know-  Navigation around your ship (to see what is coming to hurt you, or at least trying) is done with the arrow keys... That is darn old way to do it but it is necessary since the WASD keys are use as other shortcut.- The dialogue can be humoristic but there are too many repeats during the game mode to be enjoyable (like three or four phrases used randomly for key moment).  If you ever played Sacred 1 or 2... you see what I mean.It is currently bundled on the weekly humble bundle in the pay what you want tier... that means you can get this game for less than a dollar... That is sweet.			"

												In this mix between real time strategy and tower defence, you play a transporter for several companies against meteorites, competitors and pirates.The game is very well done: game mechanics are somewhat innovative, there is a sort of a story and a bit of humour, the interface is well thought out, quick and easy to use for the real time side of the game. Graphics are excellent. Mission difficulty grows little by little, imposing the use of new weapons and support items.Replayability and length are the downside of the game.To earn the fifth star you need to learn a map by heart, and only one strategy applies. A slight mistake in timing - adding an engine just a little bit too late, and you have to replay the whole level. Playing becomes grinding and late levels are no longer enjoyable as you had to retake so many times each preceding level.It is still a good game, plenty of pleasure to go through early to mid game, even replaying the first levels is agreable, when you come back after having discovered a new trick. Do not deny yourself the pleasure of discovering this game, even if you will shelve it after a dozen hours.			"

Bite-sized tower defense that forces you to be quite active; reorienting guns, activating module abilities, rebuilding modules, etc.Story and dialog is coated on pretty thin but the game does a good job of ramping you up to the more advanced modules.

												Super fun take on tower defense in space. If you've ever played the board games Galaxy Trucker or Space Alert, you've got the general feel for the game and the frequent ""oh♥♥♥♥♥♥I just barely made it through THAT"" moments. It gets very difficult pretty quick and I had to go back and play previously completed missions to get enough upgrades to make it to the next area. Overall I really enjoyed the game and it's well worth the price of admission for such a fun and unique take on tower defense. If that's your style pick this up!			"

												Very nice take on the tower defense genre- in some ways it reverses the standards to create a somewhat unique concept.As Buck Mann, *the* space truckiest space trucker, it's your job to deliver cargo no matter what. You do it fast and you do it safe and that's why people hire you despite your despicable hat. There is a bit of a story (which I haven't played through fully yet), but it's forgettable. Lots of people hire you, there's some crossing of purposes and shady space pirates, but that's about it. It's all just cut-scenes and dialog portraits but, as a nice surprise, it's all fully voiced. And the voice acting is not bad either. In fact it's quite good. All characters have a distinct personality, from rough-and-ready Buck Mann to salty (space) sea-dog Brown Beard. It's fun listening to their banter.But you don't play these games for their plot. This is tower defense, only this time, you... well... instead of having a level where enemies walk down paths and you plop down towers, the level flies through space. No wait, that really is how things are.Each level is a straigh path, and you have a spacecraft made of connected cells. Everything from cargo to engines to weapons is placed on these cells. As you travel across your route obstacled and enemies fly in from all directions, and it's your task to build up your defenses in such a way that you can take out those pesky asteroids, pirates, and whatnot, earning credits (hexnuts, in this case, don't ask!) to build more stuff. All your constructions can be upgraded in several ways; allowing you to rotate guns on the fly, increase the radius of shields, or have destroyed cells drop some credits to allow faster rebuilding. It's all somewhat generic but also never shallow- you get what you expect and it works all pretty well, especially with the constant lack of space on your craft (because you can't build new cells, ever). More firepower or more speed? Some shields to protect your cargo, or an additional thruster? It's often a frenetic balancing act.With the solid mechanics in place, Space Run also goes out of the way to look really nice. There's a certain LEGO flair to everything and while the game never explodes with effects it just looks confidently charming without taxing the hardware.There's a nice amount of missions and three difficulty settings- you can alway return to a mission with new upgrades to beat your score, which is also used to unlock new stuff. The game checks for delivered cargo AND your delivery time, and some missions you'll have to play again with better thrusters or other upgrades to earn the maximum possible score.All in all, for a tower defense fan, this is an easy recommendadion just to see a new take on the genre- just get it and you'll have some good fun.. Even if you're just partial to some oddball space scenario where you blow up stuff, you may get some mileage out of Space Run- give it a try while it is on a sale (I got it on a recent 75% sale and those 4 euros were well spent).There are some things I would've liked to be included- a pause button and a zoom, for example, but what you get is all solid, proud, and true to the genre.

Because you don't know what locations are important, you don't know what to do without restarting, and you need to restart to get a better score, and need a better score to get better equipment, and need better equipment to do better on levels. It gets grindy fast, esp for a pay-to-own game.			"

												Great premise is ruined by the need for micromanaging. This is a fun game that is a twist on the tower defense genre. Your ship must carry a blend of cargo, weapons, engines, and defensive weaponry. You have to find the right balance as your shop cruises across each level, where you will be paid if you deliver the cargo. Along the way you'll fend off asteroids and pirates. But you must manually control the laser turrets, which are critical weapons for your survival, and this takes up crtical attention, and the game throws just enough at you that it's really difficult in an unpleasant way to try and keep up. If you could buy an AI module to run the turrets that would help a lot.In any event, it's worth several hours of fun, but I quit halfway through as I got too frustrated with the demands of the micromanagement.

												Tower Defense game that puts you as the player under more preassure than ever before. No pause button (which is good for this game, imo!) and a lot of towers with skills you can activate (and on harder difficulties MUST activate). If you, like me, got tired of tower defense games where you just built tower and watched the action - you'll love this game as it requires you to be active at all times. This is NOT a TD game where  you play with one hand and drink coffee with the other.Some levels can require a bit of trial and error, and learn where the (most dangerous) enemies come from but I personally don't have a problem with that. The levels ain't that long, and every minute is fun to play. I really, really loved every minute of perfecting levels. It's not just about placements, it's also how fast you perform your action.I'd call this game ""The Dark Souls of Tower Defense games"", if you enjoyed Dark Souls, you enjoy action and you enjoy tower defense - pick this game up for sure!

I'm not here for story, I'm here for Upgrades and protecting valuable cargo. The different types of cargo with different properties make for interesting gameplay. Larger equipment you get after upgrading adds nice micromanagement: do I add the smaller, weaker (cheaper) Booster and more cannons, or the larger, stroner, more expensive ones which require additional energy?I enjoy it and the gameplay mechanics are very easy to get into (placing, rotating, etc).

												Hello everyone! the question is ""do I recommend this game"" and the answer is most certainly yes! I have been an avid TD'er for roughly 14 years now way back in the WC3 Bnet days. What follows is simply my opinion. I will not do a pros/cons, however, list things I feel is important to help you decide whether to purchase or pass on. I will leave my bias out of this review.1) Each mission/mission type offers its own unique challenges. Whether it be massive asteroids hurtling towards you from the rear, alien toys poping appearing from the void onto your ship waiting to be blinked around, or wiring for a nueral netwrok limiting defensive layout.2) It plays out like you're the captain of an actual ship in space. There is no tactical pause. Everything happens in real time so you have to pay close attention to where the spawns are coming in, at what angle, and what kind of ship/asteroid. It can get a little frustrating when you get have way and realize your initial setup isn't going to cut it.3) The missions take no more than 10 minutes so when you do run into the problem of a failed setup, a restart wont be a huge waste.4) Micromanaging is a big factor in this game. With the RTS functionality, you have to moniter your shields, make quick repairs, rotate your weaponry, and manualy use construct's abilities. It can, at times, get overwhelming.5) Voice acting is well done and the dialog is fairly amusing. The story line is decent: -spoilers- you're a space runner deliverying cargo in space and have to deal with space like challenges. Also has good sound effects, visuals, and music.6) The stonger constructs are more challenging to utilize: power needs, take up a larger section of you ship, but come with the power to outweigh the negatives.7) There are many ways to take on each mission to successfully complete them.I feel like these are the top things to concider when making your decision. After all, money isn't the easiest thing to come by for everyone. I personally loved my experience with Space run and easily give it a 9/10. It is a refreshing challenge and if micromanging and quick reactions isn't a negative, you would do well investing in this game. It is not for ""casual"" TD'ersAnywho, hope this helps peeps.			"

												Very cool unique Tower Defense game! Different to other TD's your fort is not fixes but moves! You play as Buck Mann and have to deliver the cargo of customers to earn space credit.Every level you have to place different amount and type of cargo. There are a bunch of different cargos which have different place usage, properties and even abilities. Every level you fly with a different shaped ship, so that you have to change the way you place your towers.I like how every tower has unique and upgradable abilities you need to activate in order to get the advantage.You are occupied almost full time building towers and activating abilities to adapt to the attackers type, amount, incoming directions.The story is very flat since the dialogues are always the same:Customer: Would you transport my cargo?Buck Mann: Yep.Forewarning Space Pirate: Will you give me your cargo?Buck Mann: Nope.It's quite difficult to win, so you take several restarts for every level adapting your build order, tower types and building places for each level. This is a small downside of the game, because the required thing to win a level is not completely skill but knowledge of the level, which is only aquired with several restarts. This is a bit of time waste. But still it's a very good game! I like it because it has refreshing new and deep game mechanics!			"

												An excellent take on the tower defense genre where you transport cargo on an interplanetary starship and defend against pirates, asteroids, etc. A cool theme, nice sense of humor, and aesthetic that does the job. Not a whole lot to complain about.Many of the critical reviews argue that the lack of a battle pause function to detracts from the game, but once you get used to playing it in real-time it really isn't necessary in my opinion. Especially considering every level is identical on repeat and are not overly long. If you fail on a harder mission you can easily simply repeat it and use your knowledge from the previous run to preempt your demise.Avoid the sequel.4/5			"

												Space Run is the newest tower-defense-concept. You don't have Enemies, which go trough a maze or a path. Instead you build a Spaceship which you have to defend. It totally does not feel like ordinary tower defende.Since the release they improved the controls (tower reposition). Some Release-Reviews may be outdated becauso of that.  Some other guys complained about the fact that the game can be hectic sometimes. The Game offers:- 30 missions - defending a space ship with shields, generators, turrets and engines- destroying gigantic asteroids, civil ships, pirat ships- destroying pirat bosses- optional targets: max. 5 stars(fame/renown/reputation points) per mission rewarding a perfect delivery- hectic gameplay in advanced missions- repostion the turrets and use special abilities of other towers, once they are unlocked- english dubbed dialogues, various subtitle-languages- at least 9h play time. The game took me 15h to complete without collecting all 150 stars/fameWhat I like about the game- hectic / fast paced strategy in advanced missions. You have some time to think, but mircomanagment is important.- new way of tower defense- ease to control with mouse. Optional Hotkeys are available I don´t like about the game:- surprising long loading screen (30s-50s) if you launch the game			"

												Fun tower defense type of game with nice and effective graphics and an extremely cheesy 'story'. And the game doesn't even try to be serious which makes it even more funny.Deliver cargo on timed missions while constantly preparing for incoming astroids, chunks of crystals, opposing cargo ships, small fighters and up to some massive pirate ships. Some more dangerous than others.Make sure to have enough engine power to deliver your cargo in time, defences like shields and ecm and of course plenty of different weapons, all with special abilities.Graphics are nice, clean and effective.Sound is great.The music is a bit simple, but enough for the job.The missions range from very easy to extremely challenging and getting them all to a five star rating, meaning you've delivered all cargo for that mission within a certain time limit, is in fact quite difficult.Replayability comes from the fact that you have to gather enough credits and reputation points in order to buy every possible piece of equipment and upgrade which you will need for the more difficult missions. Plus getting these difficult missions to a five star rating will probably require many many retries and rethinking strategies.Levels are always the same and the key to success is to learn the type and location of incoming dangers to maximize your result in the next try.. and the next.. and the next :)Once everything has been achieved, there's no real need to play again though. It would have been fun if there were some more missions or maybe even some random ones. But all in all it has enough content to keep you playing for tens of hours.Missions are also relatively short. So it's a game you can easily jump in and out whenever you want. Although at times you might not want to stop as you try again and again. Very likely with a high blood presure and lots of cursing. Victory will be sweet.I've had a lot of fun with this game. It was well worth the money for the 40+ hours it took me to get five stars at every mission, including all the achievements.			"

												This game was amazing. Took me about 26 hours to 100% it, but it has so much replay value. You could do the missions over and over again building your ship so many different ways. Not quite a turret defense game based on the typical style of it, but still a turret defense game. Only difference is instead of everything being stationary and waves of enemies come in; in this game, your whole ship is flying through space and you need to defeat different types of enemies with different types of turrets and towers, in order to deliver each shipment successfully. As well as some other side objectives from time to time too. Your ship changes shape in every single level, so you have to constantly adapt to making a different setup every mission, no monotony here! I really hope they come out with Space Run 2 someday, because this game was just awesome!Keep in mind though, if you are looking for a traditional style TD game, this isn't it. This is more of a you're surrounded by enemies and obstacles and you need to blast your way through it kind of TD.			"

												It's a fun little ""kind-of"" tower defense game in space. Very playable but no real long-term value since there's no free/endless mode. Still, if it's on sale for a couple bucks, pick it up if you like arcade games with simple ideas.			"
