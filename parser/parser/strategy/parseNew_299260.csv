												It is a rare occasion when a mobile game translates well to pc.  This is not one of those occasions.  This is proabably great on a mobile device when being used as a time=killer.  When you are sitting at your pc, you expect a bit more depth.  Also, there are NO Steam achievements.  The achievements being mentioned in the above picture are in-game.			"

												Not a *bad* game, but also not as good as the competition. Kingdom Rush, Defense Grid: The Awakening, Fieldrunners 2, and Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten are all significantly better. If you're super into tower defense games, than probably worth it on sale, but not at full price and not in place of any of the other options.			"

												Game for mobile, crossed over to Steam to put things simply. Not the kind of game you'd play on PC. Could be great on a phone however. This is not the place for it, nor is it the place for any mobile game. Pros* Fun in First person, haven't seen that in a Tower Defense game before.* Lost of upgrade options for turrets.* Instead of In-app purchases it has a GIANT Free Coins! Banner across the top you can get free coins daily.Cons* Giant banner across the top.* In-game only achievements, no Steam Achievements nor cards.* Poor graphics, as it was not designed for PC.* Music is repetitive.* Unable to customize many keybindings, some things don't even have keybindings.* Overpriced, I wouldn't pay $9.99 for it on mobile let alone on Steam.* Not to mention I can find better Tower Defense games on kongregate. For Free.			"

												When one thinks about Commando Jack, it is of essence not to fail to notice the inescapable truth that Commando Jack is an egregious mobile port without any redeeming qualities. Any individuals imagining that this game is worth its price possess cognitive powers so striking compared to those of an ordinary human as if the latter were multiplied by a rational number with a unitary numerator and an inconceivably large denominator.(credit: ArgYou - Win Arguments with Style)			"

Android gameCommando Jack is an android port of the same game now on steam.There is barely any story at all. Basically, aliens have invaded earth and it's up to Commando Jack to stop them.Gameplay is a mix of tower defence and first person shooting. Each level starts you off on one side of the map with a turret, trying to defend against the alien invasion. You have limited time at the start to build towers and set traps for defences before the waves begin. Besides building defences you can also switch to your main turret and shoot the aliens via first-person. Enemy waves get more numerous and stronger as the level progresses. The aliens will move towards you main turret and try to destroy it, which results in a gameover should it happen. After each level, you will earn up to 3 stars depending on whether the enemy was able to attack your main turret or not. You also earn credits, which are used to buy/upgrade turrets at the store before each level. There are variety of aliens including snipers, tanks standards and elemental which all have certain strengths and weaknesses. A variety of turrets are also available including machine gun, rockets, mines, lasers and sand bags. One of the problems I found was that when you upgrade turrets' you don't know how the turret was improved as you don't get to see any statistics.Graphics aren't great. The android history, shows off on the low detailed models for guns, environment, turrets (everything really).Sound effects are quite poor. Weapons sounds are basic. Background music is forgettable. There is not voice acting in the game.Unless this game is highly discounted, I recommend that you stay clear of this game. It's not that this game is terrible, its just that there are dozens of games which do a better job at representing the 'tower defence genre' and cheaper too.			"

												The tower defense game Commando Jack originally made its way to iPhones way back in 2012, but just recently its developer Colossal Games released this on Steam. So the question on everyone’s mind right now is: is this a ‘quick’ cash-in or this is a port that all PC gamers can be content with ?And while I’m definitely going to explain more about the game in just a minute I can already answer the question I just brought up: it’s absolutely a game made to make some extra money. No, this isn’t a bad game per se, it’s just not optimized for us PC gamers: the game starts instantly with the first mission, no menus or anything, video options aren’t there and it forces a low resolution game into fullscreen, making the whole thing look blurry as a result (Alt+Enter does work, mind you). Which to me, looks like a really bad start, wouldn’t you agree ?Thankfully Commando Jack is one of the better tower defense titles out there, and this one gives you the opportunity to shoot some aliens yourself, in first person view. It doesn’t use in-app purchases like the iOS version does, but it does have things like ‘Free coins’ banners at the top of the screen when you’re not killing enemies. It’s not even subtle. Unfortunately, these coins have to be used to buy and upgrade turrets, buy power-ups and also to upgrade your stationary gun, so there’s no way to just not click on it. You’ll get coins by finishing missions, clicking on a Free Coins button every day or by hacking into aliens’ accounts (which can also be done once a day). I never seemed to run out of cash during my game sessions; the game hands out large amounts of coins at the same time. So why does it have to be so in-your-face then ? I honestly have no idea.There are 45 campaign missions to finish, and then there’s also Endless mode, Mixed mode (normal enemies mixed with fire and ice enemies) and Elemental mode, which throws only ice and fire enemies at you. There are special towers for both these ice and fire enemies, and special ammo can be bought for your stationary gun. Levels aren’t just squares, they have all kind of different shapes and because of that It’s not always easy to create a long, difficult maze for enemies to walk through.If an enemy gets through you can always go to your stationary gun with the press of a button and kill them yourself. However, your gun can also overheat so it’s necessary to use it with caution. Snipers can also spawn on the battlefield, out of view, and they can only be killed in first person view. It’s fun, but the first few times you might not notice them quickly enough and you’ll probably see your base’s health drop within seconds. After that you’ll most likely pay more attention to your surroundings.Other than all of things I just mentioned this is your basic tower defense game. That’s not meant as a negative argument, but it’s the same thing as, let’s say, point-and-click adventures. They’re usually the same as far as gameplay is concerned, but sometimes they have a little bit more variety. The same goes for Commando Jack.So, apart from the cluttered user interface and the non-existent video options, what’s there to say about this game technically ? Well, the models use some sharp textures, which is good, but the models on the other hand are blocky. Some of it seems intentional, some of it doesn’t. The game does a nice job at showing you landmarks and other country related objects in each of the different locations. London has a Big Ben tower and Japan has cherry trees, for example.The music seems to change whenever you change cities, so if you’re fighting in Japan you’ll hear music with Japanese influences. The sound effects overall are also very good and clear.Game length also seems to be good; this could take you several hours to tens of hours if you want to 100% the entire game. I personally think it’s best played in smaller sessions.Commando Jack doesn’t completely reinvent the genre but the gameplay is fun enough as long as you can ignore the things that clearly show we’re dealing with an iOS port here. From a technical viewpoint I would not recommend it, but as a game I think I would. But just barely. And that’s mainly the reason why this gets a below average rating in my book.[Rating: 63/100]			"

												This is a tower defense game with a little addition: the target is you with your turret that you can actually control! Sounds neat! That actually is neat. But that pretty much is the only neat thing. The graphics are somewhat mobile, the controls are somewhat mobile, the daily play bonuses are somewhat mobile, everything about this game shows that this was ported from a mobile version, which means that you'd be better off playing it on mobile. And everything else is not special. So in general below average PC game. There are better ones out there. Oh and the achievements aren't Steam achievements.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												It is difficult to describe Commando Jack. I suppose the closest game I can equate it with would be Plants Verses Zombies, only with a Military fighting an Alien Invasion twist, multiple boards to play on, and an array of purchasable weaponry, designed to combat various threats. You earn coins by completing levels, which you are graded on similar to the 3 star level grading system on many Facebook games. You can spend those coins upgrading your weapons, to combat various alien threats. Each board has a different layout, and the layout changes and becomes more complicated depending on the difficulty setting you are playing at. The game allows for Easy play, which is fairly straight-forward and is recommended for the casual player, Medium, Hard, and Extreme, for only the most serious of gamers. You are tasked with stopping Alien threats, which come in the form of a portal, after which you must defeat waves of aliens, by placing weapons in strategic places to destroy the aliens as they advance from the portal. This game really took me by surprise and was a lot of fun to play. It is a very inexpensive game, fun, and easy to learn, so I would give it a thumbs up if it sounds like the sort of game you would enjoy. I don't think you will be disappointed.			"

												Commando Jack really baffles me. It only takes some cursory browsing to see all the bizarre raving from (what I can only imagine to be) sorely out of context quotes and even nominations for awards. Yet after only a very brief period of play in which I made it through the tutorial and first couple levels, it was overwhelmingly clear that this game was just another bland mobile port.At first glance Commando Jack would strike you as a typical mobile shovelware quality tower defense; however, upon digging into the game a little deeper you will discover that it is in fact.. exactly what it appears to be. The store page has GameTrailers hailing it as “...unlike anything we’ve ever played before.” It pulls into question the actual amount of time anyone at GT has ever really been in the gaming community. “Tower defense with a first-person twist!” proclaims another hideously flagrant screenshot. On and on these quotes go, yet the game is bad. Even if I had gotten this on my android phone or tablet I would have been revolted by the graphics, infuriated by the responsiveness of controlling the turret and utterly bored at the experience of playing yet another tower defense game.I’m so very glad I spent nothing on this game, that is all it’s worth. Even then I didn’t get my moneys worth.			"

												very cheap-feeling tower-defense game where the main gimmick is being able to go into first-person mode and shoot waves manually. it's actually kind of a pain to do so, especially since there's no real visual feedback when your shots hit. indeed, the visuals in general are uninspiring, and they haven't even bothered to remove the parts of the game like GET FREE COINS buttons which clearly show it's just a rushed port of a mobile game. i don't even remember how this ended up in my games list so i'm gonna just assume it was part of a giveaway. it still isn't worth it for free.

												This is dull tower defense game and it is also a mobile port. The only thing diferent from other tower defences is that you can go into first-person mode to shoot enemies that pass your defenses or to shoot snipers that can only be killed in that mode. The game also has diferent dificulties and modes where it adds elemental enemies and specific turrents to kill them.Overall there isnt alot of theme coesion and the mobile roots are present, you can see the usuall paying currrency like the gold barrs or crystals that you would have to pay for on mobile in this version the game simply gives you that by playing.

												Played the game for a while and have so far really enjoyed the experience.  It is a tower defense game with a few twists which set it apart from many of the other games in the genre.  I wouldn't say it was the best of the bunch but, at the price it sells for, is definitely good value.For those people who complain because it was a mobile game and believe that it should stay that way, I highly disagree.  I have two young children and am happy for them to use the computer to play these kind of games as it only costs a small amount of money to replace a mouse it they break it.  I am certainly not going to give them several hundred pounds worth of moile technology to play it on so, in my opinion, there is absolutely nothing wrong with these kind of games being released on Steam also.

												Game sucks. Clearly a mobile game. No graphic or control settings in game at all. Terrible resolution can't change. The game home page and original menus is confusing and not easily accessed. The controls/different menus in game are not helpful and not explained. Switching back and forth between turret and placing weapons is annoying and not quick. Buttons that are used on computer and should do certain things don't work or do anything and you have to use mouse. A lot of turrets you don't know what they do or what they are useful for an aren't explained well. Levels suck and can only place towers in certain spots, and in some levels they can just get around them for no apparent reason. Can't maze or make your own setup because some levels are just made that way because it makes no sense. Clearly a free-to place game with huge banner for getting coins which you use in game, which you can like their facebook page to get more off, shoddy marketing.You can level up new towers but also upgrade them, 2 different systems that seem to do the same thing but is unclear. Game gives you no idea what effect you buying upgrades does. Towers seem undewhelming. You have to look at certain guys come and plan your towers accordingly. No clue which towers are needed and which are useful, and sucky game menues and UI doesn't help. Half of the buttons you can click on and powers you use aren't explained. No story. Clearly 0 effort put into bringing this game to PC/steam. Hell it's even hard to figure out how to exit the game, probably on purpose because everyone who starts it up would instantly want to. Not worth any money, I got it for free and I'm still disappointed and feel ripped off. 3/10.			"

												It's a fun little mobile game that can entertain you for some time, yet that time is too short. Considering I got it for free of course, but if you are getting it for 10 euros, or even on sale, let's say 3 euros, it's simply not worth it. You can analyze it was ported straight over from mobile to pc, no improvements/modifications to the UI or whatsoever. Cannot recommend it, for the price, for it's poor mechanics and for the non-existent effort to adapt the game to a new and different plataform.			"

Product received for free
												Received for free from an IndieGala giveaway.Very simple tower defence. No story, decent graphics. Something best suited for mobile/tablet portable devices and best suited for many short bursts of gameplay (something to pass time while on the train/toilet, etc.).You have to switch between regular tower placement mode and first person turret mode to do some damage yourself. There are some enemies that your towers won't be able to hit that you have to take care of in first person mode.Later on there are elemental enemies that you'll want to use the correct elemental towers for.Gold is pretty easy to come by and there are so many levels that I think you could get very close to unlocking all upgrades by clearing the 45-stage campaign on easy without grinding.Other random thoughts: There are in-game achievements but nowhere I could find to view them.Worth a look if you're need to pass time and want a generic tower defense (though the simple first person mode gives a twist) with plenty of levels to play through. I don't think it's worth it at full price ($9.99) but maybe at mobile prices (~$1-3).			"

												I think the Game is a bit Overpriced, it should be 2€ at least. The Game itself is a little bit like Plants vs Zombies, just that you can also go into first person mode. The Controls are really easy to handle. The Graphics are really cute and cartoony. Its a nice game for killing some time whilst you download something.Thumbs up because its not so bad & I got it for free.			"

												Actually Commando Jack is a great game, i have fun before i got the crash (Last Part) I dont know whats going on, i play like normal. But after I play like Level 7 or 8, the game got crashed. But, here's the review.Positive:-The Gameplay is fun, not too simple but still great-The Control is good but not the goodest-Awesome background music (Its like Plant vs Zombie)Negative:-We got money so easy, no challenge. Play, Finish 1 level, You got a lot of money-The Control of the Guns is so terrible. We have to click Left and Right Mouse to shoot the gun.-Lot of Bugs, Crash-The menu too much, too much column-Bad Aiming, when we want to aim the gun, we need 5 seconds maybe for nice aim to the alienI will give this game, 4/10			"

												It's not a bad game per say, just pretty generic. It is actually put together decently for a mobile port and can be somewhat entertaining. The main problem with it is that I noticed that you do everything with the mouse and there are no real meaningful keyboard shortcuts just some basic ones. You should have more configuration options but you don't. That and the fact that it is a poor mans version of OTTTD or Sanctum 2, I won't put any more time in it than the initial 30 minutes sinced those two games are far superior than this.Many much better TD games exist including the two I mentioned where your time will be much more well spent than here. The regular price for this of $10 is laughable, $5 or less is more like it. I got it for free from indiegala.com but I will have much more fun playing other TD games I have.			"

												I have a soft spot for tower defense games that stretches all the way back to the glory days of Onslaught 2. Commando Jack is a welcome edition to the genre, putting you (Jack) in the position of ridding some base of some aliens somewhere. You control a large turret from first person perspective, and can swap camera views in order to build your turrets. The game sports a small tutorial at the beginning, but learning becomes very organic (and a lot easier if you're familiar with tower defense games). Each variation of alien comes with it's own soft spot (a weakness for you to hit with the turret) and there are SEVERAL different variations of small turrets to soften them up before they reach you. Turrets are purchased with in-game currency that is both readily available, and easy to earn. A single successful round will net you about 50,000, with the new turrets typically costing around half of that. A feature strongly promoted by the game is building a maze of turrets for the aliens to go through. It's a bit remniscient of ""Pipe Dream"" in that you have a starting point, and want to funnel the aliens through it in a complex path that allows for maximum damage output. Highly recommend for any fans of tower defense games, as this is a really well thought out title in the genre.			"

												Commando Jack is a 'mobile' gamed through and through. From the low resolution to the awkward controls. Although done before (Sanctum comes to mind), this game introduces a mechanic where you are capable of shooting the enemies yourself. I find such a mechanic annoying because if I wanted to play sub-par FPS games, I would play said games.The game has no spirit. The sound, the graphics, the story and the turrets are all cookie-cutter and the developer receives an F- for effort on all fronts. The only thing it does well is not having the game crash.It's also terribly boring and you can feel a part of your brain wither away as you play it. The difference between PC gaming and mobile gaming is about 50 IQ points, that much is obvious.			"

												It's a tower defense kind of game, but with some extra thingies to play around... Like, you can shoot directly from your defending position, while the turrets do your work for you... Stuff like that. Make a path of turrets, lead the enemy to your position through a tunnel made of traps and turrets. It's pretty fun. guys. I do recommend.			"

												The Colossal Games website doesn't even link to Commando Jack on Steam. (Only iOS and Windows Phone) This tells me they know it doesn't belong here. It's a mobile game that was ported to PC. The only thing added was some basic, not-so-good, keyboard controls.I can't say very much good about the game for PC. It's low resolution and has a bad aspect ratio for modern PC monitors. There are in-game achievements, but they are not linked to Steam in any way. It has ""free coins"" in the usual mobile methods of getting other stuff you don't want. It does have free coins that you can hack from the aliens' bank accounts (why would invading aliens have bank accounts on Earth you can hack?), but only one free per day, and a hack you can pay for with in-game coins, but you're more likely to lose coins on that deal.Some mobile games make the transition to PC just fine and are either as good, or sometimes even better. This is not one of those games. I won't mention titles, but there are even other tower defense games that started on mobile, then got ported to PC, that are far better than this one. Same basic gameplay (without first-person) with better controls, much better graphics, and even the same price.It does have some decent mechanics as a tower defense game, and the graphics would probably look pretty good on a tablet or smaller screen. The first person view is a nice twist, but other than that, it's basically just a generic tower defense game.Other than how this game is monetized on mobile, I would suggest you get it there if you really want to try it out, but I can't recommend it on PC, but to be honest, I don't think I could give the mobile version a sincere recommendation either.

												I got this game as a free giveaway so I have no real complaints about the product itself as it's all functional.  There are dozens and dozens of levels with just enough variety to have to try different things.  As for why this game isn't a top seller is that it lacks some polish in terms of interface (sometimes not being able to place turrets correctly) a lack of tooltips at times and way too many notifications going on throughout that mean almost nothing to the gameplay.  Overall it's not a horrible experience for those who have never played games like Sanctum or Orcs must Die which would be the few steps up from this.			"

												I bought this game for about 10 cents, never have I regret spending 10 cents, but this game brought me to a new low point. Even when you get it for free or even with a little cash on the side; don't do it!!! It is by far the worst game I have ever seen, it is indeed so bad that I overcame my laziness to write this review!!!			"

 Fun but is a bad mobile port! The game is fun for a short period of time but as it was made for the mobile, the fun does not last. The game has not had a good port, the controls have not been re-bound properly (W, A, S, D are used to move the camera for the character) and there are no graphical options (not even a full screen or windowed option).There is not much else to say about this game, it does not have many features to comment on. Pros:  Fun for a short period of time. Good time filler, easily get distracted on this game. Cons:  Bad mobile port. Controls not bound properly. Each level is to short and easy. "

												Quite a poor port of what's clearly a tablet game - even before you get into it you're confronted with a low resolution display with massive control buttons designed for fat fingers! I'd save your money and get something like iBomber defense, or if you're after a better experience for more money then defence grid			"

												I got this game for free in indiegala. I find this game simple and very fun to play. Game play was not so unique because its just like Plants avs zombie with a twists but will certainly can entertain you in times that you want to play an alternative game. Its worth to try. My only hope is to run thi on my tablet which I think the best platform to enjoy this game.			"

												Not just a mobile port, but a badly done one. The controls are glitchy and not very well thought out (Really? WASD to aim instead of your mouse when in FPS mode? C'mon...).

												This is a very poor quality tower defense game with a number of dealbreaking issues.Resolution is capped and cannot be changed - the game looks ugly even on a 1080p display.The game relies on simple tower defense mechanisms, but also a ""first person"" mode where you control a gun that you can use to shoot any enemies that get by.  The problem is they don't allow mouse aim - you have to use WASD to try point the gun!  Incredible incompetence in UI design. Obvious thumbs down.   Plenty of other tower defense games to choose from.			"

												This is a fairly bland tower defense like any other tower defense. You can go into first-person mode and shoot some aliens yourself, but the core gameplay is still pretty familiar. So what it really comes down to is execution. And, well...it's a mobile port. It's VERY CONSPICUOUSLY a mobile port. The interface is clearly designed for a touch screen. There are no keyboard shortcuts and no way to change the controls. It runs in a fixed fullscreen resolution, so if you want to go into windowed mode or adjust it to fit your monitor better...sorry, there's no option for that.To top it all off, it's priced at $10, which is quite frankly an unreasonable price point for a port so lacking in polish. There are tower defense games out there that are just as good or better that you can play totally free.Look, I like the tower defense genre, but you can do a lot better than this game. Do not recommend.			"

												This seems like it should be a free-to-play mobile game, not a $10 purchase on Steam.- Fixed resolution, with no options to increase the display size.- Click for FREE COINS! (once per day!)- Daily visit bonus coins! (once per day!)- Unlabelled layout icons. Trying to find the Options screen to look for resolution settings wasn't an intuitive process.- Loading screens with dated memes. (The use of rehashed Chuck Norris -style jokes? old and boring.)- 15-second time frame when first encountering a level, in which you have time to place turrets. Good luck if you put them in the wrong spots because you didn't have time to look carefully at the map. Also, -1000 points per turret you moved because the placement you chose no longer seemed necessary. RIP your score for the level. Would have been better to quit the level and start over, given that my score got nerfed into the ground because of it.In conclusion,""Chuck Norris once told Chuck Norris a Chuck Norris joke. But Chuck Norris didn't laugh. Because Chuck Norris jokes aren't funny.""If the game were on the Google Play store for a dollar, I'd probably be more forgiving. But this isn't worth buying at full price, certainly not when there are so many other games like it out there.			"
