Early Access Review
								Oh goodness where do I begin with this game? At first I was a bit worried that another indie RTS was being pushed out on Steam as, well I know I can speak for most of the people looking at this game, we've been burnt out and screwed over by developers that spend a whopping two months and call it a game then charge an arm and a leg... Well let me be the first one to tell you that this isn't one of those games at all!Dear lord if you want edge of your seat gameplay, better than normal base building, an interesting campaign with hopes for the future, and units that are wonderfully designed and almost perfectly customizable this game is for you! Campaign plops you down in an interesting mix of a colonization story gone wrong. I won't spoil anything but goodness that's one fine story I'm still crawling through. Loading times? Forget about em! This game has none and in the places where it does have them it's a whole whopping two second wait at the most (might be a little longer for some older computer rigs; not sure but it won't take you long!) Things that really stick out for this game in my opinion? Probably the graphics and music. You can see the screenshots and while I was skeptical at first that they were just glorified photoshopped images I can gladly say that is not the case at all. The game is literally that beautiful and the music that plays just bolsters the overwhelming beauty of this game. If you have the money for it I would gladly tell you to buy this one! You will not be upset with your purchase at all.Believe you/me friend, I'm tired of getting the short end of the stick because I love RTS games and will stand by this game as long as it continues to be worked on. Thanks Dark for rekindling my trust in indie RTS games.			"

												Simply put, this game is awful to actually play. If that's all you need from a review, you can stop here. If you want to know WHY this game is awful, keep reading.1. StorylineThe story is pretty uninspired. It's not completely terrible, but it's nothing you haven't seen before. Maybe it gets better, but I couldn't get too far due to numerous frustrations before I dropped the game. The voice acting is at best, average. WIth woodenly delivered lines, and dialogue that could have been written by a chat-bot.2. GameplayThis is the main problem. An average to below average plot/voice acting can often be made up for in gameplay. Unfortunately these developers seem to have forgotten how RTS' work. Problem 1: The perspective and selection of units.The angle of the game, and the awful awful unit boxes make it very difficult to get all your units, or select individual units, or really do basic things quickly and efficiently. Did you miss on of your units when trying to select it? Well screw you player! Because now you have NOTHING selected. Isn't that great? There are several abilities in the game that you are to use on a singular unit. This is difficult and can cause issues. Anyone who is used to a well made RTS, and want's to micro and control army effectively is in for a bad time. This however, is not the only contributor to that bad time.Problem 2: The (lack of) pathfindingYou know when you play a game, and sometimes your unit happens to go a weird way around the map to the location you sent it to? Usually doesn't happen that often, and usually isn't a big deal. That's not the case In Meridian: forgotten mechanics. Do you want to move somewhere specific? They will eventually get there. Not together, not in a timely manner, but eventually. Just hope there are no enemies to fight.What happens when there are enemies? Well I'm glad you asked! See, if you run in to an enemy, while moving around the map, chances are everyone in your dumb as hell army has separated into squads of 1. Thankfully, the enemy AI will just put them out of their misery. Now, it is possible you'll actually have your army together and want to attack. One of the basic moves in an RTS is to Attack move. In almost every RTS ever made, as soon as an enemy is in sight and range, the guns start blazing. In ""Meridian: What LSD trip made us think we knew how to make a game"", you will find, at almost every occasion, your units running directly at the enemy without firing. Without realizing that they are NOT some sort of kamikaze unit. Without deigning to obey your commands in a remotely satisfactory manner.Thanks to these amazing mechanics, you often need to retreat to try to herd your dumb struck army in to a semblance of a group so you can actually play the game. In most RTS' retreat is a viable strategy. In ""Meridian: Oh my GOD does anyone know how to walk?"" this is nigh impossible. Retreating involves attempting to move away from the enemy. In the unlikely event your units actually manage to walk away from the enemy, you will find them immediately attempting to engage the enemy. The worst part is, the terrible pathing and AI means that they will have half trying to get back somewhere, half who are going the other way and get stuck on eachother, and no one actually firing on the enemy OR retreating. The target acquisition range is just absolutely nuts. It doesn't make sense. I've had units react to hostiles WHO WEREN""T VISIBLE YET. I'm pretty sure Chewbacca lives on Endor, because it just doesn't, make, sense.Bonus problem:Hotkeys. I get having your own hotkeys for your game so you can be ""different"" so all the cool kids will like you. But changing fundamentals like moving the hold position command from 'H' to 'E' is just plain stupid. There's many similar changes in this game. ""Meridian: who even needs hotkeys anyway"" decided to reinvent their hotkeys from the refined version most games have settled with, to a new pile of crap that no one wants to be in.3. GraphicsThis is the only area where Meridian: Really Shiny gets any sort of credit. I'm not saying it's a visually stunning masterpiece. But it is nice. It's vibrant. Also really shiny. Nothing to write home about, but nothing particularly bad either.Final Thoughts: There are lots of RTS games out there. There is a reason that Command and Conquer, Warcraft 1, 2 AND 3, Starcraft 1 AND 2 are all timeless classics. There is a reason that most RTS games have similar if not identical base mechanics to each other. It's because they WORK, and they work WELL. They allow strategy, micro and macro. Meridian: Barely a functional game decided that's not necessary in their RTS. They wanted to be different, to be cool, instead everyone should be making fun of them and ignoring them.			"

Early Access Review
								Meridian: New World – Review –Warning: This review is based on a review copy played before the games release so everything could be different and is still subject to change.Game Background //Meridian: New World is an Indie Real Time Strategy created by Elder Games and published under Merge Games & Headup Games.Meridian brings back a feel of the old C&C Westwood days by giving you a unique RTS experience with unit customization and a levelling system with an ability tree for yourself as you command over the battlefield.The Story //You play as Commander Daniel Hanson of the first mission to a remote planet known as Meridian. Just as everything seems that it’s going good and you prepare to leave the planet when an unknown distress call is intercepted on the surface. Its origin unknown you set to find out what the cause of the message was. However, everything falls to panic when a mysterious enemy begins an assault on you while you are scouting a power plant on the surface. Who is this enemy and what do they want? (This is purely based on the first mission alone to avoid spoilers as much as possible.)Gameplay // Meridian gives you a Command & Conquer play style with the unit control of earth 2160. This comes together rather well however at points unit pathing can be a problem as it is hard to define what is and isn’t clickable terrain. The base building is satisfying and refreshing to the RTS genre with the original style of building on a grid layout similar to StarCraft. This makes both building your base and navigating it enjoyable and simple. The general combat of the game seems pretty simple at first. Just chuck units at each other and see who wins. However the game actually has unit customization and each unit aside from the foot solider can have a weapon set such as the auto-cannon or laser.This allows units to be countered by weaknesses and really makes you think if you should engage the enemy or not. The only problem I have with the overall gameplay is that there needs to be some more units. However this is a WIP so more should come hopefully!Sound //The sound assets for the game are surprisingly good and flow well with the overall experience of the game. Voice acting is realisc and flows well with the game. It’s really hard to believe that one guy managed to make the game.Final verdict //For me, Meridian gave back a good feel of the RTS genre to me and has given me already more hours than I will typically play a game for.Overall I give the game a 7/10 in its current state, this may go up or down in future versions of the game. The main benefits of the game are:Unit Customization –Good base building –Story –The downsides are:Range of units –Unnecessary points in the story such as the tower defence segment.Thanks for reading my review!Sorry for any spelling or Grammar errors!Also check out the video version of this review!

Posted: December 9, 2014
												5/10.A late '90's style Real-Time Strategy game, with a simplistic but solid foundation. What you can expect:  Around 15 hours of fun, 90's RTS inspired nostalgia... and a bit of frustration, too. Beware that  the variety of units, and some features of gameplay are very simplistic, so you will likely need to adjust to the limitations of such a basic system. Hints:   In the campaign, there is often an easy win condition. For example, rush to build a line of turrets at a bottle-neck; or, look for some unguarded enemy power stations; or, rescue the group of neutral units to get a bigger army. The simulation maps are great ways to pick up a few handy hints on gameplay. A bit of a rant about the things that frustrated me about this game: Kudos to this lone developer for making what is essentially the basis for a great game. Unfortunately, the developer made a few gameplay decisions which entirely spoilt this game for me, especially since this is a strategy game. Namely:  cannot attack while moving (can't even begin to list the strategic consequences of this) too few micromanagement options (such as no patrol option, no defend-this-building button, no action/movement queuing) Units sometimes wouldn't auto-acquire enemies that came in range. ""attack towards"" would first move my units forwards a few meters before attacking anything  too few units and buildings (exaggerates hard counters, eg 2 rocket-launcher light tanks beats a whole army of troopers. What's worse is that because there are so few unit types theres a very good chance that this would happen. You end up needing to build 2 of everything which is just fiddly and annoying) Finally, I stopped playing this game after a Campaign map where the enemy has somehow amassed an army of around 100 units, and had 6 unit-producing buildings surrounded by turrets. It was an impenetrable wall of units that just kept regenerating.An example of how a fight would play out: You have a squadron of aerial fighters with high-ranged armor-piercing weapons. The enemy has a rag-tag mix of every conceivable vehicle/infanty and weapon variant. In all likelihood you'll win this one. However, you need to retreat in order to prevent the AI from focus firing your units down. You spend a few seconds moving away (taking damage the whole time and unable to damage them while doing so) they finally catch up, but their high-range tanks reached you first and they start shooting (out of field of vision range) you use the attack-towards command to save the few seconds it takes to manually target them once they come into your view. Your units fly a bit farther than was necessary due to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ auto targetting; putting  their whole army in range of yours. Very soon your whole army is getting flanked and shot down one-by-one with no focus fire. You cannot do the retreat strategy because that means more time taking damaging whilst dealing no damage. You decide to manually focus fire. That's all good an fine, but you're losing damage efficiency in the seconds between then your manual target dies and when you manually target the next enemy. Don't even think about using the attack-towards function to lessen this down time, though, because we've already established that it's not viable.  .. in a last desperate attempt to win the fight you retreat slightly and attack-towards just in front of where the remaining enemy army will emerge. This time, a close-ranged scouting vehicle comes into sight on its own (slightly ahead of the rest of their army) your unit's auto-acquire this target; quickly killing it before any other enemies come into sight. You move a few meters forwards; (unbeknowst to you) you reach the spot where you'd originally anticipated they would appear... HOWEVER! The attack-towards command has finished executing. Now, due to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ auto-targetting your units dont even attack the rest of the enemy army as it comes into sight. You get picked off in the following few seconds. You escape with 3 units left on 5% health each. You use AoE heal, but somehow despite your units being within the displayed grid only one of them gets healed at all. "

												If you're a fan of RTS games, ala SC2 this game might just be for you. Is it StarCraft II??...well, no. But this game puts a few interesting spins on the RTS formula that make it really interesting and fun to play. Instead of producing a standard unit and upgrading offense/defense from an approriate facility (this game has this feature aswell for unit specific upgrades), any weapon upgrades you research for your units can ONLY be applied when they are created. For example, you can Research upgraded cannons, rockets, lasers, railguns etc. that are purchased with the creation of your new unit (varried costs). Cannons are strong vs infantry, Rockets apply area damage, Lasers have increased range and Railguns jump to nearby units. Also, Commander abilities add alot to gameplay (a SC2 comparison would be hero powers, but they are only usable when you have a hero and only with hero in range). Meridian's 'Commander' abilities are usable anytime and anywhere on the map not affected by fog of war. These powers do come at a cost in the form of an regenerative energy bar and vary from Direct Damage to Healing to Increased build/production rates. These abilities are trained with points you acquire when you level up. No Multiplayer (yet at least), some pathing issues and at times questionable voice acting are the only minor concerns with this title. NOTE: This game was for the most part made by ONE MAN in 2 years. Damn impressive.			"

												26th December update: I've now included a link to a video of the campagin being played through, link is at the end.A very nice RTS game, made by one person, that offers a good amount of content.(Demo Is Available - Highly recommended!)Meridian: New World has a lot of original RTS features to give you a nostalgic feel but at the same time shouldn't be compared to other RTS games,It takes elements from other games and uses them in its own way to create a unique and long awaited RTS.If you have high expectations of a Command and Conquer or Supreme Commander you may be disappointed but it is still a good game in its own right and fans of the genre should try it out.Meridian is strongly focused on single player, It has a good storyline spanning over 15 missions and sections between each one where you can interact with and get to know the characters.You will have to make choices along the way. Your actions will be remembered and change the way things go for you.New mechanics are introduced throughout the campaign but doesn't forget about being an RTS when that is happening.Units are limited but instead you get to select the weapons for each unit you train, allowing you to use the unit type and weapon most suited for your situation.You can also try out several small challenges during the campaign to see how weel you can use each of the units.There is NO multi-player (Story and Skirmish only - up to 3 AI) so do not buy if that is all you are interested in.There is only ONE faction (Human) but the weapon customisation allows for up to 100 differnt unit to be created.The map editor and scripting tool used to make the campaign is available with the game; meaning anyone can create anything seen during the game as well as modify existing units, buildings and soon weapons.Custom maps can be shared on Steam Workshop so you can make your own content for others or try theirs out giving you endless free content.It's Easy to use and has a 50 page PDF document to help.Meridian: New World also has a really nice sound track that fits well.There are 75 Achievements to work towards if you want give yourself more challenges.Developer is active in the forums, listens to all suggestions and has a good record for fixing technical issues for people individually.Community shared maps will continue to provide more and new game play too.To see the game in action here's a video showing the campaign being played through (No commentary)

												I really wanted to like this game. I really did. Two main problems keep me from doing so.1. Babysitting. I can't send units from one part of the map to another and depend on them to get there in one piece, because they will move to that spot without fighting back against attacks on their way there. Even in Command and Conquer, units would shoot back when being attacked, but these units just march to their deaths and don't do anything to try and prevent it. 2. Dumb units. Select a unit or units to attack and enemy and will they open fire once within range? Not always. Sometimes they'll walk past the enemy to shoot from one particualr side. Why would they insist on shooting from the right rather from the left even though the left is of equal distance from the enemy and doesn't expose them to enemy fire like the right side does? Who knows, death wish?Some odd programming choices here. Sadly, I'll be uninstalling the game.			"

								THIS is the kind of RTS i like, yea it may be early access, but it is good enough to stand up alongside with quite a few alltime favourates of mine, yes, that means you Supreme Commander.In terms of gameplay, it could be improved only with additions that im pretty sure the lone developer is planning on adding anyway, my point is, if you have the money, you should get this, its not often i do reviews, but for an early access game, this game is well structured and is worth it.I would rate this 8.5 / 10 , or 4 stars.

IntroductionDeveloped by Elder Games and published by Merge Games & Headup Games, Meridian: New World is as much a homage to past RTS games and tries at the same time to set itself apart by adopting a few RPG features. It has achieved mixed results, but I have to admire the dev team’s dedication to this project. At one point, only one person was working on this strategy game. The Sci-Fi aesthetic and the several attempts at an engaging story, try to distract attention from the game’s few but significant programming flaws. This was Elder Games’ first game on Steam and they have shown an interest in making Meridian, part of an RTS series. As of 2016, a sequel to New World has been released. It’s called Meridian: Squad 22. GameplayMeridian: New World tries hard at providing a good strategical experience. It offers a well designed tutorial and includes a story which pieces together the missions of the singleplayer campaign. It has to since, the game has no multiplayer option at all. Not even local co-op. You will have to contend with the less than stellar AI in custom map skirmishes, if you wish for a challenge outside of the main story. It has some RPG elements, if you can call the limited unit and base customization options by that. But speaking of the bases in this game, the micromanagement aspects involving both fixed turrets and units, can be a nuisance. If fact I found the game too easy during some missions, since the AI has pathfinding problems and even your own units struggle to reach the designated waypoints you set them towards. From a graphical perspective, Meridian looks the part and the extensive use of different colors (especially in regards to the laser weaponry), matches the general feel of the game. It is very well polished for a game released in 2014. The terrain and foilage though, seems less diverse than the unit roster but that is a minor complaint at best. The game’s sound department could certainly use an overhaul. While the musical score is decent, the voice acting has taken some serious dips in quality and general performance. There are in-game cinematics between missions which crop together a decent enough story. Too bad the voice actors deliver their lines with a somewhat lack of enthusiasm. Pros+ Classic style real time strategy.+ Appealing graphical details+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements  Cons- The AI pathfinding is troublesome at times- No multiplayer- Less than appealing voice acting Result / Final thoughtsWhile Meridian: New World is most certainly not a boring strategy title, it lacks a certain depth and detail that make RTS games, engaging even after countless skirmishes throughout the time. It has a good looking unit roster, but It has no diversity whatsoever as far as picking a race or side within the game’s conflict. The lack of a multiplayer mode will also deter some gamers, which rightfully feel the need to test themselves against other players. I really wish I could have enjoyed this game more since I’m a strategy fan. Rating 6/10 This review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA titles. "

												I have enjoyed my short time in the game.  For the price it is a steal.  Does it reinvent RTS games?  Not by a long shot, but it does stay true to the elements that make RTS games fun.  So far the campaign mode has been solid and considering the size of the developer that is behind this, it is quite frankly a damn fine achivement.  So if you are looking for yet another RTS to add to your collection you could choose far worse for way more money.			"

												This game had so much potential but it just falls very short of what it could have become. The biggest problem i have with this (even though alot might not agree with me) is that in skirmish the AI does not realy fight amongst themselfs unless they happen to meet each other along the way to your base. As the player you HAVE to rush and build an army ASAP to defend yourself, leaving alot to be desired of the base itself. It also seems that the AI cheats like hell, even on lower difficulty's. It's a shame but im not going to recommend this game.			"

No game should come out strait from EA to full retail in this fashion.UI is all backwards, no grouping, poor unit pathing, rigid and badly zoomed and angeld camera, it's all bad all the time.			"

												If I didnt spend more time fighting horrible controls and pathfinding, than I do fighting the enemy, this might be a good game. But as even the most basic movements are problematic for your troups, this is a failure.Even the simple idea of moving your troops away from battle, or for that matter, even moving in 1 direction, leaves them wandering in all directions ... terrible. Its a pitty, as graphics are nice, sound is ok, and it looks like it could have been a fun game.			"

Early Access Review
								After playing it for three days, doing some skirmishes and getting to the last current mission (Mission 5 at the time of the review), I have to say I am very impressed. This game is really simple, but in a good way. Almost no learning curve to the basics of this game. It reminds me of Command and Conquer and the first Starcraft put together.Pros:*Even with only about 8 (I count the fighter and heavy fighter as one) units total, it's diverse. -3 Units (infantry and bomber) only have 1 available weapon. -1 Unit has 4 (Fighter/Heavy Fighter) weapon choices -4 Units have 5 (Light/Heavy Vehicles) Choices          -(I count tier 1 and 2 weapons as one because the upgrade replaces the tier 1)*For an RTS it has a pretty good story to it. -In between missions you can walk around your ship and converse with the crew, run training simulations, and read about various parts of the game.*Optamization -As stated in another review, there are virtually no loading times. My rig is a 4 year old gaming laptop and missions and skirmishes load up in less than 5 seconds.*Fun campaign*Good graphics-The graphics are really good for how smooth it is, even the cutscenes are really good looking.Cons:*No way to zoom in or pan the camera. -Normally I play supreme commander, so I don't really care about panning the camera, but being unable to zoom in and out can be a minor inconvinience at times.*Short campaign -As fun as it is, it was over too soon, BUT!!! it is only on mission 5 so far. The dev is still adding missions in as the game progresses*Only one faction -I'm not even able to really speculate on whether I feel there would be another faction or not. It's too soon to tell but I don't see why there wouldn't be plans for one.*A little buggy -I had a start up error, but the crash report was very detailed and provided multiple troubleshooting ideas to solve the problem and they worked. This is an early access game, so bugs are to be expected.*Pathfinding -The AI pathfinding cand be really bad at times. I.E. I send a scout to one corner of the map and it cuts through and enemy base on the opposite side of the destination. Still good for the games current stage.Neutral Points:(These are neither good or bad, just some features that some people might like and others may not)*Snipers can outrange defense turrets*Defense turrets function like the NOD Turrets in C&C 3: Tiberium Wars (There is a central hub that is linked to turrets)*A rank up tree (level up, get perks)*Halowars Deathmatch style unit cap. You increase your unit cap by building structures.All in all I do recommend this game. More so if it is on sale.			"

												Micromanagement Hell.If you like that sort of thing, you're going to love this game.Produce only one unit at a time.  Must configure each unit you produce individually.  Must manually assign individual workers to various tasks, even if workers are standing around idly.  This is especially bad when you go to build new buildings.  Once workers are done with a task, they're idle, which is fine as I expect to have idle workers ... to automatically do the next do-once task that pops up.  Workers can not be assigned to a task via assigning them to a building.  Workers seem to be unable to repair buildings.  You're expected to manually heal individual units on the battlefield during combat.What I was expecting was something more along the lines of Spellforce.  What I got was something where everyone acts like they're chess pieces.Like I said, if this is your thing, you'll have a blast.  But it's not mine.  Ugh.And yes, we all know you micromanager nutters are out there.  ""What's this?  That soldier will stand around and get shot unless I tell him to shoot back? (Cums a little in his pants) Oooh, yeah, baby!  I LOVE THIS GAME!""			"

												I haven't an affection for a real time strategy game like this since playing the first two Warcraftsand Red Alert 1. The interface is intuitive and clearly arranged. The game has an old-school vibe,from the look and feel, but with beautiful modern graphics. I could never get warm with the latest Earth titles, after Earth 2140. Base building isn't tedious and commanding of troops is plain and simple.I'm not far in, but I like Meridian very much already, like I've fallen in love with Red Alert once upon a time. The look and feel, the graphics, the interface, the voice acting, the dialouge, it all comes together. It may not be be the RTS game to end all RTS games, but it's a lovely game, where you can do a mission or two and return later on, without the danger of it eating all your time. Boy, would I have loved Supreme Commander when I was still had school. But I had Total Annihilition, so all's well. If you like old-school RTS, there's a good chance you may like Meridian too.But read the other reviews, look for yourself, if this is the game for you.Cheers,Jayne			"

Early Access Review
								In short words: I love it.It´s like the old Command & Conquer parts (produced by Westwood) combined with new elements and differents kinds of gameplay during one mission. For example: First you have got a small squad of units and you have to walk with them true enemy lines, later in the same mission you will find a lost base and use it for your own aims (base building and such stuff). Later in the same mission you have to defend your base with some turrents. That´s a short tower defense part included in the mission.The game combines RTS, RPG and a feeling of retro gaming in memory of C&C.5 of 5 points from me.You can get the game right now for 9 Bugs at the Humble Bundle Weekly Bundle ;)			"

THE BITESIZE:SIMILAR GAMEPLAY TO: Supreme Commander, C&C.WHAT TO EXPECT: Intelligently designed campaign.  Strong story.  Fast-paced gameplay.  High production values.  Focused unit and weapons dynamic.  Base-buidling and fixed-force missions.  Interactive RPG-ish sections between missions. Upgradeable commander abilities.  Punishing hard AI.  Fiddly controls.  Single-player only.ACHIEVEMENTS: DIFFICULT. Beating Hard AI Skirmish mode is worse than a visit to the dentist.STATUS: COMPLETE.WHEN TO BUY:  ON DISCOUNT.  Not for casual RTS fans.More info below....THE LOWDOWN:Meridian: New World is a single-player, sci-fi themed, mission-based RTS with crew driven interactive RPGish sections describing an elaborate back-story through dialgoue and cutscenes.  For an indie it has excellent production values a great variety of missions and a focused design that balanced out army composition so that you never really feel capable of overwhelming the enemy.  Perhaps its most satisfying and frustrating feature is the overly difficult but rigid A.I.  Closely followed by the amount of micro-management that must be done in quick-time during combat or in missions with large maps. Wonderful sci-fi heavy story and settling Complex 13 mission campaign  Multipile objectives and strategy requirements  Army and base-building, resource-mining and fixed force mission dynamics Skirmish mode with over a dozen maps vs 1 to 3 AIs Commander abilities skill-tree upgraded by experience earned by playing missions Focused unit design with weapon customization Limited research tree for weapon and a few ability unlocksTHE GOOD:+ Slick production values.+ Excellent voiceovers for dialogue and mission briefing cutscenes generate a great amount of atmosphere and raise the immersion to an impressive level.+ Base micro-RPG brings alot of immersion and presents a great back-story that involves the player more than a standard RTS.+ Blocked off maps, only reveal new areas once certain sub-quests are completed.+ Strong pulsating soundtrack marries the player to the unfolding action.+ Spend attribute points gained by XP completing missions, on a range of commander abilities to use on the battlefied.  + Auto-saves at the start and between mission stages mean if you if you miss any achievements you can go back and obtain them fairly quickly.+ One of the most difficult RTS A.I. to overcome. (Hard Difficulty)THE BAD:- Relies on a skirmish mode to supplement the missions from the decent-sized main campaign.- Really needed a Pause feature given the ferocity of game speed.- Limited tactics and strategy involved in gameplay.  More a question of build and swarm.  Its only the achievements that dictate certain actions for certain missions.- Bad optimisation for a few missions.  Given my specs Core i5 and more than capable gfx card the game sometimes becomes sluggish from mission five onwards with the amount of units increasing.- Controls are frightingly unwieldly. Worse clicking buttons on the interface do not work (Win 10 I suspect).  Which coupled with frantic gameplay cause frustration and rage when you lose control of the situation on multiple fronts. - Buildings cant be repaired so as to focus tactics/strategy on unit construction, composition and use.- A few crashes on saving the game.  But mostly it worked fine.  You will only lose the time spent between saves.- One of the most difficult RTS A.I. to overcome. (Hard Difficulty) :)- Not so great audio prompts fail to give you enough time to counter any units that get into your base.AND THE ORDINARY:* The idea of simulation missions is novel but really doesnt add much to any aspect of gameplay other than providing some experience points.* Some achievements require replaying mission with an alternate strategy or priority.* The range of units is limited.  Which is fair given the game's RPG element but it small in comparison to proper RTS games like C&C or World in Conflict.VERDICT:I have had this review written up over the past few weeks.  Every time I launch the game and play some campaign my opinion goes to Recommended.  I try a skirmish versus Hard AI and it changes to Not Recommended.  This you may find, will likely mirror your experience with the game.  In the end I have only just gone for Recommended but with the following caveats:Overall Merdian: New World makes a decent stab at producing a story-driven RPG experience through the RTS genre.  The campaign was very good and I liked the way you are pitted against an unknown, superior force, with a limited number of units and resources.  Requiring you to utilise your command abilties to make a difference with slight changes to tactical aspects of the missions to hand.  Fans of the RTS genre should also note that this is not a complete RTS experience such as the C&C series.  Reconsider getting this if you are after a similar experience with a long full campaign of almost unrestricted base-building and unit creation.  Even if the skirmish mode is more in keeping with traditional RTS games it only has a limited set of scenarios to play.  Playing these on Hard is either a very short-lived or sado-masochistic experience.  As Ive said already there is no multi-player.  Bad if you hanker for it.  Not so bad given the plethora of games that dont have enough of a player-base for their intended online modes.Unit variation & weapon configuration seem like a good idea but, in reality it doesnt work beyond the missions where you must conserve units and are unable build any new ones.  In missions where there is a base it comes down to how many mines you can possess thus giving you the numbers to overwhelm your opponent.  There is no small special force dynamic that will allow you to outgun a superior force.Combat is nice, fast and vicious but for the most part difficult to coordinate.  It relies to much on micromanaging your forces at all times, while you juggle base buidling and unit build-queues. The game badly needed unit self-preservation as they can be lost in the blink of an eye, which given alot of the achievements is perplexing.  The developer seems to have forgotten or dismissed that mistakes are always possible by humans.  A pause button to issue orders would have been a godsend.  Add to that the not-so perfect pathing and the need to maximize your force numbers against the A.I at all times and it becomes frustrating real fast.Note that the A.I looks to have been designed with two things in mind - to outproduce whatever you are building and to swarm you with superior numbers, so that you are always relying on your command abilities to keep you in touch.  Thats not so easy when you dont have the power to use them.  Therein lies the problem.  If you dont twig what strategy you should be undertaking from the start then youll either get frustrated very quickly and quit the game or save-scum your way to victory.  Heaven forbid that the developer should have given average players the chance to recover and overcome their mistakes or deficiencies.The bottom-line is that Meridian: New World is sometimes a decent experience and sometimes it is not!  The great story, superb production values (for an indie), a tight game design are swept aside by micromanagement hell and in-efficient pathing killing any chance of continuous fun the game could have been. Im sure you will be save-scumming as much as me if you are not able to play the perfect game!  There are better RTS games however on sale its cheap and if you dont mind being taken out of your comfort zone the campaign experience alone is perhaps different enough to try when your mood is more forgiving.

Early Access Review
								My goodness, this is an awful game.I see what they are trying to do, I really do. Meridian: New World is trying to be a throwback to the good old days of Westwood and Command and Conquer, and has many good ideas along the way, but it fails on too many levels to be anything but a waste of money. Poor controls, optimization, visuals, voice acting, and a general feeling of shabbiness ruin what may have, at one time, had the potential for an interesting experience.There is the germ of good ideas here; you can customize the loadouts of individual units upon construction, which is always neat, and the story is attempting to be that rarest of beasts, a character-driven RTS. You, the player, have a branching tech tree that allows you to perfom actions like healing individual units, disable enemy vehicles, that sort of thing. The problem is, like so many games of a more indie persuasion, the good ideas fail to live up to their potential. The customizable loadouts are a good idea, but it's done when you start building your units, meaning that by the time it's done, you may have wanted something different...but too bad! You'll need to build a new one. Compare Dawn of War, which had a fantastic loadout system. The story is uninteresting, poorly translated into english, and with pretty awful voice acting. Normally I wouldn't mind this, but they are clearly trying to use branching, bioware style conversation trees and characterization to drive the plot. Bad voice acting undermines this goal. The controls are slow and stiff, with painfully snail-like camera panning, and the ugly, impractical UI doesn't help. In a good RTS, your units feel alive, and responsive, and you are able to control them with precision and skill. Here, I feel lucky when they are even able to move where I want them to go. And if I wanted to change the controls to fit my needs, I have exactly two options to customize controls; mouse sensitivity and a toggle for ""camera panning,"" a mysterious button with no discenerable effect on gameplay.The players ability tree works well though. Kudos for that, though it was at first a little unclear how the energy bar that powers your abilities works. Unfortunately, there is only one faction (something the original Command and Conquer was able to overcome), and so the tech tree is the only source of variety you're going to get.Moving on, the game is ugly an poorly optimized. It chugged more than games that look far better than this does, and crashes frequently. I know this is part of the early access package, but you have to keep it together if you want players to stick with it until the final release.Finally, on a less easily described note, the game just feels...shabby. Other early access games have been able to have a feeling of beauty and vibrancy from the very beginning, but this game feels broken on a more fundamental level.Taken as a whole, Meridian: New World is, quite, quite awful. It is the product of one man's vision, and where for some games that means a new experience, here it is clearly the work of someone in way over their head, trying to match the work of those who are far more skilled. It would take a truly gargantuan effort to make this game worth playing at its final release date, and I just can't see it happening. Take this game as an example of Steam's famously lax quality control. Or better still, don't take the game, and go play your favorite good RTS instead.			"

												This game is an RTS developed on a competitive formula and created mostly by a single person. The graphics are on par with many modern RTS titles and the gameplay is, for the most part, slick and elegant. As an RTS, its only pitfall in my opinion is a lack of factions and the ability to have team battles. The game currently lacks multiplayer, but the developer has stated that he plans on adding it in later. The campaign is a very interesting take on the RTS formula with interesting and varied missions that are actually quite challenging. It's a nice throwback to the quality of RTS that we used to see back during their inception, a la C&C and Red Alert. This is a fun game that you should support as much on principle as in practice- one guy made this game, and it's nearly as good as strong titles like Starcraft and Company of Heroes.			"

								I really, really wanted to like this game. I just can't, though. I guess the reason for a larger team instead of one person is to point out little helpful things like... ""Don't you think it's really annoying that units will just charge the whole way accross the screen to fight something?""And...  ""I understand the medic scouts are fast... but it's just aggravating that they will always run to the front of the battle."" In fact, that's most of this game... could have just called it formation commander. Most of it just involves trying to keep healing units from being in the front.As for the campaign... it's tedious. It's extremely simple with hard parts that shouldn't be hard at all. At one level you're left with a tower defence portion. This killed the entire game for me. There's not enough of a story to bother spending the time it would take to beat it. You can't even adjust the difficulty... there simply isn't an adjustment. Anyways... at about level 20(of the TD mini game) I just gave up. Positioning units to protect from air attack... and then they just run off all willy nilly. Hey, and in this part... you can't control them... No hold position function.Seriously... I wanted to love this game... I wanted to so bad. I just can't. It looks pretty, but the  mechanics are horrible.			"

But it also has its up side, the sci-fi themed is pretty good, this game is a mission-based RTS with crew driven sections describing an elaborate back-story through dialgoue and cutscenes.

												Meridian is a good RTS. The main negatives are that the pathfinding of units in the came can be very frustrating, as your forces often seperate into small groups and take different paths to a target. This leads to unnessesary deaths, and in my opinion is the game's biggest weakness. In terms of content, there isn't enough units and variety in the game to keep it fresh. That being said, the game looks great, plays great, and skirmish battles against the ai is fun. Make no mistake, this is no Starcraft II, but it feels unique in its own way. So is it worth the $10? Its up to you. You will certainly enjoy this for at least a few hours, and if you get into the campaign perhaps many more.			"

								As of v0.81:Pretty good RTS. And it is (mostly) developed by one person which is even more impressive.It's somewhat generic in most parts, but has a few interesting features that make it stand out (may be not too much).AI is pretty good as well (still not without glitches though) - it took me quite a lot of effort to deal with Easy AI (well, I'm quite bad at RTS genre).Still, would recommend, the game is pretty solid. Campaign has nice mission variety. Graphics looks quite good. Loading times are close to zero.More detailed overview in the video:

												This game does not know how to resolution. Switching to windowed mode, leaves you with a 1024x768 (4:3) window, that cannot be resized to 16:9, and if you force the window to resize (through user32.dll calls) it borks out. In fullscreen, it awkwardly defies the natural resolution of your monitor, and stretches the image. In 2014... really.The UI, when typing, is rather unresponsive. Press the keys slowly, for every key to be registered. It's terrible.The AI of your own units is dumb as a pile of poop, making micromanagement nigh impossible. Being able to save hurt units is more luck than anything.Since you can't see what keys you CAN use, I will have to assume that you cannot group units under a hotkey, which is a default must have since 1489 BC, or the more recent saving hotkeys to map positions since 700 AD. Good job, guys.Since metal is a music genre right up my alley, the combat music suits me. Though most of the time, the game just quiets down and doesn't play any music at all, until an event triggers a new track to play.You cannot rebind any keys in the controls options menu (which only sets mouse sensitivity and... uh... some other toggleable option. I wanted to check, but now after quitting the game, it doesn't even start anymore. The EXE file just exits immediately. Well, so much for that. But at least it didn't crash while playing.) which there is no excuse for.But what upset me most of all in the 4.5 hours of playing the campaign is the dumbfukked AI of your very own units.For a 2014 RTS game, this really is a rather crap.

												Might have been a good game...had it been released back in the late 90's. Sadly it doesn't measure up to todays standards. The visuals are acceptable for a budget title, and the music is nice (if somewhat limited). Gameplay however is where it falls down. You have almost no control over your units, who will run in an die suicidally as soon as they see an enemy, but will happily sit around and be sniped if the shooter is out of their vision range. They will ignore opposing buildings unless given specific attack orders. There is no way to control this behaviour.Commander abilities added some depth, but couldn't be used enough to make it really interesting due to the energy limiting their use.Skirmish AI is just an exercise in who can rush first. Oh, and they usually get rsource bonuses, and defenses are mid-game structures. Good luck having anything resembling ""fun"" there.			"

I like the ability to make choices or the way the game evolves in a tower defense (even if it's not my favorite kind of game).However, there a few details to improve : The pathfinding,  because I hate when my Chimera goes directly under turrets fire when I told her to go in a totally different direction.  The unities behaviour when you try to get them out of the fight to save them, they automatically go back to the fight even if their life bar is as red as it can be !But these are details.

												The game is a decent one-man effort, but suffers from a lot of flaws.At one point in the campaign, instead of playing an RTS, I have to play through a Tower Defense that drags on for 25 waves. Often I feel like the majority of the game is gimmicks, and not enough actual RTS.Pathing is done on a totally local perspective, meaning if there's a tight choke, units will legitimately get confused and seek alternative, extremely long paths.There's also a levelling grind to unlock abilities, which I found pretty pointless as a design decision and annoying (although use of these abilities is necessary!)The Human vs AI skirmish is fine (at least on 1v1), and the enemy AI is ok, but it's not worth buying the game for.I will honestly say I had some fun, but I could have had more fun just playing a free RTS on Spring.

The way your units path, your control group and waypoint options.-Some sound assets need work-No multiplayerFor more information.

												Very bad controls, unresponsive and laggy in terms of responsiveness of units. If you're used to Starcraft-tier of smoothness, this game is almost the exact opposite.The gameplay itself is fun tho, I like the game mechanics. Campaign was so-so, I didn't like to control the main guy on the ship but that's just me.Overall i'd give this game a 5/10 and will not recommend until the devs fix their customization / responsiveness / controls.

								A good stratey game which reminds me of supreme commander (the first not the second) with similar style units and gameplay making a good strategy game with commander powers as well as the ability to change the weapons which units are equipped with when constructed. A good game which i like and doesnt, yet, feel like some other early access games out there. =P			"

								This is more of a first impression than a review, mainly becuase it's still early access. Meridian brings back the C&C style of RTS gameplay that I've been looking for for ages. The unit mechanics are easily the most interesting part of the game for me. Rather than have a number of different units with a single function, you have a several units that can be built with different weapons and mining/construction gear. For example, you can have a tank that makes buildings and mines the main resource, Shardium. In terms of graphical fidelity, it looks gorgeous. Although I would prefer a zoom function on the camera controls. There isn't much that needs improving really, just focus on a greater unit variety, maybe add in other factions? And also rebindable keys would be nice.			"

												Alright, So after playing 3 missions and doing about 5 Challenges. I have to say the game is Good... It's not great, but it's good for what it is. It's just to easy of a game. If you actually try your hardest, you can win each mission without losing any units. You just have to micro manage and heal your troops with the special ""Healing Ability"" that you get. I don't recall having to choose a difficulty level which kinda sucks. They introduce the technology if only you capture it from the enemy which is somewhat annoying. It's like the nation your playing can't develope its own technology instead, they have to steal it. If I have to rate it out of 5. I would give it a simple 3/5. Best to get the game when its on sale for less then $5.00			"

												Unit art work is pretty cool. The cinematic has decent resolution but everything else  in the game are very crude.There's a basic RPG element inbetween missions where you get to move around in a ship. There are marked locations on the ground if you move there you get the option to activate some function or talk to some one. you have a few choices in the dialogues as well. But dont think it alters the story.The user interface and menu look very poor. The unit movement speed doesnt feel realistic, the map scroll feels sluggish, and army groups hot keys dont zone in the largest army which makes it a bit annoying.The game feels like something you would play 10-15 years ago. At least the game is sci-fi and has cool units I suppose. You dont see this kind of game very much at all.			"

												IF your looking for an old school RTS game with some b@ll$ that requires you to play smart and doesnt hold your hand like a little child, then BUY THIS GAME. If you're a person who needs their hand held and wants to dominate every level with ease while sucking on a pasifier, then go clinch your mouth on your MOMMA'S B@@B instead, because this isnt the game for babies.In all seriousness, this game is for all types of players and offers alot of ways to play out your missions. The question is, is your way going to work? You have to be quick on your feet and think fast because this game is not here to just let you win, but instead, its here to be beaten.Dont read this and run away scared, its not going to give you nightmares or make you think to yourself, ""Gee, I suck at life"". No, don't think that. What it does is it makes you feel like a little B!t@h because you came in expecting it to be a breeze and it was too hard for you to dominate first try while sitting on your f@t @$s choking on fried chiken and hearing your mommy in the other room yell at you all day and night that you need to get a life, get a job, wipe your stinky @$s, clean your room, quit looking at sheporn and so on.So buy this game if your ready to grab life by the b@ll$ and quit acting like a total poser who is a nit picky little girl who still needs their @$s wiped. Time to play with the big boys!			"

Early Access Review
								After reading the reviews on this title, and since it was compared to big titles like Starcraft, I had some reluctance purchasing this game. Will this be a waste of money? For a game to have the quality of a Starcraft is really asking a lot (that is whether you have to need to do so). Well, just before the summer sale was over I thought what the heck I’ll give it a go. I’m no expert on game design and graphics and so forth … I’m just a gamer that wants an enjoyable game that’s good value for money. No lagging, crashes and so on (you get the picture). I’ve been branded as full of crap when it comes to games so I see myself as a gamer with high expectations.I’ve played Meridian: New World for a bit now and I found no fault in the graphics. The detail to the buildings are good. It would have been nice to be able to zoom in closer since the characters are very small (1920 x 1080). The AI seems to be functioning well on their own. The sound is pretty decent and you have dialog options. The cut scenes was lagging a bit though … nothing serious but it’s there. I’m not an online gamer so I can’t comment on that. It may not have the online capability of bigger titles but this game does not have all that security hassles either and for me that is preferable. The price is by far more reasonable than the bigger titles. You see, you do not have to pay for the attached “prestige”.As I understand it, this game was designed by a single developer. Really? Well, if that is the case I have one thing to say to this person … you’re doing a great job. This is one purchase I will not regret. I got “bang for my buck” (pardon the pun). Do I recommend this game? I found it enjoyable so I have to say for sure! As I read in another review and to quote the person … “buy this game, or I’ll poke you in the eye”. Well, get on with it. Happy gaming. "

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Meridian New World 

			Views: 690		

			Meridian New World is a RTS on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/265120/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your thing: https://twitter.com/TheSocioPsycho...		

	Meridian: New World is a Real Time Strategy single player game.  Themusic is very well done, and adds to the highs and lows of the combat and story.  The graphics and the story combine beautifully to create a visual work of art.  	One issue I have noted in this game is in the user interface.The map is nicely done, and I had no issue with the moving or management oftroops, but there are small problems like having to click on the scene tomove individual troops.   There is a level of micromanagement that has beenintegrated into the system that makes the action of moving troops more complicated than it needs to be, which becomes more and more of an issue as youprogress through higher levels of difficulty.	The level design is done quite well.  The missions provide small variations with specific goals that breaks up any feeling of repetitive combat.  What hurts this game is the lack of a proper tutorial;  you are just thrown into the action without proper knowledge of the interface.  As the levels get larger, and you have a larger army, you need to have tight control of your troopsand a workable strategy with how you  progress.  The AI in this game is verypoor, where sometimes a troop that you tell to hold position will decided to attack anyways, making any advanced strategy near impossible as you have to babysit your troops to make sure they don't go off on their own.  It isextremely frustrating.	The game suffers from many minor annoyances;  I go into more detail inmy video, but small things like not being able to bind to infantry barracks toone key, or not being able to build buildings if there is a troop in the way,and the continuous swarming of the enemy that doesn't seem to have a unit capwhile you are limited by resources all add up to a not fun experience.  The cost of troops to the amount of resources available in the game is unbalanced.  	 Overall, I can't recommend this game due to the combination of so many small annoyances that all add up to a frustrating experience.  The gamedoesn't respect you or your time, and isn't worth your money.This is a summary of what I talk about in the video, I am a YT'er not a BloggerThanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

								This game is dissapointig in it's current state. It just makes no fun play it.In campaign mode you get stuck in the turret mission if you dont follow an exactly timed pattern of moves. You dont see this the first 5 times but after 10 tries or so it becomes clearly. It's like Dragons Lair from the 80ies. In skirmish mode you don't last longer then 5 minutes regardless of what you doing, with normal AI. Another wasted 15 EUR on ""early access"" if this is not getting better.			"

								Well what can i say about this game, its beautiful graphically and the soundtrack is ace ive found myself distracted from building troops because of the soundtrack. The ai is clever and even on easy mode can provide a bit of a challenge to those inexperienced with RTS games or to those who might be a bit rusty (like me.) This is definitely worth the very reasonable price and is a must have for any hardcore RTS fan if you havent played an RTS game before, this wouldnt be the worst choice for a first experience although there may be other games slightly more forgiving, C&C im looking at you. The fact that this game was developed in 2 years and is this well executed really sets the bar high for the bigger companys to follow suit as for as an RTS game goes Meridian: New World is a fine piece of work and very enjoyable and frustrating to play the best combo for an RTS.

								Well ,its still in Early Access. But for what ive seen till now you can just go buy Starcraft 2 instead, since both games aim for the exact same gameplay with Starcraft 2 being plain superior in every aspect.I was hoping to either get something new or something like Supreme Commander 1.The game is all about fast gameplay with close to zero effort putting into building a base. Just put up 5 buildings somewhere, build cheap units and rush like theres no tomorrow. Thats the only way to win. Defending your base? Impossible. Using real strategie? Impossible.As it is now the game has no depth in its gameplay, no real choices to make. And even when it gets rid of all the glitches and gets some nice polishing, in the end it will still feel like a cheap Starcraft 2 ripoff with no real originality.Of course if you really like Starcraft and you cant get enough of it this game just might be right for you.

												This is a pretty fun RTS game. The campaign is pretty rad and will probably take you 10-15 hours to beat. If you're looking for a fairly challenging RTS then this game definitely may be worth looking into as it has some very tough campaign missions and the skirmish mode can be rather tough. There is only one playable faction in the game, which to me is a MAJOR draw back to an RTS. The visuals in the game are pretty decent and it certainly isn't unpleasant to look at. Also as a warning to those who love to play multiplayer RTS, this game doesn't appear to have a multiplayer at the present time. Overall I would give this game a 6.5/10. If you absolutely love RTS games then you should get this, but if you're looking for something that presents many unique factions and various styles of play, then this isn't the game for you.			"

Early Access Review
								The vid says tired of the same bugs/templars crawling on your screen for the last 10 years... well this game doesn't actually provide anything new at all, one playable faction will get tedious very quickly.  This is the type of game that you've played before in C&C, Star Craft and Earth 2160.  Nothing new going on here.  I got rather bored by mission 3, repeat of all things old. If you have the old games, keep with them, will save you some money.  It's not a terrible game, but just nothing to shout about.The idea around the game isn't anything special although the players ability tree works well though in the game.  Some of the things that are annoying can be found in other post, formation command being number 1 for me.  Units are disorganised and random, air units fly around eachother on a lateral plane no concept of 3d spacing.  There are only a few units that you're playing with the same ones over and over.Overall, as above, save your money and get out your old CDs, more enjoyable.  Thank goodness I got this game on Humble and paid nowhere near the price... it's not worth it.			"

												The only thing this game has going for it, is the great terrain graphics. I understand this game is not finished, but so far I am not impressed. This looks like a mediocre, plain RTS with RPG elements with absolutely nothing to set it apart from anything that came before. The storyline elements where you are walking inside the base and talking to your team are more annoying than useful making me want to just click through them to get to the action. Weapon effects and sounds are very underwhelming. You cannot zoom in to your units to see them upclose. I just dont see anything here worth the $9 I paid on HumbleBundle. If this was free, maybe I wouldnt be writing this review at all.			"

								Let me start by saying, I'm not a fan of ""Early Access"" games.  This ""game"" is the exact reason why.  I just finished the campaign mode, which consisted of about 1/10th of what i imagine the complete game will be (like 3 maps).  I labeled it as ""recommended"", because it is truly a very-well put together RTS.  It's beautiful, plays extremely well, and a solid buy at $15, that is, it will be when it is COMPLETE.  The problem with early access games, is that they are often abandoned or updates are severely delayed.  I hope that's not the case with Meridian.  I suggested this game, because you can play Skirmish and have fun with it, but I'd recommend waiting until the game is complete.			"

												I went into the shop thinking i was going to buy grey goo the RTS C&C like game but realising it is only available via steam i bought this game thinking there would be not that much difference, i thought its a RTS C&C like game why not only £15.99 why not, I get home install this game, start playing not even 5 mins into my first game I thought ""why did I spend my money on this unfinished game"" here is the point i am trying to makeThis game has1 factionPoor AIExteamly simple maps i could create in 5 mins by fingerpainting poor detailthe only correlation to this and C&C is that it is an RTS.The only team seperation is via colour eg  :blue,red,green ectSo here is my advice to sombody who is thinking of buying this game:DONT BUY IT, IT IS UNFINISHED, EXTREAMLY BADLY MADE, JUST SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY A REAL RTS JUST DONT BUY THIS			"

												I'm quite critical when I play RTS games, I expect it to be enjoyable, and have quality. Sadly, this game's quality is not... the best.The optimization is atrocious, probably the most ridiculous drop of FPS that I have ever seen. I have a GTX 770, i5 4670k, 8GB of RAM, and an SSD. Now, explain how at the lowest settings I get 5FPS when there's more than 30 bots on screen? Yeah, that's right, it was probably a bug, but it really threw me off.The story seems really fun, and so does the choices of conversations and the missions, but the controls of the camera are awful, the buildings and the queue of troops is AWFUL, you might as well click 20 times CREATE X SOLDIER, but it only registers 3 or 4 hits at best, it's broken as hell, really makes you angry. The HUD needs to be improved, and so does everything regarding the mechanics, camera, and controls.I'd be willing to give it a shot if the game would get fixed, but it doesn't seem likely, hope I'm wrong.

												A mostly solid RTS from a small team, it has a nice plot and some rpg mechanics. The unit weapon customisation was good but it was hard to tell at a glance which unit had which weapon. The varied missions are another plus to me, though instant failure stealth sections (thankfully rare) are a bit annoying.It's all marred by the unit pathing (causing chokepoints to often become a nightmare.) But that's not too bad in most cases.Still had fun with it, and the music was great.			"

												I havent played this game much yet. To be honest with all the negative reviews, i was going to just pass by. However one review said it was like warcraft 1 and 2. That are my favorite. I have been looking for a similar game like warcraft 2 since they still have not (if ever) make a warcraft 4.This game feels like warcraft 2 in every way. Mine resources, build your requires buildings per unit, attack with units, etc. It has a campaign, skirmish missions, custom map editor, and able to download maps from the community. It reminds me of warcraft 2 with a reskin (much better graphics obviously) and change to mech units instead of orcs and humans. There are some small differences, but that is fine. Its not meant to be 100% replica of warcrafts. The pathfinding is exactly what you expect from warcraft 2. This caught my eye because it was on sale. However, i would pay the full price for this game after playing it. I am not sure why people are giving so many bad reviews. If you played warcraft 1/2/3 in the 90's you will love this game. Especiialy if you are aching for more games like that. Maybe the bad reviewers are young kids that never played the early 90's warcraft games. Who knows. Im glad i didnt just bypass this game because of all the thumbs down.@developerThere is one thing i wish it had that it does not. Multiplayer. Even warcraft 2 had LAN. However being a dev myself, i know how much more work that adds in. Hope to see it on the next one though. Keep up the great work and dont listen to these fools.			"

								Overall a very polished game. Check out my video for a demonstration. Currently, the campaign and skirmish mode works well. I haven't been able to play through the campaign, though it looks pretty complete and well done. There's about 4-8 skirmish maps, and it does have steam workshop integration.

								I find this game in its current state to be fairly entertaining.  The graphics are great especially for a VERY small development team.  The gameplay itself is enjoyable although the units seem to have a slight path finding issue; they often start walking in a different direction trying to find a new way of travel when they can't procced, this i am hoping will be cheched on.  The campaign while short currently shows great promise in future developments;  I can tell this game has great potential which is why i bought it so I would definalty recommend it to others.----   Can't wait for more :)   ----			"

								This could be (and probably will be) a brilliant game.  Been waiting for a decent C&C clone for ages and this is on the right tracks.  However, version 0.87 early access is simply unplayable as a 1 player skirmish experience. * You start with 4 harvesters.  You build a troop maker straight away and set it to make troops.  You build a power planet and a storage unit.  The enemy attack, your troops all die with 1 of there's possible dying.  By time 2 more troops are built, he has tanks, and a huge army that could not possibly have been built in that time.  Even if you have a light tank bay, you may get 1 or 2 out but they'll die in a completely unbalamced way.  Effectively,  Medium and Hard are impossible to win on in skirmish mode. This is also true for some of the time on Easy.* Ai cant shoot through buildings* You cant build a building on the square the very builder is standing on.  Seriously annoying			"

								This game has potential. SOOOO much potential.First the things I like: -Mechs-Great customization-Good unit variety-Research-base building-novel level ideas, such as the stealth mission-Well written (IMO) campaignUnfortunately, while this game does some things very well, it has a number of what I consider to be major issues:-Your unit AI is completely braindead. This is what I picture your mech pilots thinking: ""Hmmm.... Should I, an autogun mech that cannot damage air targets stay here, at the choke point my commander selected for me when there will be another wave of infantry soon, or should I chase the bomber that I have absolutely no way of damaging and get eaten by it? I think I'll chase the bomber!"" -Medical units are notably faster than primary fighting units. This does not sound like a con until you have to micromanage a squad of 10 medic units to actually stay BEHIND your frontline so they dont get pulverized and leave your primary force without a way to repair its armor-The tower defence mode is very poorly executed. If you make one single mis-move, or even mismanage your resources in the slightest, you will nearly instalose. In addition, if I had wanted to play a TD game, I would have played a TD game. I feel that this game has a massive amount of potential, but the current issues are, for me at least, completely game breaking. Most notable is the friendly unit AI issues. They will literally chase enemy units half way across the map even if they are not equipped to damage them.If during development these issues are patched, I would wholeheartedly recommend this game, but as it stands now, I cannot.

Its a basic simple RTS with nothing new to add and does nothing better than any of the established brands out there. The fact that one guy made it doesnt detract from any of those facts.			"

								I like very much. It is little bit rough, but seems stable and kinda sucks in. It tries to make it more personal with very small role playing part. The RPG doesn't give much options or way to affect things, but it's there nevertheless and somehow helps associating to the characters. Also, it tries to throw special missions during the big missions. Like once there was a tower defence  sub-mission. Doesn't get boring so easily.What I don't like is that I cannot queue actions with shift. Some other people probably won't like the simplified tactics against computer. I mean I seem to get far by just building healing scouts in masses.			"

								The game is more unfinished than I thought, but I'd like to support the developer. It has the ability to be a fun game, but its UI and resource system is too old-style. It needs it own style (think of Relic vs Blizzard RTS games: CoH/DoW vs SC/SC2). I know it's in early developement, but it really needs its own UI, I'm not kidding, if the UI doesn't get better along with its own touch this will be a wreck. With that said, this game has easy potential to become amazing. The graphics are nice along with the artwork. It is fun to play, even if it's in an early stage. I can't wait to see what it holds.

												This game is quite bad, you can only play as 1 faction. There are not many buildings, very few units. The story is not the worst, but not great. Skirmish sucks♥♥♥♥♥.. there's max 4 players per match. There's barely any resources to play with, if you want to play a hour long game... forget about it. Almost ran out of resources in 20 min. Cap limit is also way too low.Well... i do not recommend it really.. i guess you could play the campaign if you get the discount at 1€ (the reason i bought the game).  I didn't even finish campaign though, this game way too boring for a RTS kind of a guy like me... Was disappointed, damn.Game doesn't seem to be optimised... i get weird fps lag, might just be me.I would rate it 3/10. "

												This is really really bad, but in the things I did not anticipated. I don't mind B-story or limited set of units and buildings or the whole unoriginal settings. What I really wanted (and expected) was an old school RTS and that's what it is! The problem is you just can't play it, because the HUD is terrible, standard RTS hotkeys are not working, some voice overs are missing, the mouse cursor is contextually changing the most idiotic way... So many little things! You could forgive a few of them, but the total amount makes the game unplayable if you're used to a certain level of quality from the old C&C or AoE games. Wasted potential.

												This game has a long list of problems, ill start with the worst of them.-Unit control: your units ai is so bad you can hardly control them. Your units will not stay in one place no mater how many times to tell them to. If there is even 1 enemy with in your vision your units will go after them EVEN if they are on the other side of the map. When you try to tell them to move to one point they will change there mind so fast you cant hit the hold position button before they are scattered all over. When you use the hold command they will sit still but they will not fire on enemy's or defend themselves. So they will sit there and DIE unless you let them run all over them map at will. Movement is another problem, as units will not move together. When you give a move command all of your units will scatter around before they go the way you want them. Many will even go the opposite direction for a wile before they decide to go the way you want. Even if you give an attack order units will go in every direction before they get to your target.  This is a big problem as you will lose many units as they get there one at a time sometimes tow at a time. If you don't keep constant eye on your units they will all die and you will never even see it.-interface problemsOne Major problem is you get no warning if you are under attack. The enemy can attack your base wile you are babysitting your attack units and you will never know. There is no warning on screen or on the map that you are under attack. This same goes for your units, they can wonder off and all die and you will never know it. You will not even have sounds unless you are looking right at the fighting. You would think explosions would make sounds at a distance but NO.-strategy problemsThe one and only strategy that works is to get the long range lasers on ALL your units and zerg rush the enemy.  For all the different weapon types, the only one that works is the long rang lasers. If you try to use anything but them the enemy will mass them and blow you away before you get in range to attack. If you mass long range then the enemy will sit there and let you kill them. Only some times will they go after you and fight, other times they seem to just give up.So much of this game is copied from other games, but its dune so poorly I cant recommend this game to anyone.

												REREVIEWEDso i left this game alone for ages (probably over a year) and came back hoping it had been changed, however this game is still boring as ♥♥♥♥. the story is nothing special and really it just feels like an old school RTS that you would only enjoy for nostalgic reasons. definately a hit and miss, nice try but not recommendedOld Reviewit is still very early in it's development but it has a lot of potential. when i first played i found it a little boring. nothing really excited. the units have average sound effects, there is no tracers and the biggest thing that i can't stand in RTS games is when the infantry is the same size as a tank. other than that (hopefully these are fixed eventually) it has decent graphics, the campaign has an interesting story so far and you can pick loadouts of your units before you make them. i think by the time this is finished it will be very good.

												Going to be brief, I'm too tired to write a big wordy review. Here it is.The game suddenly goes from RTS to tower defense. Throws in units that attack from outside the range of your turrets. Requires you to know that you need to save a large amount of a very limited resource to use it at exact timings. No warnings of this beforehand. Someone thought this was a good idea. Basically just wastes your time by forcing you to run into an issue, die, memorize and restart. No skill or real thought involved.Alright but in general:Doesn't look great, yet runs awfully.Seemingly limited unit selection.Very slowly unlocks new tech, then immediately takes it away from you at the start of the next mission requiring you to unlock it again as an objective. This happens every mission with almost every piece of tech. And no, I don't mean research. I mean something like - Go to abandoned base -> Build X basic building -> Build a basic unit -> Basic unit only has 1 choice of weapon despite you having had 3 choices of weapon for that unit in the previous mission -> Go collect some abandoned units lying around on the map -> suddenly your basic unit can have it's choice of weapons back. There's no logic to this.Path finding is absolutely awful. Moving 1-2 units is fine. Move 3 or more and some proportion of them will take very long, winding paths to even a nearby destination. Units don't 'stack' properly. If you have say 10 units, you tell them to move to a point on the ground and they will arrange themselves in a random area around that point. They will not try and get as close to that point as possible. Anyone who has ever played Starcraft 2 will know what I mean and why this is important. (Doubly important as there's a unit and an ability that heal everything around them in a small area).EDIT:Forgot to add that clicking is really unreponsive in this game. It simply does not register commands anywhere between 33% and 75% of the time (can vary from minute to minute). Don't attempt to click an individual unit, just box it.And it doesn't communicate why your command didn't happen even when there's a valid reason e.g. not enough resources for a unit/building. "

								Well this one was a kind of game that i was after. This one is way better than Planetary Annihilation, it has story, unfortunely multiplayer wasnt implemented. At lead not yet. Will hope they will add it before the game is finnished or soon after is released. Anyway, the story and campaings/missions are importante for me. I really enjoyed the story of this one, the 20€ was well worth it, the game ad depth, the storyline is very good, the grafics are very good too!!Hope the devs hear us, while they are finnishing the game and hope they add more story and content to the game!I highly recommend this game, but pay attention this game is unfinnished so you may find some bugs here and there.

												After a couple of hours play; nothing really stands out about this game - the voice acting is average and the story does nothing to really demand your attention; the game play - at least so far appear to be your typical stock Starcraft cross Command and Conquer RTS certainly not revolutionary.  The unit control system seems unrefined, group ordering units often causes them to stumble into one another or run out wide to avoid others - this caused me several headaches in the games 'forced stealth section'.Do your wallet a favour and pass.

												For me, this game takes me back the root of old; original, simple RTS mechanics. Small core unit variants with user choice equipments. Each unit has its place. When I first jumped into a skirmish, exploring the world, ignoring tutorials to allow for self discovery and getting stomped for Easy AI after 15mins, it casted a stark reminder of KKND. The original, difficult, ruthless AI, quirky controls and tactical base expansion. None of the rush counter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t many newer RTS games compete to embrace for the ""pro-gamers"" nod. Meridian New World is bought to us by a small studio with wonderful graphics and simply fun. I, for this, welcome the game and future content was a wonderful surprise as generally I don't follow news. For all the negative reviews by wannabe patch perfect, the game is a fraction of a AAA-title and it has excellent PC specifications for those who game on a budget.			"

												Date: 1/31/16Review Number: 6 Game: Meridian: New WorldFrom (Creator Publisher): Elder Games Played On: LaptopSteam Price as of Review: $6.99Total Time played: 40 MinutesReview:The next game on the wheel of morality is Meridian: New World, a RTS clone from publisher Elder Games that seems to take after the Starcraft style of play rather than the Command and Conquer style; essentially a foreign planet robot manned colonization strategy game with a surprisingly intuitive and minimal UI.  The only issue I have with this is that everything else about this seems done already.  The story itself (at least the first half hour) was fairly standard, and didn’t really feel very engaging.  The graphics, though pretty even at lower quality levels, seemed to get in the way more than anything else.  All in all, I would think that hardcore fans of RTS games would appreciate this, but really there are probably better ways to spend your time. Maybe after putting in a few hours, this game may have more substance, however that is not the context in which I am writing these reviews, so unfortunately, this is what we get.Game’s Fate: Uninstalled.  When I want to play an RTS, I’ll go try Starcraft 2Buy/No Buy: It’s Pretty and certainly seems to work, but i would wait till it’s on sale, and even then only if you are a big RTS fan already.			"

It should be 100% free, if not, people should be invited and payed to beta test it. The pathing is absolute garbage. The graphics are sub-par. The fighting and smoothness of battle is terrible. There are barly any units. The way they use food, and power is a good concept, but it's annoying. I understand this guy was trying to make it a new game, which one day it may turn into that, but I 100% regret spending a dime on this game.

Not the initial tutorial, but the one after.  I recognize that this is likely an early access related problem, and is also probably not a problem for everyone.  Just please be aware that there are issues that still need to be addressed before you put money down on this. I cannot reccomend this game until I can play it through.  So right now, I'd reccomend you delay your purchase, but keep an eye on this one for later.			"

								This has got to be the best RTS of the year i havnt played a game this good since command and conquer. I know its still work in progress but for a small programming company it is fantastic i would pay more for this in the shops. The graphics are fantastic and i really like the part where you can walk about the ship free roam. It brings more to the story and its not all just video story and no way for you to play a part in it. In my eyes its an adventure pc game meet RTS Game. It is brilliant have not seen nothing like it. Well done cant wait for more addons. Give you 10 out of 10 for gameplay and unquie style of RTS. Would reccomend this game to anyone that likes RTS. Sorry for my spelling mistakes realy early in the morning as i have been up all night playing this and this is my first reveiw. Havnt had any games off steam that is this good to review.			"

												The idea is good, it wants to bring back the RTS games on which the generation of 90's grew up. At first it feels like Emperor Battle for the Dune. And then the drunk AI comes in. Units can't attack while moving, lack some basic command options and behave like drunk suicide wreckers (e.g. leaving the defence line to attack an enemy in the line of sight, but not attacking one in the field). Can't help to wonder if they run on vodka instead of fuel.The game itself is not hard and becomes boring quite soon due to repetitiveness, prolonged mission duration and AI stupidity.If you really miss the good old RTS you can grab this on a sale, otherwise I would not recommend it.P.S.But even despite this the developer (allegedly a one man team) deserves respect for the work done.P.P.S.More reviews and game recommendations at: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ogrreview "

								Unlike the MAJORITY of Indie games, the developer has no intention to support laptops with GPUs. It is written in the warning to buy this game, but please heed that there is NO future intention. As stated by the developer, himself:""I'll most likely never be able to fully support Intel GPUs, that's why there's a warning on the store page. I'm sorry, but in this case, there's not much else I can do.""This should be a warning not only to people who only have laptops which is a heavily increasing market, but to those who are concerned about the viability of this product.

												I’ve tried. Seriously. I tried when it was released and I tried after the 1.0 release. I really wanted to like this game and give it a bright review, but I couldn’t.Let’s start with the obvious one. The whole marketing campaign was built upon the (false) fact that the game was done by one people. It gained some attention around the early access release solely because of that fact. When the only good thing that you can quote (or you think worth quoting) from a major member of the game press is, “One Guy Shouldn’t Be Able To Make Meridian: New World”. There is something clearly wrong with your game or your marketing people. Sadly, it turns out it’s the game itself.Sound. For me it was an instant no, I had to turn it off from the menu as soon as I heard a few seconds from it. Highly generic electronic music without a soul. The same thing about the soundtrack (I own the contributor edition), nothing unique there. The sound design itself is bad. All the voices feel mechanical, artificial. I don’t know if it’s because of the voice actors (there are some “celebrities” on the cast, so probably not) or due to some unexperienced sound engineer. Honestly, I don’t care, the result is simply awful. The same is true about the actual in-game sounds, they are like something from a bad sci-fi movie from the 80s. Or something that a cat would produce if put it in front of a midi keyboard.Graphics. The game falls short there to. I don’t expect the same quality visuals as from AAA RTS games like wargame or starcraft 2, but I was expecting at least a minimal amount of good taste from the designer. No, it doesn’t exists. Some effects are overused, no consistent style across the board and the GUI looks like if it’s done by somebody who discovered a few cool tutorials for photoshop. (quick fact, the same problem is there with all the games from the developer, all the UIs are a joke)Gameplay. I could have lived with the other two being bad or amateurish, but not this one. The few missions I’ve played are just simply boring. No tactics involved whatsoever, the whole base / army management is clunky and badly done. No zoom functionality (erm, 2014, guys!) and all the game mechanics clearly shows that the developer has almost no experience with modern (and actually good) RTS games.Writing. The story feels simple, the cut scenes doesn’t support the whole flow of the game, and completely useless (why then?). Dialogues feel forced and unnatural (the bad voice acting makes it even worse), and the game tries to be too much like other games, providing unnecessary story sections, where you can wander around the ship, but it only makes all your choices and answers feel completely weightless. The best example is the first mission. You wander around on the planet for like 2 minutes, then immediately you are switched back to the ship’s view and now you are talking with your crew. The “flow” is too erratic and not enjoyable.Multiplayer. There is no multiplayer. It’s 2014, guys.So, shortly. Don’t buy this game. For it’s normal price you can get entries from way better strategy games (wargame series!). If you have a few bucks to burn, and you want to support an indie dev, then it’s up to you. But as a game product, it falls short badly.If you don’t believe me, just look at the reviews. When the game was released, it had a very positive standing (early access gamers tend to be way softer when it comes to reviews), but as soon as it reached a wider (and more critical) audience it went down to mixed.

												five bucks for this game is a reasonable price. the maps are small and you have a hard time trying to build somewhere. for some reason it's not very fun. the main weapons are lazers. there arent really any other weapons. there's bombers, but they actually just hover above something like a helicopter and drop bombs. this would be a decent game if it was in the 90's			"

Early Access Review
								Ok so here's the thing.The game is good, it's got some pro's and some consPROS: Solid RTS controls, Great texture work, unique story, very little bugs, Achievments, and Workshop, made by a true indie.CONS: The Voiceovers sound cheap, the music sounds out of place and cheaper, the game tries to take itself super seriously, no zoom., super cheasy acting, GoF2 style UI, and it just feels like a bad syfy movie....not Sci-Fi like the good ol days.it may look like the pro's are overwhelmed by the cons, but then you factor into account how this was made by one man with some contributions from his friends. It should also be noted the price tag is definately worthy of it's level. is this a blockbuster uber RTS? no, in fact it's got very little apeal aside from a better looking overused format of RTS.  The game is good, and I do recomend it.final tally 7/10, definately worth a try, but it has words and acting like a bad C movie. all in all though, the UI feels like it's from Galaxy on Fire 2 for Android.

								Rather unsurprisingly, this early access game is not brilliant.Many sound effects are missing, the pathfinding is broken at best, the voice acting and writing are stilted and boring, the graphics are inconsistent and the actiual level and map design is terrible. The music is generic, the characters are boring, the exposition for the story is so rote that you can guess the characters a mile away, and so on.So, no, i reccoment that you wait until it is further along in development or even fully released before dropping $15 on this. There are simply better places to spend money like that.			"

								I hate this with a PASSION... worst wasted money ever. The scrolling seems to move slower then a Mammoth tank, the units and research are way to expensive... a single trooper can cost 120, where in Starcraft 2 for the same exact price you can make 3. In this game you have only one resource which is named poorly, SHARDIUM. No multiplayer, the voice acting is kinda decent, the models are really slow. the voices get annoying, and the campaign is mostly PROTECT THIS AREA FROM INCOMING WAVES.			"

												I didn't play that much of Meridian, and with good reason.The game is a smaller, uglier, less polished version of Starcraft, only instead of fighting interesting alien races and monsters in chilly, dark settings, you're fighting space marines and mechs in some of the most uninspired-looking arenas I've ever seen in a modern strategy game.As an RTS, Meridian ticks all of the boxes, but that's it. It struggles to reach the heights of better RTS games, such as Red Alert 3, Starcraft 2, Dawn of War, or just about any major 3D RTS game that has hit the market over the last ten years. The game has no aspirations, no distinctive qualities.The variety in units and buildings is♥♥♥♥♥♥poor, and the skirmish match customisation options are just laughable, failing to even match up with RTS games released back in the 90's. The sound effects are basic, with guns and cannons emitting ugly 'ping' sounds, instead of something meaty and believable. The progression system and the in-game special abilities are interesting additions to the formula, but the abilities themselves are so slow and inconsequential, you'll have no reason to use any of them during a match save for some of the more powerful ones.Campaign-wise, from what I’ve experienced, you're stuck mainly with defensive objectives. I didn't play beyond the first four missions, so I can't comment much on the storyline, other than the dull voice acting and the lifeless setting of Meridian.The only prop I can offer to this game is the inclusion of a map editor, which is a feature that has been exempt from many recent RTS releases. However, given that you have no real reason to invest much time in Meridian, I doubt anyone will create anything truly spectacular with the editor, since the game's online community seems to have stagnated over the course of development.Meridian is unremarkable, sharing the same basic gameplay elements and graphical palette as Starcraft II, only that it is nowhere near as fun to play. As an RTS, it's okay, but that's all it is. It's just alright. Average. Run-of-the-mill. You could name any well-known RTS game released since 2004, and I can guarantee that it plays, looks, and sounds better than Meridian, not to mention that it's probably retailing for around the same price, too.It’s nice to see a new RTS game on the market, but we need more innovation than this.Meridian: New World gets a 4/10.

The last units unlocks at the end of game.The most annoying parts are the way troupes detect and engage enemy. The troupes engage enemy from a too far distance. Way too far. Sometimes, to attack an enemy, units advance an unnecessary short distance. Not always detect the nearest enemy.The energy to use special abilities refills too slow.Is ok that the game have a demo.The current price of 5 EURO (4.99 EURO, the sick pricing strategy) is more appropriate for the game.

												RTS, otherwise known as Real Time Strategy has become quite rare in today’s day an age. Oh, there are a number of offshoots, but very few modern day RTS that still hold to the core root of the genre. Sadly while Meridian comes close, it still misses what I personally consider a true RTS. First the pros:PRO’s1.	Interesting set of weapons each with their own unique attributes. While fun, they do become redundant when all are unlocked.  2.	Decent enough graphics. Cut-scenes are adequate with a few neat space shots.3.	So-so story, and a few unique missions that are out of the norm. Adding some variety. 4.	Audio is well done.5.	Voice actors actually fit their role and put the appropriate emotion behind their lines. 6.	Turrets and normal structure building expected of a RTS.7.	Missions where you have a locked group of units explore and fight maps. Requiring a certain level of timing and strategy. 8.	Special orders/powers are always fun, and actually influence the game quite a bit. Especially on certain maps. CON’s1.	Units are incredibly limited by the end of the game. Very little variety.  With only 1 species/faction. 2.	Story is so-so by the end, neither impressive nor a failure. Could have used something unique to spice it up. 3.	AI programming can be very annoying. Example, send a unit to fight, but there is not enough room. So the AI sends the units around the entire map if necessary, rather than what most RTS do in pushing units forward so they can all shoot. If there is no route, they pile up waiting for the unit in front to die. 4.	Long excursions, units will chase enemies to their death. Which requires the player’s constant attention in order to avoid pointless losses.5.	Some incredibly irritating missions, where the game locks you in place and forces certain actions without the options of a true RTS. For example, rather than a normal unit cap that only requires a little cache (or whatever the game wants built), Meridian has map locks where special expensive factories must be placed in unique zones that are not available on every map. Otherwise the unit cap is locked to under 10 – 20 units. 6.	Mission completion usually entails exterminating an enemy’s every structure and unit. This can grow irksome when fighting multiple opponents, and a waste of time at the end. Where all you can do is cleanup of the map.While the game has a number of irritations, it also has some positive RTS draws. For the price, it is more than worth a purchase. I can only hope the developers will add some interesting content in the future. I give it 3.2 out of 5 for the overall gameplay, skirmish, and campaign.  "

												Good, but maybe just a little bit standard RTS with a nice looking plot so far. Graphics and music is good too. I'd say it is not innovative but rather solid. 4 out of 5 (where 5 is more like C&C than Starcraft in terms of gameplay)			"

												I liked the concept, It was a fun game until you got to some map where the enemy just keeps overwhelming you. It's not fun when you get a crappy♥♥♥♥♥defence and is tasked with defending a base that is constantly under attack. The defenses dont hold and your heroes all have death wishes, where they leap into battle every time they can. I really really hate maps where you have to be born in Korea to be able to beat. The games options are non-exsistant where the only game speed is TURBO.The pacing in the game is way too fast for my taste, if it was more focused on micro which some maps are it would be a lot better.

												Plus: Good mechanics, research available, great graphics, sound and voices.Minus: Everybody plays as the same faction, with the same units and research.While indeed, this is a decent game, it either decides the matches by who can outnumber his opponents or who is the better tactician. I recommend this game for matches with friends where nobody wants to have a disadvantage opposed to the others.Might destroy friendships, though.			"

												I recommend this game only if you want to have the same feel as the early command and conquer games. It has a great story and the twists are great but i find the campaign a bit too short. Its fun if you want to play base building and maybe twoer defense here and there.			"

												I love this game I have not had as much time as I would like playing it but I bought this as a early access because I really miss the old school type 90's RTS games and this really reminds me of what Starcraft used to be before it got caught up in all the glamor and crap no one really wants.This game is a great addition to the RTS lineup if you like a true RTS game it holds true to the game style while adding in amazing HD style modern graphics. And the price is reasonable for good gameplay well worth supporting future development as the dev has consistently updated and added new features throughout the entire cycle from infancy to now.			"

												Most of the reviews are spot on regarding this being a simplistic RTS but it's still pretty fun and considering it's not backed by a massive publisher it is pretty well done.I haven't played too much yet but the overall design and foundation feel good and lay the foundation for what could be a really amazing game if this just got a little bit more TLC and polish. As it is now it's a fun way to while away the time and enjoy it for what it is. Don't expect anything ground breaking or new and you'll be sorted.One gripe I do have though is that the hardware requirements from a graphics perspective are considerably higher than I would have expected but all things considered it's still a solid effort.

												I'd recommed it if you liked games like starcraft.I don't know much about the old C&C games as I've only played from generals onwards, so I won't compare it to them.This game is reminds me of the first starcraft game, graphics and gameplay wise.I've only played abit, it's nice but having only one factions really limits gameplay. It's abit vague about abilities. I did like the ability to construct the same unit with different types of weapons, like mechs with lasers while another had cannons though.It's good alround.  I'd say 8/10			"

												This game has the worst AI of any RTS i have ever played, it is completely void of anything resempling an ounce of tactics.Your key assets, which are not allowed to die in the final missions seems to have a death wish, automaticaly running head on into the enemy.Dont buy this game, it looks nice enough, but it is extremely poorly programmed!!!

												It's not that it's a bad game, it's just that it's not a good game. Everything about it is meh. Voice acting isn't awful, but it's not good. Writing isn't awful, but it's not good. Same with the graphics, the gameplay, the AIs, the UI, and the story.I'm voting it down because the game is full of annoying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, like really slow move speeds on your ship, patroling units that are out of sync and nearly impossible to pass, and a mission that is next to impossible just out of the blue.

												This is probably the worst game I have in library.If you want to, in any way shape or form, have a conventional RTS experience, this game isn't for you.If you want to have an unconventional, but fun RTS experience, this game isn't for you.If you think that devs should make sensible design decisions, this game isn't for you.I'm not going to drag you through the mechanics of this game, but I'll hightlight what is definitly wrong with this and probably won't be fixed unless they completely rebuild the game:1. Grouping.Your units are placed in a grid and occupy square spaces of the same size for all units. This doesn't have to be a bad thing necessarily, however, if you cannot pass through your own units and paths sometimes only give you two possible squares to move through, it becomes a real pain to maneuver.2. Movement.The movement in this game is abyssmal. Aside from having extreme difficulties to effectively select units, you will also encounter problems with the pathfinding of each unit. Because your own units are impassable, you may find paths in which all movement comes to a halt. If you select an area to move to, the units will get predetermined places to stand on. However, if the units in the front will have the closest squares in that area and the path is narrow enough so that they block the movement for your other units, the other units will just quit moving altogether, which results in a split of all units and not even close to the positioning the game previews. That units will never attack while moving also results in some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat encounters.3. Level designFrom what I've played, there have been multiple missions in the campaign that will result in extremely unfavorable matchups against the AI. This wouldn't be too bad if the base mechanics were reasonably well designed. However, with the current implementation of them, some missions get either near impossible even on easy difficulties or result in very long spans of micro-ing every single unit into the correct position.Verdict:I can't conceive of a single reason anyone would want to play this game. Don't buy this, not even on sale.			"

												It's impressive one man made this game, but I cant recommend you purchase it even on sale :(The campaign in unplayable, obviously there no beta-testing being done:1) In an early mission you are given 3 options - attack the turret control centres, the barracks or the airfields. The truth is unless you choose to attack the turrets first you will fail as you dont have enough troops to destroy the other two options. Reload levl and try again.2) Another early mission suddenly turns into a 25 wave (20 min) basic tower defense game. It relies on you already established base supplying enough creds to buy turrets. however an enemy attack before this sequence crippled mine so it was impossible to get past wave 5.The skirmish game is also under developed:1) In a game on 4 players (1 human, 3 AI) all AI players (easy AI I had chosen) will attack you. the only time they fought each other was outside my base!2) You cant select teams. You and one AI against another 2 AIs. "
