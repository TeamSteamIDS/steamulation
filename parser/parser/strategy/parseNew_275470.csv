												I have already posted a negative review on this game because of the horrible controls. And i have deleted it. Don't really like that updated review will still be somewhere on the bottom of the list. Also i want to do it justice. Developers of this game are super cool for supporting their game long after the release and trying to find a way to please all the gamers. Controls are now WAY better than they were (now it actually selects tiles, not the objects on the tiles and there is a visual cue what object will be selected if you click your mouse button, also they've added more alternate controls options). For such great support only they deserve a Yes.The game itself is a mix of puzzle and speed. I don't really like the speed element, especially when the puzzle element itself can be mind boggling alone, and then you have to do all very fast. But that's just me. And you can still do just puzzles, if you don't want to earn every star (sorry, light bulb) on a level. Artistic style is cartoonish and pleasant. There is also a shop in the game to spend your dollars earned for completing the levels and doing extra bonus things on some levels. You can buy outfits for your characters :) It's a bit silly, but still, you are using those points you are collecting, not just playing for the highscore and if you are a completionist it may be fun to buy all the outfits and complete some achievements along. All in all a little pretty puzzle game with a nice support. But if you don't like the speed element, maybe you should skip it or play just the puzzle parts, though many of them still require to move objects in time.			"

												I've played an hour and a half of Chip so far, and it's great! Don't be fooled by the cutesy graphics though, it gets REALLY HARD the longer you play. Lots of fun and full of character though.If you like puzzles, indie games, and charming characters, I highly recommend this. Well worth the cheap price. :)			"

												Chip is a logic puzzle game that is very much focused on efficiency. Finishing a level isn't in question; instead, you are timed, your moves are counted, and there are some extra collectables in some of the levels.It also another component of customization. There are 3 characters, with several slots for cosmetic items. You buy these with in-game money that you get from completing the levels. It doesn't affect the game at all, it's simply a mechanism to give the player a goal.As I've been trying to do recently, I'll try to break the review into sections, instead of describing the whole game and its problems all at once.Audio-Visual DesignNot much to say in here.  Its interface is a bit iOS-y, with big buttons, and the controls relying only on clicking and dragging. I'll get into the controls later, but the rest works fine for what it is.(1)I liked the cartoon-y style, with bold lines and clean colors. Nice job on that.The music also started out to my liking, but there isn't enough variety, and quickly got repetitive. General StructureThere are 4 worlds, each with its new mechanics. The first 3 worlds have 20 levels each (with additional 5 challenge levels). The last one seemed to have been added after the game's release, featuring only 5 levels.Each level has 3 stars, one for the timed element, one for the number of moves, and one for simply finishing it. Leaderboards are only present for your overall score. Additionally, some levels have a bag of money, or a cosmetic piece for you to collect. You get gold as you progress, and can then spend it on the shop. You can buy headgear, dresses, boots, etc. to use in each character. These are only visible in the starting screen, and in the level. The objective is to get an energy ball to the your character, and the character appears as you've customized.It's more of a distraction than a mechanic, but hey, it's cool that it's there, I'm sure there are people who appreciate those details a lot.General MechanicsYou can always see the whole level in the screen at once. Unfortunately, there's no zooming option, which could solve lots of problems. But more on that later. (2)The level effectively starts when you do your first move. The puzzles consist on shooting an energy ball in a certain direction, and then move objects around to alter the balls trajectory. There are object that reflect the energy ball, portals, magnets, etc. etc. There are many different elements at play, but they're well introduced and don't overwhelm you. Tutorialisation was one of the highlights of this game, for me, but not without its problems.(3)You can rotate and/or move some objects. For example, there's a wall that reflect the energy ball. However, if it's not the right angle, the ball is simply destroyed, or sent in a direction that you didn't want it to. Or, when starting the level, you may want to shoot the ball into a different direction. Rotation and Movement are level dependent.There's no point in explaining details here, just trying to give you an idea.Every object is already placed within the level when you start. It doesn't ask you to construct the level to solve the puzzle. Everything is placed, and you have to play accordingly.It's a bit limiting, but that's due to the game's (valid) design. If you don't like that type of puzzle, you're better off looking elsewhere.Alright, onto the major design problems/highlights.1.ControlsThis is probably the biggest issue with Chip. You click an object to select it, and hold if you want to rotate it, or click another tile to move it. The problem is that the hitboxes are very dodgy. Part of it is due to the isometric perspective, and part of it is due to its size. I've had to restart levels countless times because I wanted to move and ended up selecting another object, or rotated it the wrong way. The alternative controls scheme helps, by moving the camera with RMB. The main has movement AND the camera tied to LMB which aggravates every control problems. It's particularly bad in levels cluttered with objects.Another huge problem with bad controls, is the efficiency in the level design. Since you are always timed, and your moves are counted, it's too easy to screw up, without it being the player's fault.The game is not pausable, although there is a slow-down when you have a object selected. It's not enough. They wanted to make a real-time, reflex based puzzle game, and sort of hammered it in, trying not to compromise that initial vision.A zoom featured could have helped with the hitboxes, I feel. The closer you are, the more precise the movement is, and could lead to fewer screwups.2.Time ElementsThere are two elements of time in Chip. One of them, is the time limit for each level. The other, is how sequencial your actions are. You'll have to move and rotate the same object several times, depending on which sections the ball is, and also have to coordinate every move to achieve each star. This could be great, but there are several reasons why they fall apart.Again, it seems like they wanted to make a game reliant on being fast and efficient, but didn't quite know how to do it properly, hence making those mechanics very artificial.The solutions rely more on reflexes than logic, sometimes. You can often see how to finish the levels, but end up failing because of the controls. Also, creating a time limit makes no sense to me, in such a game. There's usually only one solutions, and the creative side of the game is so low, that having it timed doesn't really help. Besides, it is often impossible to get the moves star and the time star at once. That's right. You'll have to replay the levels to get them separately...I don't think it the real-time element should be present at all, as it doesn't enhance the experience in any way. Plus the clunky controls, it's a nightmare.A simple pause would do this game wonders! Time the levels as you want, but make it count only when things are moving. The slowing down helps, but it doesn't quite reach it, and it's just there to stay ""true"" to the initial design, which doesn't work. If the player paused the game when moving an object, it would certainly feel much better.3.TutorializationThe game isn't awful. Despite having critical problems, it has some very elegant design as well!How it teaches the player is one of those features. It progressively introduces mechanics, one by one, and has a couple of levels that focus on teaching the player. Those are easy, but often lead the player in the right direction to beat the following levels, that are a bit more complex.For the most part of the game, levels didn't overwhelm me, and the solutions were spot-on! Later on, it all crashes, as you need to get each star separately, there are many objects close together, the previous 6-7 moves are now 30, etc.Another detail, is regarding moves and the tutorials/subsequent level design. The moves counter is supposedly optimized. However, in some levels, you can do better (which feels good, of course!) by hitting the ball while the object is moving towards the next position. It's like hitting two birds with one stone. That particular detail is almost tutorialized early on. There was a level that couldn't be beaten with all the stars without this trick. If that is the case, one would expect them to follow with it, and take that into all of the levels' design.  They don't. I realize that this is a very minor gripe, but it's one of those details that stick out, to me. And this mechanic made some levels really satisfying too!Well, I'm out of characters.. I was positively surprised at first! Unfortunately, when the difficulty ramps up, the game falls apart and every problem becomes too evident. I can't recommend it, but it has potential!			"

												Some challenging puzzles with funky graphics and music. All in all good fun... Just. Unfortunately I found the collision detection to be pretty awful. For example to move a block you have to click on it and then on the destination tile. But many times either the first or second click would have no effect for no apparent reason. This severly hampers completing some puzzles in the time limit or indeed at all. I have a slight suspicion however that the problem may not in fact be a collision detection issue but instead be due to clicking having multiple purposes. A plain click is to select objects and their destinations. Holding down the mouse button triggers rotation of objects. It may well be that when I think I am selecting an object, I am in fact holding the mouse button down just a tad too long on a non-rotating object and so nothing happens. Whatever the cause of the problem, it can be very frustrating and for me almost ruins and otherwise charming and fun game. What a shame as I'm sure it would be easy to fix the problem.			"

'Chip' is a game which requires creativity and patience. If you don't have at least one of these, don't consider buying this game but if you do keep on reading...'Chip' is a very nice puzzle game with many levels to complete, levels get harder and items get added in certain levels. You can customize your character and unlock more characters. There is something I don't like about this game tho which is the 'Time' and 'Move' concept. I don't like these because it effects you from unlocking other levels. If you think you like this game, go buy this and save Chip!

												8.7/10 - A Challenging Puzzler Mastering the Art of Organized Chaos!I was extremely impressed with this puzzler, there's so much going on and even more you need to keep your attention on in order to complete the level. The levels get difficult quickly and completing the full 75 will take some serious time and ingenuity! The game revolves around Chip, a red robot that has been imprisoned by his evil nemesis, Rust. You are out of power and the puzzles revolve around manipulating the game board in order to get power to Chip! Can you power up Chip through 75 levels and circumnavigate a plethora of insane obstacles? This one is worth the $7; it's difficult, polished and really fun! It's on sale often though!

												Chip is a puzzle game where you have to guide balls of electricity floating around an isometric grid in order to power up a robot each level. The mechanics are introduced slowly, so by the time you reach the more complex levels it isn't as daunting as being thrown straight into it. There's a shop to get more costumes (no actual money required, just play the game to get lightbulbs as currency), All in all it's a fun little game vaguely reminiscent of Chip's Challenge with cute graphics and good puzzles. The developers also seem to be doing a pretty good job of following up with the community post-release, which is always a plus and encouraging to look at their games in the future.			"

												Chip is an isometric puzzle game where you are guiding an energy ball from its source to destination through the use of mirrors, portals, magnets, and various other contraptions. Mechanically simple, there is a surprising amount of depth and variety to be found within the puzzles.Every level has an additional goal number of moves/time to meet (not necessarily at the same time). Oftentimes these are relatively straightforward, but in some cases they involve meticulous timing in the movement of pieces, which can vary from very satisfying to quite frustrating depending on your preferences.I was able to beat every level (although not every time/move challenge) within roughly 6 hours, so consider that a reasonable ballpark for amount of gameplay available. More level packs are supposed to be incoming, so that will likely grow.The graphics are relatively simple (it feels a bit like a phone game), and there is character customization items you can purchase, but they're all superficial and have no impact on gameplay.Ultimately, Chip is a nice little puzzle game. A little rough around the edges, but there's some good fun and challenge to be found here. In future updates, it could really benefit from the addition of Steam Workshop support to allow for user-submitted levels.			"

												This game might be a bit friendlier on touch screens, but with a mouse, it's harder to be accurate with clicks, and since timing is one of the things that gets you lightbulbs (a measure of completion in this game), that can get a bit annoying.And do note that simply beating all the levels in the first world doesn't get you access to the second world.  You have to get 50 lightbulbs out of the 20 levels provided (and up to five bonus levels, though you'll only have up to three to help boost your first world lightbulb count).  Each level gives you up to three lightbulbs -- one for completing it (so that's 20 for getting through the levels), one for completing it fast enough (another 20), and one for completing it in few enough moves (another 20), and you might have up to 9 more possible from the three bonus levels you'll have access to when you have fewer than 50 lightbulbs).  You don't have to get all three lightbulbs at the same time, thankfully, and there are also one-time treasures that you can retrieve (usually taking more time/moves than you'd otherwise need).  But still, out of 69 possible lightbulbs, you have to get 50 of them just to get to the second world.Thankfully, the first world is relatively easy.  So I found myself with 48 lightbulbs coming out of it, no access to the second world, and had to scrounge a couple more lightbulbs out of one of the extra levels.Granted, I've never been a huge fan of puzzle games.  So take what I'm writing with a grain of salt or something I guess.Edit: Okay, it turns out it wasn't that hard to pick up another four lightbulbs from the first world.  Oh well.  Still, now that I've gotten into the second world, I still feel frustrated and annoyed.  Again, I guess puzzle games just aren't my thing, but certainly having me stay this long by keeping the Steam trading cards drip-dripping like this has only increased my dissatisfaction.(Disclosure: I acquired this game from a promotion offering a free Steam key of this game, at the Indie Gala Store.)

It is a great little puzzle game.I have completed all  the levels except X5 in World 3 (too complicated at first glance, maybe will try solving it some day).This is what I like about this game:1. Simple but various puzzle mechanism2. Progressive gameplay3. Quite challengingThe only thing that I don't quite like is the ""action"" element. Some of the challenges require you to be able to click things really fast. The timing is not so critical that drives you crazy like some action game, but it do require memorization of the whole process and click one by one according to the plan. One click wrong you will need to start again,Time does slow down when you select an object, which makes the action part easier. However, I still think it's better to have a ""pause"" option in game so that we can play the game casually by pure logic rather than memorization.			"

												Chip is basically a puzzle game. Basically you are a robot, who get's 'botnapped' and is stuck in a cell. Now you need to charge yourself up in order to escape. The graphics are 2D, similiar to ""Scribblenauts Unlimited"", and colourfully appealing. Gameplay resolves around solving puzzles (ie charging up the robot) by manipulating barriers, objects, electrical charges and time. There are plenty of levels (each unlocked after completing the previous one), with each one throwing different obstacles in your face. After each level, you earn score based on the number of moves  you made and the time it took you to complete the puzzle. You also earn coins which are used to by customisations for your robot.The music is cheerful and suits puzzle solving fine. If you want a light-hearted puzzle game this is the game for you.			"

												This is a puzzle game, but to me it doesn't succeed as one. The puzzles aren't hard, and the only challenge comes from getting all of the lightbulbs, the worst of which is having to complete the puzzle in a certain time. These time limits are absurdly short and are frustrating to meet when doing the puzzle at a normal and comfortable pace, especially with the bad controls. There also isn't a very good backstory as to why the puzzles have to be solved, but that's fine, as it's a puzzle game, not a story-driven game.			"

												If I played this game on my smartphone, I would love it. But I'm playing on my PC, and this game shouts ""mobile game"" from the first second you start it. Biggest issue I have with Chip is that it often takes more than one click to detect an action, and that can be a problem in a game that requires speed.Do I recommend it? I'm stuck between Yes and No but unfortunately Steam knows only 0 and 1.This is a strictly subjective review. Try it out and see if you like it - on sale it can be bought for under 1€ and you might enjoy it. "

												Controls are finicky, made worse by the fact that the puzzles requires split-second manipulation of objects. Even after having solved the puzzle mentally, it often took 6-10 attempts to actually complete the level because of timing and controls are very unforgiving. I hoped the second set of puzzles that unlocked would have more interesting puzzles, nope, more of the same ridiculously timing-driven object manipulation. It feels less of a puzzle game and more of a finicky 'platformer' having to perfectly jump in or jump out of the path of a moving object.			"

												Chip is an interesting puzzle game. The concept is solid, and the artwork and usability is spot-on, but the only thing that puts me off about it is how abruptly it ends.Don't get me wrong - there are enough levels to justify buying the game. My playtime for this game reflects playing through and completing levels, as well as achievements, if you want to gauge how long you'll probably play this.There is a lot of room for expansion and additions - all the framework is there to build this game up. Unfortunately for the game and the players, the final bonus levels are where the puzzles get very interesting, which would allow for some pretty cool combinations. If it didn't abruptly end. Despite a lack of strong story or narrative (there is a basic story, but it's not an important theme), the game felt like it ended on a cliffhanger.This is one of the few games in my library that deserved more attention from Steam users than it received, and would be a great addition to your library if you like puzzles.

												I have already posted a negative review on this game because of the horrible controls. And i have deleted it. Don't really like that updated review will still be somewhere on the bottom of the list. Also i want to do it justice. Developers of this game are super cool for supporting their game long after the release and trying to find a way to please all the gamers. Controls are now WAY better than they were (now it actually selects tiles, not the objects on the tiles and there is a visual cue what object will be selected if you click your mouse button, also they've added more alternate controls options). For such great support only they deserve a Yes.The game itself is a mix of puzzle and speed. I don't really like the speed element, especially when the puzzle element itself can be mind boggling alone, and then you have to do all very fast. But that's just me. And you can still do just puzzles, if you don't want to earn every star (sorry, light bulb) on a level. Artistic style is cartoonish and pleasant. There is also a shop in the game to spend your dollars earned for completing the levels and doing extra bonus things on some levels. You can buy outfits for your characters :) It's a bit silly, but still, you are using those points you are collecting, not just playing for the highscore and if you are a completionist it may be fun to buy all the outfits and complete some achievements along. All in all a little pretty puzzle game with a nice support. But if you don't like the speed element, maybe you should skip it or play just the puzzle parts, though many of them still require to move objects in time.			"

												A cool puzzle game at first. I liked the fact you could change your character's appearance, althought they could've have added more items to buy. Good thing they had 3 different characters (in case you got bored). Many levels, good puzzling stuff. But in the end I was kinda bored cause it was the same material all over again but with a few new elements. Anyways, its a cool game to pass your time and its only 0,50 price (when I am writing these stuff) so why not get it? Enjoy it fellow people. +Change appearance+3 different characters+Puzzle and many levels-You'll get bored as it repeats itself-Kinda annoying music (in my ears at least)			"

												Fun puzzle game with adorable visuals.At the beginning it's very simple to understand and solve, but with each level, the game adds more gimmicks and complexity to the design, which adds to the challenge, and satisfaction when you'll finally solve it.Should you want even more challenge, each level has time and moves limits, for the full completion (which can get really insane with some end levels.)The only fault I have with this game is that the controls are sometimes unresponsive, which can be really frustrating, especially in the more hectic levels.If you like puzzle games, give this one a try.

												((OLD) issue solved) never been able to play it since i got it because the dimensions of the game go off the screen and i cant fix it because the save changes or whatever button is bellow the screen and there is no setup.exe file or even a pre launch setup option through steam.....(UPDATE) found a fix for my issue and got it to the correct resolution now and was able to play for a bit and get through the first 10 or so levels....its pretty good...but not worth the store price of 6.99...i got it for .69 cents on sale and its good for that price....but i say it should be .99 to 1.99 max since it just seems like a game i could get on my phone for free....thaty being said it is a bit chalenging after the first 10 or so levels but wait till its on sale to buy it....

												Love this game.  Sure it has its cons: the item-mouse interaction is sometimes not responsive (yet always seems to be fine when the timer is active), the screen rez is small with no way to change, and there are no potatoes.  However, the way the devs include various solutions to certain levels is beautiful.  Other games have done this (hitman GO, quell series, etc.) and I LOVE IT whenever they do.  I must mention though that I think Chip's model of multiple solutions is by far the best I have seen.  One of the biggest reasons is the more difficult solutions for levels with multiple solutions are the solutions needed to get the bags of coins and presents.  These are prefeal items that only benefit you anesthesiatically, yet they require a big cognitive load of the gamer.  The irony is ironically ironic.  Buy the damn game FOOS!!!!			"

												A great little puzzle game that demands a fair bit of speed too in case you want to get all the light bulbs for a level. If you stumble upon it in a bundle or on sale its a must-buy if you are into puzzle games!+ Cute graphics+ Nice diversity - you got magnets, batteries etc. :)+ Challenging but not too hard either+ Cards- Why didn't the devs finish world 3? Maybe its coming! This way it feels a bit short.- Cannot seriously think of anything (edit coming mb :) )			"

												A charming puzzle game that forces you to be quick on your toes and think outside the box to use the mechanics in unique ways. It would have been nice to see some truly devious puzzles, seeing as they never get particularly difficult, and it's a shame they never finished releasing the expansion level set, but overall a good play and worth the price. I completed the game including all bonuses and unlockables in about 5 hours.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Puzzle  game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou are able to play the game in fullscreen or windowed mode.All resolution sizes are available.You are only able to toggle the sound and music. No Volume slidebars available.You are able to customize your character the way you want too.About the game.The game is very simple. You click on a cannon to fire an energy ball. This energy ball has to reach the robot in order to complete the level. The energy ball is able to bounce off from walls in order to reach the robot. The ball speed is pretty slow which could give you enough time to think.Each level has 3 light bulbs/Stars. This depends on how many moves you spend, How fast you do and the normal completion. The light bulbs are needed to unlock other levels.You are able to unlock other characters. But it is only for the looks. NO PURPOSES!There are collectables, which i find totally unnecessary and might ruin the game.You can change the looks for your character.There is some kind of story line.Game is very repetitive.Has many levels.Other things.The puzzle is okay. It has to be your kind of taste.-------------------I Give this game a 5/10			"

												Fan of puzzles ? get this one !Don't be fooled by its childish looks, it will require some deep thinking if you want to finish it fully.The difficulty scales pretty well, and some levels require quite a lot of time to be passed completely.Each level has 3 ""stars"", gained by finishing the level, in a limited time & with a limited number of moves. Sometimes, there is also a ""gift"" to collect on the way. And the solution you find for one of these will not be necessarily work for the other (especially, collecting gifts often use a different route than the others).In total, you have 75 levels (a few levels are merely tutorials, though), but you can consider that you have more if you want to finish the game at 100%.All in all, a few hours of fun, with a relaxing soundtrack.To sum up :+ Good scaling difficulty+ Some levels need to be beaten 3 times in a different way to get everything+ Special levels to unlock in each world+ 3 character skins, which can be customized in a funny way- Missclicks are common on the game items, each one forcing to restart the level when trying to complete the game (thanksfully, it's restarting fast)			"

												Some challenging puzzles with funky graphics and music. All in all good fun... Just. Unfortunately I found the collision detection to be pretty awful. For example to move a block you have to click on it and then on the destination tile. But many times either the first or second click would have no effect for no apparent reason. This severly hampers completing some puzzles in the time limit or indeed at all. I have a slight suspicion however that the problem may not in fact be a collision detection issue but instead be due to clicking having multiple purposes. A plain click is to select objects and their destinations. Holding down the mouse button triggers rotation of objects. It may well be that when I think I am selecting an object, I am in fact holding the mouse button down just a tad too long on a non-rotating object and so nothing happens. Whatever the cause of the problem, it can be very frustrating and for me almost ruins and otherwise charming and fun game. What a shame as I'm sure it would be easy to fix the problem.			"

												This is a pretty good puzzlerIf you're into challenging puzzles this is definitely the game for you.The characters look awesome!You can dress them up with the accessories in the shop which you purchase using currency that you win when you solve puzzles and you get a fair ammount so that you can unlock something new every couple games or so.The gameplay is simple. You  just point and click. Move objects around to navigate a ball of energy to hit Chip and wake him up.I've only played a few levels so far and the puzzles are pretty easy in the beggining which allows you to get the hang of how the game works. If you are a prefectionist however it will be pretty challenging beating the clock (beating the clock isnt necessary in order to beat the level). I expect that itll be harder since you will be moving obstacles here and there to prevent the evergy ball from hitting the obstacles as you navigate it across the level to Chip the robot.-------------One thing about this game that kind of pisses me off is that whenever I click on an object its like the game doesnt detect my clicks until the 2nd or 3rd time I click. This leads to misclicks and that leads to not being able to beat the clock.-----------Other than that the game is great for people who love puzzle games. It's fairly cheap and a nice simple game to play and kill some time with if you're bored. "

												Chip is a very good puzzle game that requires you to plan out your strategy on a grid while utilizing reflecting mirrors and other mechanisms like magnets.If you like puzzle games that challenge you to plan your moves carefully, then you will enjoy this game.The aesthetics are good - the artstyle is cute and refreshing. The background is simple, and you can add cosmetics to change your character's appearance (there are also 3 characters to choose from, two of which must be unlocked). The music and sounds are decent, however, within 15 minutes I decided to mute all sounds in favor of my own. The story is very basic, as the focus of the game is more on puzzle solving.The controls are easy to pick up since you will only be using the mouse. One problem, however, is the needlessly large hitboxes when clicking on items - if you don't click right on the middle of an item, you risk clicking a neighboring item that you may not have wanted (can be particularly annoying when you are trying to finish a level under the time limit and accidentally click the wrong item). The learning curve is minimal to moderate - the levels get progressively difficult, and new mechanics are introduced after a number of levels have been cleared. There are also challenge levels that can be quite the brain teaser, but are very rewarding if you can solve them. The tutorial is quick and helpful, and whenever new mechanics are introduced, they are always explained.Gameplay consists of you getting a cannon to shoot an electricity ball at your player character. As the game progresses, you will have to use mirrors (switching the angles) to manipulate the pathway of the electricity ball. There are also things like batteries (which act as barriers) and magnets (which pull/push metal items), adding extra layers of complexity to the game.Each stage has three clear points (lightbulbs) - you get one for clearing the level, one for finishing under a certain time limit, and another for completing the stage with x moves. The game even tells you that some levels require you to play a level again, as sometimes meeting the time completion requires you to use more moves (or vice versa). There are also items in some stages that provide you with extra money or a new item in the store if you can shoot it and send it to your player character.Overall, the game is quite fun and can be a challenge. The puzzles increase in difficulty at a steady pace, and many of the challenge levels require a lot of trial and error to find a solution. If you like this type of puzzle-solving, then you should really enjoy Chip.Recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												       Chip is a cutesy 3-star-per-level puzzle game, but then again what isn’t? It seems like between these mobile-port style puzzle games, 2D retro platformers and RPGMaker shovelware there is not much else releasing regularly on Steam. Chip works just fine, it has some cool twists in mechanics and has a nice amount of difficulty in later levels. However, this sentiment could be copy/pasted for just about any of these puzzle games and it really doesn’t do anything special to stand out from the crowd. If you enjoy these kinds of games, Chip works, but it’s really nothing I would recommend to a friend.			"

												Very fun! At first I didn't really expect much from Chip. It's a standard puzzle game that looks like it belongs on an iPhone or an Android phone, because of its simple design, short levels and simple scoring system that's identical to the system in Bad Piggies, but this is not the case.  Despite what you may think at first, some of the levels in this game can make you stop dead in your tracks to think about your actions throughoutly before you actually do something, because this game has very high demands for both time and the amount of moves you make. And getting the top rating is actually quite important, because unlocking bonus levels and other level packs depends on your ratings throughout the game. You move cannons, magnets and bouncy walls and turn them around to create a clear path from the cannon to the robot, which you can customize. Some of the customizations for the robots make me worried about this game being struck with lawsuit- being given Finn's hat from Adventure Time, the Magatama from Ace Attorney, etc. The graphics I find very cute, even though they look like they were made in Adobe Flash. Overall, I like the game, but the game, but it's a little too expensive- quickly, nag it before the sale ends! :)			"

												Not a terrible puzzle game, but when you get to the faster/harder puzzles it doesn't like to respond quickly and many times it thinks that I'm trying to click and hold when I'm just trying to click on an item to move it. I wouldn't recommend it, but I'm picky. Paid $0.69.			"

												This game is pretty interesting. It has it's own idea on how to play it, it's not like other puzzle games. In chip, you have to solve puzzles but also do it fast and with the less possible moves as possible. I really enjoyed it, but after first chapter it turned out to be incredibly hard. 6/5 would play again.			"

												Chip is a very good puzzle game that requires you to plan out your strategy on a grid while utilizing reflecting mirrors and other mechanisms like magnets.If you like puzzle games that challenge you to plan your moves carefully, then you will enjoy this game.The aesthetics are good - the artstyle is cute and refreshing. The background is simple, and you can add cosmetics to change your character's appearance (there are also 3 characters to choose from, two of which must be unlocked). The music and sounds are decent, however, within 15 minutes I decided to mute all sounds in favor of my own. The story is very basic, as the focus of the game is more on puzzle solving.The controls are easy to pick up since you will only be using the mouse. One problem, however, is the needlessly large hitboxes when clicking on items - if you don't click right on the middle of an item, you risk clicking a neighboring item that you may not have wanted (can be particularly annoying when you are trying to finish a level under the time limit and accidentally click the wrong item). The learning curve is minimal to moderate - the levels get progressively difficult, and new mechanics are introduced after a number of levels have been cleared. There are also challenge levels that can be quite the brain teaser, but are very rewarding if you can solve them. The tutorial is quick and helpful, and whenever new mechanics are introduced, they are always explained.Gameplay consists of you getting a cannon to shoot an electricity ball at your player character. As the game progresses, you will have to use mirrors (switching the angles) to manipulate the pathway of the electricity ball. There are also things like batteries (which act as barriers) and magnets (which pull/push metal items), adding extra layers of complexity to the game.Each stage has three clear points (lightbulbs) - you get one for clearing the level, one for finishing under a certain time limit, and another for completing the stage with x moves. The game even tells you that some levels require you to play a level again, as sometimes meeting the time completion requires you to use more moves (or vice versa). There are also items in some stages that provide you with extra money or a new item in the store if you can shoot it and send it to your player character.Overall, the game is quite fun and can be a challenge. The puzzles increase in difficulty at a steady pace, and many of the challenge levels require a lot of trial and error to find a solution. If you like this type of puzzle-solving, then you should really enjoy Chip.Recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												All in all this is an OK game. I think if the developer had gone w/ a different art style(ie, less cartoony) it would be more visually appealing, but that is merely my opinion. Some of the puzzles are control/time sensitive, which is generally not a good design decision for puzzle games, especially considering that the controls can be a bit finicky. In that same vein I see this game as having a lot of potential for being ported to tablets, except that the control issues would make the game unplayable using a touch screen(I have noticed that trying to operate slowly tends to eliminate many of the problems).The game lacks a windowed fullscreen option, which is somewhat annoying for users with multiple monitors, although hardly critical as the game behaves well in full screen on a dual monitor setup. The game lacks the ability to zoom in and out on the puzzles, which wouldn't be an issue except that at times players need to move the puzzle around in the view because there are regions that are not visible(this is compounded by the above mentioned control issues and time sensitivity of some puzzle solutions).I added CHIP to my wishlist so I could pick it up on sale(it was $2.37 when I bought it), and after playing it I can say that it is decent enough that I'll get my money out of it. For those considering purchasing this game I would recommend waiting until it is on sale(in my opinion it was worth the $2.37, but not the current list price of $6.99).			"

												I have Chip in my library for rather long time but only recently I thought about playing it. I'm not disappointed. I wouldn't call it best puzzle game out there but for sure it's enjoyable, as long as you are fan of puzzle games. Are the controls bad? Nope. Is this game hard? Not really, maybe when you will start to learn new stuff (teleport, magnets etc.) then those mini tutorials are not much friendly to learn about but once you will grasp what it does, you won't have much trouble. Each of puzzle is small and don't really demand from you to spend long time trying to figure out how to deliver delicious electricity. You can also dress up you robot, which is kind of fun. I wouldn't buy Chip at full price, maybe at some -75% promo. If you enjoy puzzle games then hunt it at some sales.			"

												Wow such and awful controls...You have to move objects in the game to solve puzzles and you have to do it in a given timeframe in a given amount of moves if you want to max out the level.But you have to click an object to select it and the objects have very stupid hitboxes.Sometime you can click it in the first try and then sometimes you can't click correctly for the tenth time.If you want to have a good puzzle game without the need of maxing out all the levels then this game is for you.But if you are a perfectionist just stay away from this cos you will rage like hell when you just fail for the hundreth time on a level only because of the broken controls and you just can click that object in time and then you can start the level all over again.If there would be an option between not recommend and recommend i would choose that but since there are no such an option i will chose the not recommend because the broken controls are a more negative to me than positive.

												Horrendous controls stay away. There is also a timer for whatever reason that only compounds the problems by forcing you to click faster so if items are close to each other youre going to screw up a lot and wear out your fingers with the constant clicking of bad controls. Achievement hunters wont be impressed either, there are acheivements that arent explained at all like impress king and no support for this trash			"

												UPDATED on Feb 17, 2015; see below review. Cheers!I was playing the game and having fun, fully prepared to come and claim that those who are having trouble with imprecise controls must need to replace their mouse. And then, I hit level 12. Suddenly there's a problem. I can click on an object but when I try to place it, not only is the hitbox incredibly tiny, but I swear it moves. Now, this alone is fine with me; if a game is fun, I'll play around with placement to get the puzzle aspect correct in order to compensate for poor controls...and make no mistake: Chip is fun. However, throw in a countdown clock and it becomes an exercise in frustration. A clock is fine ONLY in cases of precise controls; this game lacks those controls. For the developers, there's only one choice here: Ditch the clock or fix the mechanics; otherwise, there's no point in the player continuing. Chip has, believe it or not, been bundled 11 different times (as of this writing), sometimes as a free bonus game. And yet, according to Astats, while 293 people have completed the first level, only 114 (39%) have finished the first 20 (introductory) levels. There's a reason for that! Puzzle games should be fun, not rage inducing. A player should never feel as though they are fighting against the interface. This game has charm, thoughtfulness, and personality, but it's being let down by poor controls. That's a shame. As for me, I'm uninstalling. Life is too short, and there are far too many other excellent games to play...free or not.UPDATE: On Dec 23, the developer released an update containing, among other things, "" New selection reticule to show what the user is about to select [and] - Object selection is based on tile again now (due to reticule) and no  [sic]  the objects sprite."" It seemed only fair to give it another chance, since I genuinely enjoyed the actual gameplay, just not the inability to move any certain selected objects. Unfortunately, this has made a new problem pop up: the game simply won't recognize when I click on objects sometimes (level 15 is an example of this; although it did occur earlier, I wasn't quite sure what had happened). You can click all you want, wherever you want, the game simply won't recognize that you're doing so. Resetting the level sometimes works for the first click, and after that the object is dead again.I know I'm in the minority here, but I cannot recommend a puzzle game where the interface is this broken.

												Puzzles are fine, accessory shop is lacking but provides good incentive for bonus objectives, but for a game that requires timing the controls are completely unresponsive. 25% of the time I select an object, then highlight and click the desired tile expecting it to move said object while instead it does nothing but deselect that object. Because of this alone the game is frustrating past the point of being fun.			"

												I like puzzle games and feel like I could have gotten into this one, but the controls are just not fluid enough for a game which requires speed. I will come back to it and review again if they ever improve on that.			"

												Cute little puzzle game. You have to help recharge chip by allowing the energy to reach him utilizing certain objects and avoiding obstacles in the pathway. A tutorial aspect helps guide the player at levels where new objects or obstacles appear. The game gives you a star for each in every level: time of completion, number of moves taken( each level does a countdown from the expected number it should take), and simply for completing the level. Certain levels unlock when you get a targeted number of stars. It may look like a cute/simple puzzle game but the levels get fairly strategic and complicated. I think it’s fun/quirky little game.

												Chip is a puzzle game where you have to transfer a ball of electricity to a robot, redirecting the ball with barriers, magnets and more. The game looks simple at first, but as you play level after level, you get to meet new things and find more ways to transfer the electric ball to the robot.The characters(Robots) can be customized with different accessories which you can unlock by collecting gifts found in some of the levels. Its a nice puzzle game and if you are into these kind of games I recommend you giving it a try.			"

												I can recommend this game to everyone who loves solving puzzles. It's tricky and you need some skills in timing but can be funny and you can enjoy the game without a feeling of ""I'm gonna uninstall it now"". When I was child I've really enjoyed the similar games like this one. I hope the good old ones will be available on steam once too. :) If you think the price is too high, you can add the game to your wishlist and buy it on a lower price when a sale is on. But if you're interested in it after watching videos and checking screenshots you should get it anyway, totally worth it. :)			"

												Slow and clunky, with unresponsive and poorly designed controls and uninspired level design. Maybe if you've run out of good puzzle games, get this.			"

												This puzzle game has a steady introduction of puzzle mechanics that leads to an occasionally frustrating, but overall satisfying puzzle experience. The puzzles on this game are well designed and most have solutions that, while requiring careful planning, are not dependent on hidden game mechanics. The majority of puzzles have at least one solution which doesn't require ninja reflexes, and level unlocks are partially based on cumulative progress, so even if you don't have the eyes of an eagle and the arms of a praying mantis, you should be able to view all the cutscenes. The payouts for level completion are generous, so obtaining a variety of outfits for your character(s) is relatively easy, but there are unlockables that require alternate puzzle solves. Overall the gameplay is enjoyable and should provide solid puzzling on the first pass-through while leaving a fair bit of non-grindy content for a second run (although those seeking 100% acheivements will likely find a few levels that will require a great many consecutive refreshes to memorize and complete the speed, treasure, or special solve).The in-line tutorial has a fair progression introducing new mechanics in the levels that first require them, but as this is a precision speed-clicker, even after you have played for several hours you will almost certainly find yourself clicking a few pixels off of the mark now and again; which in certain puzzles requiring split-bullet-time-timing will cost you a level restart. This problem is exacerbated on certain levels and menu items by the poor UI scaling that occurs at certain resolutions.What I didn't like:As a completionist, the most annoying thing about this game was that on levels that had tutorial pop-ups, they trigger every time you replay the level with no option to disable them. This was especially frustrating on a few levels that had timing elements to the puzzle and would trigger pop-ups in the middle of the solve, requiring players to click to clear the pop-up, then race the cursor across the screen to trigger the next step. A mis-click would necessitate a reset to acheive the speed clear or other condition(and also reset the tutorial pop-ups).At the time of review I have played 8.4 hours.			"
