												Hoo boy.The original A Valley Without Wind struck me as about the quality of a particularly impressive bit of shareware in the late 90s: horribly dated by modern standards and without 1980s retro charm (though maybe that just means it came a decade early), but at the very least technically competent. Animations were smooth (though obviously based on some simple figure rendering program like Poser), the control scheme worked, the story didn't make much sense but a lot of 90s shareware didn't so I could at least poke around with it and be vaguely amused.You will note that I only have 19 minutes on record with A Valley Without Wind 2.I'm going to hold off on explaining why for just a moment. This sequel--if it can really be called that, since the whole AVWW ""broken reality"" thing never made much narrative sense to begin with, and apparently intentionally so--has you running a rebellion against a big bad. Unlike the original AVWW, where you had followers who you would make go away for so many minutes to go gather firewood or whatever while you ran around the infinitely side-scrolling (well, infinitely transitioning, at least) map, this actually has a strategic map for you to tell your followers to go to places and do things and fight baddies. It's a nice touch, adding some level of strategic force movement rather than simply ""Bob has a 57% chance of getting a carrot with a 99% risk of dying because Bob is a loser.""Well, I lie. It would've been a nice touch. If it worked.If anything worked.If AVWW has the quality of decent 90s shareware, AVWW2 has the quality of bad 90s shareware, the kind that I have spent a good decade and a half trying to forget that I grew up on. The characters have gone from smoothly-animated pre-rendered 3D geometry sprites to poorly MS Paint'd cartoons that move as though they're suffing grand mal seizures. In AVWW, everything was made of pre-rendered sprites so it all fit together visually. Random elements in AVWW2 are pre-rendered, some are drawn, others are painted, and they're all mashed together in incoherent tilesets so it's actually extremely distracting. The control system went from a simple but effective ""keyboard to move, mouse to aim"" system in AVWW to a clunky and incoherent keyboard-only system. For a comparative example, let's say you want to shoot your magical ball-o'-death at some critter at an angle: AVWW, point and click. AVWW2, hold the right and up and fire keys at the same time and pray to whatever gods you have that you timed that perfect 45° angle shot just right because 45° angles are all you're going to be doing and also if you don't do the fire button at the right time then you're just going to jerkily leap your character up and into the target in a valiant but utterly stupid attempt to smash the enemy with her face. That's how Archon worked back in the late 80s. It's as though the AVWW2 was coded for a particularly archaic D-pad setup. Everything about it is completely retrograde from the original.It's completely unforgivable, since these people were able to make something competent, if not particularly impressive before. However, it's also unimaginably hilarious. It is so bad you just have to stop and laugh at everything.And then just stop, since there's absolutely no point to go on any further with it.There's certainly no point in actually spending money on the experience.

												There's some interesting ideas here, and it's a multiplayer game in the strictest sense of the word, but at the end of the day when you cross genres you want to blend them rather than keep them in their own awkward boxes.  This game has an art style that will be off-putting to many, but I found it charming in an odd way.  The different powers are interesting, but could be a little more imaginative and balance between them is basically non-existant.  For the most part, the powers don't make good use of the movement- and neither do the randomly generated maps that generally end up being narrow tunnels to fall down and strange ceilings.  The boss fights are slightly better by being a little more open, but overall it's very static and repetitive.The game has a metric ton of good ideas, but the implementation and integration is so poor that everything steps on each other's toes.  In addition the game uses strange terminology and despite explaning itself is still pretty difficult to puzzle out.  Figuring it out is kind of fun, but once you unlock the puzzle you realize that it's a lot simpler than it lets on in a bad way and it's more about getting lucky early on with a co-operative starting area than anything else.  Speaking of Co-op, it is barely functional and requires a great deal of patience.  Still, it's nice to have the option to be able to suffer together.To it's credit, I can't say I didn't have any fun, but bad platforming, dissonant storyline, confusing mechanics and characters and luck-based play (a decent beginning can trivialize the hardest difficulty but a bad one makes all but the easiest one impossible) as well as terrible implementation of platforming means I'm not going to be missing it.

												A Valley Without Wind 2 is nothing like A Valley Without Wind 1. So many of the things that made me eventually love Valley 1 — it takes a while to wrap your head around that game, and you might give up before you realize you love it — are missing in this overhaul, which has just been released as a separate executable available for free to owners of Valley 1. Valley 2 has no crafting, no collectibles, no inventory, no spell customization, no fancy traversal gimmicks, no dungeon exploration, no grinding. It is basically missing 90% of the gameplay that dragged me into Valley 1. The sorts of moments I detailed here are entirely gone. Even the music is different. The original game’s 8-bit retro ditty has been replaced with a Japanese pop song, but in English.  So what Valley 1 fan is going to want anything to do with Valley 2?A Valley Without Wind 2 is a streamlined side-scrolling action platformer embedded in a turn-based territory control boardgame about trying to contain a rampaging demon and mostly failing. There. That’s the basic pitch. The action platformer bits are mostly about moving to the far side of the level. Your goal isn’t necessarily to kill the various hopping, crawling, flying monsters; it’s to stay alive while getting past them. As you play the action platformer level for any given tile, you spread your control of the map. Map control lets you earn more resources by moving pieces around the board representing your band of resistance fighters. They gather resources, knock down obstacles, take on minor monsters, and power special superbuildings.But Valley 2 has a brutal clock mechanism that crawls out of the center of the map. Imagine an invulnerable — or is she? — demon running around the board, trashing your buildings, casting total♥♥♥♥♥♥spells that render swathes of territory uninhabitable, murdering your dudes, and scattering the survivors like terrified sheep. You have to stop this demon by getting super powerful, which is going to take about as long as a JRPG, give or take ten hours. Until then, the demon is going to mess stuff up and you can do precious little about it. Some power fantasy.Like Valley 1, Valley 2 can be awkward on the overworld. Arcen Games comes up with brilliant ideas that often stretch beyond their interfaces. Despite the basic boardgame mechanics, there is almost no boardgame elegance here. But the basics of exploring the world and keeping your survivors alive are a fantastic hook, and I can’t think of many games that offer this basic experience. This is no city builder. This isn’t about reconstruction. This is a survival horror strategy game about refugees trying to survive a cataclysm in progress, a cataclysm that chases them around the map and often drives them into fatal corners or flushes them down economic death spirals. Choose your difficulty level wisely.The actual sidescrolling action is superlative, perfectly suited to a gamepad controller and featuring more colorful and elaborate artwork since Valley 1. I thought Valley 1 was weirdly gorgeous as it was, but Valley 2’s graphics overhaul makes it more conventionally gorgeous. The more significant change is Valley 2’s new sense of focus in place of Valley 1’s wide-open spell choice and customization. Now you must choose a pre-set class. Each class has four attacks, varied by power, range, how they’re aimed, whether they use ammo, and so forth. Attacks also vary by “caliber”, which determines which attacks punch through which other attacks. If you really want to finesse the gameplay, caliber is an important consideration for playing defensively. You’ll want to build up a concentration bonus by not taking damage, so driving back enemy attacks with a higher caliber is an important part of avoiding damage, particularly in the confines of underground areas.The classes are imaginative and no one names a character class like Arcen Games. Who needs paladins and barbarians when you have featherologists, ashists, lumbermancers, and entropicists? But there are so many that I’ll never use most of them, even though they’re randomly doled out five at a time as you progress through a game. I wish Arcen had focused on fewer classes, and therefore made each one more important. As it is now, once you go up a few tiers, it’s like a racing game where you have a garage full of cars but no reason to use any beyond your two or three favorites. But those two or three favorites sure are sweet. Why would I ever not use my sleetlock with his freeze flamethrower and fancy magnetic ice?Valley 2 is a long game with some pleasant surprises waiting on the map and even in the narrative. Unfortunately, for a game that seems so perfect for replaying, there’s no persistence. When you win or lose, you simply win or lose. As it is now, Valley 2 is like playing through a long RPG with randomized elements that you can play again if you want. Which would be fine if it wasn’t the strategy game that it is.It’s a minor miracle that Arcen Games could revise Valley Without Wind 1 so completely without simply upgrading it, that they have instead made a completely separate game that plays so differently and creates a unique type of experience based on getting your♥♥♥♥♥kicked.

												Listen.  I love this game.  It's one of a kind.  If you like metroidvania type games you should definitely check it out especially when it's only 2.99 right now on sale.  What makes it so unique compared to other games of the kind is that every level is a tile on the turn based strategy game portion, and what level you will want to do is going to be decided by what you need to be happening strategically.  What makes the game such a fun challenge is that each tile has a difficulty percentage that can vary widely depending on different factors including what is happening in the strategy portion.  So, you might really need to open up a section of a map that's blocked by a tile with %500 difficulty level, but have fun with those crazy fast enemies and projectiles that knock off a third of your health, but hey, you gotta do what you gotta do.  Or, what if you can't make it through?  Time to rethink your strategy,  work on earning enough coins to hire mercenaries to open it up for you, tweak your character to go for speed over health, or or whatever else you can think of.  The world has it's own rules and mysteries and a lot of the fun is these things slowly becoming apparent to you as you play.What I love about the game is all the variety in the side scrolling action and it's effect in making your strategy come together to win the game.  I think personally this game is tied with Red Faction Guerilla for most underrated, but this probably even more for all the hate it gets from people that can't look past its subpar graphics to see the amazing gameplay and feeling of being in a coherent world with its own inherent logic all coming together in a challenging and satisfying experience.  Just like other Arcen games there are lots of difficulty settings, I suggest you crank it up a bit.			"

												This version basically uses the same base principles as the first part. But here they totally removed some aspects of game (like never worked outpost management), weakened other (like platforming), and strenghten third (strategy mostly). Resulting game is much more interesting than amorphous A Valley Without Wind 1, but still too similar to it for my tastes. Can be quite enjoyable, if you like neverending stream of upgrades, random respawning monsters and action missions in platforming environment - wrapped up in turn-based strategy about gaining resourses against invincible foe.7/10			"

												A Valley Without Wind 2 changes the formula from the first quite a bit but lost some of the core aspects that gave the first any real interesting game play. There are no longer deep (or tall) dungeons to delve into; the grand exploration is now a linear progression of going to the right. There is a small amount of tactical strategy in the world map now that was neat except with it came with a very unwanted time pressure. AVWW2 suffers from the same repetition of the first but without the depth of exploration, variety of spells or customization of equipment. I actually recommend you NOT buy this one.1/5			"

												Fabulously bizarre and fantastically original game.  It's not that the individual elements have never been used before, it's that they've never been combined in quite this way.  This game makes no attempt at anything vaguely resembling physics, so if you're a stickler for that stuff skip this game.  But the gameplay is challenging and absolutely consistent, and the dream-like demon-apocalypse setting combined with the odd but memorable soundtrack, makes for a lot of fun for people looking for something different.

												Question the graphical choices all you want.  This game is the ActRaiser successor I never realized I wanted until I played.  It's a strategy board game tightly integrated with run and gun action.  The regular threats to my units and structures provided by Demonaica and summoned monsters along the way kept me alert.  You need those units and those units need at least some of those structures.  While I won on the default settings, know that this is a game that allows you to lose after hours and hours of investment.The duration might be the only real gripe I have.  I could be biased by my analysis paralysis and the time it took to learn my first game.  However, the promise of another procedurally generated map to conquer loses some of its charm for me when it takes double digit hours to finish.  I realize that's probably not uncommon for the strategy genre, but I have to too many games in my Steam library to bother.As a bonus, the game also comes with the prequel.  Some may enjoy the more freeform exploration, but the branching pathways contain a lot of empty, useless space.  It's big for the sake of being big.  I much prefer the sequel's selection of more linear playfields.  The prequel also allows players to gather much more loot and micromanage their inventory.  Though I may whine when my equipment breaks, I much prefer the sequel's limit of a single, temporary piece of loot that disappears when replaced.  With the collection of perks, feats and mage classes tied so closely to one's progress, there's enough to gather and worry about as it is.  In short, the sequel cuts out a lot of the cruft and is a better game for it.Finally, forum complaints can largely be ignored.  Mouse control has been added.  It allegedly makes the game too easy at the moment so I'd suggest gamepad or keyboard controls for now.  Either way, it shows that Arcen listens.  I'd personally also like to see more animation detail and a final sendoff when the game ends.  However, it's worth playing as it is.			"

												A post-apocalyptic steampunk fantasy sci-fi turn-based strategy RPG platformer. With landsharks.Weird mash-up of different genres. Plays really well, both in the world map's strategy mode and in the platformer mode you go into when exploring tiles of the map. The art style and graphics are... interesting, but very low quality. The objective of the game is simply to survive in the Valley, until you're strong enough to beat the evil boss, Demonaica. Survival is pretty damn hard at times, as Demonaica's stronghold regularly spawns nasty creatures to try and kill your survivor buddies. On the world map, you get to move around survivors you've rescued, construct buildings that increase resource generation on specific tiles, heal nearby survivors, etc. The interesting bit is that because the game spawns monsters regularly, you need to keep your survivors mobile, while still balancing the resource generation with losses taken in battle.The platformer sections remind me of Terraria's combat system: you run and jump around in randomly generated levels while monsters try to eat your face. Every class has 4 spells, usually one long-range spell, two short-range spell and a unique, extremely powerful special spell. The objective in the platformer sections is to find wind generators and destroy them, allowing your survivors to move to the tiles you've 'purified'. Certain tiles also have perk tokens and other things for customizing your character, usually found in dangerous caves. There's some weird time travel stuff going on in the platformer sections, as different tiles represent different time periods: you can explore the ruins of a modern city, with skyscrapers and stuff, and next turn find yourself in a steampunk city, or perhaps the ruins of an ancient, Egyptian style civilization. The level art is quite diverse, but as I said, the assets are pretty damn low quality.Fun game, and very much worth the low price if you'd like to try a platformer with a strategy game element. AVWW2 does both damn well.Demo available here: http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/valley2-downloads Allows you to play 'till turn 20, or level 3, but other than that, has all the features of the full game.

												It seems like a lot of effort went into it, but it's got a lot of things that just make it not very fun. There's platforming and a strategic map section, and while the platforming is okay, the strategic map has you under constant pressure to deal with threats and keep a bunch of numbers up and it's not always clear what's going on. For someone who likes quick, engaging platformers, the strategy elemtn will probably just be stressful and overwhelming, as it was for me. If you like strategy games, you'll probably think the platforming is unpleasant. The eight way aiming makes it hard to feel like you have a satisfying level of control over your character and leads to combat that is more frustrating than it is pleasantly challenging.			"

												I actually enjoyed the first AVWW.I was abysmally terrible at it, but I enjoyed it.This game seemed like an enormous departure from the first game to the point where it's hard to believe they're sequels.The old one focused on evasive hit-and-run mouse-aimed projectile based combat with lots and lots of variations and possibilites for what kind of projectile you can use. As a side goal, there was a settlement you could build up and add things to.This game disables mouse aiming by default, restricts the evasion and projectile variety greatly, and send the construction/City Sim aspect into a larger role.Graphically, it looks somewhat better, but there's so much different.

												Very similar yet very different than its predecessor, AVWW2 is a unique and fun game. The platforming and weapon/equipment systems from the first game have been streamlined and polished up, but the overworld has been transformed into a sort of turn-based strategy game. The mix between these two modes keeps it moving along throughout each ""world"". It's a little hard to fully grasp all the concepts at first, but once you get a feel for it, it all falls into place. There was a lot of initial forum hate upon release, which was pretty unfounded IMO, but quickly addressed by the awesome developers, understandably begrudgingly.			"

												I cannot reccomend this game on the basis that it is inferior to AVWW 1.The original was a bizarre platforming shooter with copious resource gathering/crafting/upgrading. In a terrible design descision most of these elements have been stripped out (stream-lined?), and a greater emphasis has been put on the narrative and strategy elements, which were the least interesting aspects in the original.I have honestly tried to enjoy this game in it's own right, but cannot find much fun in it. Aside from the slight improvements in graphics, this is perhaps one of the worst steps backwards I have seen from a sequel. However, the original remains a classic and has a great deal of replayability... go buy it instead.			"

They literally coupldn't develope a computer game meant to use a mouse. They threw out Valley 1's controls and replaced it with a painfully floating/fuzzy unresponive slow mess. Some enemies are invulnerable unless you get within melee range despite both your main attacks being ranged. Just really lazy design choices meant to artificially create difficulty where they couldn't make the game properly.The ""strategy"" is just a keep-you-head-above-water gind to win before you lose.

A Paladin's Review: A Valley Without Wind 2. Less Open World But With A Better Focus On Strategy and Sidescrolling CombatGenre: 2D Action Platformer and Turn Based Strategy Game. Developed and Published by: Arcen GamesPlatform: Windows, Mac OSX and Linux. Business Model: Dual-PackFree Press Copy Was Supplied Read the Full Blog Review[kingisaaclinksr.com]What Is This Game?AVWW2 is a blending of strategy and platforming genres into one 2D game experience. The gameplay alternates between two different modes: turn-based strategy and side-scrolling platforming action. Your basic goal is to ensure that your Resistance survives long enough for you to gain enough power to defeat Demonaica. In order to do so, you'll need to level up in power, acquire higher level mage classes, find feats that give you special abilities and customize your character with perks. There are different mage classes which change the type of spells you can use. Everything from water to decay-based abilities. Feats allow you to gain special abilities necessary to progress through the game. Perks are items that let you fine-tune your character.Overall Gameplay ThoughtsA Valley Without Wind 2 is a well polished sequel that takes some of the ideas of the previous game and polishes them up. The combat is more engaging with its variety of spells, different classes and different monsters. It's not the same game AVWW1 was and that's for better or for worse depending on your point of view. It's not the same open-world game like its predecessor. Instead, it focuses on a direct evil threat that you get to know throughout the course of the game. The linear nature of the side-scrolling areas and the combat do eventually become more frustrating later on as the challenge really starts to spike at the end to the point of unfairness. Sidescroller Combat MusingsThe combat is definitely more engaging and rewarding than the original game. You only have four spells you can use and I think they worked. You have a fast primary attack, a slower but stronger secondary attack, a special attack which varies depending on your class and ammo spells which are more powerful spells that you can only use in limited amounts. For the most part, the spells felt balanced to their own strengths although some were a little too situational for my tastes. The combat system is about you finding the ideal place to throw your spells while dodging the spells being thrown at you. Taken as a whole, the side-scrolling element is nicely designed. I had a lot of fun with it until the mid-late to late end of the main campaign.That's when I begin to notice a few problems with the combat. I was starting to die a lot more. Sure, the combat should be more challenging towards the later end of the game, but it felt like a constant battle of attrition. I would simply run out of health before I could get to the end of the level from all the little cuts of damage I would take. It got too frustrating at times. The floaty nature of the jumping and the large hitbox of your character feels at odd with the bullet-hell and precision that the game demands. You have so many spells being cast at you and traps to avoid that it's nearly impossible to avoid taking a lot of damage in the course of the level. Taking on the tougher monsters becomes a bad idea as you'll likely take a ton of damage for very little reward. Your better off just avoiding them altogether. Combine that with the difficulty of regenerating health and you can end up dying a lot. The Strategy GameplayThis was definitely the highlight of the game for me. The strategy element of the game is fairly simple and straightforward, once you figure it out. As I’ve mentioned before, the main goal is to keep the members of the Resistance alive long enough for your mage to grow strong enough to overthrow Demonaica. You have to salvage food and scrap, constantly recruit new members, destroy obstacles and capture/construct new buildings. Moving your resistance members around, planning out how to tackle new areas of the map all while dodging Demonaica and his forces really worked well and I had a blast with it. PC Settings and ControlsAVWW2 comes with all of the PC settings you'll want/need and I can't think of anything missing. It's built on the same engine that all Arcen Games have been. You can adjust the resolution, rebind all the keys and a lot of other settings you might find interesting. It also supports modding via texture packs which you can find in Arcen's forums. As for the controls, well, that's a bit complicated. AVWW2's design was focused for controller and keyboard only. While it does allow for mouse aiming in the game, I don't recommend using it. It was put in after the game was released due to a lot of complaints made about the lack of mouse control. I personally don't agree with their decision to put it in the game but I can understand why since they did. Keyboard works but it's not as enjoyable to use as the controller. Final ThoughtsA Valley Without Wind 2 is a different kind of platforming/strategy experience. Unlike it's open-world predecessor with city-building & light strategy elements, AVWW2 is a more laser focused, linear side-scrolling/strategy game. It does remove a lot of the open-world aspects that the original had. However, I think it works out for the better. You should treat both AVWW1 & AVWW2 as unique games sharing the same universe.

												- Eye-bleedingly bad art direction where everything looks like 2D paper cutouts, and only right and 45 degree angle platforms exist- Atrocious ""level design"" (non-existent would be a better word for it)- Uninspired platforming gameplay- Technicolor text strewn everywhere- Achievements popping up every few seconds, mostly for things that can't be properly labeled achievements (by the 3 hour mark, I had unlocked nearly half of the game's 200 achievements)- Hodge-podge of random ideas that doesn't come together into a cohesive wholeOk, the positives:+ Quite relaxing (albeit somewhat melancholy) soundtrack that may be the overall highpoint of the game, in terms of quality+ Overworld design has better overall art direction than the platforming segments+  Interesting dystopic story and environment (unfortunately the writing quality is a bit lacking)			"

												-Funny little game, something different for a change-Like AVWW1 people either like this one or hate it. Unlike the first part this game is more focused and a match plays faster. You don't have to delve in randomized dungeons for hours to get achievements or unlockables although there might be persons who did just that. Also the graphical style is similar but not that awful, improved you might say. I was worried reading about the setting and how that might translate into gameplay but it's working nicely. You play on a strategic board against an immortal enemy and his minions. Your units run around turnbased and grab ressources or build tile improvements while the enemy hunts them down. Parallely you dispatch your PC into worthwhile areas to play jump and shoot. If you liked AVWW1 or enjoy jump'n'shoots along with light strategy give this game a try - if you hated AVWW1 then you don't like this one either I guess.			"

												I usually take the time to play a game for at least a few hours before I decide I know enough to justify a recommendation. This time a little over a single hour was enough time for me.This game is a platformer / strategy hybrid, which kind of reminds me of an old SNES game called ""Act Raiser"". Much like in Act Raiser, in ""A Valley Without Wind 2"" you split your game time between the strategic ""map view"" interface, where you have to think, plan and prioritize, and the platforming/action based ""area purification"" phase. The game offers a variety of characters to choose from. I still haven't wrapped my head around the mechanics and differences between those characters, their classes or whatever it's based on, but it does look promising when considering replayability value, as it looks like it could be interesting to try the game again using a different type of character.I'll update and post comments as I accumulate more game time, as long as I learn anything worth adding, but so far, the game does look like it's going to drain quite a lot of my spare time. :D			"

												AVWW2 is a turn based post-apocolytpic land/resource management game wrapping a 2d Platformer. You move troops around the map to farm, build buildings, etc. to fight the evil head honcho who can show up and wreak havoc. Monsters spawn every so many turns.There's a number of little nuanced details about the turn-based aspect which feels like much ado about nothing. The game, like its predecessor, beats you over the head with tutorial text for the management aspects of the game (although the platforming aspect does seem to carry a little less of the complexity baggage from the first game).The platforming here is pretty uninspired. Moving feels sluggish; I was amazed that holding down shift actually slowed down my already slow character who can jump 4 stories high.The game warns you about using mouse+keyboard (and actively makes it a chore to set what should be default) due to it being ""overpowered for the game design"". Okay, so fix your game design. Playing a platformer with 2 hands on the keyboard feels like junk. Trying to play this game with a controller only feels like junk. Trying to do a hybrid of those 2 feels like junk.The music here is much better than the first, but that's not saying much. The graphics still feel lackluster for 2013. A SNES-era retro look would probably serve the game better than what it has which carries an air of mediocrity.Unfortunately, the whole thing feels uninspired and boring in the most insipid way possible. Technically, it possesses the aspects and features a game should have, but so many things are either poorly implemented or not implemented in a way that makes them synergistic or relevant. On the scale of quality, this game lies in that precarious spot where many things sound good on paper, but it all fails to add up to something engaging. It's like the developer had a checklist of features that they think every game should have, and they checked them all off as development progressed, but they failed to take a cohesive look at the sub par results. The game takes no risk with unique gameplay aspects. I suspect the developers felt that the genre-blending would be that unique offering, but it feels like 2 poorly developed games smashed together.4/10. There are far better turn-based strategy games and far better platform shooters. This game is neither a jack nor a master of either trade. Save your money for something with far more polish and presentation.			"

												Having just slaughtered the prequel of this series, I tried giving this one a little more time to impress me.It didn't.It does have full controller support, which is nice, but that's about the best I can say about it. Because the game still tries to do EVERYTHING in one go, and fails at so many of those that it becomes a horrible slog like its predecessor. All those ideas that went into it could have been neat on their own, and quite frankly split into maybe 3-4 different games, instead of being mashed together into one.It's like a chef mixing many great small courses into one heap of a meal, which I'm sure is SUPPOSED to be super. But the truth is it turns out to be a desperate pile of gruesomely mixed steak with fish with marmite with foie-gras with 10 salad dressings with sweet dessert with wine, beer, milk, and orange juice on top of it. It's everything in one meal and the chef wonders why the guests aren't happy with it.It saddens me, because I'm sure the developer's attitude is in the right place, but they seriously need to learn restraint - cut back on at least 75% of the ideas, stick with the rest, and then pretty please with sugar on top, POLISH that stuff until it shines. Because it could.You see, genres are there for a reason - it's why The Lord of the Rings doesn't have FBI agents or astronauts in it. It's why Street Fighter 2 doesn't have City Builder and RPG elements in it. It's because it would make those pure genres indigestable if watered out too much with everything else you could think of to put into them.For now, I wouldn't recommend this, even in a bundle.			"

												You know what? This game is damn horrible. Don't play it. Just don't. They hired an art studio which makes the game look better, until one of the animations is triggered; then it makes you wish to cry and pluck your eyes out. There are not enough frames to the misaligned animations, especially in comparison to A Valley Without Wind I, which I highly recommend. In addition, they destroyed the combat system by making your magic become the choice of which colour kills your enemy, and also by implementing this silly caliber system. Next is the fact that you come back to life in your archenemy's palace, yet he doesn't really do much to stop you.Hmm... what else is horrible about this game? That damn font. Don't need to say anything else on it. The loot system is also weird, because as soon as you find an item you actually want to use... it breaks. Then you get an achievement for every single tiny thing you do, which is just EXTREMELY annoying. You enter a certain kind of zone for the first time and you get an achievement! Then for each bloody type of equipment you pick up you get an achievement. It is like Arcen are trying to get the players to keep playing by making them feel like they are achieving something through their boredom and eye-plucking. Speaking of eye-plucking, you have to use the standard OS cursor, which just looks really annoying if you try playing with a mouse. That, combined with the fact that its predecessor had a perfectly fine mouse cursor that they could have just pasted right into this game, annoys me.I would highly recommend the intro song though. It is a good intro song.Buy this game, because you unfortunately have to to get its predecessor, which has a better combat system, better graphics, more to do, a better world exploration system and a lot more variance.

												When I heard about this game, I was quite interested. A metroidvania, except with magic and its randomly generated? Sounded like a good idea, but in the end, when I actually tried it out... its a game with clunky controls combined with what seems to be very low budget everything... controls and the combat, combined with the exploration, are what make a metroidvania, and I just could not deal with such clunky controls, so I decided to drop it.Unless you are really starved for metroidvanias, I would steer clear of this game in my opinion.

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Platform game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThe Main menu music is the best of all. Even better than the game itself!You are able to play with the controller.You are able to change the controls on the keyboard/controller.There are many resolution sizes.You can play in fullscreen or windowed mode.There is a music volume slidebar available.There is a sound volume slidebar available.There is an ambience sound volume slidebar available.There are many difficulty settings and there are 2 different difficulty settings Combat and strategic.Able to skip the tutorial.About the game.You start off in a blank white area. Where you are going to select a  ""hero"". There is hearts, attack power and ammo. Ammo is needed to call your ""Super power"". Once you have selected a hero you can give it a name. Once you have spawned on the castle, You can change and choose your perks here. You can also choose a different Element attribute. Try them all out before you go on. I would recommend FAST (DPS) spells, so you can steamroll through the levels. Once you are on the strategic world map. You will see a few things that might be confusing. You will see yellow characters, these are your people. Each turn they will gather resources or capture new units. You can only place them on the light tiles.  There is also a danger level, If there is no protection and nearby dark area's the danger level will be higher then in other area's. You can move your units on top of the light tiles and they will perform action in the next turn. You can do all light tiles without doing a turn. Starting on a flicker tile and reaching the end on the level will end your turn.. If you have died, your troops will get weaker and will perform less damage against enemies. (This also counts for multiplayer). Most of the time you will just ignore all of the monsters anyway in the levels, but you could find some loot to make it easier.Confusing game at start.It takes time to actually start liking the game or to understand it.Music is decent.Graphics are a bit meh, but you shouldn't pay attention to it all too much.Multiplayer is IP BASED. Servers are dead So YOU HAVE TO HOST!Other things.i have played Valley without wind 1 and 2. But this one is soo much better. I have seriously no clue what i am doing in valley without wind 1.-------------------I Give this game a 7/10			"

												Well, that's enough for me at 22 minutes in.I *just* started playing the original and have already put in 10 hours.  It's not perfect, but it's *fun* and even exploring the game world and it's mechanics.For the sequel, it seems the devs wanted to change everything for the sake of change and experimentation.  And it is decidedly much less enjoyable.  Perhaps if I hadn't played the original at all, but no... this game is too much of a mess.It appears to want to be a more straight up platformer and has a control scheme to match, encouraging you to use a gamepad over KB and mouse as in the original.  In doing so, I can't help but feel that most of the gameplay and mechanics that made the original fun have been removed or extremely stripped down.For example, via spells and enchants, there was a significant amount of character customization you could do in the original.  Granted, I've had only a brief look, but being able to use only one item at a time in the sequel really limits things.I'm guessing here, but I think that the devs, or perhaps too many players, found the original *too* complex and daunting and that explains the more limited gameplay.  Personally, I much prefer the complexity.  Yes, even the unusual ""graph"" based dungeon map that they needed to take a couple of help pages to explain.  It worked, and it was a good idea on their part.So, skip this game unless you find it on a really steep sale price.  The original is worth your time regardless of sale price.  It's looks dated, but it runs great even on old machines, and is a lot more fun. "

												A platforming game with a lot of depth. This has a strategic side in addition to the platforming levels.You can pick from tons of mage classes (each with 4 different spells - basically loadouts) with great names - like Lumbermancers who can cast a spell to throw a log at enemies. With procedurally generated levels. Over 100 enemies. A strategic side that can be as easy or hard as you want. Tons of spell variety. And devs that are great about fixing/patching things in. It can be easy to sink a lot of time into this game!You also get the first one free when you get this - though I really suggest going straight to AVWW2 which has much more focused gameplay than the first.

I still haven't wrapped my head around the mechanics and differences between those characters, their classes or whatever it's based on, but it does look promising when considering re-playability value, as it looks like it could be interesting to try the game again using a different type of character. Also on the re-playability subject, you can choose different difficulty levels for the two different aspects of the game one for the action parts and another for the strategy part. This way, everyone can choose his or her favorite level of challenge for each part. Personally, I'm more into strategy, so I'm more likely to choose a higher strategy difficulty level, to make the game more challenging in that aspect, while I might leave the action difficulty level as it is, although at least during the first few hours of the game, the action is pretty easy and relaxed on the default difficulty level.

												A Valley Without Wind 2 is an attempt to refine the basic ideas presented by the first game and like its prequel it's a mixed success. Where as the original was a procedurally generated metroidvania with little strategy and plot, this games has a lot more of the latter two and is lacking in the first. If you've played the first one, you'll immediately notice the improvements in the overworld strategic parts. You control several soldiers that you must keep alive while running away from monsters and an undefeatable demonic overlord. The strategy part of this, is actually very well done, and the map is littered with special structures that you can task to produce resources or other special effects.  The plot is impressively coherent for a procedurally generated game, and actually rather interesting. My main complaints with the game, lie in the fact that I'd argue that the platforming is a step down from the original. It no longer has the fluid speed of the first game, which makes it far less enjoyable to play. The controls have also been changed to make the combat more keyboard centric and calculated with certain moves blocking certain enemy attacks. Frankly, I didn't enjoy it as much. I believe the could have found a better balance between the rapid fire spamming from the first and this messy system in the second. There are more RPG elements added on in this game than it's prequel, but unfortunately their implementation is lack luster as well. Most equipable items have a limited amount of uses and generally only last for one map. Other than perks, and new classes, there's really nothing else to unlock, so content feels a little scarce. Over all it's a better designed game than it's prequel, with a stronger sense of progression and better story, but I found the gameplay a lot less enjoyable and at times hard to slog through.			"

												This game tries to innovate on its predecessor, but fails in almost every regard.  The most aggrevating of these failures is the pandering to gamepad and console players.  The mouse aim has been removed from the game because it gave mice users an unfair advantage.  In a single player game.  Seriously, if it isn't AI Wars, stay away from everything else this company creates.			"

												Much more polished and streamlined in terms of  design and art than the first installment of the series, this game has a real (although basic) story arc and character progression system based on feats and perks. The combat is vastly more tactical than in the original as well. Simply bursting head first into the landscape on Storm Dash will only result in certain and immediate death.The overworld strategy layer and side-scrolling action integrate well with each other and manipulating one vs the other (to an extend) is a lot of fun.If you like tactical side-scrolling action integrated with a basic but unique strategy layer guiding where to engage next, this game is for you!Recommended.

												Neat game and an interesting approach for a sequel.Instead of pushing the open ending chaos of the original there is a lot more focus and smaller worlds, but in turn a lot more strategy is put into the overworld game.Some people might not enjoy the lower focus on loot, but much of it felt reduntant in the original.All in all a fun game, and a nice streamlining of the original concepts.

												Quite different from the original and in all the wrong ways, whereas the original was not a particularly good game (ugly graphics, difficult control scheme, minimal to no mechanics explanations, etc.) the sequel does away with any endearing elements of the first game in favor of...an entirely different set of gameplay mechanics? The new art is, surprisingly, less attractive than the original and many monsters seem to have been glued in from different artists, with different styles, and the various types of 'classes' are really a matter of what type of colors you'd like to hit enemies with. The overworld aspect is interesting and would've been better with more depth but as is its very shallow and the game's instructions even treat the two halves like separate games prompting one to ask: why aren't they? Both ends have been drastically over simplified and there isn't any real feel of progression or transference from one half to the other. Getting better at the combat doesn't influence the overworld and vice versa. Plus the tacked on timer, rushing you to try to understand its clunky interfaces as soon as possible and penalizing early mistakes sharply composes the sprinkles on this inedible cake of a game.Is it playable? Yes.Is it fun? Half of it (depending on what type of gamer you are)Would I be better off just buying a TBS game and an indie action platformer instead of Valley of the Wind 2? Absolutely.Or just play the first game if you find yourself wishing the combat half of the game was bigger, better, and more expansive.			"

												VWOW2 gets some negative feedback from reviewers, and the main complaint is usually that it's not the Castlevania-style game people expect. I feel this is unfair to the developers. The sidescrolling levels and strategic map work together well. Each tile on the world map can be played in sidescrolling mode, and depending on what's around it, it'll be a different type/difficulty of level, have different rewards etc. I found that this system gave more meaning to the levels, since they were each part of my greater strategy. There are some light RPG elements, but it basically comes down to switching movesets once in awhile and choosing attack or health bonuses. Nice, but not too deep.The production values are surprising for such a budget game, featuring nice backgrounds, tons of menu options/difficulty settings/etc, and a memorable soundtrack that even has a vocal theme song. The one downside is that the sprites are kind of crappily-animated, though you get used to it after an hour or two. Netplay has been smooth for me with 3 players... For some reason, it supports (in theory) hundreds. It wouldn't make any sense to do, but could be quite funny.There is a story, but it feels more like justification for the gameplay than a real setting to invest yourself in. You fight robots and dinosaurs in the future with magic... Just go with it.Overall, VWOW2 was a really nice surprise, and I'd definitely recommend it despite what others say. As far as things to improve, I'd say Arcen should get a different team to do the sprite work, make less predictable/more complex enemy AIs, and either refine or ditch the half-baked equipment system. I can't fault them too much for throwing it into a game with already-robust features, but it seemed pretty unnecessary.7.5/10			"

Posted: December 8, 2013
												Alright... first off... I did NOT play the first game. However, after watching my friend play and log hours on it, it looked like a nifty Metroid-like platformer. So, we decided to try the second one...Starting off, you are a person... who is in an apocalyptic like world. Now, there is not much variation here at all... I mean come on, there's only health and attack? Not much of an add-on there...Anyways, after starting a character you pick what mage class you are (why are there only mages? Is this Harry Potter on Dooms Day....?) There are NOT very many choices for the mages either and you're stuck with the same boring skills unlike the first one where you have a lot of options. Next, Satan is in front of you... Demonica (very original! What's next?  The Angel Angelica!) He tells you he wants you to recruit for him now that you have passed you're training. Now, who knows what training you had to go through, but it doesn't seem like much... Now, Demonica has blessed you with immortality. This is shown by a purple/blackish shade moving weird object behind you. So, unlike the first game, when you die you keep your character. Sounds good right? You can now bond with your character. You have that emotional connection. You can now freaking dry hump the screen and pretend that you are ONE with your character... however... this isn't a good thing as I will mention soon.Next, you leave the place and you find out you're actually a spy with the ""resistance""... again not original at all... LE SIGH. You rebels want to defeat Demonica by recruiting more people and then using a technological building that can actually hurt him and you can fight him. Wait, no you're on a world map! Much like Super Mario World and similar to games like Civ V...you now can move around the cells and travel to different lands! It is explained now that you personally CANNOT recruit people. They are scared of you because you have Demonica's purple/blackish blob thing showing you're immortality and allegience. What must you do? You must get these world map NPCs on your side, who will then recruit the people for you by standing there doing nothing on the cell. Now, these cells are terrible. This is TERRIBLE idea and terribly made... like Age of Empires Civ V + ABSOLUTE DOG CRAP. You start off, you have a farm. Your people on the map need food to live. These people are just 2D stick figures with no personality, no cool skills, and ""life"" that is only 1-9. This life is used to fight world monsters who also have life... every time they fight, you lose number of life points to the number of life points an enemiy has. Simple right? So, you build a clinic now... one guy has to keep farming for food for your new recruits. The clinic lets you heal life points. Alright, sounds good. So far (besides me mentioning CRAP) you would think this is a unique, cool twist on a platformer + Civ V like elements. WRONG.Every time you ""purify"" a cell, a turn ends for you. In 14 turns, Demonica comes out as well as monsters every consecutive X amount of turns. Well, you keep purifying, awesome! We are Team Good Guy Terraria now! But wait, Demonica is now out. No biggie, all you have to do is dodge Demonica, who moves only 3 spaces a turn. WRONG. I found that sometimes Demonica magically moves more than 3 somehow... after counting 5 spaces away or so , the next turn my people STILL Die. Yes, Demonica 1 hits them all. Now, here comes the REALLY stupid part of this aspect of the game. When Demonica goes through a space with buildings you make, he destroys that building and you CANNOT rebuild it. So, when your farm is gone... it is gone. I thought this would an easy fix... farm is ""grassland farm"" so if there is an empty grassland I can build a farm, right? NOPE NOT AT ALL IN THIS CRAZY BACKWARDS LAND OF JUJUBEEZBANANABOATS! You CANNOT. Like what in the hell? BUT WAIT. I found when you go to the Arctic cells, you CAN build farms. What in the actual duck mcfreaking hell is that? Farmlands... nope, the soil is TOO good. Arctic... hell yeah! Antartica is the best place for crops! What is this!?!?!Furthermore, you cannot build buildings on anything unless there are already pre-existing buildings there... which is also dumb?Remember when I said that having the same character throughout the game was VERY BAD... well here is why... So, you are like wow this is like a RPG ... minus the fact that you don't get to customize SHEET with consideration to the skills... also you do not even get to wear cool armor or look like a giant rainbow bunny like most RPGs. Now, you level up because your friend tells you to... because monsters level up every so often. After leveling up, you do not get any cool skills or anything... you get perks. Some perks are useful like more HP... others are well... completely useless... like literally making you into a glass cannon? Nothing works better than having crazy high attack with -5000 HP and defense! Anyways... this MAY be a bug for an online game me and my friend were playing, but after leveling up and getting perks we ended up dying. While trying to further my experience in the game, suddenly we lost all of our perks from dying... You CANNOT undo this? Like this is literally the most annoying thing! Once you beat a level up cell it disappears. So, you CAN exhaust all the level ups and then die... and be stuck at level 1 yourself for the entirety of the game? WTF IS THIS !? DEMON SOULS!? Seriously, I HOPE this is a bug because otherwise this game is like a 12 year old pre-pubescent troll face kid who spends his time on the 3DS trading Pokemon while asking his mother why he has hair growing on his genitals whilst Uncle Bad Touch is watching him... now if you like this game you may say, ""Well, that sounds kind of hot!"" to which I say...NO IT ISN'T YOU PEDOPHILE MORON GAMER FREAK! ITS WEIRD AND JUST PLAIN AWKWARD! Now, onto the biomes... this made little to no sense AT ALL. Now, when you first try to go to a Lava biome or an Arctic biome, you are told that it is too hot or too cold respectively and that you must take out the tower associated to each biome that will fix this...somehow? Well, one would figure that the tower to take down a lava place would be near the lava right? Well, wrong, because you cannot go into any lava areas without dying over there. Well, where the hell is the lava tower thing you ask? OH I KNOW! IT IS LITERALLY SURROUNDED BY THE ARCTIC AREA! How the HELL does this make sense to anyone? Why would there be 10 cells of arctic, then ONE lava cell in the middle of them all? How does this even work? It also works vice-versa... so POORLY constructed layouts here. The final problem with this game is the storyline too... they make it seem like there SHOULD be a story line with dialogue boxes popping up in every biome and when you kill a boss... but there isn't really. All I hear is, ""DEMONICA WANTS YOU DEAD. SO DOES LILITH. DON'T WORRY I AM STRONGER THAN THIS PERSON AND YOU SHOULDN'T LIVE! I MAKE YOU DEAD BWAHAHA!"" ... in which I reply... SCREW YOU SPECIAL ATTACK THREE TIMES AND YOU DEAD BOOIII. The ""bosses"" were no stronger than normal mobs... they were just humanoids with magic spells easy to dodge... like literally this was like Harry Potter again but with half-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ adults who are mindless drones babbling about how the trailer park smells of fish when no one there likes sushi in the first place. When you do enter biomes, your buddy will always dialogue box about things to you or your character will recall things like, ""humanity was once so great, now it is destroyed."" ""I remember this place being tough when going through training."" That is about it... you learn little to nothing about anything. THE ONLY thing this game has going for it is the platforming fighting that is similar to the first game...In conclusion... WHAT THE HELL IS THIS AND WHO MADE IT? BIZZARO FROM SEALAB?			"

												Where the original game may have been too complicated, this title commits another sin by being too simple.  No matter how recklessly I played, no matter how in the boss' faces I got, I never died and never had to fear dying.  The move list is also more locked into specific spell combos which takes away from customization.  That said it still can be gratifying to play and the overworld map portion of the game does offer some strategic elements to play with.  Overall I can't give it a thumbs down.			"

												A strange game for sure. There are actually two games here: First is essentially a turn-based strategy. It's fun but fairly light. The meat of the game is a platformer with odd controls that really take some getting used to. About the best thing I can say about that is that it's okay... On the plus side, it's by Arcen games and I'm always happy to support tham. It's also cheap-as-chips, but overall, I think you'll probably want to be spending your valuable playing time elsewhere (like with Arcen's excellent AI War)			"

												A better GAME than the first (which is pretty much a sandbox with a grind), but less fun in a lot of ways given that the random world generation is a lot more broken, with the nicer art throughout the terrible animations now stand out even more, and additional but unnecessary challenge added by the previously effective mouse aiming system replaced with an 8-directional lock aim which makes enemies who are NOWHERE NEAR limited by this into cheap deaths and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kills when they move faster than you reaim/move into the spaces between your shooting patterns with irritating regularity.The bosses are all simplistic and enemy types run out quick, and yet, unlike AVWW1, I did play this game to completion (eventually turning on its built-in cheat mode to speed some tedium, but...). If the concept of playing god while you cleanse a world of villains and rebuild a society, while guiding troops you rescue/protect across this hellscape, and you play in somewhat-shoddy 2D action-platforming between these segments... give it a try? It gets reeeeeeal cheap sometimes.			"

												Briefly: Better than first one but it's still horrible.Graphics are better, clear (i mean you can understand which is background, which is platform). Although, parallax background effect is disastrous, background moving so much. Gameplay is... eh.Now, spells are categorized, you have to choose one of those groups with four spells. There are no items anymore. So hotkeys decreased to four. And if you find a suit from chests, you have to wear and dispose other automatically. How silly! If you don't like the buffs and debuffs of your new equipment, you can't change it until you find a new bad one :) (because they are all bad).Strategic side of the game is also not so good.So avoid A Valley Without Wind 2 as well.

												Hours Played	0.25Beaten	NoCurrent Price	14.99Price per Hour	59.96I could not get into this game.  There is way too much going on and way too many ways to fail.  I could see it becoming fun if I was willing to spend another 20 hours on it, but the game doesn’t give the sense of accomplishment to get there.  Overall just not my cup of tea.Same review as #1 because besides the nice(er) coat of paint it felt like the same game.  Which could be good if you liked it.			"

												Utterly hated this game. The first one was soooo much better. Just avoid this hunk of junk and stick with the fun of the first Valley Without Wind.			"

												I found it much, much more coherent than the first game. Had about an hour of fun with it, but the gameplay is getting really repetitive. I guess I'll mark this as a positive review?			"

												A Valley Without Wind worked better as a Metroidvania RPG.  I simply could not get into the sequel now that its become a strategy game.Not to mention how having a definitive game over sequence KINDA goes against the spirit of the original game.Skip this one.  Stick to the original.			"

												 Its unconventional and addictive blend of classic platforming action and basic strategy segments makes every accomplishment more meaningful and every failure more devastating, and the very real possibility that you will fail to vanquish Demonaica raises the stakes enough to make everything more interesting still.

												Another game I got for free, the most unfathomable thing about this disaster is the fact that enough people apparently bought and even worse ENJOYED the first game that it warranted a sequel that manages to be even worse in almost every single aspect. I don't even want to know what level of self-loathing a person would have to have to begin to want to play this.			"

												A Valley Without Wind is a description of a fat girls thighs. Just like the first game, a garbled mess all thrown together into a blender then drank and pooped into this 16-bit dog crap which is pretty much what the entire games graphics and gameplay are like: a incoherent nasty mess. I wasn't confused as how to play I just couldn't stop asking myself ""what is this sh-t?"" It is all like something a 80 year old mental patient suffering from schizophrenia and alzeimers would describe his dreams to be like. Actually nevermind. That would be awesome lol. This is just a weird incoherent bunch of digital vomit.			"

												I got this for free after my brother sent me AVWW 1.  The first one was unique but awkward, and frankly couldn't hold my attention.  So, I wasn't thrilled when I got AVWW 2 for free... ""Who cares?"" I thought.  So, I uninstalled after jumping around a bit in the (still awkward looking) environment.  Several years later, I've come back and decided to try to get some achievments for various games.  I am frankly surprised at how much fun I'm having with AVWW 2.  It is 50% strategy game and 50% side scrolling action game with RPG elements.  It has a rather steep learning curve, so don't load it up when you're in a rush!  Oh, yeah, and be aware that the font is too small and ambiguous, so people with even mild visual impairments are going to get very frustrated playing this game.			"
