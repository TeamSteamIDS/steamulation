												First: this is an educational game that teaches the basics of genetics and plant breeding (dominant/recessive genes); a novel twist on Gregor Mendel's pea plant experiments (who makes an appearance). Pros: Unlike most children's games, it's gentle and not flashy; there's no hurry to speed through everything, and you really want to double check everything before it goes through (fortunately, the glossary to check scientific terminology is readily available). Soft pastel colours and a unique art style remind me of children's books of my parents' childhood. A lot of good memories are evoked in this game: the dress style of the characters is a fantastical blend of classical 18th century stiff frocks to a 1930s flapper style, the music is scratchy like an old record and hovers just at the edge of your perception. And I really appreciate well-written characters, subtle storytelling and good voice work: every character was charming and unique to me, and helping them out advanced their one-sided story a little further.Cons: The game is unforgiving if you burn all your money buying plants instead of breeding them, accepting orders you don't have the energy or money to fulfill, or buying upgrades too early in the game. The 'tutorial' day feels tedious, but it takes two minutes to speed-click through everything. It's also extremely short: a skilled gamer can chew this up in an hour, but the quick end (and super-low price - I bought this at 4 CAD) prevents the game from feeling tedious and worth the money.Also, I'd shoot the marketer who said ""crazy"" was a good descriptor for this game. * Edited after completing the game.

This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.Well, damn, I am learning while playing a video game...Crazy Plant Shop is a game based around the idea of breeding and growing plants to tell to your customers in your ""Crazy Plant Shop"". This game is actually used in school based environments because of the benefits and information it provides for teaching. Essentially you get a customer who has a request for a certain plant. You then have to either purchase the plant out right from the plant catalog or you can breed the plant with your Super breeding machine ""out back"". When using the breeding machine you have to take into consideration dominant genes and recessive genes, as well as different genotypes and phenotypes combinations. While doing this you also use the Punnet squares, something which I have not seen since my secondary school days. I can see why this game is used in  schools, because there is so much information, each word that you may not be familiar with comes with an audio definition recording.  I actually learnt quite a bit from this game, science wasn't exactly my strongest subject at school, and boy could I tell when playing this. I haven't managed to complete it. The aim is to actually buy all of the plants in the catalog within a 13 day time frame and not go bankrupt through paying rent everyday. I really struggled around day 8 or 9. You have to be really good at your breeding, and try not buy as many plants just to sell outright, at least that's what I figured out would be the best solution. The graphics are very cute; the game can be played in a browser which I suppose is for the school environments that don't want Steam being installed on all their machines (understandably) , so we are not talking revolutionary graphics - it does its job to a very high standard. The game actually has amazing voice acting; every character, and there are tons, have an awesome voice actor. It's actually on par with some AAA games if you ask me. It's amazing how good voice acting can have such a positive impact on any game. Difficulty; like I said, I didn't finish Crazy Plant Shop, I am terrible at science so that didn't help. If you put a lot of hours into this game you will eventually beat it. I have seen people ten plus hours on this so it does have it's own fan base out there. Along with some very handy community made guides in the hub.There are no technical problems which your regular player will run into really. The only issue I had was that I was not able to take screenshots either using Fraps or Steam, I assume because it doesn't use any DirectX engine behind it so it doesn't recognize it, who knows. In conclusion, do I recommend Crazy Plant Shop? Well I suppose the best way of putting it is that I ""don't Not recommend it"". The game does it's job very well, it serves a purpose to teach the younger audience about breeding, genes etc, and it will do that! I will actually be showing this game to my partner who is a teacher to see whether it would be used in a classroom environment. I am not going to down-thumb this game because its not bad, it's just not going to be everyone's cup of tea who will be on Steam.

												Crazy Plant Shop actually reminds me a little of Cook Serve Delicious in that ""just one more day"" sort of addictive way, except it's about efficiency rather than speed. The key is trying to offer your customers the most combinations of plants using the least amount of breeding stock (pedestal space in your store) and mating attempts (energy). It's a fun little casual game that is challenging enough to keep you coming back for more, but not terribly difficult or stressful.The game uses scientific concepts and terminology, and features the use of Punnett square diagrams to determine the traits of the plants you are breeding to fill customer requests. It would be a great game for kids taking biology classes for the first time, but I think it's still pretty entertaining even for adults who are familiar with the science involved.The artwork is cute, and the plants are interesting and varied. The music's appropriate, but the voice acting is pretty cheesy and gets repetitive and grating after a while.			"

												Not ""crazy"" but certainly adorable. The game centers around you being a plant shop owner and you breed plans to have certain traits and it's your basic genetics. It kind of took me back to those times where I had to fill in the squares with what traits would carry on and what not. It was really fun for the few hours I put into it, extremely cute with the nice graphics.You carry out your day filling orders and breeding plants to make money to buy/unlock more plants and eventually the game ends when you unlock all of the plants and all of the traits. It was cute.Reccomended for casual gamers or someone just looking for something to do for a few hours.			"

												You should try this game out before judging it.At first, I though this game is casual game like dashing game (Taking order and serve the customer quickly to earn points).But turn out I'm wrong, to play this game you need to know the basic of biology (about breeding plants).You have 12 days (13 days - 1 day tutorial) to run the store and at the end of each day you have to pay your rent.You don't need to accept all orders from the customers, sometime it's wise to just reject the order.By finishing this game you have learn yourself about Dominant - Recessive genes and some economic stuff like how to run a shop.A game that is more to education and fun to learn deserve an appreciation.I have finished the game and learn how to make a quality seeds.

												Worth the price, if you're into light puzzle and/or science-y stuff.Essentially, you spend a few hours manipulating Punnett squares to get the traits you want based on the requests of your customers. The gamer in me wanted more to do - randomization, mutations, etc, to get more longevity out the game. But again, it was worth the price.Biggest flaw was the mediocre voice acting. Some of the characters were better than others, but some of the accents were noticeably fake, and one in particular was inconsistent and couldn't decide what it wanted to be.			"

												Crazy Plant Shop is a short but well-made game. It's was also very educational. I wish I had this game back in high school since this is a medium of learning that I would've been able to get into.It takes about 1-2 playthroughs to complete over the span of ~2 hours. The achievements are simple and easy to get provided you familiarize yourself with the game's 'tutorial' during the first day.I really liked this game.

												Despite probably being outside of the target audience, I really enjoyed this game. The mechanics are simple but not too tedious since there's plenty of variety in plants you can create, and it has really cute art and amusing characters. I only wish there had been more to it - perhaps different difficulty levels or a new game plus - so I could keep unlocking more plants and filling increasingly complex orders past the two hours or so it takes to play through it. If the developers made a sequel with additions like that, I would absolutely buy it.			"

												well, takes about 1-2h to complete this game.maybe more something for smaller kids, since its all the same most of the time.far too easy since you just make 2 plants of each type which are heterogenous in all traits, so you can make every order of that plant out of that pair. takes about 5 minutes to figure out and then repeat for ~1h to win the game.too simple for adults, but i think quite good for kids to learn some basics about genetics, would recommend for 6-10 year old kids.

												This game is definitely worth it, especially since it's on sale right now.I beat the game fairly quickly (it only lasts 13 ""days""), but I replayed it about 5 times, so that's gotta say something.The good:-The animation is nice-The music/sound effects are good-It's definitely worth the $4.99 (even better if it's on sale)-The characters are fully voiced-It's very cute-It's mildly educational, I definitely know more about genetics than I did when I started, and I already new a little going into it.-The customers are very patient, you can take all day to serve one if you really want.. however, you won't get a new one unless you accept the current one.-You can check your orders at any time (in case you forgot exactly what plant was needed) and even change which one is your ""active"" order.-You can upgrade your shop with a few different improvements-Steam trading cards, and achievements.The bad:-It can be a little confusing at first, especially if you're not familiar with simple genetics-The voice acting isn't the greatest (but at least it exists)-The dialogue (I use the term loosely) gets repetative, and I definitely found myself skipping through what people were saying, and just reading the quick tool-tip about what the order was that I needed to fill.-The tutorial doesn't explain some of the game mechanics, such as switching which order you're currently working on (a minor problem, but it did cause me a few issues)-The competitions you can enter have the same requirements every play-through, so if you have already won it once you can just do the exact same thing next time, and you know you'll win again.-There's no endless mode, or survival mode, or whatever you want to call it. So once the 13 days are up, you have to restart from the beginning if you want to keep playing.All-in-all this game was well worth the money, and the flaws were very minor. If you're a fan of tycoon-style games you'll most likely get some fun out of this, though it's definitely a lot more calm than some of those types of games. It would be very nice if there was an endless mode after you've beaten it, but even playing from the beginning again is fun, especially since it's fairly quick to play through the 13 days.			"

												Crazy Plant Shop is a botanical genetics lesson disguised as a casual time management game (without the time management).Though it aspires to be something of an interactive entry course on plant genes and reproduction, its educational value never goes so far as to attempt to beat you over the head with the fact the game is trying to teach you something. It gets its points (for as hyper simplified as they are) across through gameplay hooks rather than walls of text, and it's a surprising amount of fun. It essentially boils down to cross breeding plants while taking into account dominant and recessive genes to produce the traits you need to fill a customer's rather exact and bizarre orders.It sounds incredibly dull, but in this case breaking things down to their utmost basics actually works in Crazy Plant Shop's favor. Traits are distinct and easy to recognize, with the biggest thing you need to keep tract of being making sure you spreed enough recessive genes around to be able to breed plants with those traits. The lack of any time limit or penalty for refusing orders you can't focus on allows you to take as much time as you need mixing and matching plants, until you've found the right combination and feel like an insane plant matchmaker.Where the game unfortunately trips over itself a bit is the unexpectedly punishing economy, which I wouldn't hesitate to call broken in most respects. You begin with a limited, finite amount of money to start your botanist career, and ordering plants is expensive and almost never fully compensated by the amount you're paid for fulfilling orders. If you aren't meticulously micromanaging your inventory and making full use of your also limited power for using the breeding machine, you're going to find yourself stuck with no other option but to start the game over. Aside from there being a bit about how breeding plants is cheaper than buying them outright, it was never made clear to me just how exact I needed to be with my orders, and how closely I needed to watch the number of power I had left if I wanted to succeed which led to me being forced into a corner several levels in on my first playthrough with no way out.Crazy Plant Shop's oddly restrictive monetary systems make playing in it a little more stressful than I was looking for. I wasn't allowed room to experiment because I was so scared of losing all the progress I'd made because I bought one too many plants, and this really hampers and experience that seems designed as a more lighthearted way for people to learn about plants than a typical textbook. Once the game opens up a bit in the later third and puts less pressure on your every decision it was a lot easier to see it as one of the more creative forms of edutainment I've seen. It's just a shame that I'm sure a lot of people won't get that far.			"

												While I am a little disappointed that this isn't what I expected (a more freestyle game, where you try to come up with the best selling combination of plant genes), once I got into it I had a lot of fun. It can be a little difficult at first to get a handle on managing finances and how the combinations work, but once everything clicks all you'll have to worry about is running out of space. My thanks to the developers for not including time management in with the other challenges. If I had to handle trying to keep customers happy with timely service on top of figuring out how to make the plants they wanted, I think I would have given up before making it to the end. I look forward to trying to get the remaining achievements.			"

												Crazy Plant Shop is a decently entertaining game for a short amount of time, but is not by any stretch of your imagination worth paying for. As a game, it falls in the middle range of quality of games you could find easily for free on Kongregate or similar sites.First off, there is a very small selection of poor music. The voice acting is limited and at times cringe-worthy. There is only one game mode- a 13 day challenge to obtain all the plant types. There is no way to buy extra plant slots. Waiting on your character to walk around for everything and for the plant breeding machine to go ding takes up far too much time, which is pointless because the days are not on a timer. There is no penalty for rejecting customers or failing customers' orders that you accepted.Ultimately, there is just very little to this game. It's good, but there needs to be MORE. I can find good little games all day for free, and most of them have more depth and keep me entertained longer than Crazy Plant Shop could ever hope to.As a warning, note that there is no cross-breeding plants to create new, strange species. So if that's what you want to get the game for, don't bother.			"

												I would have loved to have played this game when I was learning about punnett squares in school and would highly recomend it to anyone currently learning about them. The landlord is Gregor Mendel, THE creator of the punnett squares, which I thought was pretty cool. When there was  a word that I haven't seen since school the dictionary option was particuarly helpful. The only downside to the game is that when you finally have 2 of each plant, both having one dominant and one recessive gene for each trait, any combination can be created, thus removing any challenges from the gameplay. Overall I found the game to be entertaining for a day and would recommend it to science/plant enthusiasts.			"

												Crazy Plant Shop is an edu-tainment management/simulation game in which you use Punnett squares to selectively breed silly plants and produce offspring that conform to your customer’s specifications.(As someone who has spent many years teaching Punnett squares, I’m aware that I’m probably not the target audience of this game, so that’s probably worth bearing in mind in the context of this review.)I generally enjoy management/simulation games, and the idea of one centering on using biological concepts for fun and profit was very appealing to me. I was under the impression that this was a cute, casual management sim, but unfortunately, this game is pretty clearly intended more as edu-tainment to reinforce the concepts of Mendelian genetics than as a real game. The management aspects are trivial, the game progression is very linear, and determining the correct crosses to produce the required offspring is not very challenging.I can see this game appealing to parents who want a fun way to introduce their kids to important biological concepts, and maybe to those who don’t remember much about basic biology and want a fun-ish refresher. Beyond its educational merits, though, I really don’t see any reason to play this game. "

Even if you go achievement hunting you will likely get everything done in 2 playtrought No manual, many things are left unexplained (IE: the effect of upgrades) No reason to keep playing untill the fatidic day 13 after you unlock everything (and i made it by day 9 in my first playtrought)Overall The game is fun, relaxing and can be freely shared with kids as a very barebone introduction to mendelian geneticsThe bad points can be condoned considering the very low pricetag.

												Although this presents as edutainment, with a lot of crazy $10 science words like ""allele"" and ""phenotype,"" it plays much more like a fairly unforgiving business sim than a biology lesson. After a few game days I worked out that most of the customer orders are not just hard or impossible to fulfil, but also involve selling special-order custom items at lower than the wholesale prices for standard varieties. So, the economy is strangely (lovingly caressed) against you. You can decline orders with no consequence as far as I could see, they just keep cycling through until you have the maximum number accepted.Aside from the business model being odd, the real science of plant breeding is glossed over. I got the idea that some plants are ""simple"" like sunflowers, and you can just choose through selective breeding whether they shoot sunlight or rainbows, whereas a Pitcher Plant is more complex with variables such as whether it holds a hot or cold beverage and if it has a sippy-cup or a lid, but you choose those traits by clicking on a button and it doesn't explain anything about how to actually do that to your Mom's houseplants.Good points: for one there's no time pressure, just resource juggling. Also I did feel a genuinely heartwarming moment when, after days of fighting foreclosure, no money in the bank, no credit available and no way to fulfil paying customer orders I was able to waste my last 6 Gold Coins on a stock bunch of white daisies to sell for 3 Gold Coins to some scruffy street urchins who needed a break. The smiles made my day and the business turned around from that moment. So the Karma Simulation seems solid.Upgrades to the store itself are unlocked very early and I strongly recommend getting the Breeding Machine Power Upgrade asap, as that is the only possible source of profit as far as I can see - the machine manufactures new plants at no Gold cost and the number of uses refills each day (starting on the day AFTER you buy it, I think.)Graphics are excellent, hand-painted stuff in the ballpark of Bastion and nice animated, the sound's fine but the voice acting is patchy and amateurish, it seems like a port of tablet game but runs fine on my Windows 7-64 rig. Not sure if ""terrible fake accents"" is a good or a bad thing but it has that too. Also a Catctus... I mean a cactus shaped like a cat, in Spiky or Fluffy varieties. There are rabbit and chicken plants too.Science!			"

												Crazy Plant Shop is a pretty cool game while you're still figuring out the mechanics. Mixing plants and understanding how the dominant and recessive traits work in your favour (or against you). After you do understand, however, the game gets very monotonous. Every mission is just someone asking you x number of plants with x and y traits. So you mix your plants to get the desired result. And that's about it. Some light management aspects to it, knowing when to buy a plant or mix them, etc., but those aspects don't make much of a difference, overall.It also gets very dull to have to repeat the same procedure over and over and over again. Click here, click there, wait for the menu to pop-up, click here, open menu, close menu, etc. etc.It would definitely benefit from a pipeline mechanic, like in SpaceChem, so that you could automatize everything. But that would be a different game altogether, I guess.I'm not too keen on the educational aspect of the game. I mean, it's still sistematic/mechanic learning. You're not exploring, digging, investigating anything through trial and testing, for the most part. Which would be the real joy of learning? Like this, it's following a textbook in videogame form. You're still just going through the required motions without ever being surprised. They don't give you a fairly obscure objective that requires you to explore the mechanics until you figure out a possible path to the solution. Instead, you're just kind of memorizing what you need to do, and then you're done. Which is unfortunate, but not unexpected...Not my kind of ""educational"" game, but it may help with middle/high school tests, I guess.			"

												You get to be a botanist who breeds plants with different genetic makeup.  Your goal is to unlock all plants after Day 13 as well as complete 4 challenges to win the World Fair.  You earn money from selling plants as well as spend money on buying new plant species and paying your landlord store rent fee.  This game is about financial management and space management.  Though this game is fairly short, it was quite entertaining for its price.			"

												I really wanted to love this game. I mean, I really, really, really wanted to love it.But I can't.I absolutely adore the art style.I love the concept.And the plants are adorable.But the gameplay sucks any chance of fun out of it for me.The idea of the gameplay is exactly the kind of game I usually love.But some of the decisions the designers made on how the game should work were foolish and they ruin the fun of the experience.You buy plants from a catalog and sell them at a huge loss.If you breed the plants it's free, but your machine only has a super limited number of uses per day.So you basically can't actually experiment and play around any and if you make even one tiny mistake, you can screw yourself over completely.The result is that the game is more stressful than was necessary and the idea of a shop owner selling their plants at a huge loss from the acquisition cost seems hugely immersion breaking and frankly, I think it was done as a way to artificially increase the difficulty, and that sloppy design shows.If they had chosen instead to make the catalog orders a break-even scenario, you could play around, try things out, learn about plant genes in a lower-stress environment and have fun.In fact, even with various difficulty levels, that would be nice. Low difficulty, break even on catalog orders. Medium, small loss. High, the default loss currently in the game.As it is, I think it's incredibly cute to look at and it refreshed me about how genes work very minimally... but I can't recommend it as a game because I didn't enjoy it. :c			"

												I love the artwork and the designs of the plants and it's really fun to think of how to get the different combinations. But the game is really really toooooo short.I wishing for more content like...: - more plants (♥)- more tasks. (there are only two: filling the catalog and making the customers happy. It's not that much I think. :'< )- maybe the option to enlarge, decorate, changing the shop (?) or something like that. (I want to feel like the owner)- combinations of different plants. (to make bigger and new plants... or monsters. :D hahaha)- some kind of different outcome in the end of the last day. (depending on fame, money or something)And/or other things.I think it's a really good concept and it was fun too but at the moment I doesn't feel like to play it again. Because every time it's the same. :'(			"

												I absolutely loved this game, probably cause I love both science as well as flowers and love shop management stores, but I do wish there was more to do. I finished the game in a little over two hours. I do look forward to getting the rest of the achievement though as well as any updates that the game may have.I loved that there wasn't a time limit cause I would have lost many customers while I was trying to figure out how to make their plants, but I would have preferred more breeding power and more space, that was my main problem. I always just ended the day whenever I ran out of power haha. It would be cool if there was some downtime where I can just figure out about the plants and not have to worry about customers and would love to have more days, but I have high hopes for updates seeing how this game was released only two months ago.Either way, it's a great game, I wish it was longer though.

												Wow, who would have thought such a seemingly simple game could be so engaging and fun!? Diving into the science-y world of genetics through plant breeding is definitely amazing as well as great for the brain to think of how you're going to breed a specific hybrid for every customer that walks into your store. The voices are great, the characters are different and unique and amazing, and while they game is 'simple', it's still no walk in the flower fields because it really makes you think about how you're managing your orders and resources. All in all, this is a super great game that'll suck you right in to the point where you lose track of how many hours you've been playing it.			"

												The game is what is it advertised about plants. In this game you are a plant shop owner which anyone who is anyone hangs out. The object is to help these needy customers and genetically breeding a plant that is exactly to there specification. Sounds pretty simple? Well, the game keeps getting harder and more complicated to get these little plants the way you need them.The problems I have with this game is some of the discriptions are ridiculously vague. Which, I feel should not be since the game becomes so complicated. There is never enough space to put all your ""breedable"" plants which gets annoying. I think the best thing by far is the fact you are not timed creating your plants. You very lovely customers will literally wait all day for you to make them their plants. You do have a limit of uses per day though, and you can increase it if you want to shell your hard earned gold. After a few plays through you start memorizing things and it gets pretty easy. It's just putting in the time. Overall it's quite enjoyable.			"

												I appreciate what they tried to do here, but I honestly feel as though the lack of learning curve and the difficulty inherent in differentiating the smaller details in the windowed play mode, as well as the rather tedious instructions, make this a game that will turn away the vast majority of gamers. I do think that many of the plant species and gameplay elements are quite good and clever. Yet, I cannot help but feel that this game could have been highly educational and useful for a far broader audience with some fairly small adjustments. Instead, this is a game that really only works for a niche audience, and it's only through sheer stubborness that I stuck with it to the point of generally figuring it out, because prior to that it was highly frustrating. In general, that is not a reaction one wants to have when they start playing a game, and not one that most are willing to keep playing in spite of.			"

												First of all - this is a kid's game.I finished it anyway because I have completionist issues, but the game is pretty effortless once you figure out how it works. Took me around 2-3 hours, but it would last longer for someone younger.It is somewhat educational, but really only covers dominant and recessive genes - 7/10.PS. For achievements, the only tricky one is ""Complete 80 tasks"" - you should always focus on the low quantity requests first and early on, after you have upgraded your power, buy plants to do the easy requests so you don't waste charges. Later in the game once you are working with 4-5 genes, it is impossible to buy them to complete tasks directly. Getting to 500 gold is fairly easy as long as you don't waste more than 200 gold buying misc plants early on.			"

												Recommended for younger players. Seriously.The game is very quick, and very simple, took me roughly 2 hours to finish including a few breaks.The save function is limited, there is no undoing mistakes by loading a save, so in a way that encourages the player to be aware of their choices.As a whole, the game touts itself as an tool for education. The game does have an interactive glossary for the scientific terms, which I found to be a nice touch.Once the player has a grasp on the concepts the game is teaching, the game quickly becomes a resource management game instead, the genetic breeding becomes a breeze. Instead players have to keep an eye on their remaining power for the breeding machines, and which orders are best to fufill. Possibly a challenge for younger players, but as it was the game became less entertaining as I progressed.However the game's price was super low for me, I got it with the Humble Bundle on a whim, so I recommend the game in regards to the price. The standard price of $5 isn't that bad either, but you'll either love it or hate it. "

												This game is intensely boring as there is only one thing you can do, over and over. It appears to be aimed at young children, but is quite difficult. The plants you breed don't kill zombies or rob banks or anything actually interesting. Instead they make your coin counter increase slightly. If you are very smart and very careful you might actually make a profit today. It's like Papers Please, but with all of the charm, variety, cleverness, creativity, and story removed. I don't blame the game developers. I blame whatever bland committe of bureaucrats micromanaged the process in the interest of removing all of the fun and joy out of learning.			"

												This Whole Game Finishes in 13days! - Win or Lose! (GAME OVER MAN!)Firstly Stuff You Can Do Each Day: 1. Use Plant Breeder to get more Plants for Free (Limited Charges).2. Buy New Plants before you end the day to prepare for the next day.3. Upgrade Your Shop once you manage to save up enough $.4. Reject Customers if they request something your not selling.- Other than the Plant Competition the 4 features above are what you will be doing through out each day.*Note: There is only One Game Mode which is the new game mode, play 13days and unlock all the plants in your catalog or lose the game, that's it. There is no time limit but feels more like usage or turn limit as using the Plant Breeder is No.1 Priority and has limited charges.*It feels like a very well put together flash game and as for the educational side to it, I can honestly say that I didn't learn anything useful nor will I ever it anything I experience from this game in real life.------------------------------------------Stuff that I feel can improve this game!1. Change some game mechanics around to add Endless Mode.2. Put more meaningful upgrades, almost half of the upgrades doesn't do anything to give you a game adventage.3. Do Something To MAKE NEW GAME+!4. Have some kind of Storyline in the game please!If they devs manages to add either 1. or 3. than I will test the game again and write a new review.FOR NOW I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME!Reasons - It felt like, imagine your in an Arcade and saw that the game you wanted to play has a very long queue for it so you decided to use your tokens to play this game instead. That's how I felt about this game but even after I won on my first playthrough and I didn't have any reason to open the game again so that means game deleted*.The art style is Super Cute though but sadly the game features and zero storyline are very disapointing.

This game is actually too short: it ends just when you started to get into the real stuff!I sincerely hope that creators will add some gametime: maybe another 13 days run, with other plants, or endgame plants, to acomplish more difficult goals?I guess this is an educationnal game about genetic science, to learn the basics of heredity. And it achieves its goals: it's recreative, smart, fun and snappy, you can learn few things about biology and having fun doing it.I guess the next step could be to add some mutation process in the gameplay: maybe a radioactive machine to get new genes, or spontanius evolutions. Of course, the hole idea will be more fun with animals, but plants are keeping the concept simple, easy and realistic. Again: the game is fulfilling its pedagogic purposes.			"

												Although the music and graphics are fine, the characters are quirky, and the idea behind the game is great, the gameplay can be repetitive. At the beginning, you have very little room to learn and practice genetic combinations. With random orders, limited funds, and limited actions per day, it is very easy to go broke. While you can reject the least desirable orders to stay afloat, this habit leads to a clickfest by the end of the game, as you check and reject many orders just to get the best one. I still might use the game with my young nephews to introduce the concepts, but playing for more than 10-20 minutes got boring quickly.			"

A child might also learn something about business, but there's no shortage of games where you run shops or manage a business in a manner that stays fresh and enjoyable much longer than this game does.Ultimately, this is a game you beat in about 2-3 hours, and the only reason to replay it is to max out achievements.

I actually found it pretty charming so I would call it a positive myself.Cons- Each day is very repetetive without any timed pressure to keep it fun- After getting about 3-4 quests for a breed of plant, no one will want it anymore and you are forced to get rid of it because there is very little space to store plants. - If you don't get around to doing those quests sometimes they pop up later when you've already gotten rid of all your plants of that breed.-Little space to store plants ): Overall i kinda regret buying it "

												This game challenges one's patience in that it really doesn't make a whole lot of sense what's going on. Other than the puzzling aspects of it's mystery UI, that despite help tip balloons I could not comprehend, I would say the music is pretty good.I was hoping it would help me figure out how to start my own grow operation... but I think that would be easier and better done in spreadsheet applications and google.com searches than this game, and hey, probably a lot more fun, why not rabbit-hole wikipedia articles on asexual reproduction and mutation.

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a simulation game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou are only able to toggle the sound or Music volume.No resolution sizes available.About the game.You are an owner of the flower shop and you have to buy/sell and breed plants.  You are able to breed new kind of plants by putting 2 different plants together into the breeding machine. You have to sell the specific plant to the customer. If they want to buy a tall flower, you will have to get a tall fllower. If you are placing a plant on the counter, you have to make sure that you have selected the right order. Otherwise you can't sell your plant even if it has not been selected. Which is a bit silly to be honest.There is a small instruction guide available.Items doesn't feel very rewarding if you are going to sell them.Buying items will never pay off.There are competitions but i don't think they are really worth it.Music is meh.Game is somewhat voiced over.Game is boring and partly annoying if it takes forever to make a new plant without spending money on it.The idea is nice with the breed system but not really necessary.Other things.I do like those kind of games, like diner dash. it's not entirely the same though. But this game just didn't grab me.-------------------I Give this game a 3/10			"

												So you're some guy/gal who just rented a plant shop to sell and ""make"" plants. The game is generally fun. You buy plants, mess with the ""breeding machine"" to get the genes you're looking for and you fulfill the orders of the customers. You have 13 days to unlock all 13 plants.There is also a bad side. If you're someone like me, you'll soon find yourself declining 99% of the orders because they don't net the most gold possible. It basically means that you've unlocked plant #5 and #6 and they net 9 coins each and you'll  just decline all orders asking for plants #1 to #4. Especially fun when you're at plant #10. But that's if you're like me, which you most likely are not.In general a neat game to refresh your mind about this gene topic (or to teach you a bit about it)Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												Crazy Plant Shop is a fun edutainment game inspired by Mendelian inheritance and Gregor Mendel's famous pea plants.The premise of the game is similar to other shopkeep games (e.g. Recettear) in that you must earn enough money each period (one business day) to pay the rent and stay in the black through the entire game (13 in-game business days.) You can end an in-game day any time you want, but for the best results you should wait until you are unable to complete orders. Orders continuously stream in, but you are limited in the money you have and the number of plants that you can breed in one day; I have never run out of open orders. The game is short--a full run through will take about 1-2 hours depending on how much thought you put into each order.The theme of the game is plant breeding and Mendelian inheritance. You will buy plants from a catalog and breed them for traits desired by customers. Each trait has a dominant and recessive expression and up to five different traits. One plant is asexual and comes with only one dominant trait expressed. You can choose to fulfill orders by breeding or ordering directly from a catalog. Ordering from the catalog results in a net loss--customers always pay the same amount for each breed of plant and this amount is always at least half the cost of buying a plant. Breeding is limited to 9-15 times per day, depending on upgrade level. This is limiting factor where strategy is required.The power-ups are difficult to afford in the beginning and, aside from increasing your breeding power and shelving capacity, the upgrades provide little benefit to gameplay. You can take as much time as needed for any order and there are no bonuses or penalties for performance. The pacing and difficulty of the game is relatively static since there are few options for earning money faster.In all, this is a relative short, fun, low-pressure game that might educate young botanists or entertain casual players. There is no New Game+ or Leaderboard and no record of progress aside from achievements, so the replay value quickly vanishes, despite its brevity. I recommend this game for casual gamers and fans of the genre, but if you like a challenge, look elsewhere. "

												This is a pretty fun little game and I think it's worth it even at $5. Once you understand how to make the genetics work in your favor, it's rather easy to do. The only thing left to do than is to hunt for achievements. The hardest one will probably be to win the World Fair. My biggest dissapointment with the game is that I can't experiment more, Would have liked to see a bit of crossbreeding, but it's not possible. Other than that, was quite happy with my purchase.Spoiler: To be able to make all the possible plant variations, both seed plants should have both the dominant and recessive trait in each category, alternatively, it's ok for one of the two to have the recessive trait twice. With those combos, it's always worked for me. Sometimes, other combos will work, but seemingly without rime or reason. 	 "

												The art style is cute, but the game was just so boring to me that I couldn't enjoy it. Yes, it does a fair job of teaching about genetics in plants, but the player only has 13 days to unlock the catalog of plants and reproduction of plants is done via a gimmic that is unrealistic (a breeding machine) that restricts the player to a set # of gambles at the genetics as a means to meet requests via copied plants. Further the player is restricted by number of plants one can have, which is 10 out on the floor and two in the machine to make copies. If you have no room you are pretty much forced to sell the plant on sale for I think it is 1/3rd the catalog cost. There is no graphic options btw. The game does not support full screen. It feels like it was designed in an engine to release for iOS/Android but was also released on Steam. Short and quirky. Just not my kind of game.			"

												NOTE: For review with screenshots, please visit http://microfloppy.net/2015/02/15/crazy-plant-shop/Crazy Plant Shop by Filament Games explores the concepts of genotypes in plants. You own a plant shop and your job is to provide customers with plants that have the properties/phenotypes that the customers request. The game has adorable artwork and, as there are no quicktime events but is strickly turn-based, is very relaxing.You buy plants which you can “breed”: You select (using a punnett square) which genes the offspring should have. I found the breeding very easy which in turn made the game very easy, but on the other hand I am probably not the target audience. For kids learning about dominant and recessive genotypes, this would be a great way to introduce them to these concepts.Other than that, there is not much gameplay to the game. New customers enter, you fill their order, you breed plants until your “breeding machine” runs out of energy, and then you close the shop for the day. Completing orders will make you unlock new types of plants. You win if you have unlocked all plants on the end of day 13.A great game for anyone who wants to learn about genotypes and inheritance.4/10 cacti "

												I'll be frank, I am a little dissapointed  with this purchase.While it has all the right components to make a fine puzzle game, it still didn't work for me.Within a very small timeframe I found the ""recipe"" how to solve the game, and for the next hour I spend time doing chores to repeat the process in order to get the highest score I would be able to achieve.Then the game was over, and with no real reason to repeat this process,thats the one hour I had with this game.I can not say I would recommend this game to a child even, while the difficulty certainly fits the bill, I would still say that the game lack intuative puzzle solving,and is more about repeating chores once you figure out how it works.One final thumb up for execution, but the fundementals are still lacking, even for it's low price tag.

												Got this in a Humble Bundle and figured I'd try it. The target audience is obviously people still in primary school - the game itself is trivial to break (get two identical plants of each type that have both the dominant and recessive gene for every trait and you can breed any combination) and it's nigh on impossible to actually lose (there's no time limit). While more plants are added as you progress, the mechanics remain unchanged throughout the game; it's the exact same game but with some different images for the later stages. I can't even really recommend it to teach simplified genetics because the game does a poor job of explaining how to breed plants.			"

												This is an educational plant genetics game where your landlord is Mendel. Just saying. That’s charming. And charming’s the main descriptor I’d use for Crazy Plant Shop. Yeah, I can talk about maybe some of the stereotypes aren’t the greatest thing to stick in a game for kids, but I’d counter myself with how diverse the cast is, and in general, the thing’s just so darn cute. Especially the kid voice actors. Cuuuuute. And there’s hot dog plants and chompy plants and … and! It’s a neat way to explain homogenic and heterogenic / recessive and dominant genes. Also encourages a little critical thinking (I don’t have the right plants to get the combination the customer ordered, but if I breed these two together, and breed the resulting plant with the first plant … ).Unfortunately, Crazy Plant Shop has a couple of major problems. First, the UI is a little muddy. Tool tips or a more involved tutorial would be nice. For example, it’s not immediately clear you can choose what alleles a plant inherits. Second, and related, the game handles awkwardly. I swear I spent half my time wandering around and switching plants with plants. You have to pick up a plant to see its alleles. I do understand that you’ll never have enough pedestals to encourage that critical thinking again (do I need four plants to create all variations of this species? No, I just need two), but even if you narrow everything down to just what you need, the shelf space never stops feeling crowded and hard to organize.So, gimme more informative UI and plant-wrangling that doesn’t involve wandering back and forth, and this is fair fantastic science edutainment for youngsters.

												I bought this game just because I thought it included punnett/punnet squares and mendelian sampling. It does and it does so in a way that isn't hard to learn either. I even bought this game for my nieces to play. This game and it's developer bring relatively hard concepts, even for some of my collegues, to a basic level and introduces them to children; Or the children at heart. I'll be going into my third playthrough soon and I'm only on 14.8 total hours. I could run through this game pretty quickly, but then you'd be missing the story. The story is...decent, not great but decent. You are the proprieter of a plant shop and your landlord is Gregor Mendel. He makes you pay 10 bucks every night for rent. You have to make enough money to stay afloat while also trying to breed plants for customers orders. A third but optional objective is to ender the local flower show and move through the local, state, and national levels before trying to win at the worlds fair. These are all pretty easy as long as you have two heterozygous plants ready to breed for anything. The hard part is turning away people when you don't have enough (breeder) power to breed plants for a customers order.

												This is an educational plant genetics game where your landlord is Mendel. Just saying. That’s charming. And charming’s the main descriptor I’d use for Crazy Plant Shop. Yeah, I can talk about maybe some of the stereotypes aren’t the greatest thing to stick in a game for kids, but I’d counter myself with how diverse the cast is, and in general, the thing’s just so darn cute. Especially the kid voice actors. Cuuuuute. And there’s hot dog plants and chompy plants and … and! It’s a neat way to explain homogenic and heterogenic / recessive and dominant genes. Also encourages a little critical thinking (I don’t have the right plants to get the combination the customer ordered, but if I breed these two together, and breed the resulting plant with the first plant … ).Unfortunately, Crazy Plant Shop has a couple of major problems. First, the UI is a little muddy. Tool tips or a more involved tutorial would be nice. For example, it’s not immediately clear you can choose what alleles a plant inherits. Second, and related, the game handles awkwardly. I swear I spent half my time wandering around and switching plants with plants. You have to pick up a plant to see its alleles. I do understand that you’ll never have enough pedestals to encourage that critical thinking again (do I need four plants to create all variations of this species? No, I just need two), but even if you narrow everything down to just what you need, the shelf space never stops feeling crowded and hard to organize.So, gimme more informative UI and plant-wrangling that doesn’t involve wandering back and forth, and this is fair fantastic science edutainment for youngsters.

												I bought this game just because I thought it included punnett/punnet squares and mendelian sampling. It does and it does so in a way that isn't hard to learn either. I even bought this game for my nieces to play. This game and it's developer bring relatively hard concepts, even for some of my collegues, to a basic level and introduces them to children; Or the children at heart. I'll be going into my third playthrough soon and I'm only on 14.8 total hours. I could run through this game pretty quickly, but then you'd be missing the story. The story is...decent, not great but decent. You are the proprieter of a plant shop and your landlord is Gregor Mendel. He makes you pay 10 bucks every night for rent. You have to make enough money to stay afloat while also trying to breed plants for customers orders. A third but optional objective is to ender the local flower show and move through the local, state, and national levels before trying to win at the worlds fair. These are all pretty easy as long as you have two heterozygous plants ready to breed for anything. The hard part is turning away people when you don't have enough (breeder) power to breed plants for a customers order. Eventually the game will realize you have a spare fauxglove and give you a customer who wants that specific plant and only one. Other times you just have to keep it for the night and try again tomorrow. I would strongly recommend this game for anyone who loves genetics to even the genetic outliers. (haha, that's a joke.) It will be hours of fun and it's not a game that you have to play for hours to get into, but you certainly can. Hats off to Filament for this one. Tl;DrGame can be very short, few hours.Not a hard game, but it's not supposed to be.Very fun,Glossary of terms if you get lost or don't know what something is.Can turn off music.			"

												Considering that it was two quid in the sale it's hard to really find fault with it. It's fun, but short. The genetics involved are basic two trait dom/recessive punnet squares. It kept me busy for a couple of hours. It feels like there could have been a pretty impressive indie game in there somewhere but it's just missing something. I don't know what exactly, but it needs something more to it. Then again... Two quid in the sale... :)			"

												I'll be frank, I am a little dissapointed  with this purchase.While it has all the right components to make a fine puzzle game, it still didn't work for me.Within a very small timeframe I found the ""recipe"" how to solve the game, and for the next hour I spend time doing chores to repeat the process in order to get the highest score I would be able to achieve.Then the game was over, and with no real reason to repeat this process,thats the one hour I had with this game.I can not say I would recommend this game to a child even, while the difficulty certainly fits the bill, I would still say that the game lack intuative puzzle solving,and is more about repeating chores once you figure out how it works.One final thumb up for execution, but the fundementals are still lacking, even for it's low price tag.

												Crazy Plant Shop is a really cozy and bright game. I fairly enjoyed it as a little break from the quick-pased action games.I really like the concept with breeding plants and having to pay attention to the dominant and reccesive genes, therefore having a biology aspect and could potentionally be used as a educational game.I do however find it rather sad that the amount of content is... well... limited. I'd love to see some more levels and plants; Like if you just started in a little shop, then slowly build your shop larger and larger. Unfortunately, there's only a very few expansions to your shop :/I was a big fan of the voiceacting though! Despite being rather boderline characters (Which you would expect from a game like this with no ongoing story and so) the voiceacting gave the characters life and made them more interesting and dynamic.Also really like the art style!

												The lack of fullscreen will put you off, but keep in mind - this is an educative game. If you want to know how to breed plants - you might want to look at this. If you already know about plant genes and traits - you might like this as well.			"

												Fun but very short. The game reccomends that you have two of each plant, displaying different traits. Once you realise you actually need two identical plants, with every catagory having a recessive and a dominant gene present, it becomes amazingly simple and prevents wasting resources by having to do multiple levels of breeding for some orders. (Especially the competition orders, which can ask for specific gene codes (Like having two dominants, rather than being a carrier for the recessive gene)The art style is cute and fun, and the game itself is very zen.

												I enjoyed playing this. It's a simple breeding game that would be wonderful to teach kids 10+ the basics of inheritance, and is fun to play even for adults.My only complaint is that it's awfully short. Once you have the basics down, it's simple to fill the requests and finish the game. That leaves pretty limited replayablity, unfortunately. I've played through it twice completely, and will probably not fire it up again.			"

												The first time I played through this game I didn't realize you could change the traits in the machine (even though they pointed it out in the tutorial I'm pretty sure I skipped over it the first time). It's a short game, 13 days in the shop total, but it teaches you about dominant and recessive genes in a cute way through plant traits. It would be good for kids interested in science. Or if you're a nerd and already know about this. One thing that I'd love to see that they don't have is an endless mode. I feel like it has limited replayability right now as the story line gets tiring. Though it is fun to get better with each playthrough.			"

												As said by earlier reviews this game is no more than 2 1/2 hours. Once you realize how to manipulate inheritance through what I call the ""gene box"" then the game becomes much more enjoyable. My only gripe is that you are really limited on how many times you can cross breed in a day even with all upgrades and I wish I had more store space. Hint: Customers will completely forget about plant types once you fill enough orders of that type so get ready to sell often once you survive that plant's popularity. Buy during a sale though.			"
