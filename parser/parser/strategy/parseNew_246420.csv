												I've played more of Kingdom Rush on my iPad than any other Tower Defense game I've ever played - It's absolutely fantastic.The one problem with the iOS version was that  (as is sadly standard for the platform) it had microtransactions - there was a store that let you buy consumables (for gold you earned in-game or purchased) to use in levels, as well as one-time purchases to unlock Hero characters. The Steam version fixes this, and has no DLC or microtransactions at all - all the heroes are included in the game, and it doesn't even have the consumables store anymore.The Steam version also includes a bunch of the bonus maps/mini-campaigns added in updates to the iOS version after launch, with the promise that the rest are coming soon in a free post-launch update that will also add a new bonus campaign exclusive to the steam version.My only small disappointment with the steam version so far is that there's no way (that I can tell) to add a keybind to call the next wave early. There does seem to be some sort of nonfunctional keybind-manager in the game launcher, so hopefully that's something they'll add soon. (UPDATE: This is no longer true - there's now a keybind for this!)Kingdom Rush is, in my opinion, the best TD game out there, and this Steam release is the definitive version. At $7.50 it's a steal (I can't tell you how many hours I've sunk into this game), and I strongly recommend it to anyone who even remotely enjoys TD games.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Kingdom Rush Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: Tower Defense; Strategy; Casual My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 12-25 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Casual gamersREVIEWKingdom Rush is one of the most delightful Tower Defense (TD) games I have ever played.  As far as game mechanics go, it is just another TD game with no real groundbreaking or innovative dynamics.  But something about the art style, the animations, and the soundscape create a nice blend that is undeniably charming.  This should be a welcome addition to any TD fan’s library.Like in all good TD games, the core gameplay is extremely addictive. Kingdom Rush is well-designed to be challenging, yet not needlessly frustrating.  The level design allows for creativity, but also limits your options enough so it isn’t a total chore trying to figure out what to do.  That said, as you get deep into the game, it can become quite a challenge to 3-star levels; but worst-case scenario you can find guides online to help you out.There aren’t really that many towers, in truth.  But there is just enough. And they are all diverse, fun to use, and are all useful at one point or another in the game.  I find many TD games with dozens of towers usually still can be beaten with only the best five, anyway.  Nevertheless, to make up for the relatively low amount of towers: there are twelve hero units each with different abilities.  Trying out the different heroes as you unlock them adds that bit of spicy variety to the game.  I feel it is only fair to point out: you can play the original version of the basic campaign for free on the many flash game websites out there… with microtransactions for some extra “premium” content.  The Steam version comes with all content included in the price, as well as a few extra expansion levels; and of course it comes with the benefit of the “meta-aspects” of any Steam game (Steam achievements, trading cards, screenshots, etc.). You can decide what is an acceptable price for this.  If you are an advocate of TD games and can pick up Kingdom Rush for a price you are comfortable with, then you absolutely should grab it and give it a go.   Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												Kingdom Rush is fantastic. I've played a lot of tower defense games over the years because it's one of my favorite genres (ever since it was invented on Starcraft/Warcraft custom maps), and this is right up there in the top 5 of all time. I first played it a couple months back on Android after it was featured in one of the Humble Bundles, and it is the only game out of that bunch I played for more than an hour or so. I literally would step away from my gaming PC once or twice a day to go lounge around with my phone and play this... It's that good. A lot of people are concerned about microtransactions in this game because that was the main way they made money from the mobile app, but the new PC version is completely different. You don't have to buy heroes, and the gem store -- which was still intact in the premium version I played on Android despite having all heroes included -- has been removed. So in addition to rebuilding the game with the Unity engine instead of porting the Flash version, they've re-balanced the difficulty of certain levels or challenges that used to be really difficult to complete without consumable power-ups. Don't be fooled by those complaining about the $10 price tag (or $7.50 currently, at launch). A free, outdated browser version or cheaper mobile app with microtransactions is not in anyway equivalent to the brand new PC version. You could play them as sort of a demo to try out the game and see if you like it, but then you should come back to Steam and buy the best and most complete version there is or will ever be. Ironhide Games has put a lot of work into making the game look good at high resolutions and of course the interface and controls have been updated to support the keyboard & mouse. New content updates are on the way (for free), and they're dedicated to quickly fixing bugs and refining features. I'm happy to support them for their efforts in bringing a great game to the greatest platform, and once you get a taste of this TD, I think you will be, too.			"

												I am quite fond of these games on Kongregate and similar sites...And that is at the same time my pet peeve.Kingdom Rush is one of those better and ejoyable flash games, and it's free.So how does it compute to 9 Euros on Steam?Frankly, it does not - It is the exact same game. No added features (that I can see from a quick look), the introduction level is exactly the same, the mechanics, everything.On the plus side, it runs flawlessly, whereas Flash Games are notorious for frame skipping and overall stuttery performance - after all, Flash was originally more or less a platform for animated advertising, not gaming.Being able to have the game run smoothly on fullscreen is very nice.Still, 9 Euros. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend it at this price.The game itself is a total blast, even challenging, also I just love Tower Defense games, and this is one of the more interesting ones.So, it's really up to you to dish out that kind of money for a game you can play for free off Steam.In fact, I suggest playing it on Kongregate or any other site that hosts the original version - see it as a complete, windowed Demo, to determine if you are OK with the price.TL:DR9 Euros for a game you can play for free is a joke.However, the game is just that good, I would gladly pay 5 for the smoother, fullscreen gameplay you get with this Steam version.Play the free version - if it grabs you, you may have found a very, very enjoyable Tower Defense game at ""entry level"", meaning the mechanics are quite simple to get in to, not too overwhelming for newbies to the genre, while at the same time challenging and interesting.Torn between my love for TD games, and Kingdom Rush specifically, and the fact that this is more or less the exact same version that is available anywhere for free, I still have to give ""Thumbs Up"".

												My favorite tower defense game of all time. It has literally everything you want in a TD. * Strategic depth - the ability to actually make choices that matter and having to rethink if your choices didn't work.* Increasing difficulty levels.* Extra challenges (heroic mode, iron mode).* Great music & sound effects.* Addictive gameplay.* Secrets - achievements - clickables. The game is available (not with all the levels, and not with the element of heroes) for free as a flash game. Some people may consider this a negative (amagad paying $10 for a game I can get for free?) but I consider it a positive - the free version is easily accessible, treat it as a demo or play it whilst waiting for this version to go on sale.Kingdom Rush on steam is 100% worth the cost for the amount of entertainment it will offer.

												I recently started playing this game and have found myself going to bed and dozing off thinking about this game while planning how to build better for my next map. The game can get intense and by that I mean am spamming all over the place so I do not leak, my hand spasms and I leak only to start swearing and restart the map! I have even woken up at 4am in the morning to play this game and pick up where I left off.What I like the most about this game is how simple it is yet difficult. What do I mean by that? The basics of building but knowing the best spots and when to upgrade are key points. Position is also another key factor but what also keeps me hooked is the cute and detailed visuals of this game. I can't fully take this game serious when its this cute but neither do I want to continue on to the next map with only 2 stars lolI would recommend this game for the casual gamer who is looking to pass time. You might lose track of time but that just means you are having fun right? Catch this game on sale for half the price on some sites or just buy it off steam because either way its worth the $10 bucks. I def see myself trying to complete this game and having many more clutch moments in this game hehe			"

												I have played the original android *sorry* [cracked] game and must say this is even better. 72 achievements to unlock, hours of gameplay. Buy this game and enjoy hours of fun if you didn't play it yet. I can't hide my excitement, This game is definitely my favourite from all the tower defenses out there. It has beautiful cartoon environment changing as the game proceed, great towers and enemies art and the soundtrack fits the atmosphere. You can finish every level at max of 3 stars with 2 additional mode scenarios with some extra challenge (can't use mage towers, upgrade max to lvl.2 etc.). There are also boss rounds. If u like tower defense games, here the game you must have and i highly recommend this one to get.- eargasm background music 10/10- gameplay 10/10- environment 10/10- secret and nonsense achievements 100/10			"

												Tower Defense is one of my favorite genres, and in my mind, nothing will ever beat Gemcraft, but Kingdom Rush is a very, very close second. There really isn't much to complain about here other than difficulty, but if you're asking me, it's a total plus. The main campaign maps are great and challenging and most people should be able to get through them, but the true test comes after you've completed them. The bonus content is phenomenal. There's more to winning than just sticking towers on the map. You must strategize, realize what types of enemies are coming from where and place your defenses accordingly - and sometimes, that isn't even enough. I can't praise the devs enough for their effort in this department. I've only got a few achievements left to grab, but I've enjoyed this game the entire way. Looking forward to more from these guys!			"

If you think I missed something in my review feel free to tell me  Kingdom Rush	A TD close to my heart Kingdom Rush can be used as an example of an ideal TD for some cases. I will add a TL;DR at the end. Gameplay	Kingdom Rush has 26 levels (well 78 if you count Iron and Heroics level variations), 68 different enemy types, 4 different types of towers with 2 specializations each, and contains 12 different heroes that will be unlocked as the campaign is completed. As you select each level you can read the description telling you the story of Kingdom Rush.  This game requires you to be smart with tower and hero placement alike unless you wish to be overwhelmed by the waves of enemies. You get to choose between 3 different difficulty levels to casually play or make every single movement and purchase count. The heroes are very well varied along with the towers and their specializations. Most likely to get a feel for the game it would be encouraged to go and play the flash version (much more limited but will show you the general game mechanic). Graphics/Sounds	Personally I love the artstyle of the Kingdom Rush franchise and it was a major contributor to making me first try it when it was first released. The art throughout the game on everything is very well done.The music is a bit adventurous, fitting with the game quite nicely. The sounds of towers when they upgrade specializations is a personal favourite with the little phrases heard.Pros/Cons	Pros	+ Beautiful Artstyle+ Very Strategical (later on)+ Tower variations, enemy variations, and hero variations+ Replayability Cons	- Weird glitch I found where when exiting you run into a screen with just KR banners everywhere- Hero reliance in certain areas (This is not for all people but for some being a problem)Final Thoughts	My time on steam is a lie, for I have also beaten Kingdom Rush on mobile and flash and still enjoyed it massively with beating it on steam again. Definitely a game I would say has to be tried if you like tower defense games. A personal favourite and I can't wait for the next in the series to hit Steam!!TL;DR	An amazing game that should be at least tried by anybody who likes tower defense games. A good amount of quality content and an amazing artstyle cam easily make this recommendable. To make sure this game is for you there exists a much more limited version on Kongregate (flash version) which can be used to grasp the general direction of the game before you decide if you would like the full and luscious package.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												Amazing TD game (easy to learn) even better on PC (IMO) I have played this game on IoS for quite some time even thouh i beat it. Its still a fun game to come back to. I prefer this PC version over the IoS in my free time at home due to no micro-trans. You can unlock every hero by just playn the game. This game does have more content that will be released from the looks of it. I also hope they have plans to add KR/Frontiers into this game or on steam. It's more than worth what you have to pay for this game. Plus you achievement junkies this is a game you could easily 100% just by play'n for a little while.			"

Due to that the playtime will be padded out with some bs waiting for enemies that will undoubtedly die.Overall8.5/10(Every game starts off at a 5/10 and the grade rises/lowers with the pros and cons that are present in the game)			"

												Kingdom Rush is definitely one of the most fun tower defense games I've played. There is a nice variety of tower upgrades and the enemies change up often enough to keep things interesting.  Maps, tower placement, varied paths, rally points, and the characteristics special to different types of towers and units give the player the opportunity to outwit the enemy with tactics rather than just by overwhelming enemies with sheer power.  Unlike the mobile versions, the Steam port has no microtransactions. All the heroes and upgrades are unlocked as you progress through the campaign. It also looks like the developer releases new content and campaigns here every few months, which in addition to the multiple challenge modes on each map gives a huge amount of gameplay. Also, finding the easter eggs is a lot of fun, and it's clear from those and the achievements that someone's got a sense of humor.This game wasn't even on my radar before I saw half my friends list pick it up during the summer sale, and I'm so glad I jumped on the bandwagon and grabbed it too.Now if I could just walk around without humming the music in my head...FREEDOM!

												Kingdom Rush is one of the better iOS ports on Steam. They've obliterated the microtransactions in the game and KR legitimately feels like a TD game for the PC.After completing the game in a little under 18 hours, here's what I think..Pro:- battle system is refreshing all the way to the end of the campaign- the various towers and specialties are introduced at a proper pace- the bonus stages offer adequate challenges (although a difficulty selector would be great)- game has absolutely no microtransaction gimmicks- the art is vibrant (dem colors man)Con:- the new units introduced in the bonus stages are not too special (they were predictable to an extent)- at one point, the units got stuck outside of the map and reduced frame rate by a lot (can be fixed with RoF)- rain of fire spam and hero usage make the game much easierOverall it's a good game. It needs more variety but that's a common issue with most TD games.I'm definitely looking forward to playing the new content once it's available for PC!			"

Posted: January 16, 2014
												This game was better when it was free.  I don't say that because 'free is always better,'  no, I mean when the game was free it was engineered in subtle, but noticably different ways then this version for the PC.  I see all these glittering reviews, claiming this is the best TD evar.  Really?  Which version where these people playing?  The free version they've played to death, or the PC version that has a load of problems?  I've played the free version ( the one that had locked premium content ) on PC, and it's the superior version.  Why?  One : Hero units.  The game needed to be rebalanced for the hero units, and they added mechanics that honestly, weren't needed.  The free version was engineered in a way that you -didn't need hero units to play the game -AND- win-  I could beat the game without a hero in the orgininal, now I need to.  Got some issues there, because the enemies are buffed up to make up for the heroes simply existing.   Not only that, but the melee heroes are pointless.  Utterly, and completely, pointless.  If you didn't swap out to a ranged type hero when the flying units started showing up, then the exploding demon type enemies will have pointed out how useless they are.   And, on top of that, the ranged heroes have a plethora of abilities that are just synergize better with the towers : Abilities that slow, waylay, or simply stop an enemy for the towers to wittle down.Two : Complete reliance on acing levels to have the necesary upgrades to succede later in the game.  Now, it's no big secret that beating level one means you can play level two.  Here, though, you -need- to ace level one, so that you can have the upgrades that will make the game 'easier' later on.  If you simply beat each level, say getting one or two stars a pop, the game is significantly ( and un-neccesarily ) more difficult later on.  Because that makes sense, right?   And in some cases, you need to do the challenges to get more stars to... you guessed it... have the neccesary upgrades to have a better chance of beating the game.  So what's the magic solution?  Repeatitive game play forcing the player to redo earlier missions over and over again in the hope of acing the level so that you get the upgrade points you -NEED- by the end of the game.Three : Problems with upgrades.  Specifically, if I try to do a challenge level, it takes upgrades away.  Towers cost full price, or don't have the buffs you spent so much time earning.  Why is that?  Isn't the challenge hard enough already?  'No hero.'  Okay, get that.  'No barracks, no hero.'  Okay... I'd... kind  of like to have the buffs I earned.  And honestly, I don't know if the upgrades even matter in the long run.  Do the top tier upgrades even function?  It'd be nice if there was an indicator that the top tier 'chance for double damage' arrow talent was working, an exclamation point over an enemies head if they take double damage would be nice.  'Spiked Armor?'  Does it even work?  I can't even tell!Four : What I'd like to call 'The Korean Problem.' Now, you all know the meme 'Koreans play video games better.'  This game falls prey to this, as a in the last third of the game ( and the bonus content ) are incredibly difficult, requiring precise tower placement, upgrade, and unit movement.  In fact, I have no clue how in the heck you beat the swamp level.  The boss wave is ludricrous!  How is swarming the lanes with enormous amounts of enemies supposed to be 'challenging?'  This just tells me there's -one- way to place and upgrade the towers in many of these levels.  -One-  How is that supposed to be 'fun?'    Any answer that revolves around 'look it up online'  means the game is an utter failure.  I've played far better TD's that offered challenging experiences -and- allowed for more freedom in tower placement.  Bottom line, this game isn't worth 10 dollars.  It isn't even worth 5 dollars.  I could play the game for free, and have far more fun, and not need the heroes or bonus content.  I feel ripped off.  And if you bought this game on Steam you've been ripped off too.Oh.  And PS ~ For anyone that wants to leave a comment about the review, please spare me the subjective stand point of how much you loved the game.  Subjective means 'opinion' and everyone's got one.  Objective statements, on the other hand, are not opinionated in anyway.  If you want to leave a comment, then do so, but at least try to have a better leg to stand on then 'oh, poor you, you couldn't beat it?  you must have been stupid'  Because that's a great way to start a conversation right?

												Kingdom Rush (KR) is a really fun and well-made tower defense game. I have already finished the game at 100%, 43hrs of fun, totally worth full price: 9.5/10 ¡Awesome!In KR you'll manage only 4 type of towers, but these towers have very good upgrades, so you'll have to decide which upgrade is better for your situation in-game, by the way, you can sell the towers but you get a penalty receiving less money. Here a little explanation of the towers without upgrades just with their regular properties:Magic tower: slow shooter, mid damage, some enemies can have magic armor; However those enemies would be weak against other towers due they don't have regular armor.Arches tower: really fast shooter, low damage, a bad option if your enemies has regular armor.Explosives tower: slow shooter, massive-group damage, enemies who has regular armor present more resistence.Soldiers tower: this tower works like a wall due his purpose is to hold enemies in middle of the tower's fire. The tower will bring 3 soldiers to the ground to fight hand-to-hand against the opponents.Also you'll have the opportunity to select a hero (my favorite is Thor), the hero can run around all the map, he is very important to give a better resistence against stronger enemies or bosses. At the beginning of the map the hero is level 1, so, you need to put him in fight to level up (max level 10), each level he will earn more health, damage and special movements/attacks. I would resume 3 types of heros:Shooter hero, great for long distance but very weak against face-to-face fights.Some heros can only fight hand-to-hand, these ones are my favorites because it works like a wall vs big guys.There is some balanced heros that can shoot and have a decent resistence in ground fight.To complete, you are not going to be just like an observer waiting for money to get towers upgrades and moving your hero, also as player you will have 2 attacks; in the first one you can put 2 extra soldiers in the ground perfect to fight and to slow down enemies in middle of tower's fire, get reset very fast every certain time. The second is a meteorite attack that works like bombs, really slow to reset however perfect for emergencies.The first levels are kind easy for the obvious reason to you have to learn how does work and you need to upgrade your properties step by step.  But after that, especially the extra levels of the main campaing are amazing, very challenging. With that said you'll not only have extra levels, also you will get two extra challenges in every single map including the extra levels. So, be prepare to reset some maps or challenges like 5-10 times.The enemies? Don't worry about it, you'll face like 70 (maybe more?) different types of enemies.Regularly I don't like games with cartoon graphics-animations, but I decided to give it a try because it was already in my steam library, honestly I do not remember how I got this videogame but I think it was some of those $1 purchase just for the steam trading cards. I'm here to say if you don't like this kind of graphics, you should forget that and just give it a try. I'm a tower defense lover and this little videogame it's really really cool and easily worth the full price. 43hrs of fun.The only down side in my opinion, and that's why I gave 9.5/10 rate and no 10/10, is that you have to put the towers in pre-designed locations. I would like to resolve for myself the extra little puzzle of find the best locations.9.5/10. ¡Awesome!			"

 Such a very good Tower Defence	I'm not a fan of this type of games but this one is so nice.  The hero concept is very useful The different towers and the way they improve is awesome, allowing you to do a thousand combinations and strategies  You have to stop the enemy units to prevent then to get the portal (Because a lot of them just dodge your units), this make the game a little harder but it's cool.  The art work is beautiful  This game has a lot of funny references  Such a very good game for a low price (I got it for a dollar and worth every penny)  Those hidden achievements <3Hundred hours of playing and frustration are waiting for you!

												I am a huge tower defense game fan, and for this reason became a member of the Kongregate game website years ago because of its variety of quality tower defense titles. While the Protector series of tower defense games remains my favorite, Kingdom Rush is one of the highest quality games in the genre you can find. It remains a classic of the genre much like GemCraft and even the Bloons series because more than anything else, it emphasizes fun and strategy.Kingdom Rush is highly colorful and has dashes of humor, and is an absolute joy to play. You will make your way through a light-hearted campaign, collecting stars from levels (awarded based on how well you do in each level) to unlock upgrades. There are way more stars available to collect here than you will need, keeping frustration low if you cannot ace a particular level due to the fact that you can simply collect stars from other levels. Some levels are very easy or fairly simple, while others are a challenge and can have you repeating them using different strategies until you finally surpass them.Towers have multiple upgrade paths that add to the strategy of the map depending on the routes you choose. You can also bring heros along on the regular campaign missions out of your pick of twelve (unlockable through the campaign) that can move freely on the map and can move throughout the waves to where she/he is needed. After beating the campaign, you gain access to a few more maps that you can play. It also deserves mentioning that after beating each campaign level, you can try out two different modes of play on that level to earn additional stars (these modes are more challenging and have different rules).My only complaint about the game is that it is so short. Depending on your skill level, difficulty level, and whether or not you are interested in the additional modes, you can beat the campaign in a number of hours (it took me a little less than ten). Because Kingdom Rush is currently $9.99 full price, I think this still makes it a good deal dollar-per-hour-of-gameplay wise, as I have not beaten all the levels with the additional modes selected. Completionists can expect to get dozens of hours out of the game, and the replay value here is sky high. After beating the game, it remains fun and diverse enough to warrant additional playthroughs down the line. Unfortunately, Kingdom Rush is just so fantastic and fun, that regardless of how much content it offered, it may never have felt like ""enough."" I suppose that's a good problem to have.For tower defense fans like myself who don't agree that tower defense is overdone and will play any game in the genre, this game is one of the best. For those who aren't normally fans of the genre, this is one of the few that you will most likely enjoy. Kingdom Rush is one of the pinnacles of the tower defense genre and I would recommend it to all fans of casual strategy games.			"

												Incredibly enjoyable game. Great tower defense, various enemies, many buildings and upgrades, lots of levels and most importantly, lots of fun. It's challenging, yet not ridiculously hard, engaging and addictive. The only downside? Selling buildings is very easy and it doesn't require confirmation, which means you are very likely to accidentally sell one of your (probably best) buildings while clicking fast to upgrade it. And you can't take it back. Still, this game is definitely worth the full price.			"

												This is hands-down my favorite Tower defence game of all time; and that's saying a lot. I first played this game in 2011 when it was first published as a free-to-play browser game, and my how it's aged well. The grapihcs have a style all their own that seperates it from the rest, and the lines, voice acting, and personality give this game vast character to rival mainstream games. Gameplay is as sleek as it comes, due to 3 years in development before moving to steam through the greenlight program. I can and have spent hours before completing the whole game for every star and achievement, and I look forward to doing it again. I cannot fully describe the quality this game brings to the tower defence genere, but I can recommned that it must be at least tried on the online version at least before a full purchase, the full game comes through steam of course and has many more bonus levels that the online doesn't have, plus full hero capatibility and the tech/upgrade tree. I highly recommend it to everyone even slightly interested in the strategy genere, because this game is a gem I will never forget. Now then, i'm off to go beat Vez'nan in the Iron Challenge! Enjoy! 5.2 / 5    (Not Joking)			"

												Good grief, I had 90% the mobile version and just realize I've logged 206 hours on the Steam version over an embarassingly short time period.It's happy. I don't know how else to put it. I loath phone/tablet gaming, so I found myself flicking rapidly from one title to the next, downloading, playing, deleting... I tripped over KR (the kids at Ironhide made it free once the sequals came out), and it's the first mobile game that I didn't delete... purchased :Frontiers and :Origins also.it's quick enough to just plop down and play for a bit, but has enough tactical depth to make you want to *continue* playing for more bits. I adore the art style (the ""Minish Cap"" Esque art was the first draw for me, to be honest. HAH! ""Draw""... see what I did there?). The cheerful little cartoon world is a place I'd like to visit... hell, I wrote a review here:https://juxsgaming.wordpress.com/what-have-i-done/ "

												I don't often play tower defense games but when I do, I play Kingdom Rush.Polished to the max, it doesn't get much better than this. Graphics are candy-like, controls are good and responsive. AI makes little stupidities now and then but the majority of the time it behaves decently. Difficulty level is balanced well even for a novice like me. So yeah, would recommend, even if you generally dislike the tower defense genre like me. Maybe you, too, will be pleasantly surprised.

With over 78 levels to complete and master, Kingdom Rush remains a solid tower defense strategy game that is offered at a more than fair price. Challenge your ability to think and plan ahead whilst also maintaining a degree of entertainment and fun.---------------------------------------------------------I started off playing Kingdom Rush as a casual joke: as you can probably tell, it quickly evolved beyond that. With a little over 43 hours under my belt, you can be certain that you're receiving the most bang for your buck.GameplayStrategise and defend you way through a series of waves; protect your kingdom from armies of enemies whom are hellbent on dismanting all your work. Test your skills by overcoming the casual, iron, and heroic challenges: show your skills by becoming the best Kingdom Defender that you can be.---------------------------------------------------------Pros+ Numerous amounts of heroes that you can utilise to defend your kingdom+ Vast customizability of your defense system: ranges from different towers to useful skill trees and boosts+ Achievements are a fun challenge to get and really enhance gameplay as a result; they challenge you to plan in ways you never though possible+ Offers various levels of challenges: casual, iron, and heroic challenges each differ in their level of skill requirements, obviously randing from very easy to difficult. This does not, however, impede on a gamer's overall enjoyment of the game+ As with most tower defense games, the graphics are cartoony and cute. What makes the sprites from Kingdom Rush stand out though? I can't quite pinpoint it, but there's something about the animated trolls, orcs, demons, and werewolves that just seem uniqueNeutral± Replayability value is high, however it is repetitive. It is good for those who enjoy a familiar gameplay at the end of the night, but not so great for those whom prefer variationCons- In my opinion, it would be nice to have an online endless mode where you could compete with other Kingdom Defenders- Honestly, I have no real complaint besides the above and teh fact that there are a few bugs and glitches; they only happen very rarely so it almost seems insignificant to mention. Let's just say... don't overload the arena with many ""moves""---------------------------------------------------------If you're looking for a decent tower defense game that has withstood some platform upgrades successfully (phone to computer), then this game is a great contender and worthy of a spot in your Steam library. Give it a try and you will quickly find out why this game has an overwhelming fan base and an ""overwhelmingly postive"" rating. It truly deserves it.Overall9.5/10---------------------------------------------------------Like my review or have any questions? Then please consider joining my review group, the Sonny Report! I will keep it up to date with the games that I plan on reviewing and will also accept suggestions.			"

												There have been a lot of Tower Defense Games over the past years. Be it games that follow the classic ""watch your towers destroy a ton of enemies""-formula, like the Defense Grid series or Super Sanctum TD, while others tried to get the player more involved, like Orcs Must Die and it's Tower Defense/Third Person Shooter Hybrid gameplay or the Sanctum series that mixed TD with First Person Shooter and an emphasis on Coop. Kingdom Rush is your classic Tower Defense game, where you watch the landscape from above, place your towers, upgrade them and hopefully put them on spots so all the evil monsters don't reach the Exit. The game is set in a Fantasy Kingdom (so expect anything from Spiders to Gnomes to Ogres and Knights) as enemies) that is presented in a cute, comic art style and features a lot of humor with tons of references to movies like Army of Darkness (the mages in their tower quote „Klaatu Barada Nikto“) and during fights there are little text bubbles with words like ""Pow"", basically taken straight from 1966 Batman series. It's charming and thankfully not overdone. On your journey, that leads you through forest areas and snow landscapes, you get coins by beating the missions which you can invest to upgrade the Towers, the Knights and your Spells. Unlike other games in the genre, Kingdom Rush is a bit limited in it's towers. You only get 4: The Archer Tower, the Barracks, the Magic Tower and the Artillery but it's enough and you can not only upgrade those up to Level 3 but also turn them into specialised towers. For example the Archer Tower can later on changed into a Musketeer Garrison or the Ranger Hideout, both of them have their advantages and disadvantages, so there is a learning curve in this game ot find out how the upgrades are and what works best in each mission. Next to that are the spells. These can be activated and then have a cooldown. One is the reinforcements which spawns 2 pretty weak fighters but the cooldown is short and the other is Rain of Fire which, after you selected the target area, sends down a couple meteors. And the last thing at your disposal for defense are the Heroes. You unlock them one by one by playing the Campaign and they are different in their type (like a Paladin, an Archer or Thor) and their abilities. You can send them around the map but they're best used right at the exit to kill any enemy that might gotten through your defense lines. The game is fun and as expected, thanks to all the upgradable towers and the Heroes highly addicitive. The only criticism i can bring is the missing endless mode which is something that should be here since it's a standard game mode in Tower Defense and the music is a bit on the boring side, it's not bad but it doesn't stand out either.All in all i just can highly recommend this game to every fan of the genre.

												This is a very fun game! probably the best Tower defense i have played in a long while.All you do in this game is place tower's and defenses and do not let a single baddie through. You get heroes along the way, also you get to upgrade your 'perks' to make the game either smoother for you or challenging. Placing these towers and defense posts can never be more scary as each placement may either favor you or screw you, so be aware of the surroudings each map. You can go through the game again or a particular level again with all of your upgrades in tow so while it maybe consider cheating in some small aspect, honestly it will make the level less frustrating and more fun to enjoy.Recommend!

												Kingdom Rush is a Tower Defense game. (arches ready !!!)It's a fairly standard tower defense game.But you will soon find that it is very challenging.The game offers you a standard and funny story line.In addition, the game offers various extra challenge levels for advanced players among us.In short, for many hours of fun.The extra this game haves is the opportunity to choose a hero character and use & control it in the game.Find it extra addition because you get more freedom than just make towers.Obviously towers also get a lot of upgrades to change the battle.Only downside I can find is that there is no steam cloud is present.Think it is a very nice concept and gives it a 9/10.

												I played the free version of this and often returned to it every few months because I enjoyed it so much. I questioned why buy this one when there is a free version but I still kept an eye on it never the less.I actually prefer this version. There is no pay-wall unlike the free version. Hero's don't  need to be paid for, you don't have to pay for extra levels. Everything is here all at once, all you need to do is unlock them by playing the game.The extra levels are a wonderful challenge and happy to finally play them.- Super fun- More levels- More achievments- ReplayabilityYes, even if you done all the challenges, it is fun to go back and try different towers & heros to beat the level. See if you can find a layout that works better than others or gives you a struggling challenge.I say get this version if you enjoy the free one. Not just for the bonus levels and extra content but also to support the developers for bringing us a loveable game with charm.This game has been loved for years so I don't mind giving a few pocket-change to support them.

												Kingdom Rush is a true gem of a Tower Defense (TD) game, and probably one of the best examples of this genre, a game that never get old in my opinion. The original game (flash-web version) was first released in 2011 and became a big hit on Armor Games real fast, and later on Kongregate too. I played both KR Flash web version and had a blast. Steam version, although still not perfect, but really amazing and I have to say its one of the best TD games out there.What new of this Steam ver. compared with the free web ver.?- Better graphics, the art looks very nice and clean.- More stages.- More achievements.- All hero units unlocked (on the web ver. or mobile ver., you have to pay for heroes/premium extras, and it was quite expensive if I remember correctly).Back to the game:The good+ Amazing animations, the artwork is fantastic, charming and colorful.+ The gameplay is not too complicated, not too easy either, but strategic enough for players to really sink their teeth into.+ Plenty of funny achievements to discover beside playing the main game.+ I've put nearly 40 hours into the game so far and have not encountered a single bug or glitch, it runs smooth without any problem.+ About the price, you can get the game really cheap in bundles.The bad- There is no fast-forwarding option and the game felt a bit slow.- Can't let the battle in-game running in the background: There are stages I played few times (just to collect achievements), although I feel quite confident with my strategy and just want to do something else on my computer while still lets the battle running, but no, I can't, whenever Alt Tab or change to other windows, the game automatically stop.ConclusionWhat can I say more? Of course I highly recommend this game to everyone that loves TD genre.			"

												Kingdom Rush has cute graphics, as many tower defence games do. On first sight, I wasn't sure I liked the tiny sprites, but I soon started to love them. A lot of screen-space is given over to inert scenery, which seems wasteful, but I think it is down to the origins of the game on mobile phones and tablets. You need plenty of space when you're poking your finger at a tiny screen. I can vouch for this, having now played 'Kingdom Rush: Frontiers' on my phone. Fortunately, there is no 'pay to win' in the Steam version of Kingdom Rush.The game is tongue-in-cheek fantasy, with all the cliches you'd expect. The hero characters include a mine-planting dwarf, an overweight king on a sedan chair who throws food and drink, an ice queen, and a gnome riding a pair of robotic legs with buzz-saw arms. Just because it looks cartoony, don't think this game is a push-over. Even on casual, beyond the first third of the game, the levels are quite challenging and require you to adopt an appropriate strategy. Your tower building exploits are enhanced by upgrades that you earn, which can be freely redistributed. You also get to choose which hero to use on each level, which can make the difference between a successful outcome and abject failure. Another key skill is calling in waves of enemies early, for which you are rewarded with a few coins towards your building costs and a reduced spell cool-down.Overall, this game is very good fun and full of humorous characters. It's the best TD game I've played after Defense Grid 1&2.			"

												Kingdom Rush is one of the most fun tower defense titles I've ever played. It has charming, cartoony graphics and the addictive gameplay we've come to know from games as Defense Grid and Pixeljunk Monsters. It isn't a big game, the main game exists of 'only' 12 levels, but there are several bonus levels to be unlocked for those that can't get enough of it. These bonus levels are actually quite tough, let me tell you. I had to retry them multiple times and still wasn't able to finish any of them.Anyway, there are also heroes to be unlocked and, thankfully, these are all very different from each other. Switching between them makes the levels less repetitive and makes them more fresh, even though nothing has changed. The hero can make the difference between victory and defeat and is a must if you want to finish the levels without making any mistake.Of course, using your buildings wisely and upgrading them as you go is just as important. The tower upgrades are done in a fun and exciting way; upgrading eventually allows you to make a choice between one of two towers. So, for example, an artillery tower can be upgraded to a tesla tower or a missile tower. After that you can start upgrading the skills of these towers, so you can upgrade it to have a bigger blast radius, things like that. Very well done.Kingdom Rush wouldn't be a proper tower defense game if it didn't have boss fights and luckily for us, there are several bosses to be slain during the game. They're usually slow enough to kill them before they enter the base, except for maybe the last boss, which I won't spoil here.Additionally, the game has a few fun easter eggs/achievements that can be found by clicking on random things like a fish in the sea. It has no use or anything, but it's cute nevertheless.I think I've told you pretty much everything there is to tell about Kingdom Rush by now. Kingdom Rush is a brilliant game that needs all of our support. Like, right now. Go get it ![Rating: 87/100]			"

												Kingdom Rush is one of the best tower defense strategy games out there that is only let down by the lack of truly strategic tower commands. The Good:+ Excellent graphics+ Linear game-play with RPG-esque progression+ Hours of game-play+ Difficult (could be considered a con, see below) + (new!) Difficulty level can be adjustedThe Bad:- Very short campaign, I'd personally prefer a longer campaign and fewer side missions- No real tactical control over towers compared to Defender's Quest- Cannot view enemy/tower documentation while playingKingdom Rush is a tablet ported tower defense game set in a medieval high fantasy world. Like most tower defense games you are given a puzzle-like map stage and have to build towers along the enemy's predefined path in an attempt to obstruct said enemy as they pass through. Overall it's a good looking game with a fair sense of progression; as you play stages you are awarded stars which allow you to unlock new perks which upgrade the performance of just about every aspect of your defenses. Kingdoms Rush also allows you to pick from a pool of heroes, each with different statics and abilities to utilize in each stage. Some stages will necessitate a ranged hero, in others a melee hero is optimal. Who you choose for what stage can impact the overall difficulty of the level. In my opinion all these variables add to the overall strategy of the game but I feel that additional depth is needed. The game lacks a certain finesse that I've seen in other tower defense games; notably the ability to tell each tower which type of enemy units to target. Maybe I want my mage to target only the strongest enemies and leave the weak units for my archers. Maybe I want my soldiers to spread out so as to block as much of the path as possible instead of all ganging up on one enemy while all the other enemies walk on by just as happy as you please. Maybe I'd like my artillery to target the enemy units nearest their spawn point for better collateral damage instead of always targeting that one loner way up front. Well in Kingdom Rush you can't, you are left at the mercy of the AI which has caused me to restart stages more often than I'd like to admit. The campaign story is no Shakespeare but it gets the job done.... until it ends when you are 33% done with the game. Heck, I figured I must have at least another half dozen or more stages to go yet when the credits started rolling. Apparently the remainder 66% of the game tasks you with individual stages which are hard (in contrast to the campaign stages). For some perspective: it took me one try on all but the final stage of the campaign to get through those stages with at least one star. Stages following the campaign require repeated playthroughs just to get that one star and often stages are large enough to last a good half hour. It's a very time consuming trial and error process during which your interest in the game continually ebbs due to a lack of passive progression even through failure. Another facet I bemoaned is the lack of accessible documentation while in-game. When on the campaign map you can access a bevy of useful information about different enemies/towers in the game and what their stats are but it's only accessible from the campaign map, nowhere else, especially not during a stage when such information can really come in handy.Overall I enjoyed this game - polished graphics and linear story are just long enough for you to grab your Steam trading cards and scram. Some players may appreciate the brutal challenge later levels present but there are those of us who play causally and I, for one, am delighted the devs added a difficulty setting post release.			"

												Hmmm...where to start on my first review? Well let's start by saying Kingdom Rush is genuinely one of the most addictive, fun and somewhat challenging Tower defense games around. At first glance the cartoony visuals, vibrant music and set place building positions give off a casual vibe.  Whilst the original campaign is not all that challenging and seems more like a warm up! The real test comes in the excellent after campaign missions. As well as expanding on the universe and adding some back story the after campaign missions provide new enemies, boss fights and new level layouts. These new missions provide a lot more challengethan the standard campaign and thats where the game really starts to shine. Careless tower placement can cause even the most expensive set up to fail which will see the hordes of enemies running right through you.In short Kingdsom Rush provides an excellent alernative to the likes of Pixeljunk Monsters. It may not be the deepest Tower Defense game on the market but in terms of addictveness it's hard not to place this game near the top.			"

												Grapics:-Not pixelated-Oldish7/10Sound/Music:-Music is fricking awesome-Phrases for towers and heros get old quick8/10Combat:-Tower Defense is my favorite kind of combat and is done well for the game-The heros is a good add to the game making it not easier to beat the level, but interesting-However the heros lack character, they seem like the same generic character, the only difference is stats and look, which is all you really need, but still.-The upgrades for each tower are great.  Once you level them up to 3, you have a choice between to upgrading paths, and they have different abilities.-The towers are, Barracks, Archer Tower, Dwarven Bombard, and Mage Tower and they work very well, even though there's only 4 different towers, they play it off very well.8.5/10Difficulty:-It can be very hard at times, never in the beginning but once you beat the campaign and get additional levels, those are very hard-The villians are strange, some are harder to beat than others, but why do some of the easier ones come up later in the game? Like the Giant Rats, they are easy and the Skeletons are harder to beat, yet it takes a couple more levels to get to7/10Story:-The story is that there's this bad guy who wants the kingdom and you have to stop his forces using the king's, at one point you get to use the king to win the main campaign.-It's not that important to know the story but it's still informational8/10The rating for this game is a 7.7/10, I would definitly reccomend this to anyone that wants a good game for a long car ride, or just a good old tower defense game.

												This one ... is one of the best tower defence game I ever play. I was looking for this game a long time to came to STEAM from independence studio. I was playing this game a long time ago as an flash version ... and even that time this game was one of the best.Game is great mix of tower defence game and hero RPG. You can XP your hero inside battlefield up to level 10 and also each hero got their own special abilities. There is a system of buildings upgrades (like better sniper shots, or poison arrows, and other stuff) and spell upgrade (battle spells ... like meteor or patriots).Game difficulty (hard as usual) is pretty fine and sometime can be really hard even in base game system. Game also provides to ""hard core"" players a few more difficulty levels on each one of base levels as it is ... HEROIC ... game difficulty on each level provides to player some more ""restrictions"" on each of battlefields (for example you cannot use hero, or use only archer buildings, ...). And of course there is another ""BLOOD HARD CORE"" level on each battlefield ... and this one is called an ... IRON ... game difficulty level, that restricted you abilities even more.Game is pretty hard so its better to find somethin easier for the kids and let adults beat this one for them.Game is also a time eater ... more then week of gaming to beat this to be sure (I mean HARD settings and also HEROIC and IRON stages).Worth any money (best in sale) ... one of the best tower defence games I ever play.+ graphics+ levels difficulty+ RPG elements+ mechanics+ HEROIC + IRON stage+ heroes+ side skills (meteor, villagers)+ BIG PICTURE (controller support)- ?Graphics: 6/10Sounds/Music : 6/10Mechanics: 6/10Idea: 5/10Story : 3/10Addicting: 9/10----------------------Verdict: 8/10			"

												Recommended at $5 or less.While Kingdom Rush is a fun tower defense game, it also stretches out game time played by not allowing any kind of revert to checkpoint system. It is common to play 20 minutes on a level, only to lose on the last wave because you were unaware what was coming, then you have to replay that entire 20 minutes in order to try again the part you didn't pass. Fail again, spend another 20 minutes getting back to that point.I have almost 50 hours played, of which 25 is probably replaying the same thing I did over and over to finish a last wave. This part of the game is NOT fun.However, the art and gameplay otherwise are good, just not $20 good. "

												This here is a charming little flash-based TD/RPG/RTS (Plants vs Zombies? Fieldrunners? Sanctum? Yup.) that is essentually a brutal, strategic behemoth of a game wrapped in a pretty package, so don't be fooled by its cartoony visuals and somewhat ""kiddy"" approach to fantasy. Much like Reus, it may look fairly simple at first, but gradually increases in complexity as you progress, making you pull at your hair in frustration as you suffer a loss, all thanks to that one teeny mistake where you conjure a fire rain on the wrong goblin and everything goes to hell from there. Wow, the irony.If you're still not sure what exactly you're paying for, try it out for free here[armorgames.com] (I played the bejeezus out of it on armorgames.com). The reason why it's priced at 7 bucks here is due to the fact that the game was originally littered with microtransactions, but here you get everything already unlocked in a single package, including extra features, heroes, campaigns and what have you, all at glorious 1080p. Also pretty, pretty artwork, which is always a big plus.All in all, an excellent boredom buster and a great addition to your TD collection, if you're a commited Tower Defense nut like me. Or if you're into zapping orcs with lightning. There's never enough orc massacre. 'Cause Orcs Must Die™ and all that humbug.			"

												Most Tower Defenses (and a lot of other genres, really) can be easily slotted into one of two categories: Sci-Fi and Fantasy. Defense Grid was probably the definitive example of the former, while Kingdom Rush is one for the latter. The evil overlord Vez'nan has summoned a horde of evil to conquer the land, ranging from simple goblins and bandits to the legions of hell. You're a nameless commander that has to take charge of the kingdom's forces to fight them all off.It's a bit simplified compared to Defense Grid, especially at first. Enemies are trying to get to the end of the map, and travel on paths you can't alter. You also only have four main towers: Archers which shoot quickly for low damage and are good against enemies resistant to magic, Mages which shot slower for larger damage and can pierce armor, Barracks that release units who block and attack ground enemies, and Bombarders which deal area damage. As you go through the game though, you unlock two unique upgrades to each you can select after their third level. Archers for example, can become Rangers, which shoot even quicker and can be upgraded to poison and paralyze enemies, or Musketeers, which trade speed for better damage, minor area damage, and a chance to kill any enemy in one shot. A lot of combinations of them are quite useful.The game gives you plenty of chances to see that, too, as in addition to the usual three stars for doing them perfect each level has a Heroic and Iron mode, which reward one each. Heroic restricts you to a certain level of the general upgrades (which you get by paying stars) and typically disallows the Hero units, while giving you only one life for the whole stage. Iron takes it a step further by restricting your towers, and having enemies come in one continuous wave. These range from simple, to tricky, to quite difficult.I should note that this is one game you can technically get for free on Kongregate, or on mobile. The Steam port just contains everything that's Premium Content in those versions, and apparently at a lower cost; this includes a number of stages unlocked after the main campaign, and a few hero units you wouldn't get ordinarily. I got it for two-fifty a few Steam Sales back, which seems more than fair to me (plus there's also a current bundle where you can get it for barely more), but you could use those free versions to see if it's the kind of game you'd throw money at to own. It doesn't have quite as much content as Defense Grid, but there's still a lot of fun to be had.			"

												This is one of the more difficult tower defense games. By the third map the difficulty ramps up and you'll find yourself trying new tactics to complete it. There's typically a thin line between how much gold you have and what gold you need to build or upgrade towers. Very few times during the game will you have a surplus of goal to spend on anything so you need to constatly be choosing wisely and as soon as gold is available.Unlike other tower defense games you have a hero to control on the screen. There are a variety of heroes you'll unlock as the game goes on and each have different strengths/weaknesses with their special powers. You'll also level them up when you play so even if you lose a map you'll typically gain a few points you can put in to improve your hero. And that can often lead to weather you win/lose a map.Lots of a replayability to the game. Each map has 3 different difficulty levels. Depending on the map the higher difficulties may mean you can't use heroes on that map anymore or are unable to use certain towers. So you sometimes have to throw away tactics you used in the past to win and this in turn can help you in future maps.Games graphics, sound, and music are fantastic across the board. No complaints with anything along those lines.If you find yourself enjoying this then there is also Kingdom Rush Frontiers which is more of the same with new maps, heroes, and some new upgradable tower types.

												 Like many others of its kind, Kingdom Rush is a td to its very core. There are not many tricks or gimmicks presented throughout the game, beyond building your towers, seeing how your solution pans out and readjusting said plan. The games progression comes in several forms. There are passive skills, tower unlocks, hero unlocks, new enemies, new armour types and more lanes. Pretty standard fare overall. At its bare bones, this game is both functional and enjoyable.  Though it comes with flaws. I should preface this by saying that this game is a td, balance and design are key to an enjoyable experience for the player. As you progress through the game, you'll get a new tower type or hero that will assist you on the current map, and will carry over to the next. With a level that is designed to be tackled with a specific tower or hero, this can conflict with the out of level passive trees. Each tree has a power curve that can potentially ruin or improve your experience. If you don't know what the level is you're facing, you can enter with entirely the wrong tree for the task at hand. If the game presented on the level selection screen information as to what the player both unlocks and will face, there would be no arbitrary difficulty added. The passive tree's are not made equal. Some tree's add exhorbitantly more damage than others in all situations. The militia tree is particularly strong compared to its counterparts and comes with no real flaws or weaknesses. Without this tree being at max level the game can feel a little harder than it needs to be, increasing to downright impossible on some levels. Towers as well have balancing and design problems. Some towers are just functionally better than others for all situations once unlocked. One comparison in particular is the difference between barbarians and paladins. Barbarians are meant to deal large amounts of damage in return for being very easy to kill. Instead their paladin counterparts take twice as much damage, deal more damage as a result and have a reliable AoE. The ranger tower for example does more damage per second in an area of effect than its counterpart the musket tower which albeit has a different design path. Intended to assassinate larger targets, instead it will frequently shoot fodder instead. Being unable to control towers, to make them do what you intended them to do can be frustrating as well. Far too often the ranger tower will apply its poison on the same unit multiple times before switching, or paladins will completely ignore enemies a few feet away. This leads to an unnecessary frustrating experience as the game requires more precision and planning in later stages. Heros as well are not cut from the same cloth. Some heros skills are just not helpful. Why would you wish to lock one enemy down for an extended period when you can cc several at a time or outright assassinate one or more enemies. The majority of heros are just plain weaker compared to the exceptional few who excel at the roles provided for them. While these problems exist the game is still fun once you find what works. The game really kicks off when you beat the main campaign that presents a challenge and requires creative thinking.  Bosses are always a very tough and tense experience. There is a real threat of losing the level, as they all have mechanics that you will have to account for on the fly. Bosses never seem unfair as well. Tough but enjoyable all around. Enemies are in the same vein as well. They interact with each other and your mazes in enjoyable and challenging ways. While there are flaws to the game that detract to your ability to control, or experiment within it I would still recommend this game. There are not only few td's, but even fewer are done as well. I enjoyed myself throughout, I suggest taking a relaxed or mellow stance while playing this game.			"

I would like to be critical and point out the flaws of Kingdom Rush but as far as tower defense games go this one is perfect. It pushes the right buttons for me and if you are a fan of tower defense games this one is a must!P.S.: Great Defender, Heroic Defender & Iron Defender only unlock in Normal or Hard difficulty, but you only need to finish the first 12 levels to unlock them			"

												It's a Tower Defense game which means that there are the usual bells and whistles. The main difference is the beautiful and appealing sprite-work.There are a few things (as of Jan '14) within the game that are waiting to be unlocked/coming soon such as characters and extra map routes, so expect either free updates or DLC.

The art style is pleasant as well as the hero and spell systems. Its just so polished! I would have easily paid 20 dollars for this game and all its future content!			"

												Some people might swear that a mobile game doesn't belong on PC but for $10, you get all the heroes unlocked, and it's clear a LOT of effort went into giving this game a charming feel. Also, of the three out so far (Frontiers is also on PC), this one seems to be the best. It has an engaging albeit predictable storyline and enemies. Your troops have the most popular classes (I love that warriors can become either Paladins or Barbarians - that just captures the fighter class for me), and there are adorable references to LotR and friends sprinkled throughout. Difficulty can be adjusted at any time.			"

												Epic tower defence game. Cute graphics, good style and well-balanced gameplay. Music is OK.What I love about this game: I couldn't beat it down to the last star. I did most of the levels with 3 stars and iron/heroic challenges, but some of them on casual, same as mobile version. Love the challenge, but not enough to sit down and do every last thing :DThe game's short (I completed it in a day on mobile) but very enjoyable. I'm not much into tower defence games, but this is by far my favorite game of this kind.			"

												I highly recommend to buy Kingdom Rush, otherwise you would miss one of the best TD titles. The pixel graphics in fantasy style is consistently well drawn and uses Middle Earth-like maps up to optics in WarCraft style, the usual genre clichés.You are told to hold all sorts of fantasy scum from reaching a certain point. The bad guys are coming in waves and groping along predefined paths. You provide them with classic towers in four variants like infantry, archers, mages and artillery. The building sites are also predefined, sometimes they are distributed quite sparse on the level. For destroying enemies the cash register is ringing, the money will naturally be put back into new buildings or upgrades.That sounds not very exciting at first. And truely it is not, especially for TD-veterans. The gameplay is well known, but by the initially very low difficulty the excitement kept within narrow limits. But before you can turn away bored, Kingdom Rush puts on continuously. The developers have a whole bunch of little details that incorporate fresh ideas and additional game elements. It just exudes tons of charm, impresses with lots of funny ideas and loving details. In the second half it becomes  quite a hard nut to crack, so it will become interesting for TD-veterans, too. "

Kingdom Rush plays with a new innovative style, challenging gameplay, and a nice variety of levels. For each of the 13 levels, there are three available modes (plus two game modes: Easy and Normal) — Campaign, Heroic, and Iron; every level also has their own restrictions that decide which towers you can use and the max level they can be upgraded. The Campaign mode provides 20 lives, but Heroic and Iron mode offers only one life, essentially making the game many times harder.There are four tower types — Archer Towers, Barracks, Mage Guilds, and Artillery Cannons. There are also eight tower upgrades that vary from Rangers to Barbarians. In addition, there are also 18 tower abilities that you can equip including Teleport, Poison, and Sniper Shot.There are 30 monsters that range from Ogres and Yetis to Necromancers and Demon Hounds. Many people have a hard time memorizing each enemy’s ability, so there’s a handy Encyclopedia for the incompetent. The best part of Kingdom Rush is the visuals. In fact, the graphics are enjoyable to watch. Whether its mages dropping a lethal curse on crazed ogres, or troops in hand-to-hand combat with demon dogs, it’s a visual treat. On that note, the SFX are definitely worth mentioning, because when you activate Reinforcements, for example, a great voice actor actually yells out “Reinforcements!”, which is a great add-on to the experience.Kingdom Rush is one of the best tower defense experiences I've played. Each stage is perfectly balanced to present a very stiff challenge while never feeling unfair.THE GOOD- Looks, sounds, and feels fantastic- Truly excellent tower defense gameplay- Incredible strategic depth- The lengthy campaign never feels oldTHE BAD- The difficulty spike on some levels is an issue- No prioritizing enemy threatsDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

												AWESOME tower defense game!  Easy to learn, fun to play, goofy little animations, and lots of humor -- the dwarves that man the Tesla generators are especially hilarious (""Toasty!"").  Towers are upgradable with lots of cool options.  The only thing that's weird about this game is its difficulty curve.  There are three difficulty settings: casual, normal, and hard.  I played the entire campaign on normal and got 3 stars on most of the missions without too much difficulty.  However, once you beat the normal campaign it unlocks a bunch of bonus missions...and this is where the difficulty suddenly ramps up.  I couldn't beat most of these on ""normal"".  On ""casual"" some of them are still insanely hard, while others are totally managable.  Other than that, it's a great game.  It only cost me a few bucks and it's given me 19 hours of fun already.  Totally worth buying!			"

It has funny game and movie reference, some quote from famous artist and also tonns of easter egg awaiting you to explore it. The tower damage output is very well balanced and each different type of tower work very with each other. Hardest diffuculty is very challenging and require alot of strategy.

												Played a lot of TD`s.. but I can say this is one of the best for sure.The combination of great and simple graphics with awesome mechanics and good heroes makes this a great game. The fact that you can control a hero and have special powers that you can unleash on your enemies makes this a perfectly balanced TD, imho.The only downside is that we don`t get the updates that the mobile games get, like Origins and Frontiers.Wish there was more content and more places to spend the stars! Already at 40+..			"

												This is more an opinion / my thoughts on Kingdom Rush in short than a real in-depth review:Is it addictive and fun - absolutely.Is it overly complicated - no.Does it provide enough to keep it interesting and worthwhile - yes.BUT: Don't expect too much strategy and complexity - you will only partly find it here if you are used to other strategy games and TD games. It started out as a free flash game so don't expect too much. The question is, if you want to spend money on the steam version or if you stick to the browser game. Well, I got it from a bundle and I wouldn't get it for full price - after all it's your decision, decide for yourself.Verdict: Is it a good TD game? - I would say so, yes!			"

												If you are a fan of tower defense games I highly recommend this game.  If you're unsure about paying $10 ($9.99) for a game, try it free online in a web browser.  The money you spend on steam gives you access to a much better engine (rather than playing on flash).  The game runs smoother.  In addition, you have access to heroes and Ironhide Game Studio (the publisher/developer) has reported the expansion content will come at no additional costs once completed.As others have said, I first played this game on a tablet.  I'm not a fan of microtransactions.  It upset me to see awesome content (like heroes) which I had to pay to use.  This has all been fixed in the steam version.  People might argue well what's the difference between micro transactions and buying a game?  Either way you are still paying money.  The difference is one group of people doesn't have an advantage over others (granted not an issue in a single player game) and I know how much I'm paying up front.  Microtransactions can add up real quick and before you know it, you've spent more than the $10 it costs to buy the game on steam.  Thank you Ironhide for listening to your fan base and bringing this to steam.			"

												I think this is the very best Tower-Defense Strategy game I've ever played. (Probably because I've only played 1, and it's the game I am reviewing.) Here are some pros and cons about this game:Pros:-very fun and easy to pick up-funny animation-the archery towers are amazing-very good Hero's you can chooseCons:-a wee bit of loadingWell, you can tell this is a good game if there is only 1 con.

												A lot of fun, but very short.  Took just about 90 minutes to three star all campaign missions.  You can extend your playtime a bit by completing the challenging iron and heroic modes of each mission, but I doubt you'll get more than five or six hours out of it.I still recommend it for the well-balanced levels and fair difficulty curve, though personally I'd wait for a sale to pick it up.

												This kills me to do, and I am sure this review will reach 0/100 found unhelpful within the first 30 minutes of posting purely because it is a ""not recommend"" and people who already own and love the game will troll the negative reviews (as they always do on Steam), the review itself be damned- but I have to do it...Tower defense games might be my favorite genre, next to sandbox and RPG's, and I have played almost all of them, from Plants vs Zombies to Orcs Must Die to Defenders Quest and some of the better ones for clearly over 500 hours each (Dungeon Defenders, Craft the World, ect) so this review is coming from a position of great, great experience...This game opened up my eyes to a new type of genre I see in the near future, and that is a FTP MOBA style tower defense with heroes, a type of game that I am looking forward to playing someday, that however is not what this game is or how it plays...The beauty of these types of games is seeing ""what types/combo's people come up with to out smart the enemy"" with people show casing the many types and styles of defense, with many combo's and strats working...Kingdom Rush is a case of ""trial and error only one choice is the correct choice"" frustrating pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Period.What do I mean by this? First Problem: So I played the game for about 4 hours on hard (assuming I could of course due to my experience in the genre) and was starting to get crushed so I figured I would drop the difficulty down to ""casual"" and see if I couldn't figure out the game mechanics better... No change... So I went back to hard... No change... There was/is no visable change in difficulty from ""casual"" to ""hard""... First problemSecond Problem: So after figuring out that difficulty wasn't going to change anything I tried the map a few more times until finally I crushed the map with a configuration... So I replayed the map trying other configurations and nope... got crushed... So I went online and, you guessed it... For most maps there are maybe 1-3 different ways to beat the map shown in a ""memorized placement"" style of gameplay... Now to give you an idea of how frustrating this can be, you are placed on a map with around 6-12 places to build with 4 different buildings to choose from with 2 variations each... This ""trial and error"" could and literally would take more than a dozen reloads before finally figuring out.Third Problem: You have no idea what is going to spawn before it spawns and those defenses only do well vs a single type of enemy... Yep, so they could spawn a million spiders on wave one so you drop some archers down only to have them spawn entirely archer resistent troops on wave two and you guessed it... RELOAD TIME!What these three problems create is an UNFORGIVABLY frustrating experience that frankly IS NOT FUN! You want to play this game? Literally look up the guide in Steam, watch the video where he shows you the correct placement of towers click ""go"" and win... I mean, you can spend hours in trial and error trying to figure out that one correct placement of towers on your own but you will find yourself with the same positions at some point regardless! The game played gorgeous, the addition of movable heroes was brilliant, the gameplay is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Period. PS. Also, even with all of those trials and errors and frustration the game is beat within 2.5-5 hours PPS. If you are one of those people who own the game and loved the game reading this negative review that has been written for those who don't yet own the game and have downvoted the review and are now thinking about posting a comment about ""how dum dum you is"" ... don't ... Go look in a mirror and ask yourself why you are such a ♥♥♥♥ing worthless individual and go make something of yourself... Thanks PPPS. You ignored my advice? Cool... *delete comment*			"

												Best Tower Defense Ever.This game was the first TD that really hooked me, after that I've played others but this one really stands out.Great learning curve, especially for newcomers to the genre, simple but beautiful artwork, great game mechanics, amazing level design.The game is full of easter eggs and references to geeky/gaming culture, the music really makes you feel like you are on an epic battle in the Middle Age.Awesome Indie Game, really cheap considering how entertaining it is and how many hours it takes you to beat it 100%, besides the developers actually release new campaigns for free, which is awesome!5/5			"

												In short; play the free flash game online, you should be able to decide if it's worth your money.The factors that seperate this from every other TD out there are:-Soldiers/Barracks (Build barracks to deploy a fixed number of troops on the battlefield, each one can engage one enemy, preventing their advance)-Only 4 base tower types - each tower can specialize into a different type at level 5 upgrade, with 2 upgrades each, each upgrade having a miniumum of 2 further researchable special abilities unique to that tower. -Delightful art style (this cant be ignored)Additionally each level has 2 challenge modes, where you're restricted to certain towers/upgrade levels/no heroes .etc... and these are really fun. Also they even change the level art, so that it's clear that the battle is happening after your previous battle on the level, which is nice.As for negative comments-I feel the tesla tower is a bit disproportionally powerful, leading to less freedom in tower selection than seems appropriate (I doubt there's any level that couldnt be beaten simply by focussing on tesla towers (money allowing) - this is not true of other towers)-There's a bug with the credit scroll speed once you've beated the first part of the game.

												I have to say, i was skeptical about this game's release in Steam due to it having a Flash, Android and iOS version, but then i found out they have removed ALL MICROTRANSACTIONS in this game from the previous versions. The gameplay itself didn't change, save for more stages of mini-campaigns that's available once you beat the main campaign ( Something you can't get on the Flash version ). The game has around 12-24 hours of gameplay depending on what difficulty you're playing, with 12 playable heroes, a commendable variations of enemies for an indie game, 12 tower upgrades, and 30 perks to unlock. Instructions and the in-game encyclopedia are well-written and easy to understand, and its increasingly difficult stages makes this game a challenge to beat even for veterans. The only thing that bothers me is the AI of some heroes and the recent bug that i experienced where a boss is unable to move/stuck in one position when you have multiple slowing effects applied to the boss, but all in all, this is one of the best strategy game i've played, and all i have to say is... I'll be waiting for Frontiers to arrive on Steam :D9.5/10			"

Everytime I find another TD game I always compare it to the KR series and some are good but none beat this. Devs know what they're doing and hands down my favorite indie dev team.			"

												Very addictive, very playable tower defense game. It's easy enough to get into as a newer player, but has plenty of challenges as you get further long. Nice graphics and fun pop/geek culture references, too.  I can't wait unil they release the next campaign!			"

												One of the best tower defense games I've played. Not only do you build towers that shoot at the enemies, there are also towers that spawn warriors that ""block"" nearby enemies by attacking them. You can also choose from a number of different heroes, that you can run around freely with and attack anything you want. It's a very engaging game, instead of just waiting to see if your current towers kill the enemies, or if you should restart the level.I haven't had this much fun playing tower defense since I played PixelJunk Monsters on PS3.

												I have to say, i was skeptical about this game's release in Steam due to it having a Flash, Android and iOS version, but then i found out they have removed ALL MICROTRANSACTIONS in this game from the previous versions. The gameplay itself didn't change, save for more stages of mini-campaigns that's available once you beat the main campaign ( Something you can't get on the Flash version ). The game has around 12-24 hours of gameplay depending on what difficulty you're playing, with 12 playable heroes, a commendable variations of enemies for an indie game, 12 tower upgrades, and 30 perks to unlock. Instructions and the in-game encyclopedia are well-written and easy to understand, and its increasingly difficult stages makes this game a challenge to beat even for veterans. The only thing that bothers me is the AI of some heroes and the recent bug that i experienced where a boss is unable to move/stuck in one position when you have multiple slowing effects applied to the boss, but all in all, this is one of the best strategy game i've played, and all i have to say is... I'll be waiting for Frontiers to arrive on Steam :D9.5/10			"

												I started off playing the franchise on my phone since kingdom rush is out . To be frankly honest I'm not a fan of tower defense games but I decided to give this game a chance back when it was a flash game and OH BOY was I wrong of how fun such a game can be . Kingdom Rush completely changed my perspective towards tower defense games . I played the game over and over with the other two games Kingdom Rush Origins and Frontiers . Now I recently bought the steam version and have been delving into old memories of pure enjoyment . I recommend this game to everyone even if you are not a fan of the genre as this game would change your mind . 10/10 would free freedo again . :)			"

												I'm nearing the end of the main campaign and can easily say that Kingdom Rush nails the formula for the perfect tower defense game. Each level is balanced with the right amount of difficulty with tons of replay value. I occasionally found myself stumped in the boss battles and special challenges. The difference between Kingdom Rush and your typical TD is that the player can build rallied barracks to slow down enemy creeps from their fixed path. In addition to that, Kingdom Rush introduces three types of offense towers that branch out in two paths which can then be further customized with unique abilties; giving the player full control of the field. I would definitely recommend Kingdom Rush to anyone interested in a tower defense that requires a good amount of thought and strategy.			"

												One of the best Tower Defense games I ever played.Kingdom Rush is a fun,rewarding and good looking game with strategic depth,good variety of towers,upgrades,enemy critters and maps.The aestethics of the game are great.The menu,the music and the gameplay itself are smooth looking with incredibly pleasing to look at graphics.Kingdom Rush managed to be a challenging game that gives you a lot of options on building your defense,but at the same time it can be a casual laid back game.The game features a short campaign with some bonus levels at the end.In my opinion the game is way too short but it compensates with a lot of quality.You have a good variety of towers and upgrades for your defense plus a champion that you can control around.Also the game offers you two extra spells that you can use during the stage.This way the game keeps you engaged during the waves,unlike other TD's where you just watch.In regards of gameplay,the game excels at giving you the best experience that you can have from a TD.A lot of enemy diversity tagged along some beautiful looking maps.Along the way in the campaign,there are a few ''boss'' stages where you face off against special enemies with their own set of spells/attack moves and dialogue lines.I highly recommend Kingdom Rush for anyone that wants to have a good time.The only bad thing that I can say about the game is the fact that it is too short.

												I fell in love with this game in 2010 on my iPod touch 4th Gen. I was wandering around on steam and stumbled upon it and was shocked.I have to say the game feels amazing. Whereas PopCap failed to put Plants Vs. Zombies in a good Steam game, Kingdom Rush fits well. I have encountered no problems or bugs so far. Overall this is amazing and fun. It reminds me why I fell in love with this game in the first place. The simple, yet strategic, thought provoking game is one of a kind. I would buy the game if it was less though. I feel as if the game is not worth the full 10$ even though I like to support the studio. I think 5$ would be a more reasonable price because you can get the game free on the app store or I even played on a website in 2012 at a friend's house.			"

												This was one of my 2 favorite Tower Defense game on Flash game site Kongregate (the other being Cursed Treasure). It is an extremely unique and fun TD game, easy to understand and play, and got me hooked for the entire day (on the flash version), wanting to complete it. So I bought it immediately once I noticed it is now on Steam :)Improvements from the flash version:-More variety of musics-Full Screen-More levelsCons:-Could really do with tooltips. People who never played the flash version probably need to click the buttons to find out what they do-Rally points / hero controlling are still left clicks. This is no longer a flash game, it is a full game by itself now, and so they should become right clicks, to make things easier-No hotkey for sending next wave-You can't view the encyclopedia while you're playing. Isn't that when you need it most?-The tower AI isn't that smart. For example, it likes to cast Death Ray (one-hit KO skill with a long cooldown) on a small mob instead of a miniboss who is wrecking havocRating: 9.5/10			"

												Yes, Another TDG. Kingdom Rush is a tower defense-style game that follows similar gameplay pattern like other tower defense game  but with a little twist and a bit more option to let the player have a fair balance game with a strategic planning .Players are the King which needs  to defend their lands from enemies (Vez'nan) who uses army of mythical creatureslike orcs and goblins etc.Players can place various offensive and defensive towers along the winding path to the city gates.Whats good about this is there's a lot of option to place your towers even though it is fixed.What's more each tower have two option to be customized to. Even you manage to beat the campaign,you still have challenge mode like Heroic and Iron or side mission which gives you some replay-ability .Added with a simple art and a good music with a good cartoon comedy tone  makes it even better.All in all ,it's a great game which explains why the ratings (Overwhelmingly positive).

												Kingdom Rush is a tower defence game, Everyone is different, I will put forward my views and hope they help your opnion of the game, First off, I personally love Tower/Turret games, Tho by my own admission I am not very good at them!I am glad to see this on steam, I have been playing the flash version online, This is why my steam hours on this game are low.Firstly this game has pleasing graphics, with an easy on the eye, One screen setup, No scrolling about puts all the action right in front of you, The sound and music is a little limited and repetative, But there is nothng annoying and the music is catchy.The story line/plot was nothing impressive, But I like not too much plot, Lets get those towers up!!Gameplay is varied, Myself I found it got really hard really quick, Others found this quite easy till the final levels, Then found it to be almost impossible, So I can only give my personal opinion here, I thoroughly enjoyed this game, and I still go back to it from time to time, I have NEVER compleated this game, On the third mission I could quite easily do the normal and elete setting, It taken me hours to complete the hard? I feel there is some game ballencing issues, As you move on, It feels like it's getting easyer, Then one level will catch you out and keep you annoyed for hours.I like the creation and use of Heros, But after the first run of levels you will never get to use tham again, I like the skill tree, But you can max out everything quite early and from that point on only have stars saved up for what?!?I will always reccomend this game, But for every good point I can think of, I see a bad point to counteract this.I personally give this a 6/10 Easy is not easy.

Spent 30 or so hours on it the following 3 days after buying it. Albeit a somewhat short game, with only 26 missions, it was a fun, addictive, and casual timekiller with simple yet challenging gameplay as well as pretty visuals. Only thing for me is that it seems like a game I would only buy on sale, and unfortunately for completionists like me, endgame achievements for completing the campaign as well as the other mission variations are bugged so that sucks.

												Kingdom rush.What can I say? Overall an awesome game. If you're into Tower Defence - Just play it. You'll have your mind blown. Over 40 enemies are included in this game. 40! In Bloons TD5 there's 14. In Bloons Monkey City - 15. In most tower defence games I've played - Under 30. This game also has awesome artwork, and is jam packed with creative stages, towers, upgrades, heroes and bosses. 11 Bosses in fact. 4 Mini campaigns after you complete the main game. Come on - You know you want it.			"

Something about a bigger screen brings out fascination, especially with amazing graphics. Having the option to chose the different types of resolutions and graphic settings is simply outstanding. I've tested out the different graphics you can choose from and even the ""simple"" version of the graphics still looks outstanding. 10/10 quality game.

												A pretty fun Tower Defense that can also be quite challenging. It might not be so exciting in the first few levels because of the lack of upgrades. But soon enough you'll have the lanes filled with towers that have amazing powers. And it'll be a pleasure to see waves of enemies perishing  before you. The music might be a bit repetitive, but you can always turn the volume down and play your songs while playing. Recommended for anyone who likes putting their wits to the test in a fun way.			"

This time I found it on Steam and decided to give it a go, see if there is anything different in terms of storyline, mechanics, effects. Not to mention the fun and lively tower defense experince.+ Compact Tower Defense game+ 4 towers, 8 specializations+ Nice storyline, many references and easter eggs+ Cool monster designs, many levels+ Achievements+ Trading Cards (Emotes/Backgrounds)- The game feels very handheld oriented- Llacks the complexity of a comprehensive TD game Personal Ranking: 6/10 "

												This is one of my all-time favorite Tower Defense games. It's really intuitive and easy to learn but hard to master.With a mix of towers, upgrades, skills and a hero you face hoards of enemies trying too take down the kingdom you need to protect. After finishing the campaign a few extra levels become available to test out your skills and encounter new enemies. You can also try to replay stages with restrictions to gain extra stars and you use for upgrading skills.I really love the game because of the art style. It's a really clean illustrated style which makes the game less hectic and thus easier to play for longer sessions.The game is based on the original Flash version later ported to mobile and finally got released on Steam.

From choosing soldier positions, leveling up your heroe, choosing upgrades, and even map specific buildings and easter eggs. The bonus levels at the end will definately provide a challenge as well to those who like it, I had to look up videos on where to place my towers just to beat some of them.I'm looking forward to the expansion			"

												If you're a fan of tower defense games, and haven't playd Kingdom Rush, you're seriously missing out. The game is tough as nails, but it's so rewarding once you get it down.This game is also available as a mobile app, and I would certainly recommend that version of the game over this one. The mobile app received more love from the developers, and has two extra DLC sets -- Frontiers and Origins. They load the game up with a few new tower upgrades, interesting new levels, new enemies, and new heroes. The desktop version of this game, for some reason, never got these updates and is vastly behind in the amount of content. It's unlikely that they'll add it. The biggest benefit to the desktop version of this game is that you don't need to pay for heroes, whereas the mobile apps have a pretty strong paywall on some of the heroes they offer.That being said, I still enjoy the desktop version of this game very much. It's nice to play it with a mouse and a large screen, which makes your reaction times faster and doesn't have you hunched over your phone/tablet. Great game! Stack artillery!			"

												By far one of the most enjoyable, and frustratingly fun, tower defense games i have ever played. BUY IT. FFS PEOPLE BUY IT! Its only like, 10 damn dollars! Its worth it! It offers hours of entertainment!So, this is the first game ive ever gotten 100% achievements in, because, well, they're fun. They arent mindless achievements that you are just like ""hum drum, guess i will go achievement-grinding"". Most of the achievements you get by just playing the game, yes, but some of them are more difficult then others and offer a stance on being more strategic in your play style, making you think out your strategy before doing it if you want a specific achievement. Pretty interactive for something so small.The storyline is loose, silly, but entertaining. The Last boss's witty banter and use of internet memes and popular-culture catch phrases is entertaining in itself. The ability to customize your towers with like 18+ different skills and builds is very enjoyable, and the difficulty REALLY ramps up, even on normal mode, as you progress higher into the game.For harder, end game levels, dont overthink things. Honestly this is where i got most frustrated. I over thought everything. Sometimes the simplest approach is the best. Make sure you learn your tower synergies and what works with what. Protip: Tesla towers are the most OP tower in the game...seriously, once you get them, make sure to use them, they can wittle down enemies in under 3 seconds when they are fully upgraded and placed close to one another or near enemy spawns.The only downside i have to say is that from what i read, Ironhide [the company who made the game] has confirmed they -WILL NOT- be porting over Kingdom Rush Frontiers or Kingdom Rush Origins. Shame too, i would of spent EASILY 30$+ on the game, hell maybe even 50$ if its longer then this game. Totally worth the 10$In closing, if theres anything that needs done , is that Ironhide changes they're mind and ports over Kingdom Rush:Frontiers, and Kingdom Rush: Origins to steam. They already have the engine in place, they have a large supporting backing them from the fans,myself including, and they will make a pretty-penny if they bring them to steam. Come on Ironhide, give it to us! No more of this mobile-phone game BS. And thats speaking from my heart, with love.  "

 Kingdom Rush  is a classic cartoonish tower defense game in which players deploy different types of units (Archers, Mages, Siege, Infantry) to fend off wave after wave until you beat the level. SYNOPSIS With the new update, the game has 20+ levels that each have a heroic + Iron mode, which makes the total count at around 60. The game also has three different difficulty levels; Casual, Normal, and Hard. I recommend playing Normal if this is your first tower defense game, otherwise play Hard. The game is pretty well balanced in terms of challenging levels that don't make you want to rage quit the game. Achievements The game's acheivements are all very obtainable. Just don't play Casual if you want to get all of them. To 100% the game took me about 55 hours, but it could take much less if you're used to tower defense games.			"

												Kingdom Rush is an unexpected gem for me. As a port of a mobile tower defense game I didn't have high hopes, but it exceeded my expectations. The sound and graphics are smooth and appropriate and work well together.There really isn't that much new or original here. They didn't really rock the genre. But it is extremely well-executed. And there's even a bit of story thrown in if you're willing to read the descriptions of each level, which shows some extra thought and care that went in to constructing the game world.That said it's not without problems. The first is just that there are some glitches that pop up. Most are related to achievements (perhaps because they didn't exist in the mobile version?) but there are a few game breaking ones. At one point enemies just stopped coming for me. I walked away and came back a few minutes later and they still weren't there. The game wasn't frozen - I could still interact with it, the enemies just never came, and therefore I had no choice but to restart the entire level.And the game sorely needs a fast-forward or speed up button. If you're doing really well and planned things out then enemies can seem aganozingly slow and waiting for them becomes annoying. As this sort of feature is pretty standard within the genre I'm honestly surprised that it's nowhere to be found in Kingdom Rush.Also the difficulty in some of the DLC levels is simply far too high. Most of the normal levels felt challenging while fair, but a couple of the last DLC levels got very frustrating and made me feel stuck. It's never a good feeling to work for a long time on a level and have no progress to show for it.The RPG elements and some of the quirky towers and sound bites are definitely pluses. Along with the different hero choices and large replayability offered by needing to complete levels multiple times, I'd definitely recommend it if you like a simple version of a polished tower defense game.

												Kingdom Rush takes the increasingly stale tower defense genre and infuses it with some much-needed wit and good old-fashioned polish. The core experience is familiar – waves of enemies follow a pre-set path, and must be taken out by towers players purchase and place.The twist is that players can place ""Barracks"" towers that send footmen onto the field that will battle and slow down enemy creeps. By placing enemy-blocking barracks next to high-powered towers, players can turn the tide in their favor.Although Kingdom Rush only contains four base tower types, each can be upgraded down two separate paths, and can then be customized even further with special abilities. This gives players a surprising amount of versatility, and pays off for those that plan ahead. For example, the mage tower upgrades into the armor-weakening Sorcerer or the enemy-teleporting Arcane. The former is useful at the beginning of the enemy's path, the latter at the very end.Kingdom Rush is one of the best tower defense experiences I've had. Each stage is perfectly balanced to present a very stiff challenge while never feeling unfair. Packs of smaller enemies slip by you? Use more artillery. Flying enemies trip you up? Next time try more archers. It's a game that teaches you how to win, one level at a timeIt certainly helps that the entire thing looks and sounds fantastic. The detailed and stylish cartoony visuals set a distinct ""fantasy-comedy"" tone, reinforced by the game's sparse but spot-on voice acting. Every tower spouts one-liners when upgraded, leading to plenty of opportunities for sly pop-culture references.Kingdom Rush is an instant classic and is guaranteed to turn up on “best of” lists. Anyone remotely interested in either tower defense or strategy should consider it a most-own. Gamers that think they don’t enjoy the genre should give Kingdom Rush a shot anyway – it might just win you over.			"

												Kingdom Rush is insanely fun. Even after telling myself I did not need to purchase it because I had already beaten it back and forth prior to the Stream release on my iPad and other flash sites. I felt a yearning to claim all of the achievements yet again. So here I am, clear map and a hankering to destroy Iron mode. I am victorious in claiming it all. This game is just too much fun. I know it took them a long time to roll it out, but I hope the proof of the market helps them to roll out Kingdom Rush Frontiers even faster. No offense to mobile and tablet releases, but they suck, and I enjoy sitting at my computer with my face glued to my screen and not to my phone (I'll save that rant for another review). The Kingdom Rush gameplay is just smooth and it's one my favorite (I got 0 lag even with the highest setting of graphics and a million things covering my screen). I love tower defense. I love Kingdom Rush! Hopefully you might enjoy it too.Want some, get some!			"

												maybe one of the best TD ever!Graphic is excellent and together with voices and sound create a really funny environment (lot of citations from other movies and games). The game strategy is great since there are 3 grade of difficulty for every level (you will be allowed to use less types of towers and the waves will change) so that everyone can enjoy and find a good challenge with every level! lots of achievements and hidden spots to find during the game while you will not be able to rest for a second while casting spells and moving around your hero!

												A breath of fresh air when it comes to tower defence games. The combat functions ads a suprising amount of tactical depth and interactivity to the game. The challenge maps force you to raise the bar in your tactics and force you to think differently about the courses, which is what challenge maps SHOULD do. The difficulty curve does spike later on but the fact that you can increase your upgrades via completion of challenge maps makes you revisit old maps before completing all the normal maps and can actually teach you important tactics. All in all a solid game with great art style, and ultimately a good pick.			"

You can finish every level at max of 3 stars with 2 additional mode scenarios with some extra challenge (can't use mage towers, upgrade max to lvl.2 etc.). There are also boss rounds.

Your soldiers actualy have to fight on the battlefield supported by ranged towers you have the option to send in reinforcements ca. after every 15 seconds and of course there are different types of towers like usually in a TD game. Almost forgot about the heroes (with different attributes) - you can select a hero and use him as a support for your soliders on the battlefield.I grabed it for 2.5€ and I am glad I did. Recommending to every TD games fan or just someone who's looking for an indie chill time game.score: 8/10			"

												Yes, Another TDG. Kingdom Rush is a tower defense-style game that follows similar gameplay pattern like other tower defense game  but with a little twist and a bit more option to let the player have a fair balance game with a strategic planning .Players are the King which needs  to defend their lands from enemies (Vez'nan) who uses army of mythical creatureslike orcs and goblins etc.Players can place various offensive and defensive towers along the winding path to the city gates.Whats good about this is there's a lot of option to place your towers even though it is fixed.What's more each tower have two option to be customized to. Even you manage to beat the campaign,you still have challenge mode like Heroic and Iron or side mission which gives you some replay-ability .Added with a simple art and a good music with a good cartoon comedy tone  makes it even better.All in all ,it's a great game which explains why the ratings (Overwhelmingly positive).

												Kingdom Rush is a solid tower defense game. It has recognizable enemies with a variety of strengths and weaknesses to plan for, plus an almanac to sort it all out. The towers are all useful and all emphasize some different approach. It has a sense of humor and flair. There is an overwhelming amount of dated pop culture jokes. Many levels also have some kind of Easter egg in the background, anything from clicking on sheep and goats to freeing a spider's next meal. But what really makes Kingdom Rush special is one of the four groups of towers, the barracks. What the barracks add to the game is soldiers, a human element, which can be made to rally anywhere in the radius of the barracks. What the soldiers do is engage a single enemy; each hold them in place until the melee is completed. This means, by placing soldiers, a chokepoint is created and other towers can be placed with that in mind. This also means that troops can be repositioned to stop enemies that are just about the escape. With this movement, along with the use of a hero that can made to rally anywhere on the map, the game becomes much more active and begins to blur the line between tower defense and real time strategy.

												My favorite tower defense game of all time. It has literally everything you want in a TD.* Strategic depth - the ability to actually make choices that matter and having to rethink if your choices didn't work.* Increasing difficulty levels.* Extra challenges (heroic mode, iron mode).* Great music & sound effects.* Addictive gameplay.* Secrets - achievements - clickables.The game is available (not with all the levels, and not with the element of heroes) for free as a flash game. Some people may consider this a negative (amagad paying $10 for a game I can get for free?) but I consider it a positive - the free version is easily accessible, treat it as a demo or play it whilst waiting for this version to go on sale.Kingdom Rush on steam is 100% worth the cost for the amount of entertainment it will offer.

												Kingdom Rush is a great tower defense game. Everything about it is done in an inoffensive, pleasant way. It may not be the most groundbreaking or genre-bending tower defense game. It doesn't have a lot of depth and there's not a gruelling amount of difficulty, although some stages can still be quite challening requiring multiple strategies until you find the right one. Cartoonish visuals are complemented by its clean presentation. The achievements and unlockables keep the game fresh for far longer than I expected. If you're looking for a really well done tower defense game with heaps of content and charm, Kingdom Rush is a great first choice.			"

												A pretty fun Tower Defense that can also be quite challenging. It might not be so exciting in the first few levels because of the lack of upgrades. But soon enough you'll have the lanes filled with towers that have amazing powers. And it'll be a pleasure to see waves of enemies perishing  before you. The music might be a bit repetitive, but you can always turn the volume down and play your songs while playing. Recommended for anyone who likes putting their wits to the test in a fun way.			"

												By far one of the most enjoyable, and frustratingly fun, tower defense games i have ever played. BUY IT. FFS PEOPLE BUY IT! Its only like, 10 damn dollars! Its worth it! It offers hours of entertainment!So, this is the first game ive ever gotten 100% achievements in, because, well, they're fun. They arent mindless achievements that you are just like ""hum drum, guess i will go achievement-grinding"". Most of the achievements you get by just playing the game, yes, but some of them are more difficult then others and offer a stance on being more strategic in your play style, making you think out your strategy before doing it if you want a specific achievement. Pretty interactive for something so small.The storyline is loose, silly, but entertaining. The Last boss's witty banter and use of internet memes and popular-culture catch phrases is entertaining in itself. The ability to customize your towers with like 18+ different skills and builds is very enjoyable, and the difficulty REALLY ramps up, even on normal mode, as you progress higher into the game.For harder, end game levels, dont overthink things. Honestly this is where i got most frustrated. I over thought everything. Sometimes the simplest approach is the best. Make sure you learn your tower synergies and what works with what. Protip: Tesla towers are the most OP tower in the game...seriously, once you get them, make sure to use them, they can wittle down enemies in under 3 seconds when they are fully upgraded and placed close to one another or near enemy spawns.The only downside i have to say is that from what i read, Ironhide [the company who made the game] has confirmed they -WILL NOT- be porting over Kingdom Rush Frontiers or Kingdom Rush Origins. Shame too, i would of spent EASILY 30$+ on the game, hell maybe even 50$ if its longer then this game. Totally worth the 10$In closing, if theres anything that needs done , is that Ironhide changes they're mind and ports over Kingdom Rush:Frontiers, and Kingdom Rush: Origins to steam. They already have the engine in place, they have a large supporting backing them from the fans,myself including, and they will make a pretty-penny if they bring them to steam. Come on Ironhide, give it to us! No more of this mobile-phone game BS. And thats speaking from my heart, with love.  "

												If you're a fan of tower defense games, and haven't playd Kingdom Rush, you're seriously missing out. The game is tough as nails, but it's so rewarding once you get it down.This game is also available as a mobile app, and I would certainly recommend that version of the game over this one. The mobile app received more love from the developers, and has two extra DLC sets -- Frontiers and Origins. They load the game up with a few new tower upgrades, interesting new levels, new enemies, and new heroes. The desktop version of this game, for some reason, never got these updates and is vastly behind in the amount of content. It's unlikely that they'll add it. The biggest benefit to the desktop version of this game is that you don't need to pay for heroes, whereas the mobile apps have a pretty strong paywall on some of the heroes they offer.That being said, I still enjoy the desktop version of this game very much. It's nice to play it with a mouse and a large screen, which makes your reaction times faster and doesn't have you hunched over your phone/tablet. Great game! Stack artillery!			"

												I was introduced to ""Defense"" games years ago when playing the original Starcraft, and have been hooked ever since. With the introduction of Warcraft 3's map engine, the depth and variety of defense games exploded and became increasingly popular. Surprisingly since though, there haven't been many quality stand-alone defense games. Kingdom Rush is definitely one of those games. In my opinion, it's the best defense game on the market, even exceeding games like Defense Grid. The art and music is beautiful, the gameplay fun, and the game itself is balanced just right. If you like defense games, you NEED to play Kingdom Rush.			"

												I've decided to give this game a review. So here we go.First of all. I've always been addicted to tower defense and I must say, this is one of the best I've played. Graphics are superb. Variety is ok.(I've seen game with more tactical possibilities). The difficulty settings are very challenging an I loved it. You really have to stop and ask yourself what strategy you're gonna use to win a stage. Got it at 75% discount. At this price it was no question, but having played it, I would now say that it deserves even the full price.Pros: -Graphics      -difficult       -strategic      -intuitiveCons:-Not much variety in the turret,      -Can't choose exactly where you're gonna put the tower. I wouldn't mind if that was not a problem                                                                in the game . But there is stages that the tactical difficulties are entirely driven by the way      they placed the building sites.Still, at this price, it deserves it			"

												Kingdom Rush is a solid tower defense game. It has recognizable enemies with a variety of strengths and weaknesses to plan for, plus an almanac to sort it all out. The towers are all useful and all emphasize some different approach. It has a sense of humor and flair. There is an overwhelming amount of dated pop culture jokes. Many levels also have some kind of Easter egg in the background, anything from clicking on sheep and goats to freeing a spider's next meal. But what really makes Kingdom Rush special is one of the four groups of towers, the barracks. What the barracks add to the game is soldiers, a human element, which can be made to rally anywhere in the radius of the barracks. What the soldiers do is engage a single enemy; each hold them in place until the melee is completed. This means, by placing soldiers, a chokepoint is created and other towers can be placed with that in mind. This also means that troops can be repositioned to stop enemies that are just about the escape. With this movement, along with the use of a hero that can made to rally anywhere on the map, the game becomes much more active and begins to blur the line between tower defense and real time strategy.

												My favorite tower defense game of all time. It has literally everything you want in a TD.* Strategic depth - the ability to actually make choices that matter and having to rethink if your choices didn't work.* Increasing difficulty levels.* Extra challenges (heroic mode, iron mode).* Great music & sound effects.* Addictive gameplay.* Secrets - achievements - clickables.The game is available (not with all the levels, and not with the element of heroes) for free as a flash game. Some people may consider this a negative (amagad paying $10 for a game I can get for free?) but I consider it a positive - the free version is easily accessible, treat it as a demo or play it whilst waiting for this version to go on sale.Kingdom Rush on steam is 100% worth the cost for the amount of entertainment it will offer.

												In my opinion, the best tower defence game available. With its charming cartoony art style, easy-to-use interface, and multiple difficulty options, Kindom Rush is easy to get into, but still hard to master. Featuring a variety of tower types, controllable hero characters, upgrades, and enemies, this game is sure to have you replaying every level to secure that 3-star score.			"

												I rate this game 11/10 because of it's simplistic yet tactical game play.I played this game back when I was 9 years old, when I didn't even know that things like Origin or Steam existed. I played this on Google Chrome, normal version and unfortunately hacked version. I loved it then, I love it now, it is not complicated to play or learn, you just have to give the game time as you progress through each level. The other thing I love is that on the Browser version there weren't as many levels and they didn't have heroes. I recommend this game because it's relaxing to play whilst listening to music.			"

												A pretty fun Tower Defense that can also be quite challenging. It might not be so exciting in the first few levels because of the lack of upgrades. But soon enough you'll have the lanes filled with towers that have amazing powers. And it'll be a pleasure to see waves of enemies perishing  before you. The music might be a bit repetitive, but you can always turn the volume down and play your songs while playing. Recommended for anyone who likes putting their wits to the test in a fun way.			"

Something about a bigger screen brings out fascination, especially with amazing graphics. Having the option to chose the different types of resolutions and graphic settings is simply outstanding. I've tested out the different graphics you can choose from and even the ""simple"" version of the graphics still looks outstanding. 10/10 quality game. Moreover, this is the best defense game one can get, so do so now! :D			"

												Kingdom Rush is a great tower defense game. Everything about it is done in an inoffensive, pleasant way. It may not be the most groundbreaking or genre-bending tower defense game. It doesn't have a lot of depth and there's not a gruelling amount of difficulty, although some stages can still be quite challening requiring multiple strategies until you find the right one. Cartoonish visuals are complemented by its clean presentation. The achievements and unlockables keep the game fresh for far longer than I expected. If you're looking for a really well done tower defense game with heaps of content and charm, Kingdom Rush is a great first choice.			"

												One superb TD game! Beautiful cartoonlike with fun and colourful atmosphere.Four basic towers, which can be upgraded and each has two different specializations, with possiblity to buy passive skills for your towers. Also, you can control (more or less) heroes on battlefield! You also have two special (cooldown) skills.After each level, you gain stars which you use to buy special passive bonuses for you towers and skills.Levels can be challenging and intense, and there are even higher difficulty settings for true tactians.Overall, this a game that every true fan of tower defense games genre has to try! :)			"

												Kingdome Rush is a challenging tower defence game that's addictive and has a great sense of character.To its cunning cartoon visuals and sound pieces, Kingdom Rush is a joy to play.It's important that it got its identity right as it separates itself from different tower defence games by consistently being fun.The towers available: artillery, arrows, guards, and wizards are quite unique in terms of how they play. Each tower has a small tree of upgrades and can be transformed in several ways with bonus passive powers at your choosing.Power-ups are implemented cleverly to your arsenal as you try to strategically decide when to use them while setting up towers. It does get intense, this is a more hands-on tower defence where you're rarely watching the action without moving your hero, upgrading towers, deciding where to move your guards continually and trying to work out how to best trap the enemy.That's not all, you even have epic boss battles that appear during final waves, so from start to finish, there's never a dull moment to be had.With a market crowded with tower defence games, Kingdom Rush isn't content on providing the same old gameplay you have been used to. It's a premium production that sports some of the best tower defence, strategy and action in one package.There's no better way to spend your money, it's worth every cent!			"

												Ah, Kingdom Rush. I've played it since the Armorgames and Kongregate times. I have it on my phone (and its expansion as well!) and now I have it on my Steam account.This is a tower defense games with quite a relatively small arsenal of towers compared to other tower defense games (4 basic tower types that eventually branch out into 8 different towers at maximum upgrade level). However, despite its simple mechanics, the variety of enemies as well as the level design actually contribute to a very fun game. The great cartoon art as well as a number of memorable voice acting lines don't hurt, as well. (""Reinforce!"")For those not in the know, there are free versions written in Flash that you can access at the above websites, and are available for very cheap (~$1) on mobile. This Steam game is a complete rewrite of the game using Unity. Why should you care about buying this when you can get it for cheaper elsewhere? There are a multitude of reasons, so read on and judge for yourself.* No microtransactions. The most noticeable difference is that you can get all the heroes on Steam just by playing, whereas on mobile and the Flash versions, you will have to spend way more money than what the Steam version costs to get all of the heroes beyond the three that you unlock with game progression. Granted, the game is designed in such a way that you don't really need to buy heroes to win. (As a note, it appears that the last three heroes have not yet been released on Steam, but will appear in a future update.)* High-def art and full-screen resolution. The overworld map is much more stylized and beautifully detailed than the other versions. If you don't like playing on a small Flash window or a small mobile screen, the Steam version might be for you.* Steam Trading Cards and Steam Achievements. If you're into these, then this game is for you. The achievements are of particular note; it is actually not difficult to achieve them, only time-consuming (for a few of them, at least).* Premium content in terms of maps. There are a bunch of levels and mini-campaigns in this version that you needed to purchase in the other versions. Also, an exclusive campaign will be released in a future update.Once again, use your best judgment as to the choice between free and paid versions. My recommendation, however, is BUY this amazing game and support the developers.			"

												This isn't a game that lets you run wild, or has any loopholes around the levels. It's not even a game. Kingdom Rush tests your tower-defense skills and stares you down with virtually indestructible enemies. All you have is a small force of 4 simple towers, and a single powerhouse unit to support your other units. And for those of you who just seem to hate magic and medieval-like settings, don't worry. There's snipers with the almighty ""one shot, one kill"" rule, and dwarves with godlike explosives and great sense of ka-boom and mutha-fuka's destruction.			"

												This is a super fun and addictive tower defense game with a great art style and a sense of humor. The special abilities and upgrade paths for each type of tower allow you to be very strategic. The game is constructed so that you unlock various tower upgrades and heroes as you progress. After beating what seems like the final level, you unlock ~10 more (very challenging!) maps. Don't judge by my number of hours played - I often leave games running overnight!			"

												Unlike most Tower Defense games, this one doesn't seem to have an ""optimal pattern"" of turrets that, once discovered, trivializes the rest of the game. It is also one of the more difficult TD games to play in terms of perfect play-throughs... which ought to either delight or frustrate you depending on your personality.This is NOT a maze builder, which is a little sad as I think games that allow for such are a bit more in-depth and complex but it does a good job of making up for that with a series of upgrades for each tower that keep you invested through every wave of every match. There is no lack of content here nor is there any bugs that I have run into yet. It might be a bit ""simple"" compared to some of the heavier titles, but it is still a lot of fun for the price.			"

												Tower defense. Not standard one. This one has nice graphic setting, offers more challenges, you can distribute stars (that you get for completing missions) to some upgrades, upgrade towers, etc. etc. This game is fun AND challenge in one. I can recommend it. And guess what - runs on Linux ;-)			"

												This game is amazing.I've played it for a very long length of time on my IOS device, and it's great to see it's made it's way to steam.This game has no much detail it's breathtaking, being able to sit there messing with your surroundings, or even just staring at the map for ages, noticing something different every time, it's fun.However, I've spent money on the IOS device, buying many characters, and now i regret that. It would be nice to be able to port them over to the computer, so i can have my paid characters, or even some special character unlocked by spending money/buying the IOS game.Totally reccomend it, fun for everyone except codfans.

												Spent quite a few hours playing the browser flash version, make no mistake, this game is awesome. Probably one of my top TD games of all times. Simple enough for anyone to pick it up, yet plenty of unique & diversive towers to give it a modest ammount of depth. Good variety of enemies that will make you re-evaluate that tower branch that seemed so useless. Loving to finally be able to play this in Full HD Widescreen. Cant recommend this game enough.			"

												By far the best Tower Defense game (in my opinion of course!)I love the variety of Heroes and Bosses and even the normal enemies/minions are so cool!The upgrade system is very well done, allowing you to play in a lot of different ways also allowing tons of custom difficulties you can come up with.You may also use 2 upgradable powers which have different cooldowns:。A meteor shower which deals massive damage and can scorch the ground if upgraded。Summon 2 paesants (basic, can be upgraded to legionaries throwing spears at those pesky flying enemies) anywhere to fight for you, very useful to back up your forcesThere is also an insane amount of games/films/younameit references, from Scrat and his beloved nut trapped in an ice block to Frodo Fredo trapped by spiders and many many more to find. TL:DR (Seriously!? Too long : Didn't read? Man you sure don't like reading)PROS+Very high replay value+High variety of heroes,bosses and enemies+High variety of buildings upgrades and skills+Long enough imo (still have to complete some levels)+Secondary campaigns, usually 2 or 3 levels long and much harder than the main campaign+Unique levels+Easter eggs, easter eggs everywhere+Some unique assists on some levels (see that nice cave entrance blocked by ice? How about unleashing a meteor shower on it?)CONS- Can't fight the kraken which sinks the ship on the map menu :cScore3 Stars 1 Iron Fist and 1 Banner /10 Accidently ReviewedThis game was given to me for free by the amazing group Accidently Reviewed

												An awesome tower defense game. You control a hero that can level up during missions. You have talent trees to boost different towers and abilities with free re-specs. The towers are unique in that they can upgrade to different paths and you can choose which tower abilities to upgrade. The difficulty is definitely hard as you go through, but very much satisfying once beat a level. Well done incentive system to play the challenges in order to unlock stars, the currency for the talent trees. I really wish the sequel Frontiers will come to Steam soon.

												Solid Tower Defense game with some nice gags and very good artwork. It doesn't have enormous replay value but there are 20+ maps, each with three playmodes and three difficulty settings. Story is your standard fantasy fare but delivered successfully with tongue-in-cheek humor. Pop culture references work most of the time and add to the cheerful atmosphere.While simple at its core, the gameplay does have some depth to it with four different basic tower types that can be upgraded multiple times with a branching upgrade path and unlockable special abilities. As you progress through the main story you get your hands on more and more heroes. Only one is active per level which let me to replay some of the easier maps just to get a feel for the different heroes and their skills.Overall a very enjoyable gaming experience.			"

												Excellent Tower Defense game with a polished presentation and charming cartoon graphics.The focus is on tower upgrades, you don't make your own mazes which disappointed me at first, but with the large variety of upgrades available there is a lot of depth to the strategy. Instead of shaping the paths the enemies will follow you get to focus completely on tower placement and function, and you will need that focus as the game gets quite challenging in the later levels.The game is available for iOS and Android and there is even a free Flash version available, however this version was completely reprogrammed, features improved graphics and includes all of the extra content available now and in the future. I would highly recommend this to any TD fan and also people curious about the genre as it is easy to pick up with good information, tips and clear design.			"

												I have played a nice handful of Tower Defense games over the years, most of which have been on the iPad.I purchased Kingdom Rush for an insanely low price during the Steam Summer 2014 sale and it is by far my most played game that I purchased during the sale. If you have ever played a tower defense game, you will instantly be familiar with the mechanics of the Kingdom Rush.  If you have not and you are looking at Kingdom Rush as your first foray in to the tower defense genre, you should buy this game and I will give a short, very basic run down of tower defense games for newcomers. Essentially, TD games boil down to this; build towers (your defenses) to stop the increasingly difficult waves of enemies reaching your base. You will start each level with a set amount of lives and 1 live is equal to 1 enemy making it through all of your defenses and reaching your base.  In Kingdom Rush you are able to build a variety of different towers from archer towers, wizard towers, cannon's and a barracks.  All of these towers can be upgraded, for example a Wizard Tower can be upgraded to have spells which teleport enemies further back down the path to give you some more time to deal damage.The art style is great and it compliments the game very well, In my opinion.The audio is nice and at times it can be pretty funny.  Hearing your soldiers from the Barracks yelling ""Freedom!"" or your Wizard Tower shouting ""Might and Magic!"" adds something to the game.  All of the content is unlocked within this one purchase and there is no microtransactions to be seen here.  All heroes are unlocked by simply playing through the campaign.  On the main game screen, a new area with new levels will be added in eventually.  However, this has apparently been there for months and no update has appeared as of yet.This game is easy to learn but it can be extremely difficult to master.  The difficulty can ramp up fairly quickly, so make sure to pay attention to what the earlier levels teach you about your towers.I highly recommend this game, one of the best TD games there is.			"

												One of the best tower defense games I ever played, 2nd comes the Balloons Tower Defense Series, classic of all the Kingdom Rush games out there, from Mobile to PC.The game goes by 4 diffrent Tower classes:Range Tower - Fast attack speed tower, huge rangeMelee Tower - Generate soldiers on the battlefield to the max of 3, purpose: slowing down attackers (and killing them of course).Wizard Tower - Slow attack, great againts armor.Artillery Tower - Very slow tower, perfect for taking down multiple enemies at once.The game upgrade system is based by Stars, you can get over 5 stars each level.The player also has 2 abilities: 1) Summones meteor anywhere you want on the map.2) Reinforcements, same as melee tower but a weaker version despite they become monster killers when maxed out, can be summoned anywhere on the map just like meteor ability.The game atmosphere and art style is a 10/10.Every level depends on its location has music that fits the theme of the map, from Forest music to Snow, Hell to Zombie apocalyps.Highly recommended.

												Well made tower defense game.  The original game is a mobile game, so its operation is simple and graphics are cute.The fun of Tower Defense is to think about the complex enemy pattern and the various strategies to deal with it, and it is really following the rule, without any ""special"" things like roguelike contents, RPG contents, or even FPS contents.If you like tower defense game, I really recommend you to buy this. it's worth it.If you consider buying this game and its sequel(Kingdom Rush Frontier) then I recommend Kingdom Rush Frontier. The patterns of the enemies are more annoying, but the hero system is little tuned.Good : - Simple operation(keyboard 1,2, shift + mouse click) - Simple but cute graphic- Well tuned difficulty(have to try several times for each scenario, even in ""easy"" difficulty.)Bad :- No more update(there are already 2 sequel games)- No reward about the difficulty selection; You can clear all the map by ""easy"" difficulty, or you can do it with ""hard"" but there's no difference at all, except steam achievement(you have to clear all maps with ""hard"" or ""medium"" diffculty)- Tower balance issue; Tesla is GOD			"

I like that enemies are not stronger each wave. Heroic and iron levels are nice addition, but too much hard early.DLC missions are terrible because they are not any more classic TD levels - you have to micromanage your hero too much and use meteors as much as you can. Enemies are just overpowered (look at demon legion, wtf?!, they replicate faster than Smith in Matrix Revolutions!!!)! Only solution is spaming Tesla towers. Very, very bad!UpdateDeveloper added new free DLC which is nice and I upped my mark.7/10			"

												This game is one of the best games I've played, certainly in the Tower Defense genre. The levels do get really difficult after the last level in the story mode. There are levels afterwards, but they're extremly difficult. I would suggest one thing: having a sandbox mode that you could just experiment with towers and the various enemies. But I highly suggest this game if you enjoy tower defense games/strategy games.			"

												I've played this game ever since it came out, like a few years back when I was younger. I still love this game so much. I really reccomend it, 10/10 my favourite TD game. I can't believe it's back with MORE CONTENT! I didn't have to think twice, just bought it straight from the store. ~1000/100 Best TD game I've ever played.			"

												This game is no ordinary TD game, it's not a TD game when you just sit back and watch the action happen. No, it gets really intense, you'll be clicking all over the screen, biting your finger nails as your soldiers get wooped. But every second of it is enjoyable, it just feels so right. To be honest, I wasn't into tower-defense or strategic games, but once I got my hands on this, I totally changed my mind about it. It's just so much fun and anyone can enjoy it. I don't really care if it was a flash game before and people think it's a rip-off, I just want to support the developers in the making of this game. They will be adding more features to this that will be PC exclusive too.All I gotta say is buy this game no matter what! :D			"

												One of the best TD games out there! Great, colorful graphics and animation, high polish!Lets see about those towers! 4 towers, 3 upgrades each and 2 ""Ultimate"" upgrade choices for each tower. And every Ultimate tower has at least 2 abilities that you can purchase! To give an example: the Archer tower shoots rapidly at land or air targets and has a good range. Every upgrade increases range and damage and upon reaching Ultimate level you can choose to turn it into a Ranger tower or a Sharpshooter tower! The Ranger tower has Roots  that can AoE stun and damage many enemies around it and Poison Arrows that deal a potent DoT to whatever they hit. The Sharpshooter tower has the longest range in the game and gets Headshot that deals massive damage or outright 1-hit KOs an enemy and Shrapnel Blast that deals massive AoE damage.Thats just the Archer tower! The other 3 tower types all have their upgrades and 2 Ultimate tower choices!Now, we also have to talk about the Barracks towers. Kingdom Rush was pretty much the pioneer of the barracks type towers in which actual squads of soldiers will come out of them and stand on the creep paths. These soldiers will then block/stop enemies from moving while they do battle! You can, in an area, choose where the squads will gather to protect certain parts of the path! The soldiers have their own hitpoints, damage and once upgarded to their Ultimate forms they can gain all sorts of special attacks and defensive abilities!The enemies are also increadibly varied and Kingdrom Rush sports some of the most interesting enemy types out there. Seriously, they send a new type of enemy at you on almost EVERY single level. Every 5 or so levels you'll get a boss battle and ooooh boy some of them are pretty intense.You also get special Heroes that you unlock as you progress through the campaign and they each have at least 2 special abilites. For example Alera Windrunner summons a tanky sabrecat and has a multishot ability that fires 4-5 arrows at groups of enemies. Heroes can level up to 10 in every battle and will do more damage and power up their abilites. You can freely move them about the battlefield to help out where its most needed!Whew, well, don't want to make this much longer so I'll just say that if you like TD games you really can't go wrong with Kingdom Rush unless you absolutely have to have tower mazing - of which their is none in Kingdom Rush. The Steam version comes with all DLC unlocked and will be strongly supported by the devs with new content and goodies!			"

												Kingdom Rush is a great Tower Defense game and is guaranteed to win over the hearts of any TD player. Anyone remotely interested in a tower defense game should consider it. I played it on the iPad when it was first released, but without any of the heroes and extra campaigns. When I played the game on steam it felt new and challenging.Gamers that think they don’t know TD should give Kingdom Rush a try –I think it might just be what you needed to appreciate the genre.			"

												Alright, for this review, I am mainly going to be focussing on the negative or slight faults of the game, instead of all the positive, for the positive, I will simply say, if you love tower defense games this is one of the best ones ever, the reason it costs 10 bucks is because you are going to get the next campaign free and the hero dlc is free instead of having to pay for it. Now for the negatives. If anyone else can think of more negatives I will add them, as issues are resolved I will take them off the listing.1) The game does not have a send next wave hotkey yet, this is quite annoying especially when you are trying to get those few extra seconds to cooldown your meteor strike.2) Game still does not have cooldown timers for reinforcements and meteor strike within a seconds counter, you have to guess at how much longer.3) Heroes do not gain and keep levels (some may like them loosing it every time I do not)4) Their is no way that I know of to preview the skills of the heroes before taking them into battle, I should be able to see how much actual life, dmg, shielding, and such that they have instead of once again having to guess.5) Some heroes are still subpar (mainly the melee heroes) they need some love.6) You can not access achievements, encyclopedia during battle, I personally don't remember all the weaknesses to the enemies.7) The vetern mode has been taken out of this version of the game, I know some people maybe happy about this, but if I have to replay a lvl I did once before I usually want to do it in vet mode for that last star I missed the time before.8) Encylopdia does not have the ability to roll over a skill for one of your towers and see what it does.9) Hugely limited on the button commands, I do have a keyboard and 2 mouse buttons please give more hotkeys and possibly a use for the right mouse button or at least make it so I can customize the controls, would be awesome if I could do everything with my mouse.10) No benefit from having bought the game on other devices, would be nice if the devs would have given us more of a discount for being loyal customers, many people have bought this game on multiple platforms. Least give us a bonus level or two or something with game launch.			"

												Updated re-release of something that turned the casual scene on fire a few years ago.The x10 increase in download size definitely comes from higher def sound and graphics. +1 to finally being released and congratulations.

												The first entry of the Kingdom Rush series from Ironhide games.Kingdom Rush is one of the long standing Tower Defense games that still holds up to this day against other Tower Defense games. Ironhide has nailed the formula. There are many choices on the placement of the towers and abilities that can be purchased making the gameplay very engaging.Same goes for the heroes that are available that can influence the gameplayer in a variety of ways.One of the few tower defense games that appeals to all skill levels. Ironhide has rescaled the game from their original flash entry and mobile to Steam. It still looks great on big monitors allowing players to be in the thick of the action and still see the big picture.The extra polish definitely shows and will be appreciated by the new to the experienced players.Heres to hoping for the Kingdom Rush Origins to be ported over to Steam.

												Kingdom Rush is a fantastic tower defense. Simple to learn, difficult to master, the levels, enemies, towers, heroes...they're all interesting and fairly different. It's obviously a mobile port but it's done well. I might say that the cons are it doesn't tell you enough information about the towers and units exactly, I don't always know which tower would go best where, that king of thing. But it's a great entry in the genre. Definitely recommend.			"

We can choose a number of improvements to the towers, 2 powers and some heroes, and all that in order to break hordes of various types of opponents. Sometimes you have to think much to pass the level.When it comes to graphics, it is very good and nice for the eyes.The game is simply brilliant and worth any price.I recommend.			"

												Ahhh, what a fun game with nice 2d graphics, animation, and audio. Selection of tower upgrades and mix match-ing them is interesting. I have played this game back on flash version, but this version can run in 1920 and have all of the heroes, I grabbed it on discount ^ ^			"

												While my profile (currently) only shows a very, very short amount of time playing this game. I have played the iOS version of Kingdom Rush 1 and 2 (and this is basically a heavily expanded version of KR1). I've easily put at least 100+ hours into both games, and I've gotten almost max stars on almost all the levels on the hardest difficulties.KR is easily one of my favorite Tower Defense games, I highly recommend it to any TD vet who wants a real challenge!

If you played just one or two, this game could interest you, depending on which ones you played (bad or good ones). If you played many, you can forget this game, sadly. I look forward its sequel. I still recommend it when on sale. For now, Cursed Treasure or Defenders Quest among many are much, much better.			"

												If there is one single mobile title that is worthy of giving it a try - it’s Kingdom Rush. It is a clever tower defence packed with original graphic style and mechanics that demands creative and truly strategic approach to the game. I really liked these small Easter eggs that you can find on different levels. Some of the levels allow extra opportunities like freeing a giant yeti that will help your towers in fighting incoming waves of enemies.There is a decent variety of enemies. Sometimes they spam you with their numbers. On other occasions they regenerate health or ignore certain types of damage. There are few to none universal combinations of towers - you will have to be always ready to send reinforcements and upgrade your towers.All in all, no map seems to repeat others, every level is intriguing and intense.I am really sad that developers couldn’t port the sequels (Kingdom Rush Frontiers and Kingdom Rush Origins) to PC. Hate to play on smartphone.			"

												This is a very fun little tower defence game. It's based on the flash game of the same name, however they updated it with all kinds of new things and a campaign that continued to be in development whilst I was playing, but recently has been completed. Basically with the upgrades, it's good to be careful, otherwise you can mess up and end up penialising yourself badly.Besides that, it's your standard turn-based game with RPG elements for the towers and even the heroes you gain. The heroes start at level 1 on every stage, but level up with the more enemies they kill. I recommend this for anyone who likes fun and querky tower defence games.			"

												Kingdom rush is fun in the beginning, but after a while it becomes a guessing game about the particular order of towers the devs designed each of the levels for. It really doesn't help that some of the levels are so long that you only find out if you were correct ten minutes into the level.The fact that the game doesn't telegraph what you're doing wrong beyond the not enough air defense makes this even more irritating.But it sure is pretty.

												    This review is basically just my opinion about the game.  I've always been a huge fan of tower defense games, just because I might enjoy this game, doesn't mean you will.  If you do like tower defense games, I'm pretty sure you will love this one.      I've played this one a long time on my Android and recently bought it in a bundle.  It's a nice, solid TD. Graphics are nice, sound quality is nice and it offers a lot more than just placing towers.  There's upgrades to those towers as well as upgrades after each level.  You have several champions you unlock over time which actually help out a lot.  There's also skill trees you unlock over time.      I think my only complaint about this is how limited you are on tower placement.  You only have a set amount of tower plots per stage. I really like TD games where it allows me to place them where I want and place as many as can fit.  But really, that's my only complaint.			"

												Just a quick review, having completed the game long ago (before DLC update)This game is a must have for any fan of the tower defense genre. The variety in towers and their uses works well with predefined tower placement areas and no damage numbers.Back when I played this game, I suddenly lost my save file even though I didn't uninstall the game (apparently there is a steam cloud save option now) and had a few bugs that made it impossible to finish some levels (I remember a yeti getting stuck, see SS) unless I restarted them and tried something different.

												24 hours and 67 achievements later...Kingdom Rush has been around for a while, and this is how it started, but ported from Flash and to Steam with some additional content for a relatively good price. quite frankly, this is the best version to own, better than Android/iOS and definitely better than the freemium version on Armor Games website, where the game can be made easier via purchases.so, let's get down to business (+/- for pros/cons respectively.)+ GRAPHICS (or, rather, looks)game looks good. that about wraps it up.+ GAMEPLAYit starts off very simple but gets progressively harder/deeper from there. it's very simple, really, 4 basic towers available, you build them in predefined spots, and you also get to use two spells, rain of fire that deals AoE damage and reinforcements, which are simply reinforcements.+ CONTENTthere's quite a few levels, and there should still be at least few more coming. if you include going for 100% achievements/3 stars on every level/Heroic & Iron challenges that's easily 20+ hours of gameplay. i'm done with the achievements but not the game yet. there's quite a few heroes to choose from too.there's also a meta-game of using stars you get from clearing levels to upgrade tower skill trees, however these are very straightforward most of the time and choice does not matter much.- AIMING MECHANICSi'm just gonna say it - they're clunky sometimes. they tend to target the furthest targetable enemy in the lane they can still reach, that's where trouble comes in. slow firing towers will waste their damage shooting into an enemy that's already dead, artillery tower will shoot a projectile that misses the first time for 90% of the time and enemies will not be blocked by soldiers even though they are in their reach sometimes.- TAPPING MECHANICSsoooooo unsuitable for PC. you have to tap like you would tap a smartphone/tablet to not get your towers frozen in two boss levels, second one being the main boss level which is simply unnacceptable.- MOST POTENT STRATEGIESit boils down to Tesla+Barracks around mid-game, since that is the most powerful strategy given you have upgraded the damage fall-off removal on Artillery skill trees.- BALANCEthere are few enemy types that are just plain overpowered, rendering some tower combos simply obsolete. mainly the enemy that duplicates itself indefinitely uninterupted and enemy that jumps over your reinforcements despite having already gotten involved in combat.- LACK OF OPTIONSit would make life easier for me if i could turn off character callouts since they get a little repetitive with each tower/character/hero having 2-4 phrases they repeat constantly.all in all, it's a great game. small tweaks could be made to make it more enjoyable, but yes, it would become easier then, and difficulty is one thing this game got going for it. it's no rival for Defense Grid, but it's an enjoyable title nonetheless.

												Half way through the game you're fully upgraded. Now you can; waste countless hours trying to figure out how to beat increasing difficult levels with the exact same stuff, or read one the many guides on how to do it, so you can watch little sprites fight each other for countless hours. This game is free on armorgames -- and the sequel is way better, and oddly not available on steam. The game makers are doing it wrong. But, I liked it so much on the website I bought it on steam thinking there would be more content, not less. I got it discounted, so there is that.			"

												Personal Rating: 9 of 10Perfect little tower defense game. One of the best game ever ported from mobile. The game is designed perfectly that it will keep you glued to the game with non-stop action with spells and strategizing your army, upgrades and tower placing. Each towers and even its upgrades are essential to your road to victory. Game progresses with the challenge increasing in a balanced curve. The units and towers are clear cut and precise that you can instantly recognize them with great ease.The only missing point from my rating is that the hero progress resets after each level. I was hoping it would be permanent as it was in the mobile version, but still, this does not really hinder your enjoyment towards the game.Looking forward to the other sequels!			"

												A very nice, clean, and balanced TD.While it's certainly true that this particular game doesn't bring innovation (if you played lots of other TDs, you probably wouldn't find a single element that you haven't seen somewhere else yet), it excels in delivering the traditional TD gameplay without any hiccups and unpleasant moments.It also have enough content to keep you away from boredom for the entire campaing duration, and it have some extra challenges for those wanting harder tasks and/or more mob-killing fun. All quite nicely balanced: you won't be hard pressed to abuse every single option given to you in a level, but it'll require thinking and planning to get a level right (especially so on challenge levels).

Should I also have SSD for it?Is it really so hard to distinguish static content from dynamic content, and render static content to image at build-time - rather than turning user's PC into real-time heavy renderer?And I also need a huge display. Fonts seem to render as raster graphics, and are often hardly visible on my 19''. In windowed mode not visible at all. That's where vector-graphics should have been applied... but no.

												This game is one of the best tower defense games I've come across. I already liked this game before it was on Steam because I had so much fun with the origanal browser version. It does have a few flaws like OP bosses and hard to beat levels but its still fun even if the enemies can be insanley powerful.			"

												I have been a Kingdom Rush fan for a long time and will always be. The reason quite simple, this game revolutionize the very basic of tower defense games. After its launch, most TD games basically a ripoff of this game, which is both awesome and sad. I am very happy they are adding their game on steam. I have never played other TD games that are better than Kingdom Rush ever since!			"

												Pretty proud to say that I'm a huge fan of Armor Games, and of course Kingdom Rush is THE most amazing flash game that I've ever played and I have been through its many earlier versions. And finally I'm more than happy to see its successul conversion from the original flash version which was only around 20MB's large.Although there are certain minor imperfections(such as removing in-battle encyclopedia and some controlling incovniences), the game yet has(again) blown me away. Hopefully it'll be improved with the next few updates.Uniquely cartoonish art style with bright colors, intense but untiring music, and all those lines and quotes always keep you entertained in its easy, funny way. Not to mention the stratigic battles and the hilarious animations!If you are a fan of TD games and haven't tried Kingdom Rush -- you are really missing out. You are so guaranteed that you will love it.And even if you are not really into TD games, you may as well try out this PC version of the over 49 million times of play and 9.7/10 scored little game.Thanks. Alway have fun.: )			"

												Standard and easy to understand tower defense game.It was a browser game before on site's like newgrounds and kongregate.It's a veryfun and challenging towerdefense game.Trying to get 3 stars on each level is not easy you will need to learn a few things and think fast.But there's more difficult than that, you can play on heroic mode or an even more challenging difficult.You can build towers before the first wave come, and them start the fight, you can move your soldiers and hero to a better position any time you want.it's a very well polished game, i tottaly recommend it for those that like tower defense games.

												I realize it's just another tower defense game but this one has some charm.Not quite sure what it is about this game, probably the art style... It looks like something cooked up by Dan Paladin from The Behemoth, the genius' behind games such as Alien Hominid, Castle Crashers and Battle Block Theater. If Dan didn't  have anything to do with the art for this game, then he should be getting some royalties.Great game, easy enough campaign with some added challenge modes to each map to cater to the hard core TD players. It's really not just your average TD, it has soul. It's a lot of fun watching things happen in this game where as most TD games are boring but the variety of animation is astouding... There's lots of things happening and lots of tricks the enemy units can pull on you, sometimes there's more to them than meets the eye... like transformers, except not as Robosexual.It has some MOBA / Warcraft III elements in it with the way hero's work, they're essentially on auto mode but you can move them around the map like a mobile tower. They all have strengths and weaknesses and some are better for certain maps than others so it's fun to experiment.The meat and potato's comes with the variety of tower structures. There are only four towers in the game but they can evolve in to two different types each, for a total of 8 towers all with very different abilities that are fun to synergize together.The music is great, the campaign is a decent size and will keep you busy for a while... there are also extra missions and hero's that unlock after the campaign is over so the fun doesn't stop there.It was a great buy for 7.50. I hear a lot of people complaining the game can be played for free on kongregate or purchased for a dollar on android devices but the game is a lot more polished on steam, I compared them myself. You can't really complain when the original game had microtransactions and if you wanted all the extra content it would cost you over 10 dollars.On steam all the content is unlocked through progression... although there looks to be an expansion pack in the works as it's clearly stated on the level selection screen that some new area is ""coming soon"".

												This is a fun tower defense game.  I like the medival theme of the game.  If you like tower defense games you'll love this.  How you play is, there's a path on every map and you have to keep the enemies from making it to the other side.  There's several waves every round.  All you have to do is select a tower plot and choose a tower to build.  You earn more gold the more enemies you defeat.  Easy right?  This game has a nice level of challege as you advance and you have to put more thought about how you'll arrange your towers.  This game is also on iPhone but this PC version is better.  I recommend this game to those who like to keep gaming simple and even the hardcore gamers who just want a simple game to relax with.  It's very well made.			"

												I loved Kingdom Rush As A Kid. It was a fantasy tower defence game and it started out as a Flash game and later on it camed to app and to Steam. Steam is a little bit better than Flash because it had more levels and towers were fixed. The game had memorable enemies, memorable towers, good Music, allot of refences (like Bombardiers said Hail To The King Baby) and also had Landskapes that fit well with fantasy. The Villian Vez´nan is a stereotypical villian but i still loved him, i mean he doesnt do anything and sends his enemies but my good his a fan Of Many Villians and Dark side users. His the icon of the entire Kingdom Rush Series and had many appearances in other video games like ToToTemple. You can also get steam cards wich has only 5 cards to make a stamp. Big bertha is my favorite tower not because it has Rockets and looks better than tesla its because it wrecked the entire enemies and i use tesla when dealing with Hordes of enemies but most of the time you need to use Tesla.Pros+Good level design+Good music+Memorable enemies+Steam Cards+Towers are great+Even More Memorable Villian Vez´nan+Good graphics+Funny+You can fully complete the entire AchievementsCons-Heroes (the only best heroes out there are Oni, Hacksaw and Elonora)-Some towers are overpowered like Sorcerers and Tesla-Some towers are least used like Big Bertha and Musketeers-Early levels music is pretty blandThats all to say but ill have to say Its actualy my opinion the best tower defence game of all time and later on theres gonna be a sequel.

												I've beaten this game in its entirety on armorgames and then again on kongregate when I lost my save, and I can honestly say that even after two previous run-throughs I have no regrets purchasing it for steam. This game has probably given me 60+ hours of free gameplay online and I absolutely want to support the developers so they can continue to make sequels and DLC. The heroes all being free and the resolution being upgraded to a crisp HD is just a huge bonus, I'd have bought it without either.			"

What it lacks in storyline it makes up for in the balanced range of towers and upgrades.Personally I find the hero system to be unnecessary in the long run, but it adds more depth to the strategy required. The removal of microtransactions from the iOS version was a great call, and I'm pleased that they are adding free updates.Also try the sequel - it adds a whole new set of towers!			"

I found out just today that it came over to Steam, and after playing a few levels at glorious 1440p 144fps, I have nothing else to say other than PERFECT. It's the second best Tower Defense game there is on my personal list, and it's highly recommended. Specially with the 80% off offer.			"

												I'd recommend anyone who is interested in tower defense games such as this title.I've played Kingdom Rush 1 when it was released on Armor Games back then, then was made available at Kongregate. Also played Kingdom Rush 2 on my smartphone, very impressed that I have yet to experience any lag. Then, played KR2 on Kongregate. Seeing that KR has been released on Steam, I would support them because they have yet to disappoint me. Though, to unlock more heroes and other bonuses, you had to pay through microtransactions. This game here on steam eliminates all of that.Art style is nice, sprite animation is great & seamless, and the colors are easy on the eyes. For $7.50 w/ a -25% discount, it's a steal. I'd still pay the full amount for the content and hours I've placed in the game.			"

In addition to being possibly the best tower defence game ever, the iOS version's in-app-purchase heroes are all included at no extra cost here (Steam seems to only allow gratuitous microtransactions for model train games) and this version looks surprisingly good in 1080 widescreen.

												So glad to see this on Steam :) If you love tower defense, you just have to try Kingdom Rush, the best tower defense I've played so far.Too bad there are no diamond system like the phone versions, makes the iron levels a LOT more challenging.Would love to see the Frontiers tied into this if anyway possible (We paid 7 times more than the phone app versions! Give us Frontiers already, rawr).Oh and please fix the meteors, they drop much faster on the top area of the screen than the middle and bottom, it spoils the feel of playing a 2.5D game.			"

												If you like tower defense games then this is one of the best out there.  I've played the flash game, the iOS and Android versions and loved them!   The only problem with the Steam version is the lack of a shop for buying boosters using in-game money earned during gameplay.  So 4/5 stars, full marks if they decide to include this - either way not a deal breaker.			"

												Played the browser version a while ago, and it's just like that except that you unlock more levels later on. I don't recall if the browser version has heroes or not, but this does which makes me like the Steam version more and they're already unlocked so you don't have to spend more $. It looks like they're adding more heroes and levels later on, so I'm looking forward to that. Replay value is high IMO since after you beat the levels, there are 2 other challenging modes to try.I'm not much of a fan of the TD genre, but I highly recommend this.			"

												I loved playing tower defence when it was first invented in the custom maps in warcraft and starcraft. Each level in this game takes about 15 - 20 minutes to complete (assuming you make it to the end!), making it perfect for the casual gamer whos not afraid of a bit of strategy. I was pleasantly supprised with the added bonus levels which are awarded to you after you beat the main campaign. These extra levels, have a considerable higher difficulty, which really get you planning out your builds, and aniticipating whats to come in the next wave. There are also 2 extra challenge modes for each level, which really do add to the replayability to them. I really like this game, (and most well done tower defence games) which is why I bought it during its release sale at $7.50. Even at sale price, the amount does seem a little high for this game, but, for me, it was worth it. For those who are not as TD and strategy savvy as I, I'm sure there will be a better price on this game in the future. I think $5 is fully justified for this game.			"

												What can I say about this game other than its fantastic. The version created for steam trumps the iOS version by far, with no additional costs for heroes, premium content or microtransactions, if you're a TD type of person or ever thought you wanted to give it a try, the Steam version of Kingdom Rush is for you.Let me begin on the first day I was introduced to the flash version of this game I ended up being hooked. It was so easy to get into, gave me hours of entertainment and laughs and even some aggrivation whilst trying to figure out how to complete each level with 3 stars. By the time I had finished the original campaign mode of the 12 levels, I couldn't believe that a game such as this one, with the graphics, gameplay, voice acting, music score and overall enjoyability, was free! I felt like it should've been worth something! Which is what happened with the iOS version. However... I'm not a fan of purchasing a game only to have a ton of microtransactions needed for the full experience. Premium content wasn't included, no heroes etc. That wasn't a good way to go about it in my books at least. Left much to be desired...That is why the day it released on steam I had no reservations or hesitation on buying it and diving right back into it. Now it included all the premuim content and all the heroes and has a promise of more to come ontop of that!The Steam version's gameplay is smooth and enjoyable. I only had one hiccough on an Iron Challenge level with a certain enemy getting stuck on the edge of the map for a few attempts. The issue eventually resolved itself, but Iron Hide has been very good about providing bug fixes to this game in a timely matter so I expect that'll be fixed over soon.The graphics for this game are fantastic! Each level has its own attention to detail, the NPC's and enemy's movements are smooth and while some might argue the cartoonish animation is childish and unappealing, I beg to differ! I absolutely love it!The sound in this game is amazing! The music in this game is simply stellar. It brings the right amount of emotion to each level. When I hear the boss music que up, I always felt my pulse quicken and the sense of urgency rise as if I needed to pump up my offense and defense and quickly! Any game thats able to do that with a simple musical score is worth your time to look at. Not to mention the voice acting! I nearly died the first day I upgraded my Dwarven artillery to the Big Bertha, added a rocket only to hear ""Yippie Kai-yay mother *BEEP""! I remember going out of my way to upgrade my dwarven towers just to be able to hear that one line over and over. And still to this day I get a giggle out of it.I just finished this game 100% now on all levels and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I had hours, hours of enjoyment! And I will definitely play it again and again, not just because I want to see how I could complete each level with different strategies, but because it is simply fun!So granted there are some bugs with the game so far, the purchase price of 10 bucks is so worth it! I mean, there are so many people who are willing to throw 50 bucks or more out the window for games that are absolute garbage and here you have the chance to get a great game with high replay value for 10 bucks! It has great graphics, great music, great acting... you can't get much better than that!			"

												An engaging, addictive and moreish tower defense game with an undeniable appeal. This is one of the most well loved TD games yet to be made, and a short time playing will reveal why. With a simple four tower starting point, your ability to strategize will soon be put to the test with the varied upgrades and heroes at your disposal. Where other TD games might require no more than a cursory glance once you have your towers set up, Kingdom Rush begs your constant attention as you will need to micromanage your positioning and spell usage to stand a chance of passing some of the more complex levels. While a beginner could win through, only practise, strategy and luck will ensure you a top rating level score. In short, this game is a must-play for any fan of the TD genre, and should easily convert non fans, if they're willing to give it the chance it deserves.			"

												I first played this game on armor games.com It was great and I loved it. However the Steam Version is something much superior. Firstly you get all heroes which makes the game a lot easier. Secondly you get instant updates and all the bell and whistles associated with the excellent Steam service. I reccomend this game to all tower defense connisuers. This game is mindboggingly tough even on normal difficulty. Especially if you dont play with the proper strategy, Reccomend to all.			"

												This is one of the best tower defense games out there. It is so well balanced that every map gives a decent challenge and offers tons of replay value. It was a nice variety of maps and towers and enemies. You really have to plan out your defense and not just plant towers down haphazardly. The Steam achievements really add to the experience. This was how the game was meant to be played, not on a 4 inch screen!			"

												I'd recommend anyone who is interested in tower defense games such as this title.I've played Kingdom Rush 1 when it was released on Armor Games back then, then was made available at Kongregate. Also played Kingdom Rush 2 on my smartphone, very impressed that I have yet to experience any lag. Then, played KR2 on Kongregate. Seeing that KR has been released on Steam, I would support them because they have yet to disappoint me. Though, to unlock more heroes and other bonuses, you had to pay through microtransactions. This game here on steam eliminates all of that.Art style is nice, sprite animation is great & seamless, and the colors are easy on the eyes. For $7.50 w/ a -25% discount, it's a steal. I'd still pay the full amount for the content and hours I've placed in the game.			"

												it's rare that i really like a game. most games that others rave about i like but don't find them particuarly extraordinary. (i said most) kingdom rush is one of those rare games that i find myself really liking. i played the web version over at armor at first but bought it as soon as i realized it was on steam. and without microtransactions, fantastic.more content, even better.the only gripes i have are that there aren't even more maps, more upgrades, and an endless mode (admittedly an endless mode probably wouldn't work with KR game mechanics as they currently stand).i'm hoping they bring KR Frontiers to steam as well, but that'll be while i imagine if the time it took for KR to get on steam is any indication.anyway, i enthusiastically recommend it.

												It's a fiddly 2D tower defense game with active abilities, units to control, setting rally points, and different upgrade paths for towers. You have to think on your feet and adjust your strategeries. Some maps require more magic, others require more martial strength, and I often find myself hitting a wall a few times before I realize I have to do a topsy turvy in my approach. The art style is highly stylized and cartoonish, with bouncy units careening across your screen and lots of yelling like ""To battle!"" and ""Fully loaded!"".I can only take so much of this game at a time and it's honestly not my favorite tower defense game out there. It's an ugly mobile port. But I've seen worse, at least it doesn't tell you to ""tap this or that"" or go to a cash shop.			"

												I find this weird why they sell it on steam, You can just play it on the internet? Atleast that's what I remeber from the past. I just wanted to support the authors because I like the game. You get updates when you buy it though like maps and stuff for example. Either way it's a great game if you like tower defences. It's easy, Simpel, Childish. What do you want more?BUTConsider the bad reviews, Most of em are true... Its great and all but...First of all It it's not worth the current price.Second of all it's not like you have your own way of completing a level, Every level has it's own few ways to complete. Meaning that it's easy to fail if you don't do it in the right order.There are only 4 towers, and each only has 2 different out comes.Heroes are great, they are like your own character ingame that you can move and attack with. But i think they work kinda sloppyThe ideas are great but as I said before, it's simpel, meaning it's smallSo if you can get this for like 2.50 or something I think it's perfect			"

												This is one of the harder TD's out there, for me at the very least. Very fun, challenging, with plenty of levels, different modes, heroes and upgrades. It's very fun, I'm not too sure on the $11 (CAN) price tag, but I got it on sale for $3 (CAN) and is very very worth it.So far I'm not even done half of the campaign and I'm 6 hours in, that being said I'm completing each levels 3 different modes as I go, but plenty to do for sure!Definitely recommend getting this one, even more so if you can get it on sale like I did			"

												This game seems like it should be a facebook game but you know its not, its really ♥♥♥♥ing fun actually I had allot of fun playing this one early morning and just you now having a good time I was loving this game and I really enjoyed the gameplay style it does get allot harder after you beat The Juggernaut and there are allot of things that you can unlock and play. This game is very succesful and is priced just the right way, if they wanted more people to buy it maybe they should lower it to $5.99.			"

												Kingdom Rush is the best game I've ever played on my iPhone. If you've never played Kingdom Rush, I would recommend getting it for your phone when it's on sale. However, if you don't have that option or would rather play on a PC, then this is still a great game. I prefer it on phone, despite the paid content, because I think the balance is better. Since all the additional content is included in the PC version, they had to mess with unit attributes to prevent overpowering units from breaking the game. That said, if you thought the phone version was too easy at times, or if you want to experience the paid phone content, you might prefer the PC version.			"

												I like this game, but I don't have the imagination or...lifespan to write a full review, so here's a pancake recipe to quench your hunger that an in-depth game review could fulfill:)Ingredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

												This game is EXTREMELY addictive! Each level only takes between 10 and 15 minutes so it is a good game to play when you don't have much time. I used to play the demo of this game (free) that had levels 1-5 I think, and I was so happy that it came out on steam. The enemies are so diverse and the tower upgrades are perfect. My favorite part is the Hero addition. Who wouldn't want a super epic hero alongside your soldiers on a fantasy tower defense battlefield? With seemingly even more planned for the future of this game with more levels of campaign missions, I expect this will be a popular seller and rightfully so!			"

												First found this little gem on Newgrounds.com. Played it almost to completion then. Kingdom Rush is the best tower defense game out there. It has beautiful graphics, nice music and sound effects, an intuitive UI and more than enough content to justify the pricetag. Many complain that the game is available for free as a flash game on certain websites. This version has alot more content than the free version and buying here supports the developers that deserve your money. My only complaint is that two more have released and they havent found their way on to Steam. Hey Ironhide, show us some love too. If you are worried that the game just doesnt have enough depth to hold your attention very long, consider this. There are loads of levels, lots of unlockable heroes, a skill tree with tons of skills and more. The game was also updated recently with more heroes and another campaign. There really is no negative I can level against this game. If you enjoy tower defense games, buy it.			"

												I played Kingdom Rush for free at Armor Games years ago, and was immediately addicted. I blew through the whole thing within the span of a couple of days. I was browsing around Steam when I found this here, and asked myself, ""Why would anyone buy this? Don't they know it's free at Armor Games?"" Well, I did some reading, and supposedly they added some content and some DLC, so I went ahead and bought it. After all, even if the extra content was bogus, it was still an amazing game worth paying for, and I definitely wanted to support these guys. I was pleasantly surprised with how gracefully the game aged. They applied a fresh coat of HD paint to the game, and added Heroes, whom you pick up along the way. Heroes aren't just a gimmick either- they add to the game in a way that the game actually really benifits from. You select one before your battle, and you can guide your hero around the battlefield wherever they're needed most, which gives you more to do than just sit there and watch your towers work. In fact, I completely forgot about the reinforcements button after the addition of Heroes. As my favorite Tower-Defense title, let me tell you that if you played it for free at Armor Games, it's still entirely worth the buy, especially right now since it's marked down by 25%. Great work Iron Hide. I'm completely happy with my purchase, and I encourage anyone who's looking for a charming but challenging Tower Defense game to give this one a whirl.			"

												I've played a ridiculous amount of the Flash version of this game, and I always come back for more.  It's deep but accessible, and the gameplay is very polished.  And even as a very experienced player, I've still put something like 13 hours into the Steam version and I still have a few things left to beat.  There's a lot of excellent content here, and more is (theoretically, hopefully...) coming.Also, for those of your with touchscreens or playing this on a tablet, the touch controls are solid.  I'm shocked at how many games get that wrong.			"

												The tower d genre has been done to death, and the first few levels made me think there wasn't anything special here.  But once you get about 7-8 levels in, the difficulty ramps up and you are forced to make interesting decisions.  You have a limited number of tower spots, diverse enemy and good balance between the towers.  There isn't one clear ""make this tower and win.""			"

												I think I must've put over 200 hours into this game before it was released on steam.The gameplay is very smooth and has a sensible learning curve which also introduces more challenges and strategy based gameplay around the 4th or 5th level. There are only 4 towers but this keeps you thinking about which towers to place, most enemies have their weaknesses and strengths. The 4 different towers can all be upgraded to different towers, you have to choose very carefully.Your hero, soldiers and reinforcements are very stupid, they are short-sighted and would rather hit enemies with a bow and get beaten to death rather than stay away and shoot skin piercing arrows that can easily finish them off. I do not like this and think you should have more control over your heroes, soldiers and reinforcements.The graphics are good, they are enjoyable, cartoony but simple at the same time. This means that you can play this game on something like a netbook. I don't really care about good graphics, I think high resolution and high framerate is good enough for me.Unlike on the iPad, there are no ingame purchases available which I personally think is a good thing. You unlock heroes in by progressing through the game, the traditional way of playing.On some levels you can repair buildings to access the ability to train warriors or you can break ice that is blocking a friendly sasquatch from fighting for you. You can also click on sheep several times for them to explode into a bloody mess. I like that. Infact there is even an achievement for making sheep explode into a bloody mess. I really like that.If you beat a level succesfully, you will get 3 stars. If you loose a few lives, you get 2 stars. If you had a hard time completing it and lost a load of lives you only get 1 star. You can spend these stars to get bonuses for your towers or special abilities so you often find yourself visiting old levels trying to get stars to complete a level you're stuck on.Great game, definitely worth $9.99. I'd give this 9/10.			"

												Kingdom Rush is a nice trasition, from portable and flash version. This one poses some nice extras compare to armor game version (the only one i playd). Hero mehanic seamd to be improved, ( althou i would like them to be more like in Frontier for example upgreading them betwin mission for all thous extra stars), and generaly right now they are able to gain lvl 10 on evry map whit aproximetly 16 waves and actualy not dying - big plus armor games. Unfortunatly i already found some bugs: terminator achivment althou was active on my steam account, in game is still not active, second sometimes thers no on map indicators to spawn mobs, only highlight button show you you can summon them. Another negative thig about this releas is ... well this game is not finished. You can see it in all thous detales in game (check out all the portraits from baraks), and thers no promised additional campaign (comming soon ;/ ). Armor games you acctualymade us waiting for this re-releas more then a year, and give us nothing new, althou you promis that ... it's leave a bad afterteast in my mouth especialy after your treatment of us for this whol time. And last but not least: where the dificulti level ? You menage to do it on armorgames ... . Also i miss additional content you get on armor games for supporting this game.

												I played Kingdom Rush for free at Armor Games years ago, and was immediately addicted. I blew through the whole thing within the span of a couple of days. I was browsing around Steam when I found this here, and asked myself, ""Why would anyone buy this? Don't they know it's free at Armor Games?"" Well, I did some reading, and supposedly they added some content and some DLC, so I went ahead and bought it. After all, even if the extra content was bogus, it was still an amazing game worth paying for, and I definitely wanted to support these guys. I was pleasantly surprised with how gracefully the game aged. They applied a fresh coat of HD paint to the game, and added Heroes, whom you pick up along the way. Heroes aren't just a gimmick either- they add to the game in a way that the game actually really benifits from. You select one before your battle, and you can guide your hero around the battlefield wherever they're needed most, which gives you more to do than just sit there and watch your towers work. In fact, I completely forgot about the reinforcements button after the addition of Heroes. As my favorite Tower-Defense title, let me tell you that if you played it for free at Armor Games, it's still entirely worth the buy, especially right now since it's marked down by 25%. Great work Iron Hide. I'm completely happy with my purchase, and I encourage anyone who's looking for a charming but challenging Tower Defense game to give this one a whirl.			"

												I've played a ridiculous amount of the Flash version of this game, and I always come back for more.  It's deep but accessible, and the gameplay is very polished.  And even as a very experienced player, I've still put something like 13 hours into the Steam version and I still have a few things left to beat.  There's a lot of excellent content here, and more is (theoretically, hopefully...) coming.Also, for those of your with touchscreens or playing this on a tablet, the touch controls are solid.  I'm shocked at how many games get that wrong.			"

												A great tower defense like game, send troops and heros where you want, and use special abilities such as fire storms, and having civilians join the battle. Only four tower type, but towers can be evolved into unique and powerful hybrid like towers, such as you can upgrade your barracks to train paladins, then give the paladins perks such as critical striking, sheild boosters, and increasing healing rate.

												I'm crazy about Tower Defense games. I have played and finished like 10 ~ 15 games of this genre, and this one is the 2nd on my list. Don't think this game is easy because of the first levels, try the ""hard"" dificulty if you want to suffer, but going through 8 or 10 levels the things start getting really hard. You can play with some heroes to help you out, and that is super fun. If you like tower defense games, this one is on top of the list.			"

I have all 3 versions on my IPad and love them all. 10/10			"

												Probably one of the best, if not THE best tower defense series I've ever played.  Unfortunately they only have this one on Steam, but they have two more available, a prequel and a sequel available on the mobile Android OS.Works a bit like your standard TD game, however you have heroes that you fight with in battles with ranging classes, as well as a skilltree that you earn points/stars for as you progress through the campaign.  These talents buff either your towers, reinforcements, or spells.This game has good graphics for being a mobile port, easy controls, a nice UI, excellent replayability, and most importantly it's tons of fun.  I would highly recommend any game in this series both here on Steam and on mobile, I actually just bought the prequel yesterday.(I actually like the prequel a bit more, even though it's a lot harder.)

												Fantastic Tower Defense game.  I have thourghly enjoy the Flash and mobile versions of this game along with Kingdom Rush Frontiers.  The game has an easy learning curve, but can be quite diffult even for vetern players.  There are people who will complain you can play the same game for free, however in this version all the extra content unlocked.  Like most F2P game there is a understanding of microtransactions to unlock extra content. This is the case for the ""Free"" mobile version of this game.  I gladly pay to support this devolper especally having played there other versions for quite some time.			"

												Utterly rage-inducing. I've never been this frustrated by a TD game ever before; the only standout feature it has to distinguish it from other TD games is its extreme difficulty. For some maps I resorted to looking at walkthroughs, only to find that the game's been rebalanced to make a lot of strategies weaker, so the strategy that worked perfectly in the walkthrough isn't even *remotely* viable in the current game.Doesn't support cloud save, which is forgiveable. What's not forgiveable is that it stores all its saves in Program Files like it's 1995, so if you need to uninstall to make space or whatever, you need to know ahead of time where the save is hidden in order to back it up. So far as I'm concerned this is an instant fail on technical grounds.			"

												Can not recommend this game, because for some players this is not even a game. This is a non working executable. First time (after years and more than a houndred steam apps) of having something not work for me in steam.TLDR: Tried everything, including official support, no response from their team. Payed $10 to have nothing. Absolutely nothing.Starting configuration menu is invisible. Can press enter to play, but the game crashes upon loading the first level. Tried reinstalling video drivers, windows redistributables, verifying integrity of game cache.Was lured by pretty videos, but can not recommend an unstable game. What's happening 6 months after steam release (and an expansion after)? They require you to send crash logs, because they think content > stability. Way to go, ironhide.Besides all the steps detailed, after more than a week and instructions in the forum sticky, still no response from their tech support.Edit: Many months have passed and still no response, though the game works now. Game is about 3/5, with customer support 0/5.			"

Posted: March 30, 2015
												FIrst i'll say I love this game. It is an interesting, unique take on tower defense with lots of fun to be had. However I can't recommend this to anyone for a lot of reasons.First of all it's a mobile game that was ported to PC and it was ported very poorly. It is riddled with a lot of little bugs that hurt your ability to play the game on PC. One example is the poisoned arrows upgrade for ranger towers should always prioritize non-poisoned targets over poisoned ones, and should also prioritize targets that CAN be poisoned over targets that are immune. Well, they don't in the PC version. This bug has existed since release and was never fixed. It changes your strategy for dealing with some things because on the mobile version when it's working perfectly the poison upgrade makes the tower shoot necromancers only, ignoring the skeleton swarms around them, to kill them off so they stop summoning more. In the buggy, broken PC version they shoot skeletons and the skeletons are immune to poison altogether.Second, it is unsupported. It will never have any of it's bugs fixed, it will never have any additional content added. The developers used this as a one-time cash grab and now they have washed their hands of steam altogether. The mobile version has an endless mode where you can just go wave after wave until you're defeated and let you try to get on the leaderboard for having the best strategy. PC version didn't deserve this feature in any form. Very disappointing since it's the most fun part of the game on mobile after you ""finish"" it.Third, you can play this game for free in flash online on many different websites. The flash version has 3 of the heroes in this version, but allows you to purchase additional heroes for money. However these additional heroes are entirely not needed, the ones you are given for free are more than enough to complete the game on the hardest difficulty in every mode. This version only has about 7 or 8 levels that the completely free version doesn't have, and again, you can purchase those bonus levels if you desire.Despite playing the flash version, when I saw this on steam I bought it up quickly because I loved the game and thought I was buying something worth buying. But after the fact I found out they won't be fixing any of the bugs, they won't be adding endless feature, and they're also not adding the newer kingdom rush games to steam or PC at all, and lost all faith in the company and am sorry to have given them a single cent of my money. But it won't happen again.So to summarize, everything enjoyable about the game you can play for free online, buying it here only gets you bugs and problems and less features.			"

												Kingdom rush was okay. It doesn't hold a candle to Defense Grid though. Having the ability in a TD game to rewind a few waves WITHOUT having to go back to the start is a crucial feature, and Kingdom rush doesn't have it. The art was beautiful, sound was somewhat annoying after awhile, but that seems common with a TD game. Not worth it unless you're a huge fan of TD.			"

												PLEASE UNDERSTAND THIS REVIEW IS OVER TWO YEARS OLD AS OF THIS EDIT.  The information may not be correct anymore and apparently they have patched things into the game since.  Please keep that in mind when reading this review!  I still recommend the mobile version thoughoriginal review:The mobile version of this is far superior.  They've taken the microtransactions out of the original game(Frontiers still has them) and the ability to earn the gems as you play to get useful items to make the harder levels more manageable is nice.  Something on top to earn even if you don't perfect a level.  The PC version not only lacks these(I can't imagine trying some of the endgame bonus levels on hard without at least one extra gold bag to start me off with or an ice wand), but it also has frankly unacceptable load times, with the average for me being 45 seconds or so.  Which is ridiculous for a glorified flash game/mobile game on a pretty strong PC.  Being able to hotkey reinforcements and such is a plus, but it doesn't outweigh the handiness of the touchscreen.  I made it a bit over halfway through the campaign before deciding the PC version's not my thing.Get the mobile version.  IOS or Android, either one is fantastic.  I would recommend not getting this on PC though.			"

												Firstly this game is available free to play as a browser game which I had been playing for many a year, and did not even realise this game was on steam untill recived as part of an indie bundle.If you like tower defence games and are unsure about buying this then check out the browser version, as to be honest differences between the browser version and the steam version are not worth the £6.99 asking price. If however you can get it for £1.99 or less then I would recomend it.Sadly with the steam version they missed a trick,it lacks replayability due to the lack of any kind of scoreboard. Dueing missions you get 1 to 3 stars based on performance and thats it, the only replayability is to get 3 stars in each mission, I just wish they had something like in defence grid with a score based on time / unspent gold / lives remaining etc etc or something simlar to give reason to reply the game.With 3 stars up for grabs each level with a max obtainable of 120 thats 40 levels and in 80 ish minuites i've completed 10  and thats with some afk time.The level deigns / layouts are good, the towers while they may seem limited in variety have intresting upgrades that completely change what they do, so why it may seem there are only 4 different towers theres more like 16.I'm not going to go into any more depth about the game as it is avail for free to play and within 30 mins play you will get to see most of which is on offer and if you like it and its cheap then buy it for the trading cards and chevos on steam.It is a good game but based on the fact its short, lacks replayability and is avail to play free as a browser game I can not reccomend this game to buy at its current asking place.If you want some free tower defence goodness checkout cursed treasure, gem craft and desktop tower defence. All are fine games.			"

This game's difficulty starts off painfully easy, then quickly escalates to agonizingly hard. The strategy guides (Yeah, I watched them. This game is HARD!) on the official website are for the wrong version of the game, so they don't always work (such as, in the final levels, the player in the video uses premium content exclusive to the free flash version). I love this game, and would play it for hours, but it has very limited gameplay unless you are very good at it. Don't waste your money; get it on iOS instead.			"

												It's well built and everything functions as it is supposed to work. There is a visible progression as you clear levels. It's very well presented. I find it lacking, though - partially because of the control implementation (I find myself instinctively slamming the space bar to pause the game, one time my cursor got stuck in the 'rally troops' cursor shape and I couldn't figure out how to get rid of it), mostly because it doesn't do anything original in a genre that has stagnated so badly I've found it as exciting as watching paint dry.

												This is NOT a good tower defense game. Just compare a few pieces to any other decent TD game:Does it have pathing? NoCan you win later levels (or even early ones) on the basis of your tower (defence) alone? NoDoes it require intense micromanaging on most (and especially later) levels? AbsolutelyAre there levels where there is essentially only one way to win? YepAre there very obvious holdover elements from its mobile roots? TAP TO UNFREEEEZE TAP! TAP! TAP!It puts on a good front, it looks cutesy, the barrier to entry (during a sale) is pretty low, and there's lots of easy to get achievements. What you will miss out on if you play this versus another, more polished tower defence game, like Defence Grid or Anomaly, is FUN. Also, a lot of the core mechanics that have made TD games less of a chore and more of a puzzle. Go buy one of those instead.			"

												Tower defense is a passion of mine.  Some try to be visually fun, some think they need to add something to the genre and some feel like a simple flash games.  Replace ""some"" with ""this game"" and you've got a grammatically difficult sentence that is accurate none the less.The flash game references is a little unfair, as this game really does have solid visuals and quality execution, but at the same time it seems that there's nothing it gained from being a standalone game apart from the ability to charge people for it.Kingdom Rush is fixed position tower defense with the addition of a ""hero"" that can roam around the battle field (at your direction) and activated abilities to throw down some temporary defenses or a fireball from the heavens.  Progressing is had during the rounds by upgrading your towers and your hero leveling up (levels that only persist for each game) 'causing him/her to do more damage and have a greater amount of hitpoints.  Progression out of game is served by spending stars (1, 2, or 3 stars are given for successful completion of a level, based on how well you did) to increase the strength of towers or powers.In total, there are about twenty levels with your typical late-game unlocks for harder mobs or sudden death (single life) runs in that level.  Level design has your typical duel entry, duel exit, splits, joins, bypasses that you've seen in other fixed map tower defense games.Kingdom Rush is unexcitingly typical tower defense.  It may sate that occasional tower defense game, and while it may be a fun play on a tablet, that'd only if you compare it to the poor quality of the tower defense in the Android and iOS ecosystems.  I'd call this a buy at $3.  It's well drawn, but simple.  Level designs lack inspiration.  Progression lacks anything new or intriguing.Visuals 5Gameplay 4Slant 3Overall : 40 "

												Not a bad tower defense game, but there are many better ones. Graphics are okay, but the units are so small that the differences between them are not that easy to notice at a glance.There are some good ideas like the hero units. Not a great deal of different towers, but there are enough.The biggest problem for me with this game is that the selection pointer is not big enough on my large screen 27"" monitor. It sometimes takes me precious seconds of moving the pointer around trying to find where the pointer is when I should be selecting towers. Unfortunately this somewhat spoils the game for me, otherwise it probably worth buying.			"

												Well, it started off as a good game BUT there are improvements that need to be made for sure. The selection controls are absolutely HORRIBLE. Very bad. Selecting your hero at times is just plain frustrating (play it to mid game and you'll see what I'm saying). Going from hero selection to structure (or vice versa) is equally frustrating. It definitely does NOT have smooth controls. I am curious how such an oversight skipped testing. Did the developers not play the game? Also, the hero and footman AI are pretty bad. Your unit can be standing right next to an enemy creep and he won't attack simply because it is not on the same horizontal plane, even though they're pretty much touching. In short, this is a decent game that could have been great. It has some rather big flaws that makes the game a bit frustrating. I would say my stance on this game is neutral but as there is no neutral selection I am choosing ""No"" for recommendation.			"

												Kingdom Rush is a flash-style tower defense game that has been around for a while on sites such as kongregate.com, miniclip.com, or armorgames.com. While it has high quality for a browser game, I think it should have stayed there.Plot 5/10You are a nameless general that is saving a kingdom from eeeeeviiil. It's not that bad, but not good, either. The purpose is served well enough. Won't rag on this.Sound 9/10The sounds are terrific, and fit everything very well. They also add to the game's visual style. The voices probably steal the show on this game, though. They're corny, over-acted sometimes, but always funny, distinct, and fun. KR also has comedic references to other media including Portal, Half-Life, Star Wars, Die Hard, the Bible, and many others. The sound is KR's pride with the exception of the music. While entertaining, there's about 3 tracks that last 30s long and are set to loop. It just could have been a bit better.Graphics 10/10The graphics too are wonderful, colorful, and stylish. Visually the game isn't too flashy, which is good because it clears up visual clutter. With so many things moving on screen at once, the visuals organize everything to give the player what they need to see. Enemies are fun and recognizable. KR's visuals are spot-on. Bull's-eye.Gameplay 10/10With the barrage of tower defense games out there, it's easy to get weary of the grind. KR however, brings much, much needed personality and freshness that this crowded genre so direly needed. You place towers that are immune to enemies, and auto-attack the enemies. Placing a barracks trains 3 infantry to stop up to 3 passing enemies allowing your damage towers to wittle them down. The infantry can die, though, and have a respawn time. Some enemies have armor and are weak to magic, while others have magic resistance and low armor. Towers can be upgraded for more damage, alternate attack styles, and different personalities from the crew. It all works wonderfully and the game gets REALLY challenging fast. It works so well, KR is a high standard on how tower defense games should be made. It's that good.The Verdict""Everything's so good, so why do you not recommend it?"" Good question: the only con is the game is waaaay too short. Once you get half-decent at it, you will BLAST your way through the campaign (and most side missions) in about an hour. The game has high quality, but is far, far too short for recommending at $9.99. If it had an acceptable length, it'd be 10/10 but KR's final score is 7/10. It's a great game that you can beat in one afternoon. Just go to the above listed sites and play it for free. Or if you find that it's on sale for $5, you can go for it.			"

												For $7 this was fun enough. Over 5 hours of playing until I tried the same sorry arsed level 15 times. Ridiculously hard. Maybe if you do things in exactly the right order of placing, upgrading, and selecting the right hero then you could beat it. maybe. Not fun enough to try all the combinations though so I'll move along. Setting difficulty to easy is not an option.I am changing my review to not recommended. I lowered difficulty to casual and it is still extremely difficult. There are just so many enemies that you get overrun. Some come out of unmarked areas with nearly no mount points for defense buildings. Breakdown:Graphics: Great for this type of game, no complaintSound:  Good for this type of game, not much on sound anywayMechanics: Things work well, do not appear to be any bugs or issuesLevel Design: Overall pretty good, but unmarked areas that spawn unexpected mobs is a big NOBuildings: Good mix of abilities, being limited on where you can place a building is terribleHeroes: Somewhat helpful but too much babysitting that distracts from elsewhereMiscellaneous: Absolutely aggravating is having to click 2-3 times on a 'disabled' buildingIt could be an excellent game if a few points above were addressed, but there is something irritating having to try 10 to 20 times to beat a level to advance. Add in the clicking crap and building placement limitations and I really can't recommend it. However if you get it for around $5 it is fun for awhile.Marginal 5/10 and thumbs down			"

												I play a lot of TD games. I love TD and strategy games. This game is like babies first TD. It has 4 possible towers and all the positions for tower placements are made for you.There is an archer tower which fires fast but does light damage, mage tower which pirces armor units, siege towers which do aoe splash, and barracks which produce units to block creeps.There is no slow towers so you have to rely on barracks to block creeps so your other towers can do something. Barracks only spawn 3 units so if there are more than 3 creeps coming then they will walk on by. The siege towers are useless because of the lack of slow. There is no point in aoe in this game. The mage towers are also lacking since they are much slower than the archers and armored units are few and far between. The strategy is reduced to spaming archer towers and barracks. Pretty boring.It does have hero units ala some Warcraft 3 td maps but you bearly control it. You tell it where to stand and it does everything else on its own.You have 2 hero powers. One to spawn 2 units and the other to summon a small firestorm. Both of these powers quickly become useless unless you upgrade them. However, upgrading them means you arent upgrading your towers which makes it stupid.The story is nothing to talk about. Its toled through about 2 sentences before every mission. Throw away.All in all this TD is extremly basic and really shows its mobile origin. If you love TDs you might be ok picking it up on sale for a buck but otherwise leave it be.			"

												When configuring the audio for the game in the main menu, this does not acually affect the audio when ACUALLY playing the game. This blew out my eardrums. I'd expect such basic things to be sorted before games hit Steam stores. I don't play Tower defenses for the sheer difficulty. This game is rather difficult in my opinion. Does not allow for much in terms of ingeniuty. There's a certain way to doing the missions, and if you ain't doing them like that, then you're rather likely to fail.Can't recommend, unless you enjoy having the game choose what you do.			"

												As a tower defense game, this is one of the better ones out there. Unfortunately, this is the exact same version that you can play for free on android/ios or on various game websites. Don't get this game on Steam, go play it somewhere else, there is no added value here (unless achievements and trading cards are worth $10 to you). At least I got it as part of a bundle so I didn't have to pay full price for it. This is the reason I'm not recommending it, not because the game itself is necessarily that bad but more because this version is a grossly overpriced mobile port, not a real PC game.As for the game itself, despite being one of the better tower defense games, it still has some issues. The biggest one being that this game frequently degenerates into a mad click-fest which I don't particularly like, for me I like tower defense games that give you some time to think and plan things out between waves and that give more flexibility in terms of tower placement. This game limits you to existing tower plots on the map, severely limiting what you can do with your towers.These issues aren't even really inherent to a mobile game, bloons tower defense does a much better job in terms of tower variety, placement flexibility and planning between waves (even if the enemy types are boring).Still, this game is a fun little time waster, but if you want a great PC tower defense game, go look at Orcs Must Die or Sanctum. They're cheaper and far better.			"

												Great game. Absurd difficulty.  I am so bummed out.  I played Kingdom Rush online and beat it several times, including all the challenges at different difficulty levels.  But this port to the PC has not only removed some of the more interesting aspects of the game, but they apparently decided to ramp up the difficulty to an impossible level.  I'm not a beginner at Tower Defense.  I've played and beaten just about all the TD games on Steam, but this game is just relentless.  Even worse, while the old online version allowed you multiple strategies to victory, I'm becoming convinced that each stage has only one layout that can be successful.  I am maxed out on stars (as much as I can get) on the Dark Tower map and I cann't defeat this stupid wizard that I used to destroy online.  So I turn it all the way down to casual.  It STILL doesn't help.  So after having to play through 4 different defeats after 15 waves each (let's say wasting 20 minutes a pop) with different tower layouts I have no choice but to look up a walkthrough to see the one and only solution the developers obviously wanted me to use. I guess in the age of Dark Souls and Super Meatboy you can forgive the devs for thinking that hard=great.  But I bought this game to support them since I enoyed their online offering so much, not to smash my head against the wall in frustration because I haven't solved this puzzle game masquerading as RTS Tower Defense.  Very, very disappointed.  And it's one thing to 'git gud', but it's something else to be force to either grind endlessly in a vain attempt to unlock the single loadout that will lead to victory on CASUAL or just have to learn the combo from the internet, thereby defeating the fun of a tower defense game.  Also, thanks devs for not allowing saves anytime.  I love playing 15 long waves over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.  Just couldn't code that in, huh?			"

												If you've played the iPhone/iPad game, this one is very similar. They've changed a lot of things, specifically the heroes are pretty different. The heroes in the version are all different, and you cant actually upgrade them. You just choose one and position it around the map. This kind of change was carried over to all parts of the game I feel. Most in-game tower upgrades are ineffectual, as are the out-of-game upgrades you spend points to unlock. I never felt like anything I did made my game any different from anyone elses. This would would have been fine if thats the kind of experience they were aiming for, but based on its predessor, and how many different methods they have the potential to allow customization in, it seems more like a badly executed RPG system, not a well balanced even-playing field kind of thing.

												Yet an other uninspired tower defence.It plays, looks and feel like any old browser-based TD that have been available for free in flash for years now.Sure, it has a few bits here and there, but not worth putting the asked price, unless you are a die-hard fan of those flash games.Blizzard is making the 'custom games' free soon, and it has a lot of way better TD.And flash-based games like this one (including this one...) can bee found for free all over the net.

												Finally! Was waiting for it forever! But - there is a game breaking bug, right from the start.  Game goes into 4x fast forward mode, with no option to slow it down. Has something to do with refresh rate, i guess. Patch needed ASAP!Game patched and now running as intended! Perfect!			"

												This game punishes you on the last level of most maps for no reason, and this ruins what is otherwise a fun game. You can have 20 lives left and be cruising through a map, and then hit the last level and just get crushed, forcing you to restart. You then spend another 20-40 minutes to reach the boss level, and then get destroyed again without any hint about why. In any other game in this genre, if your strategy is good enough for 19 levels? It would  be good for the 20th. But in this game? No, ♥♥♥♥ your strategy. Start over. This time, plan your entire strategy for that 20th level stomp.And then if you're like me? You'll  end up looking at strategies/guides before starting the level again, to make sure you don't get killed at the end for no reason. Then you start copy and pasting a strat to 'win'. At that point the  game just become a 'linear instruction following' simulator, all because it decided to have an  impossible  last level on every map.			"

												If you don't know Kingdom Rush, you might just want to try the free versions on armorgames.com.This is one of the best Tower Defense Strategy games I've ever played. It's very simple and enjoyable to play after work, or when you got that little free time.In this Steam version specifically, there are no microtransations, you can count with a bunch of whole new levels and all  champions are unlockable.I really aprecciate the voice acting, soundtracks and game design. All of these features are combined in a special way, that makes you laugh while you crush your enemies to get every single achievement. To not talk about all the easter eggs...If you like strategy games, you really should give it a try.			"

												I've got to say this is one of the best tower defense games I've played in a long time. Next to Tower Wars, this one is the most fun I've played on Steam. The graphics are nice and simple. The gameplay is easy to learn, and fun. Most of all, this game is extremely challenging. I find myself losing on levels on the regular difficulty. It's crazy how strategic you have to be to win these waves. The towers can upgrade and you can unlock new abilities, too. There's a lot to this game for the price. It's retails for $9.99, but I purchased it from the Humble Bundle for nearly a third of that cost. Pick it up!			"

												Tower defense games are my preferred game style for the last few years.  Many developers have tried to come into the space and capture the experience but Ironhide Game Studios has set the bar to epic with Kingdom Rush.I have purchased this game for iPhone, iPad and for the PC and have done a full play through almost 4 times (once for each platform, twice on the iPad).  The PC version sports a few differences that are worth mentioning if you already have played through on the iOS.PC differences of note:1) There is no more collecting crystals during in-game play for purchasing ""extras"" for use during levels.  On the PC you have what you are able to do during the level and that is it.2) There is no difficultly settings to play with.  On IOS there is Normal and Hard mode; PC allows no selection.3) On PC you have open access to all of the heroes; no need to purchase them as you did on the IOS versions.If you are a fan of any Tower Defense games and would like to explore the genre a bit more, Kingdom Rush is a very easy recommendation and carries with it quite a bit of replayability.  Go forth and defend the kingdom!			"

												Kingdom Rush is a very tightly balanced tower defense game. I've collected 107 out of 110 stars and I can say it's worth picking up. Simple towers and simple enemies but the key is the placement of your guard towers and the timing of your spells. No one tower feels overpowered or one strategy fits for all levels. It takes a few attempts to get the right combination of towers to defeat the end waves of enemies. Once you level up your towers the game gets harder to adjust to the new abilities. You never feel like your overpowered or the game is too easy. The boss fights are a great touch and satisfying to defeat. Kingdom Rush is one of the best cross-platform tower defense games on steam.			"

Then again, about a year ago...Although I finished it two times before, I got pretty excited when it got Steam version...It is a fantastic, casual, Tower Defence game, with beautiful, comic visuals, and very interesting gameplay... Every tower is very useful, depending on situation, and when fully upgraded they get some pretty cool abilities.They also added heroes (although, I think they were in newer flesh versions before) and new levels... Heroes are not too powerful, but can help you with single units that got away, because they are movable across ""battlefield""...After all, it is a great tower defence game I cannot recommend enough to those that love the genre...P.S. You can turn monsters into sheep... Also flying monsters... So you get flying sheep... Easily the best reason to buy this game...			"

												Kingdom Rush is probably the best tower defense game that I have ever played.It's not an easy game, you will have to manage how to spend experience points and decide which hero to play before entering a level. Then in the level you will have to think where to put your towers, how to level them up, move your hero (some heroes require lot of attention :P)...The levels are well designed, with a good difficulty curve. They make you learn and discover everything the game has to offer.Visually is cute and well designed to allow the player understand what is happening in a moment.Overall a very good game :)			"

												 very solid tower defense game,love the upgrade system and the art style. I came across this title originally over on AddictingGames.com and found myself replaying levels just to get that extra star to unlock some bonus. when I found that they had released KR on steam along with some new content outside of what was there on AG.com I felt it was worth the few bucks to get it and its proven its worth to me.  the main campaign to fight your way to the evil wizard is essentially the same with a few changes from the free version, such as the mystic lazer of the sun at the mage temple isnt there this time around to provide a spare potshot. the main game changer is the inclusion of selectable Hero characters that can go just about anywhere on the map each with their own abilitys. more than once the outcome of a mission depended on where I put these heros to defend my hp.I havent tried the new missions yet but so far im enjoying myself with this game.

												A surprisingly deep and challenging tower defense-strategy game, where you also have to manage your hero AND the towers.Also available for mobiles, but it is not just a port, but a great Full HD experience, perfectly enjoyable on Steam, on big screens (I was a mobile player before).Definitely worth the price.PS.: you need some though to master this game, just rushing won't help. Planning is key. :)			"

												Very good game well designed. Graphics look amazing for a Tower Defence game. Only thing that could be improved is allowing us to track our acheivements. For example the acheivement for 10'000 kills when you click on it they should add it in so it will tell you 5698/10'000 so it's easier to see what you still need to do. Other than that amazing game and can't wait till the  next update.			"

												If you don't know Kingdom Rush, you might just want to try the free versions on armorgames.com.This is one of the best Tower Defense Strategy games I've ever played. It's very simple and enjoyable to play after work, or when you got that little free time.In this Steam version specifically, there are no microtransations, you can count with a bunch of whole new levels and all  champions are unlockable.I really aprecciate the voice acting, soundtracks and game design. All of these features are combined in a special way, that makes you laugh while you crush your enemies to get every single achievement. To not talk about all the easter eggs...If you like strategy games, you really should give it a try.			"

												I've played this games since it was just a simple, flash game from armorgames..... during that time, i've finished this game twice... about a year later or so if i remember.. armorgames realized this game addiction in flash PC games, so they tried to make it happen in iOS.... AND IT DID HAPPEN.... WHILE GIVING THIS GAME MORE FEATURES.... such as heroes, new extra levels, new enemies and new units as well..The backdraft ?Well, to be put frank, this game turned into a GOLD MINE for Armorgames,  its addiction combined with microtransactions proved successfull...... while keeping some people dissapointed with its ""Pay2Win(Perfectly)""BUT EVERYTHING CHANGES NOW......BETTER GRAPHICS, BETTER GAMEPLAY, BETTER TACTICS... WITH NO F##KIN MICROTRANSACTIONS....The point is.... if you want a simple yet addictive and tacticful, you should try this game.... By the time i was writing this review, i think there is a humblebundle with Kingdom Rush in it..... so if you want to pay more than less for great excitement, go there...			"

												This is easily one of the best (and funniest) tower defense games ever made. I played the ArmorGames version all the way through a year ago, and I didn't hesitate to buy this version as well. It has many new levels and other updates that make it well worth the small price tag. It is obvious that this game is a labor of love and if you like tower defense, this game will not disappoint. It is hard but never too much so and somehow I can play and replay these levels in different difficulty modes without ever getting bored. Highly recommended!			"

												One of the best flash based TD games out there, if not the BEST in my opinion. There's a lengthy campaign and different challenges to help with replay value. It has been out on mobile devices since a couple of years ago. Having completed it on mobile, there's not much motivation to replay it again except to enjoy it on a bigger screen. It is also nicer to look at with the updated UI and graphics. Kudos to Ironhide Game Studio for still supporting the game with FREE content updates even after it's release 3 years ago, more content are coming in the future. All in-app transactions have been completely removed and contents can be unlocked just by playing the game, so the price is justifiable. 8/10			"

												Kingdom Rush is a superb take on the Tower Defence genre.  If you're a fan of tower defence games or like a casual game to play during those lazy weekends Kingdom Rush is a must.There are several different towers like you'd suspect from a tower defence game. There is the fast shooter with low damage aka the arrow tower. Then there is the magic tower with moderate power but slow. There is also the tower that hits multiple enemies. Finally there is the melee tower that produces units to stop enemies in their tracks. You can upgrade each tower several times. The soundtrack is decent, mixed with the hilarious lines given to each tower when you fully upgrade them makes the game just that bit better. The cartoon style graphics creates a funny entertaining view while obliterating those pesky enemies. So why are you still reading this, buy it now :D			"

												A tower defence game, and a great one at that! :DKingdom Rush is a game I found out about from a friend years ago. He told me to check it out in an email and gave a link to the free version. I loved it, and I think I finished it. Tower defence games are one of only two genres that I actually like as a whole (the other being platformers), so I might give this game credit where credit isn't necessarily due, but the point is that it's good.You get four types of towers to defend your... defendable... things with. I'll describe each one briefly:-Barracks: Barracks train soldiers called footmen who block enemies paths. The main draw is that they slow the enemy down to allow more hits from your ranged towers. Footmen are the only units that can die. They deal melee damage, which is affected by armor.-Archers: The barracks can't do everything, though. That's where ranged towers like archers come in. Ranged towers do most of the damage usually. Archers do melee damage for some reason (think of it more like physical I guess?), which means their damage is affected by armor. The thing is that they're faster than footmen and have more range. They stay in their tower and shoot things from high up, so they can't be killed/destroyed by enemies like the footmen can.-Mages: Magic has a unique type of damage--it's not affected by armor. This makes mage towers VERY useful. They do more damage than archers, too, but they're slightly slower. Even so, I prefer mages to archers, usually. There are enemies that are resistant to magic, though. Just like archers, mages are ranged.-Artillery... cannons: Artillery is ranged bombs, basically, that are shot into the air and rain down on groups of enemies. The explosions do damage by area instead of by enemy, which makes them good for taking out groups of weak enemies. They're slow and expensive, though. I think they do melee/physical damage.I should mention that there are flying enemies that will go right over your footmen. You'll need a good ranged defence to fight them. You also get meteors and reinforcements. Meteors are for emergencies and do a lot of area damage. Reiforcements are like free extra footmen. Finally, there are heroes, which are characters you always start with. You can only have one hero at a time, but you pick which one. As you can see, there's some depth in this game. I'd recommend this, especially if you like tower defence.			"

												I don't even know how to articulate how good this game is to me. It's so polished. So fun. There are like 20-30 stages that have three different difficulties that force you to use unique strategies. The gameplay consists of paths with preset locations upon which you can build towers. There are four tower types and each has three upgrades and two specializations each. Each specialization has its own set of upgrades. The depth of tower upgrades reminds me of some AAA RTS games. The enemies consist of orcs and wizards and other generic baddies with varying resilience and counterstrategies. A lot of tower defense games rely on tower placement as gameplay. Towers in Kingdom Rush have such a diverse set of utility and manual management that placement may not even be in the top 3 strategic priorities. You have a fireball spell that you cast yourself, and you also have a hero of your choice for some levels that you manually move around the map and engage enemies. You can also call two reinforcement warriors into battle at the location of your choice on a 20 or 30 second cooldown. So much to micromanage. The onslaught of enemy hordes is relentless, so you are constantly fighting an uphill battle that requires split second analysis and action, sometimes even sacrificing towers to fortify another path. I highly recommend this game to everyone who enjoys tower defense and also to everyone who doesn't enjoy tower defense. You may be surprised how fun this game is for you.			"

												Score: 90Concept: Tower Defense ExtravaganzaKingdom Rush is basically a direct port of the flash game the would be ported onto the IOS and Android platform. Not every game should be ported from tablet form to a full PC game. However Kingdom Rush has already established itself as a major player in the tower defense genre. Before you point out that I paid real money for a game that is literally available for free on websites like Kongregate, there is a reason to buy it. In the app version there is loads of premium content that one has to pay for separately. In the PC version you get the full game, no exceptions. So, if you have it on your tablet or phone is it really any different? No. Not at all. It's the exact same fun game.Kingdom Rush takes the existing TD genre and gives it character. For such a simple little game there is so much content to it. And if you are looking for that next challenge look no further. Kingdom Rush is a deceptive game that fools you into believing you can do it then crushes your dreams two minutes later. However there is a bigger picture. You can upgrade your overall tower abilities and skills as you beat more of the game by earning stars. And it gets better, you can respec your skills freely whenever you wish. So if a level calls for just arrow towers as a strategy then max out your arrow tower strength. But if another level needs every tower then respec your skills to balance out your strength.The game is also full of fun easter eggs and achievements that are meaningless but just add more character to this already full game. There is also a hero system that will come in handy. As your hero makes kills on the field he/she/it will level up and gain strength and abilities. You'll have several of these heroes to chose from as well and the best part is that most of them are like 2.99 in the app. Its insane. The game is visually appealing with a fantastic color palette. This may be easier on a touch screen though as I lose some time with my mouse and keyboard.Second Opinion: I'm not paying for a free game...			"

												I love shopping during sales cause it gives me the opportunity to try out all kinds of games. Some are bad, some are okey and some are pretty darn good. This is one of the latter.The game is pretty easy to learn, even if you've never played this type (Tower Defense) of game before thanks to simple controls, easy to understand mechanics and in-game hints. Difficulty starts out very simple and then scales upwards as you go at a satisfying pace.Controls are simple, you use your mouse to click where you want to build structures (pre-defined locations) and when you want to upgrade. There are quickbinds for your spells (1 and 2) as well as your hero (space), allowing for fast selection when needed.Graphics are cartoonish, colorfull and very charming while animations aren't next generation they're still very satisfying and fits the theme. Not many graphic options except for resolution (1920x1080, weee!), windowed and a quality level although I think those cover all the relevant things.The sound is pretty good and can be adjusted in-game.As far as gameplay goes this one will give you quite a few hours of tower building and monster killing thanks to the campaign mode and, once finished (or during), you can go back to completed maps in order to complete the Iron or Heroic challenges (same basic map, new waves, new rules, 1 life!). There are more or less hidden achievements during some of the maps as well as whenever you complete a map you earn stars which can be spent on the world map in order to upgrade things.Many unique monsters, several bosses and a dozen+ playable heroes have kept me entertained for 25h+ ^_^So, all in all, I'd say this is a great game, giving it a 4!1 - Crap, don't buy2 - Fun for an evening3 - It's an alright game but not my taste4 - Great game5 - One of the best I've ever played			"

												When my girlfriend left me and all of the stocks I had invested in crashed, this game saved me from crying into what I like to call my ""Tear Jar"". You see, whenever I cry, I collect all of my tears into the Tear Jar and then when I've saved up a lot of tears I go to the nearest willow tree and water the ground with my tears. This is why you see weeping willows everywhere in the world. But since I started playing this game I haven't cried once! Nothing takes the pain away like stopping hordes of orcs and annoying flying broken gargoyles that make you lose and have to restart the stage. I give this game a 9/10, it's provided me with a lot of fun and also drastically increase global warming due to the decrease in weeping willows.			"

												Probably my favorite TD ever. The original flash version basically redefined the word TowerDefence for me. The mix of careful planning, direct interaction with abilities and heroes, and rolling with the mayhem of constantly changing and interesting maps and a large roster of enemy types make it one of the smartest and best balanced games of its type. I had always wanted to support the developer but never go for micro-transactions. When the PC version went up on the Summer Sale for just a couple bucks I was all over it. And the sequel (Frontiers) is even better.			"

The increased framerate, resolution and the all-round improved graphics just makes this ""Remaster"" a real treat.

Can't really give this game more praise than that.Thank you for the constant updates with new content that never seizes of amaze and impress me. The amount of dedication, devotion, creativity and hard work you guys put into game, even after it's initial launch, is inspiring. You guys basically gave us a 1.5 games for the price of one.

												Note: I played the tablet version, not PC one, so it might be a bit different.Kingdom Rush is a very enjoyable tower defense game. It has a very nice look and feel. The difficulty seems somewhat imbalanced. I had no problems to finish some levels on hard, while some levels were very difficult even on easy. The first half of the game was more fun, there was a lot of progress and new things. The second half had some interesting new enemies, but there was no more development in towers or heroes, which is a pity.The fact that you can't place your towers anywhere, just on designated spots, changes the tower defense concept quite a bit. Some people might like it, some might not. Kingdom Rush also usually gives you quite low amount of money, so you have to carefully plan what you build and where. Instead of just playing spontaneously as in other TD games, this makes this particular game also close to a strategy/puzzle game. If you don't plan carefully the tower layout from the very early beginning, nothing will help you.			"

												This game is ludicriously addictive. Prior to aquiring it on Steam, I had logged an embarresing amount of hours playing the original mobile version via my Kindle Fire. So much so, that the first few weeks after I got it I'd wake up early for work in the morning and RUSH to get ready just so I would have time to play this!The great thing about the PC adaptation is that it looks like they're in the process of rolling the first and second mobile games into one, (One complaint about the mobile version of the second game I had was that in order to get additional heroes you had to pay, which looks like will be done away with for the PC version except for maybe the cost for the expansion itself.)It's a pretty standard tower defense game. You get knights, archers, mages, and the like. You also have heroes, who help you fight the baddies. You get upgrades for your towers, which give them special abilities, etc. It's a simple, tried-and-true formula that they adapted to their own style beautifully and it's quickly become one of my favorite games.Worth every penny, and then some! :D			"

The game is very cartoonish, but that graphic style gives it a unique look and feel.

												Ah kingdom rush. I remember playing this about two years ago on Kongregate. Although that version is just a flash game, and truth be told there is many differences with this recently re-release on steam, the core gameplay and game feels the same. That is to say, if you want to play demo of sorts of the game before you buy it on steam, go look it up there. The main difference is you have to unlock the heroes for 15 stars, instead of just getting them for free as you progress here. Then buy it here to support the maker. Its an enjoyable way to kill time, thats for sure.			"

												Kingdom Rush is a tower game.  It is fairly simplistic I used I think my mouse, and maybe 2 or 3 keyboard keys to play.  It was I think originally a tablet/flash game.  The campaign is the following: you are a leader who works for a king and you're taking back the kingdom from an evil wizard and fighting off evil hordes and “bad men.”  On the Steam version you get a variety of towers (like any tower game) and they do a variety of different things.  The animation is cute.  It appears to take a lot of processing power and the settings are apparently unable to be reduced by much.  There are also ""reinforcements"" like dropping down risk pieces to bolster your defenses or attack certain mobs. One spell exists that rains down meteors on the enemy.  The story is light.  There are a number of achievements which are relatively easy to find if you click around enough. Certain levels are amazingly more difficult than others.  Several heroes are OP and others are so weak that no one would choose them.  There are Iron and Heroic challenge options to give you more stars. These stars allow you to “purchase” upgrades to make gameplay easier. These challenges are pretty much optional as there is no need to get more than about 40 stars to achieve optimal tower consideration for any map.  Certain towers are more effective on certain maps.    The game is pretty inexpensive for roughly 10-15 hours of play you're basically paying 1 dollar per hour.  The replay value is relatively low.  Supposedly the developer is creating more DLC or an expansion.  That has yet to be seen and today is 1/12/14.Would I recommend this game?  Yes.  It is cheap and for the entertainment value for what you will get out of it is worth it. I’d rather play this then watch a Hollywood movie.  I don't see much reason to complete the Iron or Heroic challenges as there is relatively no ""added value"" in doing so it is just something to waste time with to create an ""optimal"" strategy for the level.  I'd rate this 3.5/5 for what the game is compared to others.  Inexpensive, easy to put down, and simplistic method of game play are the positives. It is colorful and cute and the music is okay as are the sound effects. The ""Easter eggs"" and ""jokes"" aren't very funny or cool but it is a tower game.			"

												 very solid tower defense game,love the upgrade system and the art style. I came across this title originally over on AddictingGames.com and found myself replaying levels just to get that extra star to unlock some bonus. when I found that they had released KR on steam along with some new content outside of what was there on AG.com I felt it was worth the few bucks to get it and its proven its worth to me.  the main campaign to fight your way to the evil wizard is essentially the same with a few changes from the free version, such as the mystic lazer of the sun at the mage temple isnt there this time around to provide a spare potshot. the main game changer is the inclusion of selectable Hero characters that can go just about anywhere on the map each with their own abilitys. more than once the outcome of a mission depended on where I put these heros to defend my hp.I havent tried the new missions yet but so far im enjoying myself with this game.

												This is easily one of the best (and funniest) tower defense games ever made. I played the ArmorGames version all the way through a year ago, and I didn't hesitate to buy this version as well. It has many new levels and other updates that make it well worth the small price tag. It is obvious that this game is a labor of love and if you like tower defense, this game will not disappoint. It is hard but never too much so and somehow I can play and replay these levels in different difficulty modes without ever getting bored. Highly recommended!			"

												I've played this games since it was just a simple, flash game from armorgames..... during that time, i've finished this game twice... about a year later or so if i remember.. armorgames realized this game addiction in flash PC games, so they tried to make it happen in iOS.... AND IT DID HAPPEN.... WHILE GIVING THIS GAME MORE FEATURES.... such as heroes, new extra levels, new enemies and new units as well..The backdraft ?Well, to be put frank, this game turned into a GOLD MINE for Armorgames,  its addiction combined with microtransactions proved successfull...... while keeping some people dissapointed with its ""Pay2Win(Perfectly)""BUT EVERYTHING CHANGES NOW......BETTER GRAPHICS, BETTER GAMEPLAY, BETTER TACTICS... WITH NO F##KIN MICROTRANSACTIONS....The point is.... if you want a simple yet addictive and tacticful, you should try this game.... By the time i was writing this review, i think there is a humblebundle with Kingdom Rush in it..... so if you want to pay more than less for great excitement, go there...			"

And the use of heroes. Lots of replayability and a number of levels unlocked after you finish the campaign. The only down side in my opinion is the short time it took me to finish the campaign. Would have been nice if it was longer or if there were multiple campaigns for different regions.			"

												Ignore my time played on here, as I just installed it. I've played hours of this game when it was just a Flash game on the web and sunk even more time into on iOS. However, the version available on here is the definitive edition. All microtransactions, which were present in the iOS version, are gone and we're given a complete, well-balanced and beautiful tower defence game. In fact, this is the only tower defence game I've actually spent a decent amount of time playing. Buy this game & gift this game. $10 is only a fraction of what it's actually worth.			"

												Great Defense Strategy game combining basic RPG elements.In the beginning you wont find many tower options, but that would change during the gameplay as difficulty would arise. Together with that you have two types of hard-modes which would keep you entertained for a lot of time.You also command your hero (you choose from several options) which can be used to boost critical parts of your defense thus bringing new strategies to game. As well as 2 special abilities you have and technology upgrade tree where you can boost towers / abilites.			"

												Definitely one of the very best tower defense games out there, can't think of anything that would improve upon it.It's your usual tower building and upgrading, but you also control one out of a dozen or so diverse hero characters with special abilities, so no boring waiting around for cash and always something to do and click. Great and huge array of visually diverse enemies that also differ in significant gameplay-changing ways from each other.Great and humorous artstyle and balancing, no wild difficulty spikes in the campaign progression just a smooth slope up to the point where it gets really tough as nails and you feel like you've accomplished something afterwards.At the time of writing this I've completed everything with 105/105 stars, yet I'm really happy there's still much more to come including a new campaign. It's not perfect but you gotta be one hell of a miserable nit-picker to be unhappy with what you get here.10/10			"

												I picked up on playing this game when a friend told me about it on armorgames.com, and I thought it would just be some half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥flash game like ""Beat Your Boss"" or something, but boy, was I WRONG! The game was a ton of fun other than it's heroes not being unlockable through gameplay, and it's IOS release (Which I also love) had microtransactions. This steam release of the game get's rid of all that completely. And to get back on topic, the game's creators released a new game called ""Kingdom Rush: Frontiers"" as a sequel to this great game. playing them both and learning that it would become a steam game blew me away! This Kingdom Rush is actually both of them together, along with even MORE updates, so you KNOW it's gonna be good. I recommend this game 100% to any casual or hardcore gamer who likes Tower Defense, and some funny dialogue along the way. BUY THIS GAME!			"

												I know what you're thinking...why pay $9.99 for a game that was $0.99 for iOS? Well, let me tell you it's completely worth it. First off, Ironhide has remastered the graphics...it's no longer running on flash. Second, there's no DLC or real-money purchases like on iOS. Everything's already unlocked! There's bonus content as well!And that's to say nothing of the gameplay, which is fantastic. Kingdom Rush is on par with the greatest tower defenses I've ever played. There are only 4 towers, but they all have branching upgrades. All upgrades provide a cosmetic change as well, which is nice. Despite only having 4 base towers, there's a good amount of strategy involved in picking the right ones and upgrading appropriately. If you don't, you're gonna have a bad time, especially on some of the harder levels.The art is fantastic, the music is alright, and the game's wit/humor is good without beating you over the head with it. And if that's not enough for you, there's a horde of Steam achievements as well as trading cards.			"

For example the acheivement for 10'000 kills when you click on it they should add it in so it will tell you 5698/10'000 so it's easier to see what you still need to do. Other than that amazing game and can't wait till the  next update.			"

Personally I wanted to see them bring more to the table so I picked the game up to support them.			"

												""Archer's READY?! BULLSEYE!""This is one of the best tower defense games ever made. Fun animation, secrets, cultural references, enthusiastic voice acting. A lot of love and handcrafted design has went into this gem.I have played the free flash version, the mobile version and expansion, and now the Steam version. I can attest that this is the best version of the game out there.			"

												Awesome TD if you are into that sort of thing. It feels quite different from most other TDs in that there are no slow or stun towers - but rather you use soldiers to keep the enemies at bay while your towers hammer away at your enemies. Quite challenging and fun			"

												Resounding ""YES"" to buy!BEST TD EVER!!! (Bloons can kiss my A$$. I played this ish on kong when it was flash.  Sure....now it crashes a tad.... DO IT! don't play the flash, buy it! I want to see more like this from ironhide and you will too. I have played both Kingdom rush games, paid for both..... and then PAID again on steam. That's how much I love this game and YOU will love it too!  E'ffing BRILLIANT! I cannot give enough support to ironhide. If I could choose only two games on a desert island.... this would be one of them.To  Ironhide: wtf.... is up..... with the static pics?!?  I liked it more in flash. The quality is crap compaired to the in-game.... downgrade that so that it fits. I don't like the ""high quality"" static pics.			"

												If you played the flash game for free(on PC), this new version comes back without too much change. There are maybe 6-7 extra maps to beat than previously. In the old flash game there were not heroes but now there are. (Heroes are just units that you can move around and auto-attack/auto cast spells). This is actually still pretty challenging for me. At the time of this review I have not beaten all of the levels, for a full 3 stars. I still have a map or two before finishing it.The tech tree remains the same as from the flash version. Overall it's a good game and worth the money for what you get.			"

Challenges are tough and help teach the strengths and weaknesses of tower synergy. Boss fights are challenging and satisfying. Little bits of humor. The champions are useful and fun to use. If you like Tower Defense then this is the second best you can get behind Defense Grid.			"

You can play the free version, but they've added a ton of new content in here, like heroes (somewhat-played-controlled characters), extra maps, new enemies, and a great campaign. If you love tower defense games, this game is for you.			"

												Its hard to describe how great this game really is. I think my fiance hates it. ;) I literally beat the game in the original mode (not heroic or champion) within 2 days. It's that addictive. I've played a few TD games here or there, but this one is by far the greatest. I had some laughs (prepare for the hilariously foul languaged bombardment towers in all their Irish-accent-glory). The one thing I can't wait for is MORE LEVELS! I really wish they would have some type of ""endless"" mode like some TD's out there have. You'd be able to hone your skills and see how far you can get and compare scores with others by how many waves you defeat..One of the funnest parts about this game is ""picking the right hero for the right battle."" You'll pick up on this pretty quick once you get toward the end-game. After you beat this game in original mode, you'll unlock a few more levels (some are ridiculously hard! Make use of Tesla towers every chance you get.. they'll get you by.) Heroic and the other modes are fun.. they definitely require some thought. I just wish I could make use of Heroes after the end-game a little more.. they're fun to play with.I can't wait for more content!! I give this game a solid 10/10. Great developers, great game. They also listen to the community and offer patch-releases that update some requested features. Awesome!			"

												Simple mechanics with deceptively deep strategy. At first, I thought the limited number of towers would dampen the potential of the game, but the game really emphasizing placing the right tower (with the right upgrades) in the right place. One wrong tower can ruin a playthrough on higher difficulties. Really satisfying when it all comes together. If you're a fan of tower defense games, don't pass this game up!			"

												When tower defense games first became big, close to 10 years ago, a lot of flash trash got thrown out onto mobile stores and sites like Armor Games.  Kingdom Rush started out as a flash game on Armor Games, but was, shockingly, really good.  It's well balanced, good cartoony art style (similar to PvZ but fantasy) and fun challenges.The main negative is the price, as what started out as a free flash game is $10 here on steam, with minimal improvements.  It does go on sale often and get thrown in a lot of bundles, but even a nominal price is more than free.  The other negative is that the two sequels are gonna stay mobile only, as the developer didn't code them in unity (this is actually a ground-up unity port).			"

												Cool tower deffence game, you should consider playing. Basically you are playing through some sort of a story that was not really interesting for ME, but you might enjoy it, ofcourse the story is not reason why you SHOULD buy this or any other tower deffence game. The REASON is that this game offers great gaming expirience, its nice to look at, it involves big amount of strategic choices you can make through the game. There is big amount of way you can beat the stages/levels, all depends on which hero you chose, what do you upgrade, etc. Stages take about 10mins (Normal mode), so its nice game when you want to just chill and you dont have much time to play. I´m pretty sure you will enjoy it, if you cant afford it on steam, check out online markets or wait for sale. The game that should be in your library, really entertaining, i did enjoyed playing through, good luck in future to devs of the game. *8/10 ofc. what review would it be without apologizing to reader, so ""Sorry for bad english"" hope this ""review"" helped, and ""Have a nice day sir/miss.""

												This is one of my all time favorite games.  Very addictive, and lots of replayability.  I've played the iOS version for a few years now, and when i saw it release on Steam, i had to have it.  The Steam version plays great with a mouse, and plays just as well on my Surface 2 Pro tablet, using the touchscreen.  This version of the game is a little different than the iOS version.  There are not 3 difficuly settings per level/game mode here.  There is also no Store to buy power ups, and you don't earn gems from completing levels, to buy said power-ups.  However, this version allows you to unlock all the Heroes, through completing levels, and there are no in app purchases in this version, which was required to acquire the majority of the Heroes on iOS.  That being said, this version is tuned a little differently, which i liked, since it took me a few weeks to complete all the levels.....where as you could do so, in just a few days on iOS.  I'm looking forward to the coming updates to this game, and curious if the sequel will be released on Steam too.If you like good tower defense games, you will love this gem.  The art style is particularly charming, to set it apart from others.  Enjoy!			"

												Amazing tower defense game! Generally I find tower defense games perdictable and easy to see the strategy on how the maker wants you to build it, but this one is rather challenging. A lot of curve balls are thrown at you to keep you on your toes, which makes the game a ton of fun.			"

												Definitely a fun little tower defense game that's worth the asking price. The gameplay is fun, some maps are actually tricky, and overall it's pretty well balanced and fair (just ignore the usual forum grumbling of people that don't really pay attention to the enemies and then die to them). It's a kind of mix between the more passive tower defenses (build everything, watch) and the active ones (build stuff to slow enemies, then mainly kill enemies yourself, such as Dungeon Defenders) and hits a pretty sweet spot there. Your main interaction with the game, aside from building towers, is summoning a pair of grunts that can hold enemies back with a short cooldown, summon a small rain of fire with a long cooldown, and finally command a single hero to move around.There is no mazing, because your towers aren't built on the lane the enemies walk on, but you can also build a building which spawns soldiers, who will attempt to hold off the advancing orcs, wolves, et cetera.And it's fun. If you want a pretty relaxed tower defense game that needs you to think some, pick this one. It sure has the gameplay to be worth it.			"

												If you played the flash game for free(on PC), this new version comes back without too much change. There are maybe 6-7 extra maps to beat than previously. In the old flash game there were not heroes but now there are. (Heroes are just units that you can move around and auto-attack/auto cast spells). This is actually still pretty challenging for me. At the time of this review I have not beaten all of the levels, for a full 3 stars. I still have a map or two before finishing it.The tech tree remains the same as from the flash version. Overall it's a good game and worth the money for what you get.			"

												Towers are and their upgrades are great. The bonuses are balanced pretty well and work well together. Cool artwork. Challenges are tough and help teach the strengths and weaknesses of tower synergy. Boss fights are challenging and satisfying. Little bits of humor. The champions are useful and fun to use. If you like Tower Defense then this is the second best you can get behind Defense Grid.			"

												Easily one of the best tower defense games of all time. Kingdom Rush offers plenty of content without being over-complicated.   It is one of the few TD games where you can actually control ground troops and truly use towers together effectively.  Kingdom Rush over my years of playing different versions both online, steam, and mobile, seems to have few to no bugs as well.  Great graphics, challenging game play.  YOU MUST PLAY THIS GAME if you are a TD and strategy game fan.			"

												One of the best (if not THE best) tower defense games I've ever played. Combines passive and active defense in a brilliant combination that keeps one always engaged. It's not a case of being pressed against the wall where there is only ONE way to solve a map, but flexible enough to allow for multiple strategies. The gameplay is easy to learn, but difficult to master. The easter eggs are cute too. Definitely worth the price.			"

												This game is ludicriously addictive. Prior to aquiring it on Steam, I had logged an embarresing amount of hours playing the original mobile version via my Kindle Fire. So much so, that the first few weeks after I got it I'd wake up early for work in the morning and RUSH to get ready just so I would have time to play this!The great thing about the PC adaptation is that it looks like they're in the process of rolling the first and second mobile games into one, (One complaint about the mobile version of the second game I had was that in order to get additional heroes you had to pay, which looks like will be done away with for the PC version except for maybe the cost for the expansion itself.)It's a pretty standard tower defense game. You get knights, archers, mages, and the like. You also have heroes, who help you fight the baddies. You get upgrades for your towers, which give them special abilities, etc. It's a simple, tried-and-true formula that they adapted to their own style beautifully and it's quickly become one of my favorite games.Worth every penny, and then some! :D			"

												A lot of fun! Requests from creators if they are going to expand or make dlc. I don't know if others would want this but this is something I think would be cool in Kingdom Rush. 1) Add out of match  leveling, and costumization  mechanics for the heroes. (I know they level in game, but I want to be able to do more with the heroes I like. Make it feel like my hero is more unique.) 2) Allow to costumize keyboard scheme. (Sometimes I wish I had other ways to do things faster. In the heat of the moment I feel clumsy.) 3) Add a challenge mode or trial mode for online comparisons. 4) Add 1 or 2 more towers in the scheme but only allow 4 total in the actual map/match. Meaning just how you pick your hero before a match you also have to pick your towers. 5) More maps, and more secrets.			"

												I must say, this is one of the best tower defense games out there.  It is simple, but can be very challenging; it is very chill, but can be very involving as well; and it is calm, but can be stressful.The artwork is what drew me to this game first--it is awesome!  The creatures are excellently animated, and my wife even likes this game more than I do.  It's good for all gamers, IMO.  The only complaint I have is that there are only set stations where you can build your towers.  I would prefer a little more freedom with it.  But that also works into the challenge of the game--you have to deal with limitations and still try to win.  Plus, even with set areas to build, it's WHAT you build there that matters so much.Lastly, I've noticed that iOS units have TWO sequels for this game..... BRING THEM TO STEAM!!!!!!  I'd buy them all in a heartbeat, as this game is very affordable and still brings many hours of enjoyment for the whole family.			"

												I have played literally every version, every edition of this game I could find, from Kongregate to Armor Games. I paid an entire $1 on Armor in order to get more points to spend and extra campaigns. yes, an entire $1. I know, it's a lot of $$, but it was worth it.Seriously though, Kingdom Rush is hands down, the absolute most fun I have ever had playing a standalone TD, flash or otherwise. The campaign is well done, well written, and so much fun to replay that I literally can not stop playing it in every version I find it in. This Steam version works perfectly, and though slightly different from the previous flash versions, in very small ways, the gameplay is flawless. You will find yourself replaying maps in order to get that perfect 3 star score, in order to use the points earned to fill out your point sheet and get better towers. I wish this version had the Hero level up system like the previous flash versions had, but it's a small quibble. Overall, this game is almost perfect as a TD. It has variety of units, variety  of strategy, and customizable towers. It has well written lore describing the situation and map for each step of the campaign. It's just a very fun TD, and one every fan of a good TD should play. As another Reviewer stated, ""Kingdom Rush is well-designed to be challenging, yet not needlessly frustrating."" Perfectly stated.  It's just hard enough that you probably won't get a perfect 3 starts your first time on any given map. Yet, you will enjoy playing it so much that you will most likely replay each map numerous times in order to get a perfect 3 star score.The art is just as enjoyable as the gameplay, though the sounds do get repetitive quickly. But that's really my only (small) complaint. Buy it, play it, love it. It's just that good.			"

												I have played many tower defense games, and Kingdom Rush is the best of them so far. It has beautiful 2D graphics with charming animations, tons of levels to play and a good variety of towers to use. This combined with the hero management and the extra strategy required to use your spells wisely made it a very addictive experience. The final bosses are insane bullet sponges and they may seem pointless but just for the fun of seeing them is worth getting to the end of the diferent quest paths.			"

												Great game if you Like causal tower defense. Only downside is the lack of advance targeting system on the towers, so you cannot get them to target anything but the runner in the front. If you are looking for a quick break though, it is a quick game to get through. Only 47 hours of play and I am 100% done.			"

												One of the best tower defence games i've played. Charming graphics, funny speech and sounds, very strategic. You build towers in preset locations using money, which you get by killing enemies. While battling, you upgrade said towers again using money. After every succesful battle you are awarded up to three stars each mission, which you use to unlock perks for your towers and these perks are well thought out, offering many gamechanging mechanics and -ofcourse- more damage.All towers are equally useful: magic for strong/armored enemies, bombs for crowds, archers for small & fast enemies, soldiers for stoping & gathering enemies. You also have 2 special powers which have a cooldown and can be used indefinately (1.inserting 2  soldiers anywhere you want and 2. meteor shower). By the way, special powers get perks too.And then there are ""heroes"", which are directly controled by the player, have special powers and suit many different playstyles (strong melee, weak magic, ranged, teleporting among others). Between heroes, special powers and the fact that you can demolish your own towers (and get a little refund) to build a different towers in their place, you will never feel powerless or blame the game.Make no mistake though, the game becomes gradually challenging. You won't be needing lightning reflexes, but you'll have to learn by trial and error sometimes. If you are easily frustrated, there's always the ""casual"" difficulty setting.As for longevity, this game is a completionist's dream. Beat the main campaign and you still have 2 challenges for each mission (which restrict what types of units and level of upgrades you can use - for me these were even more fun than the main mission!) and a couple random missions poping up all over the map. I haven't completed everything yet, but i'd say you're getting at least 20 hours of fun.Well worth the price.			"

												I first played kingdom rush back in the early days on a website called Kongregate and thought it was extremely fun. I never imagined that they would be able to improve it so much as to be able to sell the game on Steam! This is a Tower Defense game, meaning that you have to strategically place buildings (There are four buildings to choose from) in locations so the waves of oncoming enemies don't overrun you (get to the other side of the map). The game offers three modes for each map, each giving you currency to upgrade your abilities, buildings and your heroes. Probably the best part about Tower Defense games in general is that there is always more than one way to successfully beat a level, so if you want to beat down your enemies with only arrows, you go girl! (or guy ;p). Unfortunately sometimes a single type of building, despite how many times you upgrade it using the money the monsters you kill drop (which you don't need to worry about picking up thank goodness), won't be sufficient in beating said level. You'll need to adapt sometimes. What sets this game apart from the other Tower Defense games for me is the beautiful art style. I am not a huge fan of pixelated games, though I will try them if I hear good things about it. Another thing are the heroes and their unique abilities to help you in battle, as well as your own abilities. Reviews for this game are generally overwhelmingly positive, and rightfully so. This game is perfect for that coffee break during work hours, or for sitting at home when you want something casual yet challenging and stimulating at the same time. I highly recommend this game, and if you don't feel like paying for the full version before you get a taste, go try it out on www.kongregate.com and get a taste of the game for yourself!

												If you own this on your Android device, and I assume your iOS device too, it's essentially the same game.  It 's a bit more challenging, because you can't buy the powerups with money you earn.  There is no money to earn.  The problem I have with this game is that you pay 3x more than the mobile version, and still only get the first game.  I was hoping they would have given you the Frontier locations, as well as the new Origins regions.If you are a die hard Kingdom Rush fan, then you'll like this version.  Otherwise, if you own the mobile versions, don't bother.			"

The interactable easter eggs in the map are cute and fun and make you pay attention to the maps. Tesla towers are the best towers in the game, followed by the wizard tower with the teleport ability and then the wrath of the forest archery towers. Everything else sucks (except mage towers, mage towers are always good and get REALLY good when you get said upgrades).			"

												Kingdom Rush is an all around superb TD game that just gets everything right.  The art looks great with the PC real estate compared to the original tablet version though the latter currently includes a few more features due to post-launch updates. The iOS version has received an endless mode/map as well as an item shop where coins earned during games can be spent on helpful items (especially useful on some of the secondary challenge objectives). Ideally some updates will make it to the Steam version but if not rest assured that if you're a fan of the genre, Kingdom Rush will not disappoint.			"

												Medieval tower defense game, with upgrade trees and nice graphics. To me it misses two things to make it even better:a) Hero upgrades (besides the building upgrades)b) Speed increase (x2, x4, etc)			"

												When you come to this game, don't let the simple appearance fool you, for its charm lies precisely within that. The game is great. It has engaging tactical gameplay, cool level desgins, funny dialogues and great music. The PC version on Steam has more stages, more heroes and improved graphic compared to the Flash version, so it is still worth buying even if you have played the Flash version. This is one of the best, if not THE BEST, tower defense games I have ever played.For 7 dollars, you are assured with 20+ hours of good time.			"

												Basic tower game including power up development, hero's, and variety of bad guys. Could use more basic tower type but each type can have several development paths that can have a win or loose effect depending on the level. Basically another way to kill time without having to get to evolved.			"

												Stress-free, addictive and not too hard but fun (great voice acting).  Many ways to win but may need to explore various options with towers and heros. Heros are extremely useful.  Some challenging modes do not allow them so you can't always depend on heros.  First TD game that I was interested enough to played until unlock all the achievements and beat all the modes!			"

												I know what you're thinking...why pay $9.99 for a game that was $0.99 for iOS? Well, let me tell you it's completely worth it. First off, Ironhide has remastered the graphics...it's no longer running on flash. Second, there's no DLC or real-money purchases like on iOS. Everything's already unlocked! There's bonus content as well!And that's to say nothing of the gameplay, which is fantastic. Kingdom Rush is on par with the greatest tower defenses I've ever played. There are only 4 towers, but they all have branching upgrades. All upgrades provide a cosmetic change as well, which is nice. Despite only having 4 base towers, there's a good amount of strategy involved in picking the right ones and upgrading appropriately. If you don't, you're gonna have a bad time, especially on some of the harder levels.The art is fantastic, the music is alright, and the game's wit/humor is good without beating you over the head with it. And if that's not enough for you, there's a horde of Steam achievements as well as trading cards.			"

												You know what it is, you know what it does.  And if you don't, go play the -free- version on any of the flash sites before buying this.BUT!  Note that while the Steam version may have unlocked all heroes and what not, it is not the equivalent of ""premium content"" from other sites.  No extra reinforcement unit, no alternate skin, no extra gold bonus, etc etc.  You get what you pay for, and the developer obviously can't toss other benefactors like armor games to the side.  Take your picks.			"

It's a great game and cheesy in it's own little way (But the voices... i cringe when i hear them xD) Some downsides include only 4 selections of towers, I could do with more ways of #reck-ing goblins with cool abilities and stuff.

												Large variety of high tier towers and tower abilities, many heroes to choose from that can be leveled up and controlled in game, 2 spells that can be leveled up and used in game on cooldown, varied map environments, usable map elements, diverse enemies and wave combinations cause interesting problems to be solved.  Has a great tutorial, excellent difficulty curve, probably easily beatable normal mode for veterans, but there are two additional modes and diffculties to play each map, which are not just rehashes of the same enemies with more health, but actually finely tuned scenarios with some towers locked, and new enemies/waves, which means a specific strategy must be used, which in turn teaches you new strategies to be applied in other levels.  I started on tower defense games in the late 90's when they were all browser/flash based.  I've been hooked since, playing nearly evey tower defense game available.  I think I own about 30 on steam alone.  This is my all time favorite.			"

This Tower Defence game takes almost no time to pick up and figure out, but with innumerable combinations of towers, upgrades, and heroes, it offers a real challenge without being unfair, and lets you up the ante with challenge modes and multiple difficulties. Plus, they throw in a few amusing references to other books, movies, and games for good measure. Absolutely worth $10 if you even remotely like Tower Defence games.			"

What is Kingdom Rush?Kingdom Rush is a Tower Defense game. Each level has roads that enemies traverse in waves and if they get from their starting position to the other end you lose life points, causing you to fail that level when your life reaches zero. To prevent that from happening players can build towers, control heroes and summon comets and reinforcements.Towers can be built on predetermined locations alongside the road and attack the enemy. There are four kinds of towers - Barracks, Dwarven Bombard, Archer and Mage - and each affect different types of foes in different ways.Heroes are powerful individuals who will aid you, leveling up as they vanquish foes, unlocking new abilities and becoming even stronger as the level continues.Apart from that, the player is also able to summon a Rain of Fire from the skies to strike foes on the battlefield or spawn timed reinforcements.Money, game modes and upgradesMoney is collected by slaying enemies and starting new waves of enemies early and is used to either upgrade existing towers or build new ones.There are three game modes per level in total: Campaign, Iron Challenge and Heroic. Whilst Campaign is the normal story mode, Iron Challenge and Heroic provide a new challenge, spawning stronger waves of enemies and having restrictions on what towers, upgrades and heroes may be used.Based on your performance per mode you get awarded stars; these can be used to permanently upgrade towers and summons (Rain of Fire and reinforcements), providing strong bonuses.Why I recommend this gameThis game has a lot to offer both to casual and more veteran gamers, due to the tactical nature of the gameplay.Although the earlier levels can be beaten with relative ease, the difficulty ramps up quickly and provides the players some really tough challenges, especially during the later stages of the Campaign and the Iron and Heroic modes in general. The varied levels - and therefore ever-changing predetermined locations for your towers - always force you to strategize to achieve maximum effectiveness. As the waves of enemies per level are non-random, meaning wave X always has Y type(s) of enemies in Z amount, knowing what you're up against is extremely helpful, not just for your towers, but also when to cast Rain of Fire and reinforcements.Add to that the twelve heroes who each fight differently and have their own perks and weaknesses when it comes to different types of enemies, and you see why this is rightly called a tactical game.For me, I also really like the bright colourful artwork and the achievements, frequently referencing games and movies.If I have to mention a negative, it would be that later levels of the Campaign are quite lengthy due to the number of waves and as it's impossible to save during a level, some players might find it too long.As it stands though, I highly recommend this game, especially for those fond of Tower Defense games. If you're not sure and would like to try out the game before purchase, there is a free legal version on several gaming websites. You don't get all levels and heroes, but it should provide you with enough to decide whether this would be a worthwhile purchase.			"

												The best tower defense game I have ever played.Humor, references, graphics, enemies, levels, music, voice acting... every single thing in this game fits perfectly with the rest. Fun, but also sometimes very challenging levels, interesting heroes... This game just has it all.For me, this game felt like it's a giant puzzle with many small pieces which you love putting together and spending all of your free time on it, and when you put it together you realise how beautiful it is... and then you are sad because you actually finished putting it together, and you want to turn back time and start from the very beginning.On a scale from 1 to 10, if I'd give 10 to Kingdom Rush, then I would definitely underrate it. 100!

												Kingdom Rush is a tower defense game with rather cute grafics and surprisingly complex and tactic gameplay. There are various strategies one can employ to win the maps and since there are restrictions on what towers you can use on higher difficulty maps you may find yourself thinking and testing a few times before you win the harder maps.Balance between the different towers isn't perfect though. There are some that are simply overpowered so you may find yourself using those exculively.The same goes for the heroes you can recruit. You will probably use only very few of the ones on offer since they are way more usefel than the others.Still, overall I enjoyed the game very much.Grabbing it on a sale like right now, you will definitely get your money's worth.

												When my girlfriend left me and all of the stocks I had invested in crashed, this game saved me from crying into what I like to call my ""Tear Jar"". You see, whenever I cry, I collect all of my tears into the Tear Jar and then when I've saved up a lot of tears I go to the nearest willow tree and water the ground with my tears. This is why you see weeping willows everywhere in the world. But since I started playing this game I haven't cried once! Nothing takes the pain away like stopping hordes of orcs and annoying flying broken gargoyles that make you lose and have to restart the stage. I give this game a 9/10, it's provided me with a lot of fun and also drastically increase global warming due to the decrease in weeping willows.			"

												Probably my favorite TD ever. The original flash version basically redefined the word TowerDefence for me. The mix of careful planning, direct interaction with abilities and heroes, and rolling with the mayhem of constantly changing and interesting maps and a large roster of enemy types make it one of the smartest and best balanced games of its type. I had always wanted to support the developer but never go for micro-transactions. When the PC version went up on the Summer Sale for just a couple bucks I was all over it. And the sequel (Frontiers) is even better.			"

												I've played Kingdom Rush Frontiers on ArmorGames.com and immediately got hooked. When I saw there was a full game on Steam for a low price? I immediately bought it and now I'm halfway through it! I was no fan of tower defenses (literal towers and lanes, not Plants vs Zombies, please) until I tried Ironhide Studio's Kingdom Rush!! If you want REAL tower defense, get THIS game. It is full of content, full of  different characters and towers to try out, placement, upgrades and strategy actually COUNT in this game. It IS simple, but it won't baby you and you won't need babying but it DOES have reasonable challenges. Get this game!! And try the game on ArmorGames, it is significantly different than this game here somehow, but I have no complaints.HOWEVER, and I don't know if only I'm the one experiencing it, but the Steam version of Kingdom Rush has its...bugs. On the technical side sometimes out-of-stage music plays alongside the in-stage music, and if I didn't pause and unpause the game, the introduction of a new tower I just unlocked won't show up and I cannot continue the game as the stage is unclickable.It sometime also has some visual bugs. There's random imagery fidgeting around the top right of the map selection screen. And somehow every time I quit to the main menu, it either has loads of Kingdom Rush logos splashed across a screen of black or just a black screen (the buttons of the main menu can still be clicked though, but of course I don't know which is which.)These happen sometimes and not all of the times. I'll reinstall for the 3rd time later, so I am not sure if I am just tad unlucky on getting corrupted files, or it is really a bug. With all that said, KUDOS to Ironhide Game Studio. Thankyou for your work!!			"

												Enjoyable game.  It's simple to learn, provides some very basic tactical challenges and overall is entertaining.  There are some frustrations, especially in the more difficult levels where long periods of work are undone by a single mistake on a level forcing you to replay the entire thing, but if you like tower defense and are looking for something very basic...this is perfect...

												There are a lot of mediocre tower defense games in general.  Most of them are just flash player games, some eventually make it to other platforms in strange ways.  Kingdom Rush is actually a flash game turned cell phone game.  Brought to steam, Iron Fist Games managed to pack two cell phone games into one and bring it to the PC.  What I love most about Kingdom Rush is that it's fun and simple, which is good in a tower defense game.  There's plenty of strategy, but it reinforces those two tenets through it's art style and how it plays.I was initially turned off by how few tower types there were, but the game becomes somewhat deep as you progress through the campaign.  Eventually you realize there are certain towers that are more powerful than others, but very few levels can be completed with a single tower.  Likewise, the addition of Heroic and Iron versions of each level give an added level of difficulty and strategy that games like Defense Grid have tried so hard to achieve.I highly recommend Kingdom Rush to scratch that tower defense itch.  Not only did I play the game for over 70 hours (and counting,) I managed to get all of the achievements.  It's within reach, and it's very fun.			"

												A enjoyably quaint tower defense, although it sometimes feels like the game takes a pretty serious jump in difficulty from level to level later on.  Still, the art direction is wonderful and very reminiscent of some of the prettier 2D games of years past, with plenty of enemy types and tower options.  This one positively exudes charm and surprising strategic depth.			"

Great (and i mean great) artwork, balanced gameplay and you really feel motivated to get more stars (i.e complete the mission on a higher difficulty). The only drawback is that you will get waaaay to many stars for the skilltree (you spend stars to level up) so after a while you will have every upgrade and still have stars to spare.			"

												As good as a Tower Defense can be! The maps are interesting and there is room for immersive strategy. I would seriously recommend this game to casual strategy enthusiasts and of course Tower Defense players.I would really enjoy if there was some sort of persistent hero progression. I wouldn't necessarily want to start every map with a level 10 hero but it should be fun to have a skill tree for heroes. Additionally, a hotkey for calling waves early would also be handy. In general more hotkey or keybindings would be nice.A ton of fun!			"

												Quite enjoyable. Very easy to pick up. The levels begin trivially easy, but rapidly begin to challenge. Yet you will find that you can proceed 3/4 through the game winning each map on the first or second try, which I find enjoyable. The later maps require many multiple tries.Between the during-session upgrades, the between-session player upgrades, and the (limited) strategic placement of buildings, there are many aspects to master.Quite worth around $15-$20.

The art and animations are reminiscent of something from The Behemoth, the sound is appropriate to the style, and the game play is incredibly smooth. Even at full price, this is well worth the cost of admission. It's got a lot of content packed into that $10 price tag. Note that this is NOT infected with the micro-transaction, money-grab nonsense that ruined the mobile versions. Everything is included in the initial price and the game is infinitely better for it.

												Kingdom Rush is, without a doubt, the second best classic-style Tower Defense game out there. The first being the Defense Grid series, of course. That said, if you own Defense Grid (or not) you deserve to give Kingdom Rush a chance anyway.Starting out as a portable game on iOS and Android, I half expected the PC version to just be a cheap port. Oh man was I wrong! Graphics are subtly improved, while not loosing their style. The map view is way better on the PC version. The difficulty has been upped, to force you to plan better. Even mouse effects have been added when you're casting your ""fireball"" and ""reinforce"" skills. The game actually feels as if it was made for the PC, and that's how game ports should be!The graphics for Kingdom Rush are different and unique. You'll absolutely love them. The tower upgrades are also VERY well done, with each upgrade changing both the look of the ""tower"" and the ""units"" it supports. While not really that dissimilar from the portable version, it does make viewing the game on 24+ inch screens a delightful experience.Gamev play is the biggest surprise here, because this isn't any ordinary tower defense game. There's also a bit of RTS involved. For example, when you put down a ""soldier"" tower (which spawns 3 soldiers) you can set a relay flag within the radius of the tower's influence. This allows you to put many towers in close proximity, rallying them at the same spot to form an army, or have your tower in the vicinity of multiple paths so you can adjust your raly deployments to whichever path needs it at the time. Yes, there is often more than one route to the ""map exit"" you have to protect, sometimes even multiple exits... You also get a hero, and unlock new heroes as you continue. You'll have to decide which hero you need for a specific level, as they all have different skills. This game also has a very hefty ""skill tree"" that can mean the difference between life and death. To unlock these bonuses you have to collect stars. Each level has a capability of providing you with 3 stars and you lose stars based on how many enemies make it past your defenses. This will bring you to, regularly, have to go back and clean up earlier levels. Some will argue that this is a bad thing. I argue that it's actually a good thing. First, when you take on those earlier levels again you do so with your upgrades intact, which makes them easy. Second, it allows you to take a break from not being able to beat your current level, so you don't consider ""rage quitting"". Third, it allows you to gain more stars so you can unlock more abilities and then decimate that level you were just getting ticked off at. Proper leveling can really make a difference on the game's overall difficulty.The music for the game is pretty repetitive, with each level having virtually the same music to it. That said, it doesn't get annoying in the least. It's pretty much background sound, as the weapon clashing, arrow flinging, magic casting, and bomb exploding takes center stage in the audio department. Sound is very well handled, and I like the fact that there is a bit of voice added to the characters as well.I was going to give Kingdom Rush a 9/10, but I think I need to up the scale because I feel it's more like 99/100. Why did it lose a point? Well, I felt sometimes you didn't get enough money from kills to have the upgrades you needed to defeat the level. You're constantly going, ""Dammit if I could have only upgraded that tower once more I would have stopped that last guy!"" That said, it's all part of the challenge, and this game is a challenge.If you like classic Tower Defense games, this is one you have to own. It will frustrate the hell out of you, it will bring you a lot of satisfaction, and It's well worth the $10.* My review is based on my 30+ years of gaming experience, my vast experience with other games like this one, and my experiences with this game on both Android and PC.  Constructive criticism is encouraged, however if your comment is based solely on the fact you can’t beat this game then I suggest you move along as you won’t find sympathy here.			"

												Tower defense games are my preferred game style for the last few years.  Many developers have tried to come into the space and capture the experience but Ironhide Game Studios has set the bar to epic with Kingdom Rush.I have purchased this game for iPhone, iPad and for the PC and have done a full play through almost 4 times (once for each platform, twice on the iPad).  The PC version sports a few differences that are worth mentioning if you already have played through on the iOS.PC differences of note:1) There is no more collecting crystals during in-game play for purchasing ""extras"" for use during levels.  On the PC you have what you are able to do during the level and that is it.2) There is no difficultly settings to play with.  On IOS there is Normal and Hard mode; PC allows no selection.3) On PC you have open access to all of the heroes; no need to purchase them as you did on the IOS versions.If you are a fan of any Tower Defense games and would like to explore the genre a bit more, Kingdom Rush is a very easy recommendation and carries with it quite a bit of replayability.  Go forth and defend the kingdom!			"

												""Archer's READY?! BULLSEYE!""This is one of the best tower defense games ever made. Fun animation, secrets, cultural references, enthusiastic voice acting. A lot of love and handcrafted design has went into this gem.I have played the free flash version, the mobile version and expansion, and now the Steam version. I can attest that this is the best version of the game out there.			"

												If you played the flash game for free(on PC), this new version comes back without too much change. There are maybe 6-7 extra maps to beat than previously. In the old flash game there were not heroes but now there are. (Heroes are just units that you can move around and auto-attack/auto cast spells). This is actually still pretty challenging for me. At the time of this review I have not beaten all of the levels, for a full 3 stars. I still have a map or two before finishing it.The tech tree remains the same as from the flash version. Overall it's a good game and worth the money for what you get.			"

												Towers are and their upgrades are great. The bonuses are balanced pretty well and work well together. Cool artwork. Challenges are tough and help teach the strengths and weaknesses of tower synergy. Boss fights are challenging and satisfying. Little bits of humor. The champions are useful and fun to use. If you like Tower Defense then this is the second best you can get behind Defense Grid.			"

												Quite enjoyable. Very easy to pick up. The levels begin trivially easy, but rapidly begin to challenge. Yet you will find that you can proceed 3/4 through the game winning each map on the first or second try, which I find enjoyable. The later maps require many multiple tries.Between the during-session upgrades, the between-session player upgrades, and the (limited) strategic placement of buildings, there are many aspects to master.Quite worth around $15-$20.

												Note: I played the tablet version, not PC one, so it might be a bit different.Kingdom Rush is a very enjoyable tower defense game. It has a very nice look and feel. The difficulty seems somewhat imbalanced. I had no problems to finish some levels on hard, while some levels were very difficult even on easy. The first half of the game was more fun, there was a lot of progress and new things. The second half had some interesting new enemies, but there was no more development in towers or heroes, which is a pity.The fact that you can't place your towers anywhere, just on designated spots, changes the tower defense concept quite a bit. Some people might like it, some might not. Kingdom Rush also usually gives you quite low amount of money, so you have to carefully plan what you build and where. Instead of just playing spontaneously as in other TD games, this makes this particular game also close to a strategy/puzzle game. If you don't plan carefully the tower layout from the very early beginning, nothing will help you.			"

												When my girlfriend left me and all of the stocks I had invested in crashed, this game saved me from crying into what I like to call my ""Tear Jar"". You see, whenever I cry, I collect all of my tears into the Tear Jar and then when I've saved up a lot of tears I go to the nearest willow tree and water the ground with my tears. This is why you see weeping willows everywhere in the world. But since I started playing this game I haven't cried once! Nothing takes the pain away like stopping hordes of orcs and annoying flying broken gargoyles that make you lose and have to restart the stage. I give this game a 9/10, it's provided me with a lot of fun and also drastically increase global warming due to the decrease in weeping willows.			"

												Probably my favorite TD ever. The original flash version basically redefined the word TowerDefence for me. The mix of careful planning, direct interaction with abilities and heroes, and rolling with the mayhem of constantly changing and interesting maps and a large roster of enemy types make it one of the smartest and best balanced games of its type. I had always wanted to support the developer but never go for micro-transactions. When the PC version went up on the Summer Sale for just a couple bucks I was all over it. And the sequel (Frontiers) is even better.			"

												Its hard to describe how great this game really is. I think my fiance hates it. ;) I literally beat the game in the original mode (not heroic or champion) within 2 days. It's that addictive. I've played a few TD games here or there, but this one is by far the greatest. I had some laughs (prepare for the hilariously foul languaged bombardment towers in all their Irish-accent-glory). The one thing I can't wait for is MORE LEVELS! I really wish they would have some type of ""endless"" mode like some TD's out there have. You'd be able to hone your skills and see how far you can get and compare scores with others by how many waves you defeat..One of the funnest parts about this game is ""picking the right hero for the right battle."" You'll pick up on this pretty quick once you get toward the end-game. After you beat this game in original mode, you'll unlock a few more levels (some are ridiculously hard! Make use of Tesla towers every chance you get.. they'll get you by.) Heroic and the other modes are fun.. they definitely require some thought. I just wish I could make use of Heroes after the end-game a little more.. they're fun to play with.I can't wait for more content!! I give this game a solid 10/10. Great developers, great game. They also listen to the community and offer patch-releases that update some requested features. Awesome!			"

												A tower defence game, and a great one at that! :DKingdom Rush is a game I found out about from a friend years ago. He told me to check it out in an email and gave a link to the free version. I loved it, and I think I finished it. Tower defence games are one of only two genres that I actually like as a whole (the other being platformers), so I might give this game credit where credit isn't necessarily due, but the point is that it's good.You get four types of towers to defend your... defendable... things with. I'll describe each one briefly:-Barracks: Barracks train soldiers called footmen who block enemies paths. The main draw is that they slow the enemy down to allow more hits from your ranged towers. Footmen are the only units that can die. They deal melee damage, which is affected by armor.-Archers: The barracks can't do everything, though. That's where ranged towers like archers come in. Ranged towers do most of the damage usually. Archers do melee damage for some reason (think of it more like physical I guess?), which means their damage is affected by armor. The thing is that they're faster than footmen and have more range. They stay in their tower and shoot things from high up, so they can't be killed/destroyed by enemies like the footmen can.-Mages: Magic has a unique type of damage--it's not affected by armor. This makes mage towers VERY useful. They do more damage than archers, too, but they're slightly slower. Even so, I prefer mages to archers, usually. There are enemies that are resistant to magic, though. Just like archers, mages are ranged.-Artillery... cannons: Artillery is ranged bombs, basically, that are shot into the air and rain down on groups of enemies. The explosions do damage by area instead of by enemy, which makes them good for taking out groups of weak enemies. They're slow and expensive, though. I think they do melee/physical damage.I should mention that there are flying enemies that will go right over your footmen. You'll need a good ranged defence to fight them. You also get meteors and reinforcements. Meteors are for emergencies and do a lot of area damage. Reiforcements are like free extra footmen. Finally, there are heroes, which are characters you always start with. You can only have one hero at a time, but you pick which one. As you can see, there's some depth in this game. I'd recommend this, especially if you like tower defence.			"

												I don't even know how to articulate how good this game is to me. It's so polished. So fun. There are like 20-30 stages that have three different difficulties that force you to use unique strategies. The gameplay consists of paths with preset locations upon which you can build towers. There are four tower types and each has three upgrades and two specializations each. Each specialization has its own set of upgrades. The depth of tower upgrades reminds me of some AAA RTS games. The enemies consist of orcs and wizards and other generic baddies with varying resilience and counterstrategies. A lot of tower defense games rely on tower placement as gameplay. Towers in Kingdom Rush have such a diverse set of utility and manual management that placement may not even be in the top 3 strategic priorities. You have a fireball spell that you cast yourself, and you also have a hero of your choice for some levels that you manually move around the map and engage enemies. You can also call two reinforcement warriors into battle at the location of your choice on a 20 or 30 second cooldown. So much to micromanage. The onslaught of enemy hordes is relentless, so you are constantly fighting an uphill battle that requires split second analysis and action, sometimes even sacrificing towers to fortify another path. I highly recommend this game to everyone who enjoys tower defense and also to everyone who doesn't enjoy tower defense. You may be surprised how fun this game is for you.			"

												Score: 90Concept: Tower Defense ExtravaganzaKingdom Rush is basically a direct port of the flash game the would be ported onto the IOS and Android platform. Not every game should be ported from tablet form to a full PC game. However Kingdom Rush has already established itself as a major player in the tower defense genre. Before you point out that I paid real money for a game that is literally available for free on websites like Kongregate, there is a reason to buy it. In the app version there is loads of premium content that one has to pay for separately. In the PC version you get the full game, no exceptions. So, if you have it on your tablet or phone is it really any different? No. Not at all. It's the exact same fun game.Kingdom Rush takes the existing TD genre and gives it character. For such a simple little game there is so much content to it. And if you are looking for that next challenge look no further. Kingdom Rush is a deceptive game that fools you into believing you can do it then crushes your dreams two minutes later. However there is a bigger picture. You can upgrade your overall tower abilities and skills as you beat more of the game by earning stars. And it gets better, you can respec your skills freely whenever you wish. So if a level calls for just arrow towers as a strategy then max out your arrow tower strength. But if another level needs every tower then respec your skills to balance out your strength.The game is also full of fun easter eggs and achievements that are meaningless but just add more character to this already full game. There is also a hero system that will come in handy. As your hero makes kills on the field he/she/it will level up and gain strength and abilities. You'll have several of these heroes to chose from as well and the best part is that most of them are like 2.99 in the app. Its insane. The game is visually appealing with a fantastic color palette. This may be easier on a touch screen though as I lose some time with my mouse and keyboard.Second Opinion: I'm not paying for a free game...			"

												I assume that Kingdom Rush is basically the Steam/PC port of a popular mobile game that was really first popular on Amor Games' popular flash site made by Ironhide games.  Sorry if that is a little confusing, but really the game is a flash tower defense game and why would you pay money for something you could probably play in browser for free?The short answer to that question is that you should pay for it becasue the game is really good, challenging, and supported.  The game itself isn't really innovative because the whole tower defense game genre is pretty stacked full, but this is a well executed TD with a great theme.  I really liked the art becuase it brought me back to the days where I did sit around and play flash games online.  Also it reminded me of Warcraft III tower defense games because of the use of heroes.  It has multiple difficulties which actually make the game much harder and give the game some much needed depth.  But the biggest reason this game is worth the money is becuse the game is supported.  Instead of releasing tons of DLCs Ironhide has decided to just release new levels as they build up to the second game.  Supporting a studio like that is a good enough reason for me to buy this game.  And for those of you out there who just complain about microtransactions and DLC costs, this should be a game you should straight up buy then.  Because I got this game when it came out and since then several new levels just showed up in my game for free!In the end Kingdom Rush is simply a good TD game.  It is a throw back to both flash and Warcraft III TDs that will put up a fight.  And you should buy this game because supporting studios who continue to develop content for paying customers with out added DLC or microtransaction costs is a great policy to support.			"

												Unfortunately, because there is a free version of this game available on kongregate, and a cheaper one if you have a mobile device, there's the inevitable question of if this version is worth your $10.00.But before we go there, Kingdom Rush is a simple and well crafted tower defense game.  It has enough new features (like the core of your defense being a soldier spawning tower) and is quality enough to stand out of the pack, in both the tower defense genre and ""free"" browser games.   Liking tower defense games is obviously a pre-requisite, but it's also simple enough to be a great point of entry.Why buy this version?  If you loathe freetoplay games in any incarnation as much as I do, here's the way to play without any of it.  Everything you'd pay extra for in the browser and mobile versions is all here for the entry price.  That's about it, but the core game is good enough that this game would definately be worth a purchase, all things being equal.Honestly, I'd reccomend going to the kongregate site, trying this out for a while, and if you enjoy it, wait for a steam sale and pick this up.  Hopefully there have been enough sales to persuade Ironhide to release full versions of the sequels.			"

												If you are a tower defence fan then Kingdom Rush is one you should certainly not miss.It’s a cute looking game with many additions to the traditional tower defence model that add a lot of depth. The big thing about the game is that, it’s busier then your regular tower defence because you have a hero character to manage and defence points to alter by moving around the location where your units hold the front.Of course there are plenty of different towers and upgrades and a plethora of various enemies of unique characteristics.Sound design is decent, graphics are cute, and mechanics are solid. There is a bit of storyline there as well but nothing to write home about. Just a great tower defence experience.8/10 "

It 's a bit more challenging, because you can't buy the powerups with money you earn.  There is no money to earn.  The problem I have with this game is that you pay 3x more than the mobile version, and still only get the first game.  I was hoping they would have given you the Frontier locations, as well as the new Origins regions.If you are a die hard Kingdom Rush fan, then you'll like this version.

												Its a good TD. You dont maze in this one, just use the designated area's to build 4 kinds of towers.Archer, Magic, AOE and soldier towers. You can also use a hero that moves on the map freely and you have the ability to use 2 kinds of powers. 1 is a rain of fire and the other one is to summon 2 soldiers that cant move but stand their ground.Using a hero and 2 summoned soldiers is a good way to stop the advance of the enemie. Because walking enemies must attack ground units (towers will never be attacked). If you place your units in close range of towers, they can shoot at the enemies the soldiers are also attacking.The maps are diverse and sometimes hard to beat, but when you play the map a couple of time you can find the weakness of the enemie and adapt to it.

												I love shopping during sales cause it gives me the opportunity to try out all kinds of games. Some are bad, some are okey and some are pretty darn good. This is one of the latter.The game is pretty easy to learn, even if you've never played this type (Tower Defense) of game before thanks to simple controls, easy to understand mechanics and in-game hints. Difficulty starts out very simple and then scales upwards as you go at a satisfying pace.Controls are simple, you use your mouse to click where you want to build structures (pre-defined locations) and when you want to upgrade. There are quickbinds for your spells (1 and 2) as well as your hero (space), allowing for fast selection when needed.Graphics are cartoonish, colorfull and very charming while animations aren't next generation they're still very satisfying and fits the theme. Not many graphic options except for resolution (1920x1080, weee!), windowed and a quality level although I think those cover all the relevant things.The sound is pretty good and can be adjusted in-game.As far as gameplay goes this one will give you quite a few hours of tower building and monster killing thanks to the campaign mode and, once finished (or during), you can go back to completed maps in order to complete the Iron or Heroic challenges (same basic map, new waves, new rules, 1 life!). There are more or less hidden achievements during some of the maps as well as whenever you complete a map you earn stars which can be spent on the world map in order to upgrade things.Many unique monsters, several bosses and a dozen+ playable heroes have kept me entertained for 25h+ ^_^So, all in all, I'd say this is a great game, giving it a 4!1 - Crap, don't buy2 - Fun for an evening3 - It's an alright game but not my taste4 - Great game5 - One of the best I've ever played			"

Each level has roads that enemies traverse in waves and if they get from their starting position to the other end you lose life points, causing you to fail that level when your life reaches zero. To prevent that from happening players can build towers, control heroes and summon comets and reinforcements.Towers can be built on predetermined locations alongside the road and attack the enemy. There are four kinds of towers - Barracks, Dwarven Bombard, Archer and Mage - and each affect different types of foes in different ways.Heroes are powerful individuals who will aid you, leveling up as they vanquish foes, unlocking new abilities and becoming even stronger as the level continues.Apart from that, the player is also able to summon a Rain of Fire from the skies to strike foes on the battlefield or spawn timed reinforcements.Money, game modes and upgradesMoney is collected by slaying enemies and starting new waves of enemies early and is used to either upgrade existing towers or build new ones.There are three game modes per level in total: Campaign, Iron Challenge and Heroic. Whilst Campaign is the normal story mode, Iron Challenge and Heroic provide a new challenge, spawning stronger waves of enemies and having restrictions on what towers, upgrades and heroes may be used.Based on your performance per mode you get awarded stars; these can be used to permanently upgrade towers and summons (Rain of Fire and reinforcements), providing strong bonuses.Why I recommend this gameThis game has a lot to offer both to casual and more veteran gamers, due to the tactical nature of the gameplay.Although the earlier levels can be beaten with relative ease, the difficulty ramps up quickly and provides the players some really tough challenges, especially during the later stages of the Campaign and the Iron and Heroic modes in general. The varied levels - and therefore ever-changing predetermined locations for your towers - always force you to strategize to achieve maximum effectiveness. As the waves of enemies per level are non-random, meaning wave X always has Y type(s) of enemies in Z amount, knowing what you're up against is extremely helpful, not just for your towers, but also when to cast Rain of Fire and reinforcements.Add to that the twelve heroes who each fight differently and have their own perks and weaknesses when it comes to different types of enemies, and you see why this is rightly called a tactical game.For me, I also really like the bright colourful artwork and the achievements, frequently referencing games and movies.If I have to mention a negative, it would be that later levels of the Campaign are quite lengthy due to the number of waves and as it's impossible to save during a level, some players might find it too long.As it stands though, I highly recommend this game, especially for those fond of Tower Defense games. If you're not sure and would like to try out the game before purchase, there is a free legal version on several gaming websites. You don't get all levels and heroes, but it should provide you with enough to decide whether this would be a worthwhile purchase.			"

												Enjoyable game.  It's simple to learn, provides some very basic tactical challenges and overall is entertaining.  There are some frustrations, especially in the more difficult levels where long periods of work are undone by a single mistake on a level forcing you to replay the entire thing, but if you like tower defense and are looking for something very basic...this is perfect...

												Easy to learn, difficult to master. This Tower Defence game takes almost no time to pick up and figure out, but with innumerable combinations of towers, upgrades, and heroes, it offers a real challenge without being unfair, and lets you up the ante with challenge modes and multiple difficulties. Plus, they throw in a few amusing references to other books, movies, and games for good measure. Absolutely worth $10 if you even remotely like Tower Defence games.			"

												A lot of fun! Requests from creators if they are going to expand or make dlc. I don't know if others would want this but this is something I think would be cool in Kingdom Rush. 1) Add out of match  leveling, and costumization  mechanics for the heroes. (I know they level in game, but I want to be able to do more with the heroes I like. Make it feel like my hero is more unique.) 2) Allow to costumize keyboard scheme. (Sometimes I wish I had other ways to do things faster. In the heat of the moment I feel clumsy.) 3) Add a challenge mode or trial mode for online comparisons. 4) Add 1 or 2 more towers in the scheme but only allow 4 total in the actual map/match. Meaning just how you pick your hero before a match you also have to pick your towers. 5) More maps, and more secrets.			"

Some may complain being like ""oooh, you can just get a free flash game and play for free on a web browser""I say [/spoiler]""Oi, ♥♥♥♥ off!""[/spoiler]. It's a great game and cheesy in it's own little way (But the voices... i cringe when i hear them xD) Some downsides include only 4 selections of towers, I could do with more ways of #reck-ing goblins with cool abilities and stuff. Overall sexy game, sexy-cringy voices and EngieIsSexy :) "

												A very fun and quite addicting Tower Defense game! It took about 4-5 hours to complete the main story line missions, which flowed in a nice increasing level of difficulty. I did take a bit of extra time to replay one mission 3-4 times to get the 3 stars (highest achievement).  The game was challenging, but not too difficult -- so even people new to tower defense games can get through  it and have a good time. There is more missions and challenges unlocked as you progress through, so I'm still going to get some more value out of this game.  Also there is some great power ups and enhancements as well as several 'hero' characters you can choose to help you fight the bad guys. So there is personalization to enhance your playing style and your choice of strategy. Lots of fun!  If you can get this game for under $5 its a no-brainer. At $10, it's still a great buy if your a fan of the genre.  If you've never played a tower defense game, give this a shot! You won't be dissapointed! 9/10			"

												Large variety of high tier towers and tower abilities, many heroes to choose from that can be leveled up and controlled in game, 2 spells that can be leveled up and used in game on cooldown, varied map environments, usable map elements, diverse enemies and wave combinations cause interesting problems to be solved.  Has a great tutorial, excellent difficulty curve, probably easily beatable normal mode for veterans, but there are two additional modes and diffculties to play each map, which are not just rehashes of the same enemies with more health, but actually finely tuned scenarios with some towers locked, and new enemies/waves, which means a specific strategy must be used, which in turn teaches you new strategies to be applied in other levels.  I started on tower defense games in the late 90's when they were all browser/flash based.  I've been hooked since, playing nearly evey tower defense game available.  I think I own about 30 on steam alone.  This is my all time favorite.			"

However, attempting to get 5 stars on every map, then going to heroic and iron modes, will triple the playtime of this gameRecommendation:  A must-have for fans of tower-defense games			"

												If you like tower defense games then this is a must buy.The game keeps getting updated so there are always new levels to play, unless you are really, really, really good at the game there is no way you can complete the whole thing very quickly! I love this game and I am now playing it on hard, even though I still couldn't get past some of the levels! Then they updated it, so I had even more content to try and get though!The animations and sound effects are fun and randomly clicking the scenery can often be rewarding as you sometimes get random hidden achievements!I can't honeslty say anything negative about this game :)			"

												The truth is that I have had neither the patience nor the skill to become a decent player with other attempts at various Tower Defence games. The difficulty of the TD genre  is well known, and just like a MOBA (but in a different way of course) the learning curve is as steep as it is long. This is the first, and perhaps most significant, success of Kingdom Rush. It eases you into the difficulty, being neither pedantic at your noobishness nor too quick to assume you've picked up the knack. This is not a polite way of saying ""it's easy so I like it"": I've been beaten by it on multiple times, but only because I've done something wrong or miss-timed a tower upgrade.Its other positives are numerous and substantial. The art is blissfully cartoony and likeable whilst never being too childish or stupid. It has many references to other games and films, and although some of them are a tad clichéd, they still raise a laugh or two (""THIS IS MY BOOMSTICK!"" being a tickler) But most of all, it's a joy to play. When those 3 stars pop up after a perfectly handled wave, you feel a great and long lasting sense of accomplishment. Fending off the numerous and widely varied enemies is great fun: watching hordes of Bandits and Goblins crumble in seconds to allow your towers to focus on a lumbering (and hilariously cute) Ogre really gives the player a sense of ebb and flow which continues to grow in vigorousness and length as you venture deeper into the campaign.To summarise, Kingdom Rush is brilliant and enjoyable game. Whilst purists of the genre may argue it is a little simpler than some of its peers, I feel this is no bad thing. It pulls off a balancing act of fun and challenge that very few games even get close to mimicking.Highly recommended to all.			"

												Quite enjoyable. Very easy to pick up. The levels begin trivially easy, but rapidly begin to challenge. Yet you will find that you can proceed 3/4 through the game winning each map on the first or second try, which I find enjoyable. The later maps require many multiple tries.Between the during-session upgrades, the between-session player upgrades, and the (limited) strategic placement of buildings, there are many aspects to master.Quite worth around $15-$20.

												Great TD that i first played over at Armor Games. Great (and i mean great) artwork, balanced gameplay and you really feel motivated to get more stars (i.e complete the mission on a higher difficulty). The only drawback is that you will get waaaay to many stars for the skilltree (you spend stars to level up) so after a while you will have every upgrade and still have stars to spare.			"

												A unique niche of Tower Defence game that has succeeded in bringing something unique to the genre. The art style is themetic, colorful and timeless. This game has much less tower spam than other games, and focuses on simple strategic placement and upgrades of towers to survive waves of enemies. Towers are unique and brings different advantages to the field, allowing the player to choose branching upgrades depending on their needs.One of my favourite tower defence games. I would recommend playing without heroes as heroes were added later and the game was originally meant to be completed without them.			"

												Great Tower Defense game, 9/10. There is a story told, there are quite some enemy units to counter by your 4 basic towers, which can get a lot of upgrades. On top of that, there are many heroes you can unlock (play one at a time), and by earning stars for beating maps you upgrade towers and spells. Finally, there are a lot of achievements to get, some for finding easter eggs on almost each map. Highly addictive and rewarding! Difficulty was well balanced on normal for the campaign maps, some extra maps however I could barely pass on Casual.			"

												I played this years ago as a free Flash game, and still had to buy it so I could play it again. It's probably one of, if not the best tower defence game ever. The artwork is great, and the voice overs are funny and full of pop culture easter eggs that remind me of Warcraft 2. The levels seem simple but the more you play the more you realize how deep they are, when you start figuring out multiple ways to place your towers and still be surprised.It's a simple game that will give you many hours of gameplay, it's worth the buy.

												I first played kingdom rush back in the early days on a website called Kongregate and thought it was extremely fun. I never imagined that they would be able to improve it so much as to be able to sell the game on Steam! This is a Tower Defense game, meaning that you have to strategically place buildings (There are four buildings to choose from) in locations so the waves of oncoming enemies don't overrun you (get to the other side of the map). The game offers three modes for each map, each giving you currency to upgrade your abilities, buildings and your heroes. Probably the best part about Tower Defense games in general is that there is always more than one way to successfully beat a level, so if you want to beat down your enemies with only arrows, you go girl! (or guy ;p). Unfortunately sometimes a single type of building, despite how many times you upgrade it using the money the monsters you kill drop (which you don't need to worry about picking up thank goodness), won't be sufficient in beating said level. You'll need to adapt sometimes. What sets this game apart from the other Tower Defense games for me is the beautiful art style. I am not a huge fan of pixelated games, though I will try them if I hear good things about it. Another thing are the heroes and their unique abilities to help you in battle, as well as your own abilities. Reviews for this game are generally overwhelmingly positive, and rightfully so. This game is perfect for that coffee break during work hours, or for sitting at home when you want something casual yet challenging and stimulating at the same time. I highly recommend this game, and if you don't feel like paying for the full version before you get a taste, go try it out on www.kongregate.com and get a taste of the game for yourself! My Rating: 7.5/10			"

												If you own this on your Android device, and I assume your iOS device too, it's essentially the same game.  It 's a bit more challenging, because you can't buy the powerups with money you earn.  There is no money to earn.  The problem I have with this game is that you pay 3x more than the mobile version, and still only get the first game.  I was hoping they would have given you the Frontier locations, as well as the new Origins regions.If you are a die hard Kingdom Rush fan, then you'll like this version.  Otherwise, if you own the mobile versions, don't bother.			"

												Great game if you Like causal tower defense. Only downside is the lack of advance targeting system on the towers, so you cannot get them to target anything but the runner in the front. If you are looking for a quick break though, it is a quick game to get through. Only 47 hours of play and I am 100% done.			"

												This is a great port of Kingdom Rush.  The controls are much easier to use with full screen and hotkeys.  The textures are also high res and quite nice.  The world map is especially pleasing.Edit: The Devs have added difficulty levels.  This game is now 10/10.That being said this is a significant gameplay downgrade from the flash version which allowed you to choose your difficulty.  The difficulty in this version feels like normal/easy from the flash version and if you are buying this because you liked the challenge of the flash version I would recommend you save your money.  The aesthetics are nice but with the removal of difficulty modes and a overall difficulty nerf I cannot recommend this game.  Sometimes the iron and heroic modes feel easier than the campaign.  Im hoping they address these issues in a future patch.			"

												Good game, addictive. Some levels are quicker, some are tough and long. But what I hate very much is the fact that the game saves the progress in the slots to the steamapps folder directly to the folder of the game. I have not thought about backing-up this folder when reinstalling computer, so I have to play it again. I have backed-up only Users folder (including Documents etc.). Don't expect super precision in this game, it is still a bit about fun, but there is a lot of strategy to play with.			"

												There are a lot of mediocre tower defense games in general.  Most of them are just flash player games, some eventually make it to other platforms in strange ways.  Kingdom Rush is actually a flash game turned cell phone game.  Brought to steam, Iron Fist Games managed to pack two cell phone games into one and bring it to the PC.  What I love most about Kingdom Rush is that it's fun and simple, which is good in a tower defense game.  There's plenty of strategy, but it reinforces those two tenets through it's art style and how it plays.I was initially turned off by how few tower types there were, but the game becomes somewhat deep as you progress through the campaign.  Eventually you realize there are certain towers that are more powerful than others, but very few levels can be completed with a single tower.  Likewise, the addition of Heroic and Iron versions of each level give an added level of difficulty and strategy that games like Defense Grid have tried so hard to achieve.I highly recommend Kingdom Rush to scratch that tower defense itch.  Not only did I play the game for over 70 hours (and counting,) I managed to get all of the achievements.  It's within reach, and it's very fun.			"

												Truly a masterpiece of a tower defence. Simple and innovative, especially with the barracks towers and upgrade system.Recommended for anyone who hadn't gotten a feel at tower defence.			"

												I definately recommend this game! It's great, fun and it's Tower Defence! Some may complain being like ""oooh, you can just get a free flash game and play for free on a web browser""I say [/spoiler]""Oi, ♥♥♥♥ off!""[/spoiler]. It's a great game and cheesy in it's own little way (But the voices... i cringe when i hear them xD) Some downsides include only 4 selections of towers, I could do with more ways of #reck-ing goblins with cool abilities and stuff. Overall sexy game, sexy-cringy voices and EngieIsSexy :) "

												I reccomend this one for anyone that likes tower defense. It's really fun to play, sadly I get bored in any game after all the ""main"" objectives are completed (Which I mean unlocking new levels and technologies, and beating the bosses. I don't really care about getting 3 stars in all levels).			"

												I'm playing Kingdom Rush (Google Play)Kingdom Rush (Steam)Kingdom Rush Origins (Google Play)Kingdom Rush Frontiers (Google Play)And I do not regret any of my purchases! Best tower defense I've found in a looong while. This game maybe be repetitive but of course if you like tower defense it will not be a problem;There are tons of achievements (on Google Play Store ones atleast), new content every level... Well I'm not going to explain you the game from A to Z, discover it by yourself but you shouldn't regret it.			"
