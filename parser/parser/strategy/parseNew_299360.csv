My first reaction: Oh look, some crappy wannabe Minecraft/Team Fortress game.This will probably take two minutes to learn how to play, and five to reach top score in every server.IWASWRONG.This game is MUCH. MUCH more challenging than it looks. The weapons are fierce and explosives can be unforgiving. Not only that, The blocks you can make are astounding.One that I enjoyed the most was the radar.You can literally place a radar to see EVERYONE. It felt amazing being able to sneak behind a base and place a radar.Not only that, but this game is very tactical.The last game I played probably went on for twenty minutes, and I'm sure games can go to an hour if both teams are skilled.There are traps. Support characters. Attack Charaters. Defense Characters.Honestly, this game is much better than people let on.8.6/10RECENT UPDATE:The game has been updated to be free to play. I also have like 100 more hours under my belt. Here is more review info.You can play as the heroes in the free rotation, but once they leave the free rotation, you have to buy them with either A) gold, or B) platinum. Platinum can be bought with real life money, and gold is gotten in game. BUT! BUT BUT BUT! It isn't pay to win. Characters are just that, characters. No characters are better than others, they all excel in different situations.Then there are perks. Perks can ONLY be bought with gold. Perks upgrade characters (they have downsides too tho) and give them better offensive, defensive, and hero roles. AKA: if you're good at this game, you get better.This also brings a lot more uniqueness into the game. EXAMPLE: Just because someone is Nigel (the sniper) doesn't mean you'll know how to counter him  right away. He could have a gun damage upgrade or a fall damage upgrade.In the game are skins, to add even MORE variation to your choices. Skins can only be bought with platinum, but holy crap they look good. Devs did a good job on them.Also, if you bought the game when it was p2p (like me) you got a bunch of skins free and all the starter heroes unlocked.This game is a few skins, a new gamemode, and a new hero away from being the best multiplayer teamwork-oriented fps game out there.I have re-earned my faith in JagEX.8.9/10I realize now I'm being way too ""HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥THIS GAME IS GOD"" so I'll list some cons as well.PROS AND CONS:Pros: +most characters feel balanced, and all have great skill ceilings.+most maps are great, and it's rare for me to say ""not this map again"" when playing+I have a bad computer, and the game runs well at low settings. You HD 50 gb ram PC master race people will love that.+game is constantly being updated with new heroes and skins, as well as bug fixes +daily challenges add an extra goal to gameplay and gold earning.+very high character customization. First you pick a hero, then perks, then blocks, then skins. Every hero can feel different with different setups+devs are actually listening to the community+large userbase, not too long of a wait when joining games.+all guns feel different and funCons:-now that the game is f2p, heroes aren't free. You have to pay gold, which is earned through playing games, to buy characters. This is ok, but the problem is that new players will always be the same characters.-A few characters need nerfs and buffs.-ranking system is completely broken. You get placed with noobs even at gold rank. They should fix this.-some maps are badly designed, in my opinion. Like ""Block"". ""Block"" is a multicolored map where being a skill character is necessary to win, really.-cubes can be damaged by stuff that isn't your tool (guns, explosives), but devs said they'd patch this. Will remove this once fixed.-lower ranked players are toxic, and immature.			"

Block N Load, is THE example of Steam games that are actually fun to play, have replay value, and (most importantly of all)  IS NOT PAY 2 WIN!The game is very well polished with great graphics and can prove to be one of STEAM's best Free To Play games.     As a new player diving in the game, I was instantly consumed by the fun mechanics and playstyle of it. If I had to compare Block N Load to another game, it would be kind of a mix between DOTA/LEAGUE with Team Fortress 2 characters, and the freedom of Minecraft all mixed into one.    The battle maps in this game are very diverse; there are multiple playstyles you have to incorperate into playing each map. By allowing contant map rotations, it is a very refreshing game that has lots of replay value.    The characters in this game are simply amazing. Each character has their own unique set of tools for the job. Each one is valued in its own way. I've found that playing with a team with everyone having completely different characters, are the games that win the most. CONS:- BALANCING    While there are many different types of characters to choose from, only a select few are currently viable. Engineers are almost essential to a win, while playing the Sniper class proves to extremely hard to win with. There are Cogswheels in almost every game because of how strong they are. I would love to see more balancing of characters in order to give more streamline gameplay.-- RANKING SYSTEM  Block N Load has a ranking system. However the problem with this system is that it is completely one-sided. A player can only progress forward in terms of rank, and never drop ranks. To put simply, the ranking that a player has simply reflects the amount of time they've put into the game; not actually their skill level. I would love to see a ranking system with both ups and downs in order to have more of a competitive environment.Overall Block N Load is am amazing game worthy to pick up and try. There are only minor issues, but I'm sure those will get sorted out with time. Have fun guys =]			"

												game is free now so.. YAY! :P also note that only queing 2 (3 now) people together is a temporary fix to veterans like me pup stomping with other veterans will be changed back relatively soon :)the game is great fun when you start out, and the more you play the more strategic depth you find.Now i have been streaming and playing this all through out beta too, and have had a chance to interact a lot with the devs, and 1 thing that really matter here there is that the devs CARE, they listen, talk and reason like i have never seen devs do for another game.So sure maybe something could be balanced a bit different maybe there is a bug here and there, but all in all the game is great fun, and the devs are working on it, and the interaction is AMAZING.

												Absolutely love this game!!!Its the perfect blend of affecting your environment with high-octane gameplay!If you love shooters from the veins of classic FPS alá Team Fortress and the endless creativity that games like Minecraft deliver, then this game is right up your alley!Currently there are 6 really balanced Heroes to choose from, each with pros and cons on the battlefield that makes Team Composition really important.The phase of battles are great, with a decent Build Time for you and your Team to construct the ultimate defense before the Build Barriers lift and then the 2 Teams can duke it out towards victory!But yeah this game is wicked, so check it ouuuuuuut!!!

I am a veteran of the game who participated in the alpha. This means I have a larger knowledge of the game and it's issues than most reviewers, but I possibly also have a more mild opinion on how serious an issue isSo what is Block'n'Load? It can be described as a combination of TF2 and Minecraft combat combined with parts from LoL.It can also be described as a rethought spiritual successor to AoS, and the first great creative shooter.Finally, it can also simply be put as possibly the most tactical FPS to date.The issues I have seen quite a few reviews by peoples who haven't really played the game, and I'm going to start by clearing up some of them:The controls are clunky As a part of implementing a building aspect, the controls are slightly different from a normal shooter and generally, the entire game has a somewhat steep learning curve because it is very different. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it took me about 5-10 matches to adapt to the controls, and both the official tutorials as well as the steam guides written by the community gives you a good insight into the game. Simply: It takes slightly longer to learn, which some free weekenders are crying about.It's too expensive! It should be F2P! No. First of all we did ask for them to lower the price in the beta:http://steamcommunity.com/app/299360/discussions/0/620703493333496110/And they did lower it:http://steamcommunity.com/app/299360/discussions/0/620712364037811307/They seemingly lowered the price of the game based on player feedback. Kudos to them! Now about the game being F2P? Just pay the price already. Here are a great thread about why it should not be F2P:http://steamcommunity.com/app/299360/discussions/0/620712364038776156/The argument for F2P is that we get more players. That is the only argument besides greed from players, which doesn't count. Also, amongst the extra players will be a lot of griefers, trolls and new players who haven't gotten into the game, which is indeed an issue as shown above. The free weekend showed this, and no current players want F2P because it straight out makes the community worse.JagexYeah, that is apparently an issue. You simply see players of previous titles, especially AoS, who come and simply haunt Jagex by disliking the game without giving it a shot. Have Jagex actually improved this time? The game is great, the CM's, map creators and developers play from time to time and they are great and fun peoples.So give them a chance, the game really deserves itIt is slowThat is another aspect of the building. For building to be of use, the characters move slightly slower than most shooters and all of them have a ton more hp than usual. Again, this both a pro and a con. It allows for a lot more tactics and strategy, and getting the jump on someone or a lucky shot does not mean an instakill. A headshot from the sniper class deals 60 damage, where most heroes have 100 hp. It also prolongs fights, which actually grants a lot more action at a time. Still, if you want more mindless twitchy shooters that have been around for ages, wait and then buy the new map pack and graphics overhaul of CoD when it comes.It is tacticalWhich means that you need to rely on teamwork, and can't have peoples fooling about. This makes you very reliant on random teammates, and like other games, this can cause frustration. Be aware that you will rarely be able to carry an entire team here, and that it is possibly best played with two or more friends.The introduction of ranked should largely separate the more hardcore players from the casual ones, but be warned that this is not a game that is casual. You have to focus and pay attention, and it is not something that you can relax while doing. Again, this is a pro and con, and it is up to you if it is for you or not. There has been speculation on a more casual and chaotic gamemode, but it will problary not come too soon.Your pretty base won't lastDespite being a creative minecraft-like shooter, do not expect to be building pretty castles. This is what AoS really were criticised for, making the building element very chaotic and not being able to create anything pretty because it was blown up in seconds. In a fashion, this is the same. You can be creative with your base, but in a cold-blood tactical way and not aesthetically. Even if it doesn't get blown up, the game usually doesn't last more than 1 hour, and then it is also gone for good.A map creator might be made though, so then you can create pretty things, save them, and then blow them up repeatedlyOnly one gamemodeThere is only one gamemode as of yet, and while it is a good gamemode it can get slightly monotone. They plan to introduce more gamemodes in the future, though.Doesn't run on a potatoWhile it isn't badly optimized, the requirements sort of resemble those for AAA titles. Why? Same reason you can't just set off 100 nukes in Minecraft, there are just a ton of block updates, and here you have a server running 10 players who are using explosives while also having something that needs to accurately calculate bullets and plenty of other things. Graphics are also noticeably better, which also bumps the requirements a bit.In short, if your computer is half a decade old, don't expect it to run well, even if it is a voxel shooter.  The strong sides""No game is the same""The creative aspects allow for an extreme amount of tactics. There are not only a couple camper spots on a map, you can poke a hole in a wall and shoot from there, so you have to constantly improvise and you will never be able to master the game. This is the aspect of the focus point ""No game is the same"", and while it might not be entirely true, it is more true than any other FPS.You don't really need to be a good shotFor a lot of the guns you don't need a super aim, and playing the game tactically is much more important. An example is from the reveal at Insomnia, where a team of LoL players beat a team of BF players. Community is good so farWhile there are a lot of rookies who wander a bit about trying things out atm because it is launch, the community is pretty good. Other than that there are several bands of veterans from the beta who team up in 5 man groups, and while playing with competent friends is fun, this can cause some very uneven games. But otherwise the game has seen few griefers, trolls and teamkillers.The core of the community gathers on the official livestream (Twitch.tv/blocknload or hitbox.tv/blocknload) and you should be able to find friendly players to play with and veterans who will give you advice there or on the forum.Balance is goodIt is always up in the air for discussion and there are several threads on the forums discussing it at all times, but the developers have been balancing things well so far, and while it will never be perfect, it is good so far.Graphics are good enoughI didn't like them at first either, but after a couple games? They are good enough. It's some mix of Minecraft pixels style and the TF2 cartoon style and it works well to both provide good performance while not looking horrible. Final Score So you want a number to use to compare it to other games? How about I just paint it out directly?The game is in my opinion the best shooter to date because of the building aspect, which is implemented so well and allows for so many tactics, a much more varied gameplay and that you constantly have to improvise.If you play FPS, Minecraft(or alike), Moba or RTS I would recommend you to try it. Otherwise not, because the game introduces you to a lot of unknowns, and its best to have some experience from either of those genres.			"

												A review after 233 hours! So read some reviews and most aren't complete enough to be fair. So here it is a honost review:1. It's a free game so you can't complain a lot about it.2. Its is fun. The quality of this game is high especially considering it is free.3. Unlike what most people say, it is not pay to win. I never payed a dime, got all the heroes. You will earn a lot of money, but you got to play to earn it. Some heroes are cheap some are more expensive.4. There is no best hero. It is more important how you play with you hero. This game is not a FPS where you goal is to kill as many players as you can. You need to be smart. Every hero has a weakness and a strentgh. It will take a few hours to find them. So once again, you just need to play. When a hero is to strong, the developers will make him weaker within weeks after release.5. Amount of players is a real problem. On average you need to wait 2min before every game. Not a huge problem, but you would think that given the quality and fun there aren't wait times. 6. Great support! We get new heroes and updates all the time! In terms of support it is the same as ARK, so just awesome. 7. I noticed that most players whom are complaining are actually the players who are just not that good. They fight hard but not smart. Like you will notice.8. Strong learning curve. The game is easy, but it will take some hours for beginners to understand it. After that, with every new hero you will need some hours to master his skills. This game does not only depends on skills but also tactics. 9 One huge problem is that people will during the match. The problem is, when a player leaves there is no side effect for the other team. Meaning they got a extra guy. Also people will leave when your on the loosing side, while a game can change within seconds.Conclusion: I think this is a must have game. It is fun, free and has great support. You would be stupid not to try it out. Is it perfect no... But how many EA games did you buy that last year that were unplayable, XD.			"

												Well, I've never written a full-blown Steam review for any game, ever. Even if it's really good or really bad, I don't normally have the motivation to do so. That changed when I started playing Block N Load.It's a spiritual successor to Ace of Spades, which was bought and remade by Jagex. Unfortunately, that alone would turn quite a few people away, because Ace of Spades didn't fare very well. However, almost all of the problems people had with Ace of Spades have been fixed up here.The game is relatively simple: You get to pick between six classes (more will be coming in the future), including an insane scientist, an evil robot, and a Mexican ninja. Games are two teams of 5 versus 5, where you have about six minutes to build defenses and traps to protect these large machines called cubes and your team's base, then when time's up, the game starts and you can raid your opponents.There are tons of different blocks that do different things. For example, my personal favorite is the fake block: It looks exactly like a connecting block, but when the opponent steps on it, it breaks away and he or she falls hopelessly into your trap, which could be bear traps, caltrops, sentry guns, poisoned dart-shooting tiki heads, or you could even make them fall off the map entirely. Another block is the Force Gate: You and your teammates can walk through it like there was nothing there, but your opponents cannot; they'll have to go around or destroy it. The variety of different blocks allow you to attempt to set up an impenetrable defense (although NOTHING is truly impenetrable!)The strategies required in this game are far deeper than you might expect. Just throwing bear traps everywhere won't cut it. You need to think about where your attackers might approach or where to place radars and respawn pads. Since nearly everything in this game can be destroyed (including all the blocks and items you can place), you have to hide them away where the enemy can't find them. In addition, occasionally a powerful weapon called the Blockbuster will be sent in, giving you shielding and increased cube/base damage for two minutes... unless your enemy gets it first! Because the Blockbuster is only given to the team that can get it first, it becomes a frantic race to the center of the arena to grab this powerful item.So, what are you waiting for, Blockhead? Come on and give it a go!By the way, a tip for new players: Although it seems like a good idea, do NOT cover the cubes/bases with blocks. Trust me on this. You'll just end up giving any attackers free cover.			"

I do recommend you to check out this games sub-reddit and the steam community, the community in this game is what makes it amazing.			"

												Wow. Block N Load. What can I say? It's a fun game, and if you like working together with teammates, you'll love this game! Pros  Completely free-to-play. Many fair-and-balanced heroes. Optional perks that buff an ability while debuffing another. Good, addictive gameplay. Most people don't really get salty. You don't need huge skill in FPS games to play it well. Bullets seem to be like projectiles, so that you won't get hit for no reason. Many tactics you can use. Balancing makes it so that there is no such thing as ""Pay-to-Win"" in this game. Everything you get from using real money you can also get from in-game currency. (Except for skins, which barely change anything.) The Ninja doesn't have generic indestructable Ninja abilities, so he's like an ACTUAL Ninja. You can play with your friends! Cons  There's always gonna be a small amount of people that are only there to be toxic and to grief. You can only have 3 friends in a squad when playing Casual. People tend to do what they want in Casual, rather than working as a team. Example: Three people go Nigel even though two people advise against it. The team loses because there is too many snipers. It's easy to fall for the same trap twice. Idlers. That one person that never accepts the queue. The End All in all, this game is really fun if people cooperate and everyone is at a similar skill level. In total, I'd rate this game 7/10, which is a really good rating. (that message was directed to kids who think 8/10 = ""not bad but not good either"")			"

												After 75 hours, I believe I can make an honest review on this game.Pros------* Free to play. Downloaded for free, played it, don't like it? Unistall. Not a dime spent.* You can build defenses for your base, alongside your team. And then the mayhem begins!*You gain exp and gold as you play matches and level up, which can be used to buy and upgrade perks, and heroes.* Daily missions = more gold*Perks have an upside, and a downside. So technically speaking, Default is best, but perks are an extra bit of help* Map editor allows you to create maps of your own, which you can publish and edit whenever you want.* Free Hero Rotations allow for learning who you like to play.*This game is very easy to learn, a few steam user guides and you'll be a pro.*As you level Heroes you will game skins for your blocks, as well as gold and some badges.Cons------*Long queue times. (I usually run from 2-4 minutes in the day, 4-6 minutes at night.[This can be lowered by checking the shorthanded games button])*Cosmetics for your characters can only be bought with platinum (pay to get currency). So most skins can't be bought for free.* only 1 or 2 devs work on this game. Updates are pretty slow. (I imagine if the game becomes popular, move devs may want to work on it)* A lot of Noobs vs. Pros games will happen on casual play* You need to play a lot for enough gold to get a higher tier Hero.Money--------Money will only NEED to be spent on skins, other items can be bought with gold. But, with that note, the highest price for any skin is around less than $6 (USD). And that is just for the high tier skins.------------Conclusion------------Great game, although it has flaws. But no game is perfect. If you have had any thoughts of playing it, go ahead, download it. It's free, so if you don't care for it, no money lost. Don't resist playing the game just because of negative reviews, try it out. I have fun with it.			"

												Hi! this is my review about this game, as you know.. :D (Sorry for my bad english)So I have played this game only 20.2 hours when I write this, but I think that I know everything that I need to know to write this review.I have played this and heres my pros and cons...Pros:-Fun and Awesome gameplay-Every character is unique, and that makes it intresting. You have from cutest hamster to creepyest clown!-With short and fun tutorial, you will know everything you need to know to start and rest you can explore yourself!-I can say that you cant get bored right away when you start your third match or  so....-You can blow up stuff if you want!-You cant say that this is just one stupid minecraft copy with guns... THIS IS MORE!-You will get evolved with your team, because you can tell your team how you want to play before match starts(Defend or Attack)-I haven't even listet everything that is awesome in this game :DMini-Cons:-From my opinion, this should have more content(Can be easily fixed)-World/Arena/""what ever you call it"" Editor is little bit hard to use, but it is useable and community have created awesome maps with it!Cons:-this is free game so everyone can play it... that means there is trollers and bullies, but no report button.... I have been bullied, but theres nothing I can do to it...OVERALL:This is such awesome game, and if you just have time.. GO PLAY IT! At least give it a shot! This is one of the best games I have played! :-)I would pay to play this game ;D (But I dont want to xP) "

												This game is very well designed, it brings a lot of new things to the table when it comes to first-person shooters, building, strategy, the problem is that the community is awful, if you like competitive gaming, responsive, mature team-mates that respond to threats, help you tactically, build the necessary blocks that are needed, etc, forget about it, you will not find this in this game, most of the times you'll be matched with 10 year-old kids with no developed motor-functions, and nearly autistic levels of lack of spatial awareness, you'll spend most of the game yelling, ""BUILD HEALTH BLOCKS, BUILD THIS, BUILD THAT"", while your teammates ignore you completely, and a formed squad of enemies destroy your team and you can do nothing but watch they win, doesn't matter how good you are, doesn't matter your K/D, you cannot carry the team by yourself. So this is this game in a nutshell, I believe they already mentioned the community being this awful somewhere in the reviews but I had to play the game to believe it, I'm just here to reinforce this and tell you guys why I have stopped playing this surprisingly good game.Another con? Matchmaking, it takes a loooong time, just a bad stupid design for a matchmaking system, instead of creating a room and filling it, they get 10 random people, if they click OK within 15 seconds a game is created, if someone fails to do that the whole match is disbanded and they try to create another random group of 10 players using the same stupid method.What else do you need to know, yes, they aren't updating the game very much, not that they need to, the game is actually very well polished, it has barely any bugs, the biggest problem in my view is the community indeed.

												Fun, plays a lot like a version of tf2 (with cut down movement but more balanced weapons) played on one of those chaotic minecraft pvp custom maps.Game runs fairly well, although I do get less frames than I would expect. if you have a 60hz monitor it will be fine but I struggle to maintain a solid 120fps.Most glaring issue is the lack of a ""toggle aim"" option, there's only hold to aim. So if you've ever played a PC game that let you scope in, that will probably feel pretty awkward.No options for crosshair customisation that I could see, but hasn't really been an issue so far. (although I’ve yet to play the sniper class where it may become more of an issue.)Overall a fun game and as player numbers continue to pick up I'd say it's defiantly worth your time.			"

												Pros:This is a very fun game. It makes you work with your team and the way you play is determined by the character you picked. Every character is well balanced. You get supplies by breaking blocks, the longer it takes to break the more supplies you get. Also I found the maps to be so fun and beautiful. Over all I really like this game it’s so much fun, but it’s not perfect.Cons:The flaws are that if you are new you may find it hard to go against those that have played longer. This could be that they are better, but most likely it’s because the games leveling up system is broken. If the person played longer than you did with a character, their character gets to wait less to reuse their ability “F key” than you along with other benefits. Also if you’re looking for a match and find one, but it’s already in progress three things could happen. 1.)	You join and see that the game barley started and have fun.2.)	You join and see that you are about to lose.3.)	 You don’t join and may get penalized from playing for some time.Yep, the game will penalize you for not joining a game which most likely is about to end. Also when the games over you have to leave back to the main menu in order to look for another match. So, this means if you had a close game and wish to have a rematch, will too bad you can’t.The game requires to be very tactical and work as a team. Also on average a game may last you 20-35 minutes so make sure you have time to play and have some fun. Bye bye.			"

												Please do not think of Ace of Spades, Minecraft, or Team Fortress coming in to this, treat it as it's own game, because it is. All gameplay elements are well balanced, and tie together incredibly well. In the context of pure gameplay, there is little you can say against it. It is the best game I've ever played, and that likely won't change for a long time, I'm certainly a candidate for being the #1 fan.Currently the biggest problem is the playerbase. It is quite low, and slowly diminishing. I'm sure the developers will be looking at ways to pick this back up. If you'd use a USA, or UK server, you shall be okay, but otherwise I'd suggest not purchasing the game. Queues may take a little longer than other games due to the low playerbase. However, if you're in a long queue, please do not leave, it creates a perpetuating issue that is only solved by players being patient.The game handles high ping as well as it can with client side hit detection, however it heavily affects other elements of the game. Anything above ~150 and you likely won't enjoy the game to it's full extent.The community has a whole is a pretty positive one. There will of course be those who aren't, but they are a minority. Please try to encourage this trend if you play. You can also find many discussions on the forum to openly speak about the game with other players.If you find yourself being beaten by experienced teams constantly, please do not give up the game. Instead, try and improve, or wait before queuing to try fight another team. It is a problem, but one that is not currently solved. Just try enjoy the game regardless.The game is essentially free of any game ruining bugs. There is quite a lot of bugs, however you will experience almost none of them during regular gameplay and they have little to no effect. These bugs will be fixed eventually. Do not consider this an issue.Cheaters/Hackers are not an issue. You'll see the occasional one, however they'll be banned, and the game is VAC enabled. Don't expect them to ruin your overall gameplay experience.The development team historically was quite responsive to players, however this has lately diminished, but this shouldn't deter you from the game. They also do regular live streams on Twtich and Hitbox.You should try out the demo that is available, it lasts forever, and gives you three characters to play. All characters are balanced, and the game is not pay to win in anyway. You can fully enjoy the demo, though I encourage you to purchase the game if you enjoy it.			"

												While the gameplay is interesting and fun, the game itself is plagued with spammers, griefers, and trolls who want nothing more than to ruin your experience. As far as I know, little is being done to ban players from matches, and there is currently no system in place to prevent chat-spamming, afk-ing, or team-killing. Until more moderation is placed in this game, I DO NOT recommend you purchase this game.Edit: Due to concerns from commenters, I would like to make it known that this game is fun, it is entertaining, it's full of fun, quirky, and interesting mechanics. Want a fun 'TF2'-esque shooter with a bit of a sandbox feel? This game is for you. HOWEVER, and this is my own personal opinion, until better community moderation is in place, I, as a random steam user, do not recommend it.			"

												Update: This review was before the made the game F2P.By the POWER OF GREYSKULL! This game is a blast! Found it through Yogcast and was cautious. Luckily I was able to snag a beta key before they switched to the pre-order model. I loved what I played so much I went ahead and kicked in the $20.A great mashup of CS:GO (or TF2 if you will), Minecraft and a old Source mod called Sourceforts (Oh yes, I went there).While I do think that the classes need a bit more balancing. It is amazing to see the almost weekly changes to maps, classes, weapons in an attempt to provide a great gameplay experience.I'm not a big fan of Jagex in general but this one is a gem!Pro tip: If you are queued solo and the opposing team is 5 ninjas... prepare to cry, as they will rip through any defenses you have set up in record time.

												The game is half good and half bad.Good: It's easy to learn, easy to play and there is no advantage on other teams apart from experience. I've played 400+ hours on this game so i know how to counter attack and defend. Small community which is good for a game as you get to know people and play along side with them.Bad: When you hit level 100+, Searching for a match takes 6+ minutes. i wanna play the game, not think about my life choices.... a few trolls who just purposely blow your base up, block traps and refuse to attack. Some of the high level people are salty as hell when they lose or can't get it in their way.Improve the game by: Less search waiting, bring back the old league system. A way to kick trolls or AFKs. A restricted ping amount of 200+.... hate it when people lag out and you gotta wait 5mins for them to either be removed or join back			"

												I've been playing this game since BETA and i absolutely love it. Great community and the developers have really been listening to their community. I bought the game even before i had played it and i don't regret doing so at all. This game is a brilliant mix of shooting and building. If you aren't good at FPS games then this game still has the building part which you might be good at and you can still be very good at the game. Overall an amazing game and certainly worth the amount of money you need to pay.			"

												Most of the negative reviews for this game are complaining about it being pay 2 win, being too expensive or just being made by the same guys as ace of spades (which we all know was a real badly executed game), when in actuality this game is in beta and is a free 2 play at the current time, so anyone who isnt happy with the current price can play free 2 play until the price drops far enough (Hopefully its one of those games that are in beta for like a year). You can pick up this game for free at the official block n load website, so price complaints shouldnt matter at the minute. This game, despite the fact that its blocked based and an FPS, its almost completely different. The game feels a lot like a moba, but it isnt, so dont let that statement turn you off. you must defend from 1 to 3 bases depending on the map, like tf2 control points except you cant camp back. You must destroy the all the enemies bases to win, and there is five minutes at the start to build your defences. This game allows for a lot of creativity and is pretty good when you get down to it. Jagex have learned from thier mistakes as they just recently made an update that fixed almost all problems i had through character balancing and bug fixes. This is a brilliant game, but sadly i also do not approve of the price for this title. Although this is a pre release with lots of bonus content, i think that if the price was maybe 40% cheaper, it would be a very fitting price and i would reccommend you buy this game.			"

												This game is one of the most addicting games i've played in 2015 ( Only game I launched since 2015 )But seriously, I am hooked on this game, 3 days owning it I put already 13 hours into it.The game is still in BETA, and it is amazing.Block N Load currently offers 5 maps and more coming soon:– Cube Cove– Teeny Tiny– Wilson Bay- Mountain Express- Heroes PlaygroundEach map offers a whole new experience, and requires diferent strategy.There also is 6 Classes currently avaliable:-O.P Juan Shinobi - Starring as Ninja ( Not based off of Obi wan kenobi )-Doc Eliza Doolally - Starring as Chemist-Cogwheel - Starring as Cogwheel-Nigel Purdey-Longshott - Starring as Sniper-Tony Turretto - Starring as Engineer-Sarge Stone - Starring as tankEach class offers a whole new play styleEach class can only rank up to level 10. You unlock a special skin when that character reaches level 10.Block N Load features addicting and fun game mechanics, but is easily exposed to trolls.Trolls can:- Team Kill- Spam- Destroy what you build- Destroy traps you placeAlthough its simple to troll, I have encountered 0 trolls in my 13 hours of play time.Most players are kind, willing to help and are just pure awesome.So what are you waiting for?

												I've been trying the game during a free weekend and definitely gonna buy it, it feels varied, fun and has competitive teamplay potential.The game encourages emergent strategies using destructible environments and building. Digging feels balanced, e.g. sneaky tunneling can be countered with radars, heavy defence with explosives and so on.Pacing is medium to fast - feels more dynamic than, e.g. TF2 for me. Maps are not big, you can quickly get to fights, build respawn pads and respawn is quite short. Individual contribution to winning can be big and satisfying.There's a room for mastering and skill - map control, shooting (headshots), movement (two-block-climb-jumping), deciding when to attack or defend. There is some depth and learning curve is gradual, you can start with just shooting and assaulting the front lines if building is too much for you from the start (tutorial shows just the very basics, unfortunately). The interface is intuitive and informative.Currently ranked matchmaking (is there matchmaking at all?) is not available yet so you get very randomly skilled and behaving people (I haven't noticed any serious griefing yet though (EU server)).

												Well i've been a little lazy to write an actual review, but here goes. As you can see I know pretty much everything about this game and have played it for a good portion of time. BlockNLoad is a 5v5 shoot em up style game where you try to destroy their objectives while defending your own. To do this you have a wide variety of 14 heroes all with different weapons, tools, and blocks at their disposal to use to win. Each hero has their perks and stats making them worth taking for the most part. This game is not just another dumb minecraft type shooter, believe me, it's anything but. This game has immense competitive potential and quality, and quite sadly should be alot more popular. If you want to try this game i highly suggest it, it is very addicting, and you can have loads of fun with it. Pros:-A massive progression system-14 wide variety heroes-Sexy graphics-Loads of awesome skins-Many different maps-Many different strategies-a in game map makerAnd a bunch of other stuff, just try the game.-Cons:-Only a couple developers -Some bugs that still arent fixed-Some current balance issues, ahem vander ahem.Basically just get it, it's f2p and it is very enjoyable. Have any questions? Join this Discord server here for the BlockNLoad NA and ask questions!: https://discord.gg/VEASeJR "

												Many games have the style of what Block N Load has, an FPS in a world you can build and destroy blocks... nearly all games that fit in this category fail miserably like Brick-Force.Block N Load however doesn't, it stands tall on its own and has a lot to offer! Let's see what the game has! Pros Lots of heros, they are separated in 3 classes. Brains who support the team and can do quite a bit of damage, while having limited movement and low health pools. Brawns who are the bigger guys who can take hits, build spawns, radars and mines, and ontop can do a lot of damage to enemies and bases. And Lastly are the skill pros who fit into small roles to help with the team, for an example Nigel the Sniper is a brillant partner to defend with, while Kira is a brillant option for attacking.There's a lot of  variation  between classes and all of them are unquie and memorable, plus if you don't like a certain hero, you can always try another! There are plenty of options to choose from!Some of my personal favourites are...Cogwheel the heavy hitting robot who can destory teams and bases with ease!Sarge Stone who is a basic tough guy who can do a lot of damage and in a short time!Nigel Longshot who is one of the most balanced Snipers ingaming and can set up lots of traps!And Kreepy the Klown who scares his enemies into submission with his gloves and banana bombs!Friendly  Forum  community, we are happy to help out new players who want to learn the game, by giving out advice and tips on how to do certain things, the only way you can anger/annoy us is by directly taunting people or making horrid balance suggestions, we welcome newcomers with open arms!Easy to earn Ingame currency called Gold, you get some for your first win of the day, doing the tutorial, winning and daily events, you can easily earn 1000+ gold a day by doing your challenges and winning! You can then spend gold on heros and leveling up perks, which give you small bonuses and downsides to help give a more unique play style, for an example on Vander, you can get faster build speed, with higher build costs so you can become more offensive, and while attacking, you don't really need to worry about build costs.Lots of blocks to build and destroy! Certain heros can carry certain blocks like Brain's Heal Stations and ammo, Brawn's radars and Spawn Points, and Skill's beartraps and fake blocks, all blocks are useful in their own way and none feel useless!Lots of maps, plus you can make your own! Block N Load pretty much has unlimited maps since the community can create their own if the Dev's take a break from making their own!This game  ISN'T Pay2win, while you can buy heros and XP boosters for real world money, it's not advised you buy heros with real money since you can get them with Gold quite easily, while boosters are more to show of your level and get block skins, yes you get a certain amount of gold at certain levels, you still gotta work for it.Really cheap prices for skins! Unlike other FPS's that charge you £5 for a small hat *Cough cough TF2 cough cough*, for £1.99 you can get 2 full character skins or 1 more expensive one! Pretty much every skin in the game is awesome and I love every single one of them! Cons As of patch 2.9 the Matchmaking has been messed up, myself and others have been matched with lower ranked players and have either have been on a massive loss streak due to horrid team balance and lack of skill from players, or a massive win streak for the same reasons, even now Jagex said they have fixed it, but even now I still get matched up with people  I SHOULDN'T  be matched with constantly and I often go on massive loss streaks. I've played against the best regularly during and after the BETA and up to now, why do I keep getting shoved with teammates I shouldn't get all the time?It's pretty much like this...


2.9 Matchmaking in a nutshell 
Community Created Artwork for Block N Load
By: вιgвangreχ

			It's so broken Jagex, please for the love of god fix it. I'm not joking when I say I lost 7 games in a row and rage quit from 2 games, with a total of 9 unfair and broken match ups.		


 HOWEVER  I haven't seen any brand new players been matched with older players, so chances are you will be fine.Queue times can take a while, but this is because of the rather small playerbase, it isn't the smallest in the world, but on average you gotta wait for about 5 mins for a game.Balance is ok, but it needs improvements, Sweet Science is the best attacker in the game thanks to his mobility, damage and insta kill lava pulls if you don't have an escape which most characters don't have, and characters like O.P Juan (the Ninja) aren’t as good due to his low destructive power, and having no blocks that benefit the team.Ranked is pure cancer, just flat avoid it, everygame I’ve been in it’s ALWAYS been Team idiots with one or two decent players VS Team no life Premade World Champion tryhards, it’s pretty much the Block N Load BETA/Pay Release all over again, just hope Ranked mode dies again like it did in the BETA.Most of the  Ingame  the ingame community are ret**d, seriously most matches I have (mostly due to poor matchmaking) I end up with either...Teammates destroying our own basePeople who insta lock O.P Juan (Ninja) or Nigel and just do nothing to helpEither lack of attackers or defenders (aka if I attack no one helps, or if I defend, everyone leaves me)People digging 5 miles undergroundPeople who ignore cries for helpAnd moreGrab some friends if you can before you play, again go on the forums to see if anyone wants to join you. (I don’t advice stacking as it is giving the game a negative look to newer players, and older players who are sick of seeing new player/tryhard stacks)The soundtrack could be better, it's lacking a lot and if you want to see my full thoughts, please go check my review for the soundtrack DLC.Overall Block N Load is a unique FPS and a lot of fun, I've played since the BETA and own every single skin in the game, yes even the rare Santa Tony.Do I like this game? No, I love it! Install it and have some fun!			"

												The game is pretty darn great, and for a better understanding of my completely complicated review I have never played Ace of Spades and will not let that affect my opinion of this standalone title.Pros:Lots of Building, fortify this fortify that, hide a radar here and there, maybe a few surprises along the way and your set to go.Alot of Action, some games like this focus on the building and forget about the combat solely. This combines both very well pitting opponents against each other to tank, or support in combat.Fun Strategies, as the trailer says go over, under, through, or whatever your imagination comes up with to assault your opponents.The character selection is nice in a sense each one is meant for a select play style, AoE, Sole player combat/tanking, or defense destruction and fortification of your own base.Cons:Watching your beautiful creations get unbuiltSome matches are decided based on team, with no current ranking system or points system in deciding the Queue do not expect a balanced team everytime. Think of it as a challenge for yourself to keep the team going in the least.Player base is questionable since I have had a few matches in which team members were player killing on purpose without penalty, some players will afk and the timer is far too long in removing them.All in all a great game.

												Many call this game the unholy marriage of minecraft and TF2, which is true mechanically speaking, but the game has a lot of charm all it's own too.Pros:-Easy to pick up the game-Runs on just about any pc-Queue times are reasonable and often quick-The mechanics of the game are fun and make every game experience unique because you have to think on your toes when defending or assaulting, following a ""meta"" would only serve to make you easy to predict and counter.-It's NOT free to play, which given the nature of this game, is a good thing.  Plus no unreasonably long grinding for class leveling.-The devs hold polls and take community input and seem to put a lot of effort into the gameplay and balance.-Cons:-Only 5v5 but later on 10v10 will be included-Variety in maps and characters and weapons are a bit lacking, but that's already planned to be improved later on-It's easy to get griefed in this game, but luckily the game isn't free to play so you see far less of that in this game compared to others.-The game needs a some what better anti cheat system.  You wont see hackers all the time, but they do rear their ugly heads.  Hacks I've seen so far are speed hacks and damage hacks, and no I they weren't using a block buster when I saw this happen.-Team reliance, I love team games, but if you have really bad team mates, you're probably in for a loss, make use of that surrender button if that happens.If I were to rate this game on a scale of 1-10, I'd give it an 8, it's a lot of fun for 20 dollars, I've been playing since the free weekend event for steam release and I already have 40 hours on the game writing this review.The game could use some work and more content, but luckily Jagex seems to be getting on that as they recently opened a poll to vote for what features the community wants them to take priority on, things like 10v10, map editors, more weapons and classes and blocks, etc etc.			"

												This game is one that's worth your money. You also get a FREE COPY of Ace of Spades!It's similar to AoS beta but feels more finished and it's still in beta ;) The graphics are pretty decent, even in very low. (Specifications changed and now it's hard for me to run it ;-;)The main game mode that exists for now is a sort of destroy the flag and it's pretty fun. There are a variety of classes and my favourite is the minigun guy. (Robot) Ace of Spades failed a bit with its building, but this game makes sure you spend some time to build and create defences for your base. I doubt Jagex will make the same mistakes again! Also, people say other team mates don't work properly and mess around horribly, well, you can report them and perhaps kick(?) them, like you could in AoS.I'm not too sad I bought it because I can still run it pretty well on VERY LOW, however, it'll be great with a decent computer and not a laptop. If you really don't want to spend $15, you can wait for the basic version to release which will be around the same price, so may as well get it now! After all, a FREE copy of AoS :PHowever, always report team killers and sentry destroyers of your team and there are now speed hackers. While the dev team is trying hard to get rid of them, the easiest way is to report them, getting them stuck onto a 2 hour loading queue with other hacking noobs.[EDIT: Sorry, the AoS copy was only for Beta purchases. For $10, it's a good TF2-like game. Great updates and new characters still coming out so far out of release.]			"

												Block and Load is honestly a great game. Besides the fact that it is free the gameplay and graphics are solid and charming respectively. It is a very easy to learn 5v5 team based objective game. Each team has to destroy the other teams cube while protecting  your own, which you prepare with blocks and traps. There are 3 heroes that rotate each week that are free, but it is fairly easy to get currency in order to buy other heroes. You can purchase them quicker with real money, but there really isn’t a need. The hero rotations are also good because you get to try out heroes before you buy them essentially. This game is fun alone, but more enjoyable with friends. It is definitely worth the download. "

												I'm really enjoying this game. Learnt the basics in only a couple of matches.It's basically a crossed between TF2 (class-based team shooter) and Minecraft (block digging and building). On the smaller maps the matches are 10-15 mins, bigger maps with multiple objectives can be 30 mins. While its straightforward to understand, you need to be able to think and adapt each match, because every time is totally different because of how you can dig and build anywhere, and have lots of different types of blocks to choose from when you setup your character.This is a shooter where you need to think and improvise!

												Man, I gotta tell you, this game rocks.  Literally fire up 3 hours ago and haven't stopped playing.  It reminds me of TF2 a bit accept you've got block building as well, which is totally awesome.  Fortify your base, then go crazy shooting up and destroying everything in sight.  I know I'm not going to get bored of this game because you can change your play style every time and the range of characters are really good and all very differet.  Very highly recommended!!			"

YouTube™ Video: Block N Load (Review) 

			Views: 3,449		

			Minecraft plus TF2... What could possibly go wrong? Follow me on Twitter- https://twitter.com/00Nightstalker Production Music courtesy of Epidemic Sound: http://www.epidemicsound.com		

If nothing else, Block N Load is an interesting concept. It’s an elegant genre blender of sorts which combines the sandbox building aspect of Minecraft with the team based first person shooting of Team Fortress 2. And while it has its setbacks, Block N Load is a clever Team based shooter which is sure to deliver at least of few hours of quality content. The premise here is simple, each team has its own generator cube, which they have to protect while attempting to destroy the other teams. However it gets a lot more interesting than it sounds. At the start of each match the teams get five minutes to fortify their half of the map and build defences. After that time is up, the big force field at the centre of the map goes down and all hell breaks loose as the two teams attempt to attack each others base. The best thing about Block N Load is that there is no one single definitive way to play, in fact this is a game which rewards creativity and where no two games are quite the same. This is where the Minecraft aspect comes in. The entire map is fully destructible, allowing the teams great freedom of approach. For instance I learned early on that a frontal assault is rarely the best option, as the short ten second respawn timer makes it hard to push the enemy team away with brute force. Therefore what soon became one of my favourite strategies is simply digging a tunnel across the map and to the enemy base, and then destroying it from underneath. The same ingenuity applies to the defensive aspect of Block N Load. This can be anything from digging trenches to building walls to creating some highly elaborate traps. For example in one game I managed to dig a giant ditch next to our base, and put bear traps at the bottom. Afterwards I filled the top up with dummy blocks, which would collapse underneath anyone who steps on them, sending them falling to their death. And there really is a great sense of satisfaction that comes from building a defensive structure or trap, and then seeing your plan work out, as the enemy falls for the trick. The base building aspect is certainly Block N Loads strongest quality, as it embraces creativity and rewards clever tactical decisions. That said, I would like to have seen more different blocks and materials in the game. There is a nice selection on offer here, with some blocks being specific to certain classes, but it would be quite nice to see a little more, as when selecting the materials I wanted to take into battle with me, there wasn’t really that much I had to leave out. It would be a lot more interesting if more blocks and material types were provided, as that would give the player much room for experimentation, therefore meaning a greater sense of replayability in the long run. Speaking of classes, there are six of them, and they each have their own unique weapons, abilities and materials. Jagex did a great job here in differentiating all the characters, and making all of them feel useful in their own right. For instance the medic, which is very much a support character, can heal friendly players and provide them with ammunition, while the big robot class can put down extra respawn points, something which can prove game changing if placed in the right location. There is a lot of emphasis on teamwork here, and a team which is working together is obviously more likely to end up victorious. That said, due to the small team sizes, five on each side, individual contributions can and do make a huge difference to the games outcome, making each player feel a lot more important in their own right. This does however carry a certain problem. Due to the importance of each player in the team, if one player leaves in the middle of the game, the enemy team will automatically have a huge advantage. And this does happen far more than I would like it to, partly due to the fact that block and loads matches are certainly not short, and can easily drag on for 30 minutes or more. As a result I feel that there should have been a system similar to Counter Strike Global Offensive, whereas players can punished for leaving mid way through a game. All Block N Load currently does is politely ask you to finish the game for the benefit of your team, but frankly that is not enough, and I would prefer model where you will be temporarily barred from playing if you abandon your team. Block N Load is at its best when both teams are utilising all the tools at their disposal, and when everyone is using their brains to outsmart the enemy team, the game can prove to be extremely fascinating to play. Newtons third law applies fairly nicely here. ""For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction”, and a good player is not only one which can employ good tactics on his own, but that can also predict the movements of the enemy team, and take appropriate measures to counter them. The actual first person shooting is however mediocre at best. It is helped by the fact that all classes have different weapons and abilities, however I would have liked to see more on the side weapon variety here. Each character has their own unique primary and secondary weapon, however that is it. What I would have like to see is maybe an extra few class specific weapons to be unlocked later on, something which would increase both the gameplay diversity when in combat, and the general sense of replayability. But Block N Load is indeed at its best when its played more like Minecraft and less like Call of Duty. I already mentioned that a frontal assault is perhaps one of the worst and least successful strategies to employ, and thats not helped by the mediocre FPS mechanics on offer here. Instead its the sandbox base building that carries that game, and provides it will a good sense of replayability, as no two games are really ever the same. One of the most fascinating parts of Block N Load is simply looking at the strategies which other players have come up with, and then replicating them at a later date. When going into the enemy base, I was always curious as to what sort of defences they managed to build in those first five minutes, which could be anything from turrets to minefields to elaborate networks of trenches. The replay value is also propped up by the different maps, of which there are currently five. The sandbox nature of the game means that each map comes with totally different strategies, both defensive and offensive. They all offer different possible routes, both above and under ground, rewarding those that are able to think outside the box. Despite its silly tone, Block N Load, is a clever team based shooter which rewards player creativity. It strikes a fine balance between uncontrolled sandbox chaos, and genuinely satisfying team based action. You can currently pick it up on Steam for 15 dollars or 11 pounds, and to be honest I think thats a reasonable price to ask for what you are getting, as at the very least Block N Load will provide you will a few hours of chaotic entertainment, while at best you might fall in love with its open ended sandbox nature. As a final verdict I would recommend Block N Load to FPS fans wanting something a little bit different.			"

												So this Will be my 2nd review for this game. In my first review I had 244 hours total. Now I have 1,115 hours. Hopefully that shows how fun this game can be. But there are a ton of things both right and wrong with Block N Load. First of all The game has a horrible tutorial so don't even bother with it. The playerbase is usually helpful to new players but when players with over 1K hours keep getting games with new players they can become quite hostile. There are 4 regions to play on Oceania,Asia,Europe,and North America. The game has a bundle of fun mechanics and skins and perks and great voice lines and visuals. Now as before where I was very new to the game a lot of my attitude has changed but most still reamins the same. The game has potential. There are a lot of problems. But in my opinion the Fun Filled moments are worth most of the hard times. I've had more fun than ever possible playing this. I've also had the most frustrating times of my life in this. But i've also made friends that I absolutely Adore and Love to play with every day. I just hope you take a positive mind and treat each game as a learning experience.			"

												5 Reasons Block N Load is Amazing and CreativeBlock N Load is the game that I’ve been craving. It’s incredibly addicting, fun, and easy to jump into and blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up. I’m just going to jump right into it to convince you to splurge 15 dollars on this great game. Normally not a fan of Jagex (never liked Runescape or played any other games), you can assure I’m not biased. I’m basing this list solely on what I’ve enjoyed through playing the game.1. Superb Matchmaking Finding games in Block N Load is quick! I often found myself getting put into instant-queues that were great when I didn’t feel like waiting or alt-tabbing for an extended length of time (I’m looking at you DOTA!). For a game with a relatively (hopefully growing) player base, this is very exciting.Perhaps my favorite thing about the matchmaking is that you can choose to queue into games where players have rage quit abandoned their teammates in the middle of a battle. It works great for both parties–for those who need team mates and for those who want to get into a match remarkably quickly.In these situations, you get a chance to become a hero to your team mates and freshen up a stale game. You very well might be the tide to turn the battle around! In fact, I noticed that happening in certain situations. We would be steam rolling the enemy, and a new player would show up with a unique perspective (and class) and make things interesting for both teams!2. Sweet Class Balance and Diversity When I was first playing the game, I often found myself wanting to be other classes or have other blocks–while I was playing my own. If I lost, I had a feeling. “If I just would have had this tool, then we could have won.” But then as I played the game more I began to get a deeper understanding of the blocks you can choose in the game and each of the classes strengths and weaknesses.Each one of the classes is restricted to individual blocks that they can build. I think this is a great ruleset in that it forces players to diversify their played classes and playstyles to a particular class. For example, while the ninja class doesn’t appeal to me–it’s fancy fake blocks, and snares do. Each class has something cool about it, and very strong as well. Because of that, it keeps things very fresh when switching from class to class.Each role also feels well pitted up against other classes. Sometimes matchups (like sniper versus ninja) tend to feel a bit “rock-paper-scissors”, but a big and compelling part of the strategy in the game is knowing where to position yourself on the map against your opponents. You’ll often finder snipers obsessing over towers, ninjas digging tunnels endlessly, and engineers protecting giant caverns with their turrets. In this game, everyone becomes their role, which is surprising and sometimes hilarious. I had a sniper insisting we leave an island solely for him (even if mining the island would give a universal 1000+ resources to the entire team!). Oh yeah, did I mention that the physics in this game let you mine huge chunks of a block mass by cutting out the base and letting gravity take things down? You also get the resources too!The “Rambo” guy as I like to call him is the jack of all trades (and my favorite) as you can build him either offensively, defensively or both. The engineer specializes in amazingly high defensive maneuvers. The sniper and ninja class both act as pure damage classes with specializations in short and long range, with tricky traps in both arsenals. I  wanted to give you some examples of the differences between classes, but I don’t want to give an in-depth analysis of every class because part of the fun is exploring them yourself!3. Clear but Fair ObjectivesOne of Block N Load’s greatest strengths is both how it takes from MOBA games and how it changes concrete MOBA dynamics. This time there is three towers, and you can’t skip towers–instead you have to kill them in sequential order (similar to other MOBA games). The three tower system (sometimes different on the maps) create significant momentum in games and provides different routes and playstyles. Did your first defense fail? Perhaps try a different approach for your protection of the 2nd node.Another strong element in the game is the focus on teamwork and strategy. In a lot of MOBA games, one player often snowballs. However, while Block N Load doesn’t necessarily punish players who do well, players never reach that sense of frustrating godliness that they do in other MOBAs. If the team bands together to take out a particularly strong set of turrets, that player who built the turrets will have to start over. There aren’t items, or levels, just blocks, and lots and lots of explosions.You’d think this would make the end game boring, but the game works through a resource gathering system that encourages constant growth. The more blocks you destroy in the map, the more formations/traps/buildings you can build. There’s no ceiling for your ambition (which is another thing MOBA games lack–only six items at a cap, or a maximum level).The game match length and momentum feels fantastic. The longer games feel tense in the end, and if a team coordinates well–sometimes incredible comebacks can happen.4. Good Community Game I’ve met a lot of cool people playing Block N Load. The game demands communication. Thankfully there’s great voice support in the game to encourage great teamwork (for some reason it doesn’t tell you who is talking or that you are, but this is easily remedied by asking the player or making sure others can hear you!).Like I said before, people can’t ever leave a game in a sense–since they are always replaced by someone else. I’ve found this is a massive increase in team morale and the people I’ve seen trash talking (only a few I can remember) usually leave and are replaced with a more competent teammate.Why can’t other games do this? Well… Remember how I said classes can’t snowball and there isn’t any items? So when someone joins a match fresh, they are on the same level as everyone else (of course without all of the setup blocks and level knowledge). No one wants to join a League of Legends game feeding from the start.5. Weapons and Mechanics Shooting in Block N Load is great. It feels a bit arcadey but more realistic than say TF2. Sometimes the guns don’t feel powerful enough, but enemies have health bars and numbers come out which makes it very easy to tell the damage you are doing and how effective you are at doing it.Sniping people isn’t so much about one shot one kills, but more about taking bonus headshot damage. The shooting feels a bit similar to Borderlands 2. All of the weapons also have great hitboxes and range, and it’s incredibly satisfying to shoot at someone hiding behind blocks and do damage to them (I love the rocket launcher).  Well, that’s my top 5 reasons to play Block N Load. I just recently picked up this game on steam and have already clocked an impressive amount of play time. It has great addicting gameplay that borrows from objective and team style MOBA games but also combines the creativity inherent in games like Minecraft.

												Edited for launchAfter playing the last few Beta weekends, I have to say... they Nailed it!  I am updating my score to:10/10Come on guys!  Let's go play!=====I am so impresed with this game!  9/10Okay before I bang on about the aweomenes here's why:1.  I love having a building element in the game.  Initally I thought the whole 5 mins of building time  was going to be so damn boring and I'd be reading a book or something while waiting for the match to start so I could shoot people in the face.  In  reality I am begging for more time!  I do defualt to playing the Engineer (Tony) becaue I like the building so much and his turrets just make me happy2.  It's not crazy hard to pick up a new character.  Too many game make it impossible to use another role because the knowledge ramp to get into it is too massive.  Here I found that I could be adequate with just about any role (ninja did take me slightly longer to get good at) without needing a month of practice.3.  I usually don't like voxel based games because it just seems like an excuse to be lame on the art in many case.  NOT HERE.  It's really quite beautiful and there are tons of funny details that make me chuckle along the way.  Not to mention the most important thing is the characters and they are epic.  I am loving the skins.I like this blend of building and shooting... it reminds me of chess-boxing  brains can beat brawn!!			"

												Good game. I am currently in the Beta and I have mostly good things to say about this game. This review is about the Beta and not the finished product.Pros:- Enjoyable classes with distinct characteristics that make it extremely easy for people to find an individual playstyle.- 98% Fully destructable enviroment (Metal Blocks that are part of the map borders can't be destroyed)- Fast paced action- Simplistic building system that can lead to some pretty elaborate defenses- Great Graphics- Decent leveling systemCons:- 3 maps (May be different in full game)- Gunplay is hard to get into at first (for me at least)- Building defense is sometimes boring.- Games usually end when the enemy team uses one of several tried and trusted strategies.

												I've never written a review before but this game has compelled me to. It won't be everyone's cup of tea, but I strongly reccomend trying it. I have played for free since it was released recently and i must say that I've laughed out lound more than once. At first the game seems innocent, childlike, a minecraft-ish experience.. But that is far from the truth. as soon as you're taught to get out your LMG you realize that this is a violent game. It's the funniest thing i've seen in a long time, has the best effects sounds especially for the guns, and the shooting is tight and VERY responsive. I've now purchased it, I reccomend you do the same, unless you don't have a sense of humor. If that's the case then you'll hate it.			"

												TL;DR:  Unless you have a team of friends to play this with, stay away from the game. The community is a cesspool.Really crappy community of players in this game.  The matchmaking system doesn't pair you with people your skill level. Brand new players will continually get slaughtered against seemingly higher level/more experienced players.Which is a shame, because the game itself is awesome.  Lots of strategy is involved with building defenses. A strong resemblence to TF2 is there with gunplay and classes.  It's a great game.  But the community and matchmaking system make you pull your hair out.  And the people that play generally want to do their own thing, rather than be a team.

												While the game is fun, I don't recommend buying it, and this quote is why:""The game will be priced at $20... initially. Horton admits straight away that the game is likely to go free-to-play if it gets traction with players, a decision that Jagex left up to his team rather than the accountants.""Source: http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2014-11-20-jagexs-wild-childIn other words, it'll become free to play if it gets popular. In other way you'll be wasting $20 no matter what. The pay and then pay more model is very similar to what Jagex did with ""Ace of Spades"", a game they also sold for $20 and then also added a free-to-play model where you are required to pay for skins and other items. Think of it like League of Legends, where you have to pay $20 upfront.			"

Characters may seem unbalanced at first but after a good few hours of play you will see they are all matched almost perfectly. 10/10! Buy it now!			"

												This game was a lot of fun to play. That said, I only ever got to play 3.. maybe 4 games during that brief popular period in May. Every other attempt to play this game has led to a huge amount of bitter disappointment, as I never found another game. Until the game incorporates some sort of AI vs mode, there'd be no way for players to find a game when they feel like playing it. My '2 hours played' comes from waiting in queues for ten minutes at random intervals, until giving up on the idea and closing the game. I've applied for a Steam refund, but since i've left it a little too long, I don't like my chances...I do not recommend buying this unless you have a large group of friends to queue with. (enough to fill both teams should suffice).			"

The game just fell apart for me and it was kinda sad because I actually really liked this game :|EDIT:I swear the hope for this game to become good again is the chance of me getting a job (Pretty slim), face it, community is just intoxicated now...

You can make underground tranches to attack the enemy base in stealth or many other tactics. You can bobytrap parts of battle feild. Or just create a big fotress to keep ememys out.

												I loved this game, i allways played it, it was a huge fun, until the f2p...Before i start, i just want to let you know that i'm saying Block N load isn't bad, you can play the game if you want, it's not bad, but it's only a dissapointment for me, so i'm only sharing my opinion.Good things about this update:1: They didn't made it pay to win.2: There is more content.Bad things:1: If you bought the game before the f2p, the only good thing you get is a skin...2: There are WAAYY too many trollers and unskilled players now.3: Only one friend can join my queue, Seriously?!4: ALL YOUR STATS AND LEVELS ARE BACK TO THE BEGINNING.5: The interface/menu is impossible to understand.6: The gold and platinum...seriously?7: The HUUUGEEE unbalance of the new characters.8: Why? Before the f2p jagex listened to the community, now they barely even look at the community's opinions.You see, this game was perfect, but they made it free to play just because there wasn't enough people on this game, and by doing that huge mistake, the majority of the people that were before the f2p just quit.I knew the game could become f2p at any time because of a post of the developers, but i hoped they wouldn't do that mistake and let the game like it was.The thing that i liked about this game the most, was the community, it was small, and helpful, that's what i loved about it.Now the community is huge, unhelpful and worse in general.After all, it's actually a good f2p game for new people, but only for new people...not for the majority of people that were there before this update.

												Some people say it copied Minecraft and/or Team Fortress 2. The correct term is ""ispiration for something original"".Block N Load combines a full class-based team FPS experience with a blocky 5v5 MOBA game, where you can build and reinforce your base AND destroy the enemy's. Each class has its own perks, and each one of them brings their own weapons and special blocks to help their team. All roles can be fulfilled by anyone, but some are better than others at certain tasks. All classes are balanced and competitive. Heck, you can duel as any class with an opponent and you'll always have a hope to win! There are no instakills in this game, if you want to bring down your opponent you gotta earn it like a pro.Work as a Team! Only teamwork will lead you to victory!Use your preparation time wisely! Build a base, earn resources by destroying blocks and demolishing entire structures with gratuitous laws of gravity! You'll need a lot of resources to build and reinforce, especially the Defensive classes.Attack the enemy from the sides, the underground and the sky. Dig trenches and secret passages. Demolish the enemy's base with bombs and artillery barrages to help your digging tools. Place special structures behind them to allow respawning directly in their base and spying their movements... or build an entire base in their base, complete with turrets and mines, to make their lives hell! Hard as hell, but worth it!Defend your base with mines, radars, turrets and lethal traps. No enemy must infiltrate your base unseen. Invaders must die!Camping in an isolated corner won't get anything accomplished. Your kill count doesn't count. What matters is that you either defend your base OR attack the enemy base.Balance means victory! Avoid using classes of which your team already has 1 or 2. Only certain classes can place certain blocks.So what are you waiting for? Block in and give those Blockheads what's coming to 'em! Block Block Block! Block'a'Block'a'Block!			"

They insist in shoving new heroes down our throats, rather than sorting major balance issues experienced along all levels of play (Competitive or even noob queue).Its not that it is pay to win, but the developers powercreep the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of new heroes just to increse sales. PTR/PTS are available, and even if you are ranked 2 globally, they insist on making bad decisions. For example, they thought creating a large RNG factor on something that is realistically an auto-win condition would be intelligent. Who needs balance?

A mix of the ever popular Team Fortress and the 3D Minecraft, this game is a new evolutionary step in online gaming, where you are no longer constrained by walls or maps, or the simple imaginations of the original graphic designers.  The game is new, and I love it, and I suggest it to anyone out there looking for a new fun distration to the absurdity we call life.  However, the game is still new, and is a little rough around the edges, as well as still requiring some technical tweaking.

Great if you can get a couple of mates to play together so your on the same page, but if you cant then just have a blast with anyone. I can see so much potenial for future champs, and maps, and who knows what else they'll add-in. Nicely balanced too, and being able to choose not only your champ but their skills is a great added dimension. Would recommend anyone to give it a try!			"

												I started playing Block N Load during its free weekend and have been entranced with it ever since. After having played it for some time I even spent money on the Skins for the Win DLC pack due to my thus unyielding enjoyment of this game. I find it to be generously priced for it's content and quality.I think of particular note is the free demo; it acts akin to the full version of the game minus ranked mode and with only one hero of each archetype available which lets you get a good feel for the game before putting down money.

 My thoughts: Block N Load Well, here we are. I don't make many reviews, and I'm strict with my ratings. I'll be giving you my Pros and Cons, but here's what I think just in a small paragraph. I was skimming through the negative reviews, and I noticed a few saying things along the lines of ""A rip off of minecraft"". So, what I'm hearing here, is that any game with BLOCKS is minecraft? Hm. So, Terraria is a rip-off of minecraft? Think about this one. Also, a rip-off means they're charging more money for people to enjoy the game. Yes, there are purchases avalibile, but the game is F2P, while Minecraft P2P. Now, let's get into the Pros and Cons. Pros! 1. It's free! No money needed. It's not like TF2, which is mostly P2P.2. Good quality, runs well on a low-end PC.3. A range of classes to choose from, as well as 3 amazing started classes.4. Not too complicated and doesn't require skill, which is the total opposite of TF2.5. Enough maps for my liking.6. Endless possibilites for defence (I built a castle out of bricks. Just cosmetic) Cons... 1. Not sure if it's just my headset, but my mic doesn't work on it.2. Could use some more weapons.3. Tiny chatbox.			"

ClassesBlock N Load offers a nice variety of classes with more being constantly added, this allows for pretty much non-stop fun. Once you've learnt a class you begin to feel like a master with them, knowing how and when to use your guns/abilities. Each class has their own blocks and special block to use, these give them an edge in battle whether it be defensive, offensive or supportive. Each class (some more than others) takes time to master, I really enjoy this side of gameplay due to it's rewarding nature of bonuses at level ups and new skins (as well as being able to destroy your opponents). Matches and MapsThere is a happy pool of maps to play on and you are given a choice between 2 when you join a lobby. Each map is unique and takes time to learn. As said for the classes, new maps are also being added. A slight negative is the regional servers; with the EU server I have been experiencing lag and not even being able to get into games, because of this I've had to play on NA servers despite the high ping. GameplayOverall it is very smooth, the movement is simple and enjoyable because of the rate at which you scale the maps, when learning this can be annoying at times (sprinting and jumping at someone and then flying over the edge of the map) but you'll soon pick it up. The gun play is great, each unique with different ranges and block damage. This leads me onto the building/destroying side of things; the fact I would enjoy this game if the maps weren't interactable has to say something (a good something) about the gameplay, but being able to do this adds an unimaginable amount of creativity.SummaryTo conclude; Block N Load has been a breath of fresh air for me in the FPS genre, it's large range of potential for future competitive play and continous updates makes me really want to stick around and see how everything turns out. My final opinion on whether you should buy this game is: Yes, and if you used to play Minecraft and TF2: Hell yeah.Negative reviews...Please take into account when reading the negative reviews the hours of game time and when they were posted. In most cases the player has very little time played or the review was made when the game was in beta. To be frank, I believe this game deserves at least a ""very positive"" review status.			"

												Fantastic game. Just fantastic. Loads of fun wrapped in this very simple formulae. This game gives me huge nostalgia waaaay back when I used to play Medal of Honor: Allied Assault on custom Builder Servers that allow you to build before you play.This game has the combat feel more of arena shooters due to it's fast movement and longer time to kill. I love it for it. It's like minecraft Only in the sense that there's voxel blocks to build with. You still need to know how to shoot like other FPS's to do well.There's immense strategy you can pull of in this game, from defending to attacking to organizing your team in just the right fashion. Similar to Moba's, it's 5v5 and your team is key to winning.The beta itself has very few bugs and is basically almost ready to release. Balance is pretty damn good as well, which will likely be an ever-evolving process.9/10 - Buy it.			"

												Nice and simple. Maps - 9/10 I would like to see bigger maps and more spread out. Classes- 7/10 Some of the classes ( the ninja and Tony are pretty much broken) as the ninja your sword hits very hard, with a shrine down you can teleport to the other teams base as soon as you spawn, kind of op. Tony's turrets make above ground assaults on the other teams base impossible. I played a game where he placed 5 turrets down and it made anything above ground impossible. So those two classes seem a little more op than the rest. But with that being said every class is still fun to play!Overall enjoyment of the game- 10/10 Hoping for some changes in the future but still a fun game!			"

												My first reaction: Oh look, some crappy wannabe Minecraft/Team Fortress game.This will probably take two minutes to learn how to play, and five to reach top score in every server.IWASWRONG.This game is MUCH. MUCH more challenging than it looks. The weapons are fierce and explosives can be unforgiving. Not only that, The blocks you can make are astounding.One that I enjoyed the most was the radar.You can literally place a radar to see EVERYONE. It felt amazing being able to sneak behind a base and place a radar.Not only that, but this game is very tactical.The last game I played probably went on for twenty minutes, and I'm sure games can go to an hour if both teams are skilled.There are traps. Support characters. Attack Charaters. Defense Characters.Honestly, this game is much better than people let on.9/10			"

												Just as a FYI, I got this game on the 5th of May, 2015 and I've played 395 hours.This game caught my eye when it was still pay to play and in the beginning I enjoyed playing it quite a lot.The tutorials are great, although I think they should actually be somehow enforced to avoid completely unaware players of diving into PvP without any knowledge of the game's or heroes's mechanics.The maps were plenty and new ones were being introduced with updates. They were symmetrical so there were no balance issues.The ORIGINAL heroes are well thought of and relatively well balanced. The ninja was only OP if the enemy team doesn't actually play as a team, which happens very often.The graphics have that cartoonish look which to be honest I don't mind that much, not every game needs to have outstanding textures and special effects to be good and I think this one did that.The control and movement does need some work, sometimes it feels like you're playing on ice and it often ends in you falling, sometimes into lava.But then the bigger problems started appearing...The player base was small, which was expected since the game had not been released for too long, and as a consequence joining a game sometimes took longer than 45 minutes.Barely anyone talked during a game and there was rarely any sort of communication as a team.The matchmaking algorithm is absolute trash, placing someone who just finished the tutorial against players with level 60.Only one region for all of Europe, which generated huge amounts of lag and made many players go crazy because of shots not being registered, being disconnected, not being able to move, etc etc. You obviously can't expect someone from Amsterdam and someone from Portugal to be playing and everything going smoothly, it just won't happen.New heroes started being introduced, and although I welcome new content with open arms for a game that I've paid money to purchase, I HOWEVER do not welcome new content that allows players to exploit lame tactics with new heroes or new content that allows players to be overpowered because they paid to be able to use an overpowered hero (two major issues here, one is allowing the game to be exploited by the use of lame tactics, the other is P2W).Cheaters (not many) ingame. Imagine a Cogwheel shooting his minigun and only doing headshots... Yeah, not much fun to play against that one.And then ranked was introduced...And it was actually introduced correctly, there was a queue for normal games and there was a queue for rankeds, which is great!Players just looking for a relaxed and fun game can just go for normals and players looking for a more competitive edge can go for rankeds.BUT, they screwed it up. They made it all into a single queue. There is no more normals queue and no more rankeds queue. Now you just press Play and the ranking system is forced upon you.And with a ranking system forced upon you, you can either be playing with someone who's just there for the hell of it or you can be playing with someone who's actually there to play as a teammate.Now, if you're into normals, you're fine, you'll just play your game and you'll enjoy yourself.But if you're into competitive, well, you're not going to enjoy it very much when that guy that just joined for a normal does absolutely nothing the entire game to help the team but instead spends his time building a tunnel under your own base.Matchmaking remained trashy, placing 1 or more players in the top100 against people with Gold 3.Even more new heroes came out, and again, more P2W heroes that were overpowered.And now they've gone one step further (and in my opinion, downhill) and made the game free to play.Probably hoping that this will expand the player base considerably.Not only have they completely disregarded the many people that have paid for this game and just told them ""Thanks for your money but now that we already have what we want, screw you"" but they've opened the gates to every player with a half decent PC.While I find it great that the queue has diminished, I absolutely hate the fact that now anyone can just install, cheat and even if banned, just install again and cheat again.And obviously the amount of normal players will increase dramatically since it's another game you can just have for free in your library and play whenever you want.This was the final drop and what made me stop playing the game, and I consider it unplayable at this point unless you're just going for normal.It has clearly changed a lot from what I purchased and Jagex have ruined it.EDIT: Typo removal			"

												What is Block N Load? First of Let me say that this is far from an Ace Of Spades rip of or fancy reskin. Anyone who plays for a decent amount of time will be able to confirm that. Block N load is all about team work, and preperation, But it also features fast paced combat requireng strategy and planing inorder to achive victory over your opponents. The team that wins will be the team that works together, plans together and  adapts to the enemys movements. Block N Load is unique in that before combat begins, both teams get time to build defences to protect there objective. Building walls, radars, traps, turrets and the like can all help defend your precious base. Working togetehr is key to build an epic defence that will have your enemies stuck at the front door. Failure to build an effective defence will alow your foes to walk all over you. By doing this the game forces you to think carefully and be a bit creative in how you plan your defence. Its up to you to find a way to defend it as long as posible to give your team more time to attack. Once the batle begins things heat up quickly. Battles can be fast paced and frantic and require quick thinking inorder to out wit your opponetns. Getting the high ground and working as a team to flank enemies is highly effective and landing a killing blow feels awesome and satisfying. Attacking the opponents base can offten be tricky and some times rather challenging. Especialy if its well fortified, yet there is a huge sense of Acheivment when you are able to open it up and watch it come crashing down. Blowing up a defensive line with a well placed bomb or mortar fells great and satisfying. I even caught myself shouting ""KABOOOM!"" (Ive been plaing lots of Demoman on TF2 latley, sue me) once when a well placed bomb of mine took out there wall along with 2 of there turrets and health and ammo staions, allowing my team to charge in and take out the remaing defences before going for the objective. Winning a match feels SO good and the satisfying sound of the enemy base exploding just puts the cherry on top. There are several diffrent characters to try and all of them have strengths and weaknesses. A good team will have a mix that alows for both good defence and offence. A team that neglects one or the other can still win, but chances are they may strugle if they do not plan out their strategy well. Each character feels useful and unique and each plays in very diffrent ways. This alows for players to experiment and find characters and strategies that match there preferd play style or to branch out and try new and diffrent tactics that they would normaly avoid otherwise. At the moment there are 6 playable characters but there are more on the way and hopefully this will lead to new and exciting ways to play.While I have done nothing but praise the game so far there are a few issues that have disapointed me duing my 100+ hours of gameplay. The controls do feel a ♥♥♥♥♥ chunky at times and the jump mechanics do take a fair bit of getting used to, especialy if your used to playing games like TF2. Do not be suprised if you find yourself acidently jumping off a leadge to your death. There are also a few anoying bugs that still remain unfixed despite the game being out of beta, thankfully none of them truly ruin the game and they sould hopefully be on their way out soon.It should also be mentioned that new players will most liekly strugle at first as they try and learn what works and what dose not work, when it come to attacking and defending.Overall this is a really fun game that alows for good team based combat and strategy. Players who like to rely on there brains as much as there skill will probably have a lot of fun at this. Just be sure to give the game a chance and you will most likely enjoy it. I Highly recomend you give this game a shot. Its fun, its clever, its well balanced, its action packed, and its highly enjoyable. Get in there and have some fun. (What the Block you gona do?)			"

												This game isn't bad, it just could be much better. There's too much going on at once, that it can often feel hard just to focus on the player three bricks ahead of you.You HAVE to have a decent class line-up otherwise it's almost impossible to play. I'll come back in a year or two and edit my review then, but as for now I'd advise players to wait a little while on this one. It's a great idea, being able to have total control in a team based shooter, it just needs time to refine it. This game is filled with ideas that look great on paper, but when you put in motion it all falls apart. Tony (This game's version of the engineer) is painfully weak. He has a rivet gun (Shot-gun) but the damn thing is extremely inaccurate and when you do hit, everyone completely out damages you almost instantly. He can place seven sentries, but none of them are any good. They all have a painfully small health pool and do almost nothing for damage against everyone other than another tony. Defending is much harder for the simple fact that they always tunnel in on the cube (What you must protect) completely bypassing the tony's sad excuse for a defense. what you end up with because of this is a messy cesspool riddled with holes of variours depths and tunnels going 9,0000 different ways, which makes defense all but impossible because without spending a good portion of the round smoothing the area around the cube out, there's no point behind placing sentries or traps or anything else for that matter. If they were to removed the digging aspect when near cubes, that would be fine. (I like the buliding aspect, not a huge fan of the digging. it's annoying to deal with.) This game's version of the spy, while very strong (He's an infiltrator with a small health pool, if he's not dealing hefty damage, there's no point behind having him) at times feels too strong. that's manily because he ""teleport"" anywhere on the map with ease and the moment he takes too much damage he can just ""Teleport"" out of harms way.Nigel, this games version of the sniper, is... okay? he can head-shot (For a lot of damage, but I don't think it flat-out kills someone) is odd in the sense that he has no-scope, making longer range marksmenship nearly pointless (A sniper that can't snipe all that well, Sounds really stupid but hey.) which leads to him being played more as a CQC class, which because his rifle has no scope, he does quite well with.  In TF2 you can phase into and out of players on your own team, in this game it's the reverse. You can't phase out of your own team( Is a utter nightmare when a newer player follows you down a hole and you want to go out the way you came in.) but you can phase into and past the enemy team, which makes CQC at times literally spray and pray. (Most likely why Tony's Shot-gun is utterly worthless, which it is. It's something even the ""Vets"" mostly agree on. it's too weak and too inaccurate to be his sole means of self defense.) Tony can buff his sentries (At a cost of chewing through his ammo) to deal arguably greater damage, which is fantasic on paper because of how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ his sentries are on their own. However, you have no idea when your sentries firing on someone or being fired on when you have seven of them scattered across the map. you can repair them also while someones firing on them, but the range of his repair tool is sad. you tend to take spash damage when a cog or sarge is spamming at it, but most of the time it's pointless to even bother fighting off cogs/sarges due to their higher health and greater damage out-put. even if you can catch one low on health, you'll most likely still lose due to how lack-luster the rivet gun is. Tony can not place respawn pads, which is odd because that would give him a greater offense role. (Setting up forward bases would be much easier.)The respawn rate is... Bad would be a compliment. (34 seconds... Just let that sink in for a moment. Thought 20 seconds was bad, I feel sorry for you.) Map sizes are quite nice though, would prefer if each side got seven players, but five is alright.Sarge (This games version of the soldier) is pretty worthless all and all. Because a tony can place health and ammo packs, Sarge can't. If you haven't unlocked Cog yet he's okay in a very loose way. But the moment you get a cog, do not bother with Sarge. Everything Sarge does, cog literally does 10X better.All of this aside, the game can be something that can go toe-toe with TF2, just not right now. A few years time, this game might be something truly good.			"

												Great game, but I have one issue:It's like a all the 12 year olds on Steam saw this game and was like ""oh wow! Minecraft + CoD how amazing!"" and as a result you get a lot of awful players with no tactical or strategic sense. Granted, I'm still a low level and still learning some mechanics, but some of the people I have played with so far are just so dull. Anyone looking to buy this game, beware of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ players, but learn the game. Also, do not be afraid to communicate. This game is first and foremost a MOBA, so teamwork is priority. That is the key to winning matches in this game. No amount of individual skill can carry in a MOBA of this variety.Regardless, I am having a lot of fun playing this at the moment.			"

												Is this supposed to be a logical development from Ace of Spades? Really just feels like a step back. The controls are clunky and unintuitive. AoS was an incredibly fun game before Jagex got their hands on it. This game feels like them trying to brush the AoS name under the rug while releasing an update for that game as a standalone product. Regardless, you know that Jagex rarely listens to players... Any game you purchase from them is a risk that it could change fundamentally overnight. Anyway, I didn't find this game fun. It's a really nice idea, but the best iteration of this type of game has already been made, which was AoS pre-Jagex.			"

												I tried this game only because of the free weekend offered on Steam.  Its a Minecraft-ish, tower defence/attack, team FPS.  After playing a few games I discovered I really liked it so dished out the cash and bought it.  At the start of a game each team is closed off to prepare their defence of the cubes.  This involves building/destroying walls, setting traps and adding defences.  Once the ""curtain"" drops the game starts in earnest and you will have to defend the cube against the other team as well attack their cube.  You can do this by running in gung-ho, sneaking around the defences or tunnelling in from below.  Sometimes you get stuffed with a rubbish team and you are doomed from the start but to be honest I still enjoy the gameplay.  There is a variety of pre-set characters who are cartoonlike (in fact very Borderlands) but very well drawn with amusing one liners (which do start to get annoying and can give away your position).  So yes I will give this a positive review just because I have had my £10 worth out of the game.  There are more updates coming as well as a new character.i really really like this game, HOWEVER the queue times are not acceptable.  So I have changed this review.  I quite regularly queue for 5 or so minutes, finally get in a game and then the 10th person doesnt accept.  You then find yourself at the start of another queue starting at zero.  Also if you do get in a game, you may play a game where one cube is destroyed and you get an♥♥♥♥♥♥in your team who just wants to give up so continually spams Surrender.  If you fail to agree, he/she will then just type abuse and then eventually when you refuse to give up will then attack you and your defence and assist the enemy team.  Then to make it worse at the end of the match they vote you as a bad player just because you want to play the game.  It quite often takes 10 minutes to get in a game so I never want to surrender no matter how bad my team.  The down vote by the ""♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; player then affects your queue times negatively.  It is such a shame that the queues are so bad and the fact that the kids get to vote against your willingness to play when it looks like you are losing.  Therefore I cant recommend it any longer.  A great game but ruined by really long queue times.			"

												So,this is my first serious review on a game.  Pros  : Great F2P figure,every hero is obtainable with gold. Only skins require real money. -Great graphics,it looks really detailed. Well,seems here I ran out of ideas xD. Cons: Community(a part of) really rude persons,griefing destroying your traps , turrets, mortars etc. Some will even team kill you,but only with some specific weapons/traps for example Rolys Cannons or Sarges Rocket launcher,C4 and grenaded. Yes,I reccomend this game,its really addicting and worth giving it a shot.Okay so I feel like editing this a little bit and adding something describing every hero there is (cheapest to the most expensive) Sergeant Sarge Stone:Sarge is a really good close range - mid range with his rocket launcher and LMG. His c4 is more of a troll block dont get me wrong.... lets move on to Nigel Purdy Longshott: For new players,I reccomend building a sniper tower. It will help you out to take out enemies. His tiki head is good in tight places,as of you cant get easily out. Also beartraps work best with fake blocks. Anthony Tony Turreto:Tony is a good choice if you want to defend,his turrets are hardly destroyed and can even be fixed. His rivet gun,is essentialy a shotgun,nothing more. As that is his only weapon,it is not reccomended to go attacking with. next hero with a bigger price tag: Cogwheel:Cog is preety good for starters because he has high health and high DPS makes him a great choice for attacking since hes a tank. OP Juan Shinobi: Most people recognise him as op but hes okay,he isnt that game breaking. He is a mobilty hero so he is good for attacking. Doc Eliza Doolally: This crazed doctor is really powerful with its Toxic Ball launcher and Chemical grenades. Her hero block,the miasma mine is good also in tight places(just like Nigels Tiki Head) she is good for both defense and attack. Moving on to the next heroes. Lets start up with Dream Genie: I find her more of a troll class because her weapons arent that effective she is good in the attack because she can play tricks on the other teams defense and its a good way of infiltrating in the enemy base without getting hurt. Sweet Science: Well,havent played with him alot but i got him on the free rotation. he has some abilities just like Juan to teleport and stuff and he is good at point blank range with his gloves. The gravity well isnt that effective since u can destroy it before it catches you but maybe you get killed in the process. Astarella:Also, I havent played much with her but i can say she can be very annoying but very effective if played well. And last but not least the most expensive characters. Vander Graaf:Also,havent played much with him but i can say he is a considerate option in the defense,but i find him underpowered.. next is Kira Chan: Havent played at all with her,but she is good in both attack and defense. The SMGS are great at close range and the Kitty Launcher seems like its Sarges RPG but comes with a grenade detonation mode. Yuri The Yeti: He is good at camping at the base with a big pile of ice because its his ammo resource,the snowballs can be deadly if you have good aim and the snowthrower is preety much useless(does 2 damage lel) and moving on to Roly Poly Fat Fat: I like this one alot,she is great. Even though i cant aim for days with her cannons she is still alot of fun. The cannons have a one shot then if you want to deal heavy damage they can be fired at once(but have to wait 1 second before you can shoot them again) The Booster is good for getting supply drops first and if you cover yourself in the enemy base I reccomend to use the toxic fumes because the enemies will get caught in them and then die. And last but not least Kreepy The Clown: I think he is great at range with the gloves also at point blank range with the other use of the gloves. The banana is ok,you can use it as an obstacle for the enemy team or  as a grenade. His Special ability is preety useless,next to the avalanche. Im preety much done now explaining every hero,if you want further explanation just write down the comments. IF you actually are reading this now. Buh Bye! Oh and I have to add a con,sorry I had to :p,but there are some server problems out there,it just freezes.			"

												I was interested in this game for a long time after seeing some youtubers play it, but now that i can test it i realized the game is as bad as rumors said.If you don't live in North America, Europe or Australia your ping will be terrible.Seriously, EVEN THE TUTORIAL IS 200 PING. It would be a little bit forgivable if placing blocks was client side, but no, they aren't risking any possibility of exploits, everything, even the tutorial MUST be at their servers.Movement and aiming sucks, my default sensitivity was like 360 every 2 centimeters.Jumping is floaty and sprint jumping can go over a 5~ block gap, while jumping being floaty it still climbs a single block a time.EDIT:If i could make a private local server to play with friends, that would be enough for a positive review.Actually that would be enough for me to freaking BUY it, no need for the free to play and no microtransactions ruining the potential this game had.This is the minecraft objective class based gameplay i was looking for, but sucking a lot harder than minecraft's netcode.

Then they drop the walls and ur in a team fortress 2 style objective based shooter tring to destroy the enemies base.  You can dig trenches, place exsplosives and shoot the enemies in the face to get to their cores.  The game is free 2 play and can be loads of fun specially with friends.			"

												This is a thrilling game since this used to be a payed game (I think) and now it is free and it is not a pay to win. This game is a time killer and really enjoyable and all swear words are replaced with the world ""Block"" so e.g.""What the block you gonna do"" or ""Block Heads"" ect. But the ONE (I am not angry) problem is the currency since for a match you lose in you will get 50 in game curreny but when you win you get 75 in game currency so the only way to get a lot of in game currency is to do the objectives which are reset every 24 hours and will give up to a minimum of about 400 in game currency and a maximum of 450. but otherwise the game developers should get a gold trophy for their work. And since it is a f2p you have nothing to lose.			"

There more negatives than positives, but you might as well try this game.GOOD:-No game is the same, which leads to many hours of new things.-Heroes are different, and most of them are actually fun to play.-Small playerbase, which has led to me meeting some cool people.BAD:-Small playerbase, which means you might have to wait a few minutes to find a game (only affects experienced players really).-1 developer, which means there are pretty much no updates.-Some heroes are unbalanced (such as SS and Vander), but it doesn't seem like they will be nerfed anytime soon.-Long queue times for experienced players.-High level play is boring as it consists of waiting until blockbuster (a boost) to end the game.-Game is filled with braindead, 10 year olds, so don't expect anything from your teammates.

 What is Block N Load Block N Load is a game where you build, defend and attack. The game is simple, but fun. Some people say that the game is Pay 2 Win (P2W) But, NO, It's not!  You can unlock characters by playing the game normally! The only thing that you can't unlock with the game normal currency, is the characters skins. You do, have to pay real money to buy them, but you don't need to. I recommend this game, and you should install it now! What the block you gonna do?!  "

												A brilliant mix of strategy and FPS. Reminds me a little bit of playing Spy vs Spy as a kid, sneaking around, setting up traps and sitting back watching someone fall to their death through some sly fake blocks...For me, as someone who plays games so infrequently that I'd be totally oblitterated in a standard FPS, I really like the way that you can play the game the way you want to, which for me tends to be tunnelling in underground, out of the heat of the battle.Oh and Ninja's voice overs are worth playing the game for alone!

												I'm gonna start this off saying I am not the ""building games"" kind of guy.I was probably bored as ♥♥♥♥ and stumbled upon this game, the trailers looked fun, so I tried it out for the heck of it.Straight to the point, this thing exceeded ALL my expectations, it's some sort of TF2 in which you can ♥♥♥♥ up your enemy's base, what's there not to like?Another thing that I liked a lot, is the necessary teamwork, being a lone wolf can get you ♥♥♥♥ed up.Here are the classes of the game:* O.P Juan Shinobi: Infiltrator class, get inside the enemy's base by climbing walls, sabotage their defenses and slice people with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sword.* Tony: Defensive class, builds turrets and has special building tools to assist allies.* ""Doc"": Offensive/Defensive class, throws some kind of toxic♥♥♥♥♥♥that makes people die.* Sarge: Has an LMG with a huge ammo capacity, a C4 charge, and frag grenades. great for destroying defenses.* Nigel: Has a long-range rifle (scopeless), tons of traps, and can ♥♥♥♥ you up from afar.* Cogwheel: A robot with a ton of health, a machinegun on his arm and a mortar.I'd advise you to give this game a shot, specially since you can play it for free if you get a beta code.http://blocknload.com/signupIt might look childish and all but I had tons of fun in this, met some nice people and I didn't even play that much, greatly recommended.

												a sort of review i'd like a ""mixed"" button for.basically you've got another ""it's like, a moba. but with blocks."" idea, but this one's actually pretty unique, with cool, semi-original characters who all play differently, who excel with different block loadouts, etc.pros:-unique characters that are fairly balanced (vander graaf)-different perk loadouts (which you can buy with in-game currency acquired through playing) that can boost your areas of expertise-brains heroes are pretty cool-""build phase"" before a round in which you can build up your base before the 4 enemy skill-type heroes all flank through the same narrow path at the same time-3 different classes of heroes: brawn, brains, and skill-there are like, 5 songs on the soundtrack, but those are pretty good, i guess. they're also impossible to find on youtubecons:-this community holy♥♥♥♥♥♥br>-almost every update is balancing changes that didn't need to happen or like 1-2 new skins and then it's complete silence and no support for a month-90% of your matches 1-3 people will instantly lock into a hero that they want to play, usually a skill-type one (sniper hero, flank-based ninja hero, etc) and will barely communicate at all, usually if they do it's in a foreign language despite being in your proper regional server (no racism intended but i'd like to not see russian text every single game in the us server)-there are only 4 brains (support) heroes, and half the tools they need to properly build a base are from other classes. in addition, 2 of the brains are offense-oriented, meaning if you want to/have to defend you'll be playing the same heroes, over and over.-the in-game currency grind takes way too long. most of the ""fun"" heroes (or just simply ones used in the meta more often) take around 15-ish hours of grinding money to get. there are daily missions+rewards and normal achievements that can boost your cash intake, however.-25+ minute queues, only like 10 people in the queue-the competitive league is beyond dead and is only active during some parts of the day and week, so most of the time any remaining pro players that have like 800+ hours will jump in and pubstomp regularly, hope they're on your team.-most of the time, even if you volunteer yourself to go brains defender, your team will start wrecking the base and not communicating with you at all.-some characters are horribly imbalanced, and with certain perk loadouts have no weaknesses (ie: the 540 hp cogwheel)-hidden blocks blend into the normal ground (actually they look identical to the nearby blocks) and evaporate when you walk on them, which allows people to send you through the map or into a trap that garuntees instant death. whenever i die to these i don't think ""whoa, i should've been paying more attention"" i think ""how the ♥♥♥♥""-first few matches in which you're thrust into a game with only 3 available heroes (which are all situational) and are most likely thrown against a 200+ hour person-all in all, the game has lots of flaws, and most of them are with the community (including devs), and i'm nominating it the custom category ""game ruined by community"".

												Block N Load is a great game which encourages emergent gameplay. The game is very fun whilst playing solo but playing with friends the game shines even brighter. The possibilites are literally endless - I have well over 1,000 hours and I still see something new every day I play. strategies evolve over time, and fun hits you in the face from around every corner. I by no means exaggerate at all when I say that playing Block N load has given me the most fun any game has done for a VERY long time. :)			"

												This game is what Ace of Spades should have been It's a suprisingly strategic game. You get 5 minutes to build whatever the hell you want (yes, you can build after 5 minutes to). You get traps, fake block that enemy players go through, bombs, blocks that only your team can go through and etc. It's a game where the enemy team and your team get 3 core blocks in a 4x4 shape that your and your enemy team needs to deffend from each other. Kinda like a moba with it's towers...but it's 4x4 block with no turrets. If you like TF2, Minecraft or just want a new and somewhat inovating way to play an FPS game, well here it is "

												The game used to be good fun and I am sure it can still be at times however I feel ripped off having spent money on this game and getting very little in reward when it became free to play.

												If you have played ace of spades or other similar games that introduces voxel base building and first person shooter but was disappointed, then you might avoid it with this game, Block N Load. BnL is trying to have a fine balance between letting a player enjoy base building such as placing blocks, traps, turrets and other gadgets around within a certain time limit, before all hell breaks loose and the big wall is removed. At the same time it is allowing first person shooter fans to have fun just shooting anything and everything, blocks, traps, turrets, players and so on. Whether you want to focus on building defense, traps and buildings using blocks then you can contribute that way. If you want to go in gunning, then you can do that. If you want to stay behind and snipe, you can do that too. Maybe you want to sneak around and climb up the walls, you can do that too. Perhaps you want to mix it all up, you can do that too. All in all, it offers a great variety and strategy when playing. If you don't care much for team play you can still have fun just playing lone wolf, gathering resources by breaking bricks and using them to put out lots of firepower in turrets or just traps, even intel such as radar.If you are terrible at FPS but always wanted to have fun playing an FPS this is your chance to still be a team player, contribute and even end up first in your team...even if you lost the match. As you rack up points also by destroying bricks and placements while building new things. So killing alone might not be sufficient anymore.So if you enjoy building, placing out things, sneaking, sniping, gunning, running, climbing, jumping, digging, healing, being random, trying to be creative or figure out new ways to combine the different classes you all play as a team who have access to different equipment, to create a new way to attack, defend or just be crazy creative while bombs and gunshot is flying around...then so be it. Do that...It's a great game. Play it...Classes - Standard equipment + unique equipment for the class you choose. Level them up, get bonus and more powerful buffs...Come on, go on....I know you want to play it...			"

												It's great. You should buy it if you enjoy:- a tactical shooter in which mindless run&gun is punished by an increasing respawn timer and various devious traps that the enemy team builds- coordinating with friends to pull off crazy stunts- shooters where you don't die instantly but instead have the ability to balance for screw-ups by tactics and coordination You shouldn't buy it if:- You like to run and gun and think that teamwork is for sissies- You feel like a 40 second respawn timer after 40 minutes of match is too long (the respawn gets longer the longer the game goes on. To prevent eternal games)- You value solo-play. The game is best when you work together with your team mates. This goes all the way down to your character class selection. The team can't be all Ninjas, so you should be prepared to pick something useful instead. In general this game is great fun. The graphics are vibrant, the gameplay is very polished and overall balanced. The game rewards playing smart and punishes mindless stupidity. It is prone to griefing and the team suffering due to incompetent members, but as of right now I played 13 hours and have not encountered more than one or two such unfortunate events.			"

												I loved this game in the beta stages, and I still play it now time to time.But making it free to play ruined pretty much everything.It can be very fun to play (if you have a semi competent team.)But over half the time you'll have a team that chooses three heavy characters etc and loses.When I used to play, I was level 36 and was excited to level up, but the F2P update took away all my levels and character upgrades and replaced it with owning the original characters and a few skins.I payed TWENTY DOLLARS for the game and I feel like I should get something more than characters that should be free already. Plus, people who payed for the game don't get any new characters, (Yuri, Kira Chan, Kreepy, etc.)Gold and Platinum are the stupidest things ever... That's all I have to say about them.THE SERVERS ARE HORRIBLE, I GET CONSTANT LAG SPIKES AND HIGH PING.Don't even get me started on character balance...Those are just a few of the reasons that I feel ruined the game.This is all my opinion so don't flip out.TL;DR: the devs ruined the game and unless they fix it, I'm not changing my review.

												This is my 1st review of any game i have ever put up on steam but i feel compelled to give a review here.I got this game from a friend and i loved it ever since. Its a moba type game like smite and league but more like smite with it being 3D, it has some building elements inspired from minecraft and fast paced fps action. Defend your base with 4 other people in a 5v5 match. I'v had tons of fun playing this game and i only been playing one class.Pros:  Fast paced action           Solid game mechanics(Except for the accidental jumping off ledges and the side of the map dying.)          Class's are unique no 2 class feel the same.          Maps are beautiful and colorful          The class level system is really cool and fun gives you mastery over a certain class.           Team based game.Cons:  Solid game mechanics(Except for the accidental jumping off ledges and the side of the map dying.)           Some class feel over power and very stale to play vs.(Example is Eliza has DoT AoE that does not require much aim             at all.)           The game client could be better           There is only 6 class.s I want there to be more class's.           People can pick the same character in the same game so we basicly could have 10 ninja's all in one game. I dont like this very much because its stale and not very fun i like diversity.            Probably will get boring without more content.Over all i like this game very very much. I would love for a mod or another version of this game came out like a MMORPG with the class's they have and the skill mechanics. But thats just my idea.Do i recommend this game. Well lets see i'm going to go out and buy the $20 bundle and get 2 keys so i can play with more friends. I hope you guys like this as much as i do.			"

												I would like to say that this game is extremely fun, but I dunno if I should say if it is STILL fun.I liked it when lava and water can get you killed, so now if ur on a water map, you literally have to worry about people getting in from the side of the maps or such.And not only that, but the range of the rocket is outragously long, where the player could literally just place down a ammo block and constantly shoot until the cube explodes.Another thing that seemed to change is that the ninja is somehow more irritating, I was fine with the ninja disappearing and leaving a bomb, but also healing and replenishing ammo??? It is bad enough if you don't have radars surrounding practically your entire base or the ninja could hide the shrine ANYWHERE. I know the shrine is the ninja's major ability but add that in with the exploding healing smoke bomb....kinda turns the ninja a bit OPMedic seems good, xcept it isn't fun that she has quite a long range with her gernades.Science actually seems fine.Asterella seems fine also.Sarge is good.Tony is good.Nigel is good also (thank god there isn't a scope lol)Cog is also good.So far this game was extremely fun when it did the free weekend before it offically got a price. But it somehow seemed to patch a bit and might of accidently made a character or 2 a bit OP without realizing it.			"

												This game really does feel like a cross between Team Fortress 2 and Minecraft. It has the best of both worlds: class-based FPS action, destructible/buildable environments, great physics, and a strong tactical feel.The whole game feels very polished, and at no point did I feel it was pay-to-win. All of the cash shop stuff is cosmetic only, which at this point in the games industry's development, I'm totally OK with.Well worth the money I spent. Great fun at a cheap price, and it's got loads of replayability.The only thing I don't like is that some elements of the UI are less polished, like voicechat. Voicechat works well, but it's not well documented and it's hard to tell who's speaking at any given time.			"

												This game is extremely fun and addicting. This is a small mix of League of Legends + Minecraft + TF2, with it's own unique mechanics. There is a small bit of a learning curve, but you can learn it very fast. Pros-Fun and addicting-Not pay2winYou pay for skins, you can pay for heroes, but still get them for free. Perks are also buyable, but only with the free currency.-A ton of mapsOf course, some are better than others.-Each game is differentYou build and fortify your base, so each game will be different.-Not region lockedIf your friend is from EU and you're from NA you guys can still queue together, unlike a fair amount of games.Cons-High queue timesDuring weekends and afternoon weekdays the queue times are short. But other than that they can be a bit long, and you will run into the same people a lot. They are also a lot longer for players just starting out so you don't run into people who stomp you.-UnbalancedThe game is a bit unbalanced for sure.-RanksYour rank can only go up, not down. This removes the stress from the game, but rank is less skill and more grind. They are fixing this soon (maybe) with a new ranked mode.Overall, I for sure recommend this game. It is a ton of fun			"

												The reason I don't recommend the the game is because of the resent update. Making it Free to play has made it so to have all of the characters, you have to pay. As it is a f2p game, this is expected. When I saw this, i thought it would be fun. I was kinda wrong. Sure it is still the same game, with the none paid for characters still being there, but it is stuff like perks. Before, everyone was on the same level (except those who had put more time into it) so nobody got extras. As of now, you can have such of a bigger advantage.Also, people who put hours into it before, have nothing. One day I look, level 10 characters. Now, everything is level 0.:(			"

												This game Looks like another minecraft clone targeted towars young children but its not ~! Its actually a suprisingly fun combination if tf2 / minecraft/ dota & league elements. In this FPS shooter you build up your defenses around the Cores. Protect these cores from your enemys and destroy their cores :) So far the playerbase has been quite good and most of the players are not your avarage ""Call of duty minecraft screamers"" so thats good :) If you have the spare money and looking for an online FPS thats fun to play, this might be the game for you :)			"

												Amazing game, before the update. Why did you do this, the only thing that  I got for paying for this before it was free 2 play was skins for characters that I've never played and had no intention of playing them. I enjoyed playing this with a friend and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Now it's free 2 play. That's great, I earned the skins for the characters that I wanted to play and then I get given free skins for a game that I no longer play becuase it's been made into a free 2 play. Money not well spent. 8/10 before update, 3/10 after update. Been made into a terrible game that I have unistalled never to look at again. Don't waste your time.			"

I paid for a game that is now free. As for those saying that there was no guarantee it would always be pay2play, I ask you, do you think when purchasing any game on steam ""Wait this may go f2p someday!"" and hold off on buying it. The answer is no. As the users, we should not accept this hack method of drawing in more users, a good game is self reliant and shouldn't require a f2p gimmick to have a dedicated userbase.			"

												Omg dis best game ever, look at my playtime etc. etc.On a more serious note, the game involves a steep learning curve and is difficult to master. The 'Build' is just as important as the 'Load', meaning you don't have to be good at aiming to be decent at this game. The game gets extremely tactical, especially when the teams are balanced. That's the main issue though. The lack of players is really this game's greatest downfall. This isn't much of a problem for new players in their first 50 hours, but when your MMR (Match Making Rank) reaches a certain point, the queues start to last longer than the games you get lol. Yes this is probably because the game fails to put high ranking players against eachother since only 2 or 3 are online during most of the week, but a 10 minute queue for a 5-10 minute game gets pretty repetitive after a while.Anyways, the game is really fun and you should definitely try it. After all, it is free to play, you can't really complain lol			"

												Block N Load is a game for itself. Amazing combat, beautiful and well-made maps, funny gameplay and TONS! of gameplay value. I haven't played this game so much yet, but I've already noticed the small events they have put into the game. Shows that they really put effort into their game. Around Christmas, they had an event where you had to play 20 matches, to get a Tony skin (Tony is one of the playable characters).I love the quick combat and the variable combat in this game. Want a new way to go? Dig down and dig away! ""Dig your way to victory!""Rate? 8/10. I would like to see more small maps, rather than big maps. I enjoyed the 1 core map more than the 3 core maps.

												9/10A really fun game. I honestly cannot remember the last time I had so much fun playing a shooter. Graphics:The graphics look much more like TF2 than Minecraft, but are unique to themselves. Though there are blocks, many of them are not cubes. There are all shapes and sizes.  It looks sleek and modern, not retro at all. There are also nice shadow and lighting effects. The style works for the type of game it is. In the heat of battles, blocks fly everywhere from explosions going off all around you, which adds to the experience drasticly.Gameplay:First and foremost is the unique ability to break or build anything. It adds a layer of strategy not found in most shooters. Defenses do not have to be complicated to be effective, though complicated desings can work if applied correctly. It takes a lot of time to develop good strategies for building on each map.Once the match begins, after the build stage, you can do just about anything. Digging under a base is as viable as building over one. As others have said, unlike in Minecraft, there is gravity, so you will not be able to build floating bridges. Each character feels really unique, and you really need one from each of the 3 categories to be successful (usually).  The weapons in this game are SOOO satisfying. A combination of good sound effects and visual effects makes each one pop, and landing a shot, no matter the weapon, always feels good. Each character also has a special ability, which, for most characters, offers support for yourself and all surrounding teamates.Teamwork is key in this game. You need to use text or voice chat to tell eachother what you are doing, and make sure to plan attacks ahead of time. Running in wildly is not an option in this game, even for the tank class Cog.Right now there is only one gamemode: Destroy the Base, but the developers are going to have more ready for launch in less than a month. I am hoping for a Payload type mode, where players place the tracks for the bomb train to follow.Despite just one gamemode, I have yet to become bored, thanks to well designed maps that offer good variety. Player map creation is another planned feature to be looking forward to.Overall I would HIGHLY recommend this game. It has something for everybody, even those who don't usually like shooters. I hope that this game will continue to expand and grow a healthy community once it is released in a few weeks!			"

Refreshing gameAfter playing this game for hours, testing everything and being on the multiples forums (steam, reddit) I believe I can make a comprehensive review of this awesome game.There's a DEMO available, that allow you to play ONLY a few characters available. You can play with every other users, on every maps. Try it before you buy it ! ;) Also a pack (5 players) is available if you have any friends that are willing to play with you. Pros (+)  Incredible freedom with blocks, it feels good to model the battlefield ! You can dig holes to make traps, create bridge, sneak around below thanks to tunnels, create bunkers. This is great to use your creativity to defend and attack ! The devs are quite present (especially on reddit), and listen to the complaints as well as the questions of the player. (You can find a discussion I had with them on reddit, search for ArthurCP). This feels great to be able to contact people from within ! The characters available are quite different and each bring something powerful and different with them ! From the turret makers to the very mobile ninja, and also a robot making mortars. You're sure to find a character suited to you !  Devs plan to add more characters, more blocks for MORE FUN!  Cons (-)  Lack of players sometimes but not a big issue in my opinion, didn't really felt the lack of players. You might have to wait a few minutes to get into a game. Jagex (the company that own the game) is making a lot of marketing to help onto that. Jagex do not have a great reputation in the gaming world as they ♥♥♥♥ed up some games. But seems like Block N Load is a completely different story (AT THE MOMENT, 26/06/2015). Some issues with the matchmaking, that allow team of multiple experimented players against casual/new players. This lead to a very bad first view of the game for the new players.Even if there's negative points, I highly recommend this game as it's skill rewarding (creativity, time to learn some ""construction"" such as bunkers, etc.) and I find the atmosphere really enjoyable !

That aside it is a decent game and diffinatly worth a try if you are into hero shooters, and its free so why not?			"

												As you may be able to tell by my game time, I have played a fair few games since the beta was released and I was also lucky enough to be able to take part in the Alpha segment of this games. Which is why I can tell you that this game is an extremely fun to play, yet is competitive enough to keep that level of enjoyment at a consistant rate. Would recommend this game to anyone/everyone who's looking for a new game to play with their friends.			"

												my god. This game has it all. A minecraft style MOBA with beautiful graphics and very competitive/ decent concepts. How do you ♥♥♥♥ THAT UP!?!?!? Well Ironically it isn't the game. It's actually the communtiy. Casual mode is nowhere near bearable when the only people you play with are idiots who only want to go on the offensive and suck badly at it. Not to mention that everyone just so happens to want to play the same character as you or someone else. So your chances of winning are hardly any. Mainly because there's no team comp nor is there great matchmaking. The sad part is how great this game is if you actually had a good team. I can't reccomend this game to anyone....yet. It's too early in the stages to be considered popular (Especially since PvP is dead most of the time) that and there's not nearly enough heros to choose from to make diveristy amongst the teens. But hey if you wanna  survive through the harsh grind of leveling 3 characters you're good with to lvl 15 and try ranked, it's in beta. Nothing to lose except your precious time that you'll never get back.			"

												I would not recommend it now cause of a lack of server. ( SEA server )Build defenses make turrets to protect your base from enemies, Easy right? No. There are players that straight up dig from their base to your base making your turrets somewhat useless. But there are players that still go the extra mile to walk the surface of the map, facing your defenses head on to get to your base like a real man, unlike the others that just dig from base to base.I'd give it a 8/10 IF it had a SEA server.However it doesnt have a SEA server only US, EU and OCE. So.... Im playing every match with 200 ping constantly. 4/10 "

												Looks cool! Unless you watch me playing! Because I'm rubbish!(now off to go play practice mode so I can figure out what the hell's going on...)Def recommend giving it a look, was lots of fun even in the chaos of me not figuring out controls etc ;)Updated: Played about in the tutorial, and had a few games - seems really easy to get the hang of the trivial bits, but deep enough that I can see lots of longer-term strategising, metagame and other fun...Games can take a while to complete, but actually I've so far found that a good thing - the time flies, and it allows for a lot of ebb and flow.Recommend, esp while free, and I've now bought it too :)			"

												I joined the beta of this game a few days ago and I really enjoy the concept and how it changes the normal gameplay of a multiplayer fps by adding in building/destruction elements, but a $30 price tag? I would pay $5 and feel okay about it, or maybe even $10, but not $20-$30. Don't get me wrong, my friends and I enjoy the game, but the new concept wears off quick and makes me just want to play Minecraft or TF2. If the games is free I would say give it a shot, otherwise, stick with Minecraft or TF2.			"

												Did I just waste my money on this game? I went through the tutorial and after was looking through the servers list... where it looks to be completely deserted. I saw a total of 3 other servers, each with one player in it just by themselves slowly making their way to the enemy bases. Am I missing something here? Oh yeah, it has other gameplay options but in order to play them you have to create your own server because you can't join any other server that has ""started"" the match, so you have to do this pointless, tedious match by yourself? Please let me know if i am missing something because i feel I just completely wasted 10$			"

												Very fun first person build and shoot game where you just defend your base/attack the enemys cubeand just build and destroy stuffThe game has multiple ""heroes"" which you can unlock by just playing enough and then buy them with your earned gold in the shop.U can also choose your own blocks depending on your playstyle.If u like being an offensive guy then get Cogwheel, amazing robot with Minigun and Missle launcher which also has Mortars where you can destroy much stuff over a big distance, but beware with every shot the mortar loses HP aswell increased block count when you build more of them.Like Defensive style? Try tony, the engineer which can build sentrys and also lay down ammo and medikits and heal other blocks!Like killing over long distances? Play the Sniper which has the ability to target enemys for a bounty and gain bonus blocks, and also can place stuff like jumppads which let u jump higher.Also nerf O.P Ninja pls he destroys all objectives too fast...

												This game is such wasted potential. I have been playing since Beta and it was a great time until about a few months ago when I realized how many flaws this game has. 1) It takes 10-20 minutes to get into one match, which is insane because most matches don't even last that long and matches are poorly balanced with new and experienced players.2) The community is just harsh. There is no way to fix this, but it is a problem that exists in this game. There is a huge amount of trolls, rage quitters, and toxic skrubs in this game it's hilarious.3) The most important reason being that the devs quit on this game. There hasn't been a big update in such a long time, it's ridiculous. This aids to the game being stale af because no new content is being added in and more and more people are quitting this game, like a bunch of the long time veterans.Even after saying all of this, I still wish that this game survived because it seems like such wasted potential as stated earlier.

												Played this for a couple hours now and I must say, I've been looking for a game like this.The game looks very simple but it involves a good amount of skill and teamwork to defeat your opponents.I think the game also has quite some replay value, since every match you play is different. There's different ways of trying to win a match. Also finding the perfect way to defend your base will probably be a long road. The private matches are fun party games to do when you're with a bunch of friends and looking for things to play together.The hero-system reminds me of League of Legends, you can choose from a bunch of heroes that all have different abilities. As far as I assume they will be adding more heroes over time(?)Overall I think this game is good fun!			"

												Block N Load is something new and fresh to the game market. With it's catchy music, unique art style and competitive multiplayer, this game brings a lot of fun and friends to your PC. Each character you choose has a totally different fighting style and Silhouette, they each have a role to play on this team based multiplayer. Pick the wrong character setup and you may not do to well so choose wisely. You are a 5 man team facing another 5 man team with your own side of the map. Once the match begins you have a few minuites to prep your base by setting up traps, reinforcing things or building anything you can think of that may help win the game. During this time you cannot see or go to the other teams base, once the timer hits zero each team is free to attack. You may still build after the timer but you will have non friendlys attacking you at any time. The way to win is to attack they enemies cube, a small square genereator looking cube. Depending on the map chosen in the beginning by voting, you may have up to 3 cubes to destroy.  Once one of the two teams destroys all of the cubes it is game over where you can look at your stats before heading back to start a new mach. I fell in love with Block N Load. It's refreshing to see something new on the market with a great community including friends from all over the world. Everyone is there to help you because they need you in order to win. The devs are very good at responding to any questions, concearns or just to chat occasionally. I find myself not wanting to stop playing even when I need to. Every game I find myself on the edge of my seat as I get into fast paced battles with other players seeing who can outsmart our destroy the other.  Each play is different and the game can change and flip at any moment, you will find yourself stuck fighting and defending untill one team breaks through enemy lines taking you and your cube down or vise versa. That is what makes me love this game, that is why I reccomend this game. No other game can you laugh, fight, and sometimes cry all in one match.			"

Each play is different and the game can change and flip at any moment, you will find yourself stuck fighting and defending untill one team breaks through enemy lines taking you and your cube down or vise versa. That is what makes me love this game, that is why I reccomend this game. No other game can you laugh, fight, and sometimes cry all in one match.			"

												Block N' Load was an amazing Beta when I played it. The only problems I had with the game, wasn't really the game itself:Graphics are good, game-play is one-of-a-kind, and it is truly fun to play.My issues lied within the community; I adore a good game, but if it's going to be centered around multiplayer, community is important. The Beta had only a few players who were willing to buy it, and the ones who probably got a code generator were hackers, and without any V.A.C. system or report features, this game was horrible to play and have a good time.Now, fully fledged with constantly updated and bursting new content all the time, the community is much better. I know a lot of people may think that Free-to-Play means lots of noob-ish players, but at least their better than too few players at all, or hackers! And on top of that, anyone who DID buy the Beta, retains some of the previously available (but now unlockables) from the getgo.As far as game-play goes, everything is pretty balanced an fair to play, it runs smooth, looks nice, controls are a bit clunky (who cares, you can reconfigure them!), but best of all: IT'S A GAME THAT IS A FREE TO PLAY AND DOESN'T FOCUS ON MICRO-TRANSACTIONS! Yeah, they have them, but they really won't get you anything that gives any sort of advantage over another player. Their also not so in-your-face about them either, almost like a thing you can do but you have no reason to do it.All in all,8.6/10-CrazyContraption @ R&S Corp.			"

												Do You Like Minecraft? Do You Like Any Shooter?  Well Mix Those 2 And You Get This.

EDIT because of the F2P update : Dont get me wrong here but heres the new thing theres almost ALL f2ps Why? every match you get 1 to 3 guys that have reskins evrey one else has the commando guy destroys ALL defenses and make your life a LIVING HELL! So my outcome after the f2p update 8/10. - IGN lol Dont get me wrong its still fun just not like before the f2p update so play if your a newcomer if your a vetran to this A.K.A. cod.... just get minecraft, mod it, with guns n' stuff find a server that supports all that and play on it! So if you skiped all that heres the summed up version. 8/10 Play if you think it might be fun.			"

If you are not yet a meme feel free to read belowI am quite sure there is no other game where xX_mLg_PrO_MiNeCraFt_LetS_PlAyERs_Xx™ can coincide with ¢σ∂ σf ∂υтιєяѕ without taking the living memes out of each other. Block n load is also one of the only games on steam to not have 8 year old Russians screaming♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ down their mics and telling you about what they did with your mother last night.Unlike games like Dota and League of legends block n load always ends up with  a different map than how it started. Yes fps games will have them covered in blood and some console commands show where bullets hit but in this game the map is sometimes unrecognisable after a showering of mortar volleys and several extra hills of yuri's snow.So if you have not yet pressed the download button 'JUST DO IT', cause it will 'MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE'. Who knows in 2 years time you may have pressed that play button for the thousandth time. But you still won't have come across the same scenario, noob or well you might encounter a few noobs on your way, but with a communtity as nice as this one and Devs that actually listen block n load should be here for a long while longer.

												And the title for my most surprisingly fun game of the year goes to... Block N Load!!I saw that this game was now free to play on steam after many months of ridicule towards both the game itself and it's unappealing £15 price tag and so, given my laptops inability to render any graphics more advanced than that of minecraft, I decided to give it a go. And boy was I wrong to mock it. This game takes the fun strategic multiplayer of csgo, gives it a dash of TF2 and smothers it in a minecraft art style and building system, creating a rather odd frankenstein's monster which actually plays surprisingly well.The main gamemode in Block N Load is a 'defend the objective' mission in which you must build defences around one or more cubes to prevent the enemy team doing melee damage to it, and attacking the enemies cube until either objective loses all of it's health and explodes. Simple enough. But through playing the game, I discovered it's extremely strategic and team based undertones which sets Block N Load apart from other generic shooters. For example, the multiple classes of characters, that can be unlocked through either in game cash or real money, offer a unique play style for either attacking the enemy or defending your own cube. They all feature different items and blocks to place to both remain balanced and also fill in their specific role.You may have noticed that I mentioned the purchase of characters through real money. Although I, along with many people on the internet, hate microtransactions this game manages to implement them in a way that doesn't really give people who pay a large advantage. They do this by making the heroes relatively easy to unlock by earning cash through playing the game and also having skins for the heroes that can be purchased that offer NO ingame advantages.the graphics for this game, with some special blocks and the heroes as an exception, are very similar to that of minecraft making for an interesting looking game that actually performs well on any PC. I personally use a HP pavillion G6 2000 series laptop and the game constantly runs at 30fps on low settings, not impressive for many but it is an achievement for my little piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥TL;DRPros:-Fun Gameplay-Well optimised-FREECons:-Can spend real money to unlock characters-not AAA graphics (just adding this to try and seem more fair, I understand that they weren't aiming for that)Would recommend any day "

This game went from having the potentual to be something great to be ruined by pay to win crap. In all do respects great game, but i think its dodgey buissness to pull off what the developers did here, which is why i dont recommend it.			"

												Holy ♥♥♥♥, when I came across this game, I though that it would be another MInecraft rip - off (and I hate Minecraft), but then I played it with my friend and it was so amazing! Gameplay like Battlefield, very shiny and next - gen looking graphics, along with really good classes and a huge diversity of skills.I absolutely fell in love with this game the moment i joined the server. I do think the Robot is OP, but everything else is a massive surprise. Well done, well done....			"

												And the title for my most surprisingly fun game of the year goes to... Block N Load!!I saw that this game was now free to play on steam after many months of ridicule towards both the game itself and it's unappealing £15 price tag and so, given my laptops inability to render any graphics more advanced than that of minecraft, I decided to give it a go. And boy was I wrong to mock it. This game takes the fun strategic multiplayer of csgo, gives it a dash of TF2 and smothers it in a minecraft art style and building system, creating a rather odd frankenstein's monster which actually plays surprisingly well.The main gamemode in Block N Load is a 'defend the objective' mission in which you must build defences around one or more cubes to prevent the enemy team doing melee damage to it, and attacking the enemies cube until either objective loses all of it's health and explodes. Simple enough. But through playing the game, I discovered it's extremely strategic and team based undertones which sets Block N Load apart from other generic shooters. For example, the multiple classes of characters, that can be unlocked through either in game cash or real money, offer a unique play style for either attacking the enemy or defending your own cube. They all feature different items and blocks to place to both remain balanced and also fill in their specific role.You may have noticed that I mentioned the purchase of characters through real money. Although I, along with many people on the internet, hate microtransactions this game manages to implement them in a way that doesn't really give people who pay a large advantage. They do this by making the heroes relatively easy to unlock by earning cash through playing the game and also having skins for the heroes that can be purchased that offer NO ingame advantages.the graphics for this game, with some special blocks and the heroes as an exception, are very similar to that of minecraft making for an interesting looking game that actually performs well on any PC. I personally use a HP pavillion G6 2000 series laptop and the game constantly runs at 30fps on low settings, not impressive for many but it is an achievement for my little piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥TL;DRPros:-Fun Gameplay-Well optimised-FREECons:-Can spend real money to unlock characters-not AAA graphics (just adding this to try and seem more fair, I understand that they weren't aiming for that)Would recommend any day "

												Good game it is free and it isn't a pay to win but you can pay if you want it has very few lag spikes I have only had one lag spike in my 10 hours of playing. This is an amazing game eventhough it is only in beta I would recommend it to anyone who likes tactical shooters. In the game you have 5 mins at the start to set up defences for your bases where there can be up to three bases at once then it is wich ever team can destroy the other team's base the fastest (there is up to 5 people on each team).

												Take a constantly-rotting community bowl, add in a cup of Team Fortress 2, 3 tablespoons of Minecraft and stir them until the mixture looks pleasant.Take a matchmaker and chop it in an as unbalanced manner as possible, then add it to the previously-made composition.Next, grab a fresh tutorial and peel it well, in fact, remove the flesh until you get close to the seed and drop it in.Put it in the oven for 15 minutes or more, depending on your internet speed. The finished product should be a FUN game, even FUNNIER played with friends, but LESS FUN after reaching level 10 or so (where you begin to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by the pros and matches last up to an hour), with a broken matchmaking that will take 1 to 5 minutes to get into a game and even then you'll be encountering 2 vs 6 situations (at worst), with some cool starter heroes and some cooler, more powerful ones, that cost a fortune and will require over 16 hours of not premium gameplay, that encourages players to rush into the game with 0 knowledge of what to do through a thin tutorial and the option to skip that tutorial for bonus cash (seriously), where nobody has any idea what are they doing except for wrecking everything in their way (explosions, yaaay).BUT, overall, I would still recommend it. Serve it with a LOT of PATIENCE and care (because it can be addictive).			"

												Edit: Oh bummer, seems the beta key I got that gave me access to the beta for free is no longer valid, looks like I have to shell 15 dollars out to keep playing. Perhaps I can argue that I bought Ace of spades and deserve to get this for free? D:Just so you guys know, I was one of the people who was horribly let down by Jagex's fantastic butchering of Ace Of Spades which left me unsatisfied and . So When I first heard of this game, I was FURIOUS. How dare Jagex make another game using the same font layout for the title using the same concept?So I started playing it recently, and I'm amazed with how far they've come and how much they've improved. With no dedicated fanbase of origin like Ace Of Spades, they took some neat creative freedom, making a MOBA-styled shooter with building integrated into the gameplay. Gameplay can have a lot of variety, as one can shift between offense and defense pretty quickly! using the same character! Destructive items are limited by the fact that they cost a lot of ""blocks"" to build and take awhile to do so, discouraging griefers from just spamming bombs as they would have to gather the resources  to break blocks by digging a ton first.Only nitpick I have right now is the time it takes to find a match, but that's presumably due to the game being in beta and weekend-long windows that the devs have been leaving for public testing. It's also a bit difficult to use the weapons in combat as there are no bots one can train against to help track moving targets, so it's reccomended you bring your 1337 tracking skillz to this game from other games.Overall, a very enjoyable and chaotic game!

												If you're thinking about buying the pre-release, I highly recommend it. Not only do you get the game but some AMAZING skins and ace of spades. Jagex may have made some mistakes in the past but they're really bringing it back with BnL. This game gets tweaked  and updated so often and they are always adding new things, like how  recently they added 3 new characters. Also, there are loads of things to come such as new maps, characters, and even gamemodes!What I like about BnL is that you can play really casually or you can go hardcore if you want. Also, it's not violent compared to other FPS' and has a lot of variety. Like their motto says, no game is the same, and this  is completely true. BnL is a like a mix of TF2  and minecraft. What more could you  want  from a game?			"

Enough different characters at the moment to keep you going but i would like to personally see some new ones or even ones that are not given the same abilities as the others to make them special and unique.Overall i would rate this game 7/10 and its great entertainment for great value.If you buy this game you won't be dissapointed , come and join me i need people to play with.What the block you gonna do?

												For £10 it's a very top game for it's money, but because it costs £22... well you know too exspensive.Pro's-Awesome concept and idea and works very well in practise-Looks very beatiful-Block physics are very very cool-Classes are pretty original by now but there abilites go well witht he classes and are cool ideas and look good-GUI is actually really decent-Soundtrack is also very good-Effects are very artistic and look nice in there cartoon fashionCons-Plays slow and badly paced most of the time-Movement is really horrible, as said on another review it's like sticky custard. You can jump and feel the momentum but one block will stop that moment making the game feel sluggish and damn bad. (MAJOR FLAW FOR ME)-Some unbalanced classes (Nail shotgun uselessly weak vs mostly all other hero weapons)-Map does not get destroyed as much as i'd like.Good/ish things-Maps are bland looking but that works well for building on.-Art style feel everso slightly all over the palce. (Super cool looking cartoony effects, with a blocky works, and with decently high detailed characters feels like an odd mix of content)I recomend for £10-£15 not any higher i'm sorry even with all the pro's it just feels slow and slugish.

												Note: Beta key user from website, then bought full game.To get your free beta key visit: [https://www.blocknload.com/signup/]This game is NOT a pay to win (so far) the only thing paying money gets you is skins. There is a forum on steam by the VP / Studio Head going over some of these concerns: [http://steamcommunity.com/app/299360/discussions/0/626329820802521208/] Buying the full game after owning the beta key will presents you with some orange warning text when purchasing, ignore this, this is because the version of the game you recieve from paying is the same as the beta key version:[https://steamcommunity.com/app/299360/discussions/0/626329820654746292/?l=finnish]   (scroll down a bit)Overall i highly recomend this game, it is similiar to the combat and overall design and feel of TF2 with its class based multiplayer and team play aspects. i have seen many people complain about greifers and trolls but i have yet to encounter anyone ingame who has purpousley gone out of their way to achieve this. Really love this game as it combines aspects of minecraft, TF2 and isnt just a 'brute force' game where you can just rush the enemy team; class balancing is generally good but it really depends upon team composition and experience with that class.And for the low low price of £15 you get the full game on release, a skin pack and woah....A FREE ACE OF SPADES BATTLE BUILDER....*just ♥♥♥♥emed*TL;DR Great game, shows promise, not p2w, unnecessary Jagex hate, overall 8/10 with potential.

												THIS GAME IS NOT ACE OF SPADES!People have been  mad at jagex for the things they have done in the past, such as ace of spades, but Block n Load isnt that. Unlike ace of spades, which felt like a crash grab, this game feels like they put their hearts into it, its oozing with character, everything is so colourful and bright. Each class has their own purpose with diffrent blocks and abilities and stats, the classes are also brilliantly desighned, theres ninjas, robots, rambos, crazy scientists, and a sterotype italian. They all have skins which are quite wacky and make you stand out. They are all wellbalanced (maybe the ninja is a bit strong.) The game play is like a mix of Awesomenauts(A MOBA) and Minecraft,(First person builder) The objective is to destroy the enemies core, and defend yours, you have to build defenses, plant traps and modify the terrrarain so you get full advantage of it, you have to communicate though with whose defending and attacking or it will be a short round. Only problems ive had with this game is the friendly fire and the trolls, if you have a jerk team mate he can plant tnt onto your core and ruin everyonelses day, if you dont defuse it in time, Theres no punishment for being afk aswell, and its hard finding an oceanic server, luckily N American servers work fine.

												Hello and I'm writing this review because why not I have 50 hours on this game and feel like I'm eligible to review it.What I like about Block N Load:Block N Load I feel is a great game for being free. It is a really fun game to play with friends super easy to pick up and has a nice learning curve that can let you get dozens of hours of fun with friends. The game is great to play with friends who have cruddy connection (Danish friend plays with me on NA servers and gets like 150 ping doesn't really have much lag issues).The community isn't bad(probably because most of the kids that play don't know that there is voice chat)It is most definitely not pay to play because the only stuff you can buy are heroes, and you can get enough in game money to buy everything if you play around 100 hours. The only few things I would like to see changed is: 1. More content(I know this will come with time)2. During build time I would like there to be a middle ground where you can fight the enemy over an objective/buff that you can keep fighting over throughout the game (I play Op ""juan"" and some maps I don't do much during building phase).

												This game is absolutely fantastic. As someone with 1000+ hours in TF2, it feels like a very similar style of shooter. However, this game has an absolutely incredible level of depth and strategy that TF2 lacks. Conversely, however, the point-and-click aiming skill of many shooters is less prevalent in this game, though still very much present. All around, it is a fantastic game by one of my favorite developers, and it is well worth the price.			"

												The devs wouldn't even reward 300 platinums (300 platinums is the LEAST in tourney pool and it's not even real money) to potential winners (some are already winners if you can count the scores) of the Winter League which they ""hosted"" and left to the players to tend to which they canceled NEAR THE END with excuses like ""It didn't seem right to host a tournament before the game was balanced"" and other nonsensical excuse...Worst of all, they actually dropped a bloody game changing patch right before the tourney and got the cheek to say, ""Oh the tournament wasn't balanced so we'll just end it right here right now.""I wouldn't recommend this game just because you can't take the devs for their words seriously...and I can't even imagine what they'll do for real money...Unprofessional to the core...

												9/10The game is what is says... a unique fpsbut first off... this is not minecraft...while it might look simular, you can only place 7 blocks (6 that you can choose, and 1 based on the class you chose out of 5 classes), and their main purpose is movement, attacking, or defending. you are not building just for the sake of it...if you whant to compare it to a game, you would have to choose tf2 (with simular class, gameplay and weapons system), or battlefield 4 (with is's destructable enviroment).while it is a little repeditive, the game requires teamwork and strategy that makes it compelling to win.there is a little lag at times, but it is currentley still in beta so this is expected.~ajcres			"

												I only tried this because of Runescape.Still have to get my cosmetic outfit in runescape. (yes i played 5 matches)First of all, the game hasn't enough appeal. Itlooks like it's made for children and once ingame i actually think it was made for a lower age.The gameplay has nice twists BUT i love sneaking and tunneling but it sucks that it takes so damn longbecause once you get to their core it's mostly game over for you.So basicly the game is a bit too fast when you want to sneak and too slow when you just run and gun since it can take a long time to finish a round.The graphics aren't top notch but look alright.Controls feel a bit clunky at times specially when moving faster with the ninja.Animations could be done a lot better imo.i'd recommend this game for the time being but i don't think it'll last very long.Other than that, it's xp waste while you play runescape >.>			"

On my stock laptop that I use for video/image editing and such, I can get a solid 30fps on maximum graphics! The gameplay is to be reckoned with as every game is unique and fun in its own way, and it can be fun for either team wether they are playing offence or defence!With a couple of new Heroes, maps and blocks, this game could reach the top of my favourite game list! (Yes I actually have a notepad file with a list on it 0.o)TL;DR... Great game, now get in the fight Blockheads!			"

												I voted Yes, but I could easily vote, No, for this game too because Negitive- the game will have a Leage of legends feel to it, for example if you are new and there is 4 very experinced player, they will probly hate you and they will report report report, if you do the slightest thing wrong and just makes hte game unfun. - Trolls/grifers spammers the useal- No kick system for AFKer's, doesn't replace a player with another player, if player is dissconnected etc etc...- only 5v5 not any higher- Sholud have a better kick system- Team mates take damage from other team mates, leads to trolls etc etc..Positive- Very fun building and destroying blocks - Great leveling system overall - Great idea for player skins for each charatar - Would be fun to play with friends- Solo is fun too, also depends on the people- Has a competitive mode which will be fun - The class's for each charater you pick is very fun, you can be a, tank which is a heavy, healer which can also shoot posion, and 2 other DPS's which they all have the qunaue abilitysOther things- If you are comming from the game Ace Of Spades, its kinda the same, but with higher graphics and diffrent game mode. the game mode is like the orgial Ace Of Spades.This review can be outdated over time depending on patches etc etc.			"

												I love this game. This game is gave me so much entertainment, and everything about it was pretty refreshing. Honestly the few hours I played of it with my friend was some of the most fun I've had in a while, and we were excited to start playing with otu third friend who had started downloading it after we realised how fun this game was. And then it all fell apart.Turns out you can only make a ""squad"" of yourself and one other friendfor matchmaking. For some reason, it's you're not able to join up with more than that one friend and go play some games online. You can create custom games, but they take ages to fill up, and it's no where near as convenient as normal mathcmaking is. I still don't understand the decision for this really, I guess it's something to do with skill control, and making sure than a bunch of randomers don't get pitted against some tried and tested group of people, but stil.... this decision is stupid, and it means I gotta pick a friend each time I wanna play with some and just have some fun.

												I was a beta tester for Block N Load, so I've been playing it since the very beggining, and to be honest, there was nothing wrong with the pay-to-play version. It feels like Jagex realy took down the game's quality in an attempt to make this game more widely available. I mean, we used to have all heros and the only problem I can think of is a semi-long que time, not to mention the fact that most people had to pay $30 for this, and are only compensated with a $10 premium package. But with the addition of having to buy heros, perks, and other things, it seems that this once great game is going to freemium purgitory. However, the game is very innovative and fun, especialy if you're a fan of minecraft or TF2. overall, I would give this game a 7.8/10 for the new updates. Please Jagex, if your reading this, make some sort of change for everyone who is very dissapointed, who bought the game and are now disgraced by the fact that they have to share a que with unskilled free-to-play players who only make the game that much more frustrating. I would recomend something like a server for premium members, or even better, a remake of the origional.			"

Bad, or most people have that view) The developers have fixed the issues with ""Ace of Spade"" and packed this into a fun shooter ""Block N Load"".The game is smarter and requires a balance of skill, tactics and teamwork to win a game!

Then my game went fluid, I got more and more hang of it. Now I'm glued to this game, almost all my spare time I have, I spend on this game.It's a game where you can be creative, strategic or just stand on a ammobox launching rockets.It's tons of fun, it's balanced with ONE exception.

												This game. Just playing it for a few hours, and I'm HOOKED!Characters are an interesting bunch, each of them with their own abilities and special buildings. Also, some voice lines are really funny. Sure, some characters take time to learn, but the game is always about team effort and composition.The stages are enjoyable, comprising of small ones with 1 cube to big ones with 3. A lot of them also have good spots for hiding e.g. respawn pads in enemy territoryWhen it comes to matches, they always differ from one another; for example, I could end up with a bad team in one match, losing really badly, and suddenly have a skillful one in another, winning with a big margin.I'd say, this is one of the most unique FPS games I've seen. And since it also became free-to-play, there really is no restriction on playerbase. Friendly hint: go through the tutorials before playing to get familiar with the mechanics			"

												This is a very interesting game. It takes MOBA style objectives in order to win, FPS style shooting, Minecraft style building all bundled together into one game. When first entering a game you have 5 mins to build with blocks. The goal of the game is to Protect your ""cores"" while attacking the enemy's. Within these 5 minutes you have to build fortifactions, and maybe a setup to build into No man's land. When this time is up the barrier that blocks you disappears and you attack. Every character is uniquely designed weapons wise. The medic has a gun that arcs balls, a robot with a chaingun, a soldier with a m60, a hunter with a sniper (scopeless), a ninja with shurikans, and an engineer with a shotgun. While these characters are interesting I do have to admit certain guns are directly more powerful than others. The sniper rifle can be used in CQB and is generally better than the Medic's ""bubble gun"". In certain times it can even trump the shotgun that can only be used in close quarters. While the chaingun does do fast damage. With that said maybe these classes aren't right for me since I use cogwheel the robot tank mostly. With all that said, this game plays well and is a lot of fun.  However I came along with some issues.Number 1: The game can be VERY slow. As in the two teams just defend and no  one tries to make a move. I've been in many hour + games.While this is mostly the player's fault, it can be resolved with a timer ticking down or some sort of penalty.Number 2: If you get stuck with a new player, you lost. The game has a video explaining what to do, and it doesn't explain well. A hands on tutorial would be best to fix thisNumber 3: If one person leaves, you are at a serious disadvantage and have a way greater chance at losing the game. Like issue number 1, this is more player's error, but can be fixed with a severe penalty. Leaving a game because you died once is no reason to make your team lose.Numbner 3.5: There are as many AFKers as people that leave too. Once again, have a penalty for AFKing, or make it easy to report these playersNumber 4: This game is no way worth the price it's being asked. It's a fun game, but not a $30 fun game. Making this free to play with skin sales or making it atleast $15 cheaper would make it worth it. At least what I'm shown isn't worth $30Currently playing the beta, I'm going to recommend this game as it is tons of fun as a free game and I completely respect that it's a game in beta. However if these issues aren't addressed, I can't recommend it. With all that said the biggest issue is the pricing point + the ingame marketplace where you must pay for skins. With that said, this game can be very interesting with time to come.			"

												I've put more than a little time into this game, and I have to say, the developers listen to the fans. The community routinely bounces ideas off of them, and they very often implement their suggestions. If someone's OP, they fix it.Additionally, each character has a serious amount of depth to them. Personally it's taken me dozens of games to get competent with a single character, and even then you still learn something new every game. Would definitely reccomend in its current state as a fast tactical shooter best enjoyed with friends.8.5/10			"

												This game has a ton of content. Nine characters, somewhere in the range of 15-20 maps, and each character also has a selection of different building blocks/traps/explosives/etc. they can pick from. Each match feels different due to the variety of approaches you can take such as tunneling underneath, planting a respawn pad behind your enemies base and having your entire team flank them, or just blowing everything up with a rocket launcher. The only downside is the small community, which makes it hard to learn or find tutorials on advanced techniques such as the best cutting locations for each map (where you cut the bottom blocks of a large structure to make it fall down and earn bonus blocks for your team).

												This is a quick review, summs up my short playtime of this game, and the things you will see if you start playing.This is a class based voxel FPS with the building style of minecraft and a similar class system to a mixure of LoL and Team Fortress. Each week, three characters are free to play, and during that period, they cost less. Currently there is around 15 characters.The gameplay is simple.Two teams of five, drafted with the matchmaking system od LoL.Few minutes when the teams are blocked from each other, this is the time to construct your defenses and set up a special offense strategy(like digging a straight tunnel right under the surface, just to place a respawn pad below the enemies base), then the game starts, time to shoot each other, destroy the enemies defense and base, while defending yours.You need teamwork, much.Most people of the growing community understand that, but there are some kids raised on CoD and BF, who think their defense is supperior and everyone else just blocks them(some kid actually started remowing my turrets and radars from the places i placed them, just to get angry when i rebuilt them.), or think they will win the match by running and gunning(no, that does not work).The graphics are good, for the style of the game, but it has pretty big requirements.The sounds are good.I have only encountered one bug, when i, with the sniper class killed 3 enemies in short range combat with my revolver, because i did'nt take any damage until i was in prone.You get XP and money VERY slow, which might be annoying to some people.That goes for the game in overall, its kinda slow.The devs are amazing, they give the players every opportunity to express their thoughts, and they actually listen.There are some problems, like the game is very much based on offense right now, and there are some very OP ways to win(digging a tunnel, building over the map and stuff like that.So thats it.A good but still developing game of its kind(compared to many abominations), with a developing community, some bugs, and somewhat high requrements.I would say its worth a shot, its free after all.Beause its still in development, this might change in the future, but right now this game is just amazing.I give this game 9.5/10. TRY IT! I KNOW YOU WANT TO!!!			"

												9/10Very great game with great mechanics. Honestly, I find myself playing it more than any other game on my computer and I have at least 50. It doesn't take a high performance computer to play. I play it on my laptop with 40+ FPS.There are interesting characters and skins. The many blocks, gadgets and defenses are absolutely awesome. There's a very tactical method to the game. If you just go in blindly shooting, you probably won't get far. A lot of the time you have to sacrifice kills for winning.Over-all, I love this game. A very beautiful blend of FPS and Minecraft (not in a bad way at all.) The only issue is some minor pay-to-win elements but it's nothing to be too concerned about. Just needs some balancing, in my opinion.			"

												WARNING!: Steer clear of this game if you live in Australia. There are almost no players currently playing this game and I write this review as I wait in a queue. Do not get me wrong, at the time this review was written, I have accumulated over 26 hours and I thoroughly enjoy the game but the queues are just too damn ridiculous.Just be cautious of this when purchasing the game...EDIT: Game is now FTP. This could fix the lack of games and it's free now so there is no risk trying. Check out the game because it's pretty fun.			"

												-Not much people playing. Usually takes around 3 minutes to find a game.-F*cked up economy. You can donate to get characters fast, or you can grind for hours and days to then buy a character that you may not like.-Poor balance.-Microtransactions. You want a cool skin? Well, too bad `cuz you're a hobo, go ask your mom for money, or something.+Interesting gameplay.+Many characters or so called - ""Heroes"" (14) "

												I personally loved this game, though there is so much it needs to work on.Pros:-Interesting gameplay-Really focuses on teamwork-Interesting characters-Not pay 2 winCons:-Matchmaking is crap, you are a lvl one sarge against a expert team of yetis and juans ( Plus tony and the occasional pro sniper or doc )-You earn way too little gold per match for 3,000 gold heroes  ( i am talking 75 or 50 per match )-Some classes dominate, others suck.Otherwise, it is a amazing game with solid gameplay and some hilarious traps and walls.

												PROSNo pay to win mechanics only paid skinsNice selection of characters and three play stylesUnique game play not like other shooters you can build and shootMatch making is quick, balanced and it's easy to get into a matchMax of 3 people in a party so no 5 premade stomps if you go soloSimple game to learn but a hard game to master at high ranksRuns on low and high spec PC'sGame devs communicate often and updates are frequent including balancingMap editor and custom gamesCONS Low level and early play can be very frustrating until 10-15 hour markCommunity is strong but needs more players (it's not dying though 1500+ a day)Better choice of paid skins most of the skins aren't very excitingSo I'm re-writing my review now this is Free To Play, I was a paid player however the game was dying due to lack of players, I'm glad it's free because there's now over 1500 active players daily on Steam and the game is in a much better state! Firstly unlike a lot of free games here's no pay to win which will please lots of people everything is unlockable over time apart from the skins and cosmetics which you need real cash for. Paid players who bought the game before it was free get character unlocks and skins as a reward for buying the original. Block n Load in my opinion is in the top ten best free to play games on the Internet or Steam. It's primary a shooter but has some Minecraft building mechanics and 5v5 game play like a moba which I'll explain below.This game is simple but great though you need to get through your first 20-25 matches before you start getting team mates who know how to play and want to improve and learn the meta. Early on people clearly have no idea how to play, they troll a lot and argue and make stupid decisions which lose matches quickly. Low level players think they are playing team deathmatch game and generally do stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥so expect 10 hours of frustration before the game comes into it's own.  Once you hit match 25+ or above half of those lowbies carry on playing and get better and the others leave. Things get very fun once the competitive players remain and only the core community who understand the game are left.Matches in general can last between 10-30 minutes and some occasionally an hour when teams are very well matched on the bigger maps. I love jumping on with a friend or two and found teaching new friends to play was nice and easy as there's a tutorial video and you can make custom games. What I enjoy most about Block N Load is some games are a long tactical slog where as others are rush rush rush and lots of killing and carnage with a quick win or defeat. One match you might be dug in on a stale mate and others you push early and gain the upper hand for a quick victory.Block N Load certainly feels like a moba mixed with shooter mechanics and Minecraft block placement. It's matches feature 5v5 gameplay, choice of loadouts, cool skins and there is a kind of meta for each champ some are attacking and others defending play styles. There isn't any minions or skill trees like you'd get in a moba but your base is effectively the nexus or objective.As you can see from the pics and vids it uses Minecraft like voxel graphics and engine which suits it nicely. It runs very well and is stable I never experience disconnection from their servers or get lag at all I've played ona 4mb connection and my home 70mb fibre. The combat is first person shooter like where you shoot other players with a small selection of weapons and fit out your character with perks and building objects but the moba element is basically two teams attack and defend each others cubes (Nexus) trying to destroy it to win.Think DOTA/LOL but without minions, no buffs and there's no number based combat or pointing and clicking. Just a side note I have never ever seen a hacker on this game either!So basically to explain a match or the core game play a you get a build phase/resource gather phase which is normally 5 minutes to prepare your cube defence. After that a shield wall goes down and you battle until one team loses all their cubes (some maps have more than one). There's not much else to say it's build then fight and then either win or lose. Games can be pretty intense and action happening all the time. My only complaint is the game should force at least one player to play an engineer or defensive class as sometimes you can lose a match in character select and build phase if no one on your team can build decent walls, traps or turrets. The game can be won or lost in hero selection and in build phase if a player disconnects or leaves they are replaced very quickly, this is a great feature.Block n Load is the best voxel based builder and shooter game out there!

												This game was fantastic in beta and even more fantastic now. Its a great game to play with your friends. If you want to have fun and just mess around and build i dont recommend this game for you but if you want to get competitive and work as a team to win this is a perfect game to you. Some people think of Minecraft the first time they see it, why you wonder? Probably beacuse you use blocks and you build with them. Minecraft and Block n Load are like two different worlds. Minecraft go creative do whatever you want. In Block n Load you can be very creative but in a different way. Maybe in minecraft you build a really nice castle you and your pigs can live in while in Block n Load you build a strategic base with maybe cool traps and defences. Before you buy Block n Load you probably wanna find somone to play with. It can get a bit repetitive at some times but there are many different maps and actully alot of events with maps and new playable characters in a limited time. Dont judge from if i do a thums down or thumbs up. I recommend the game to people who like strategic, ""creative"" and wants a game to play with your friends :).			"

												This game was pretty good. I mean the added extra stuff and they were keeping it in a pretty safe place. Now it's F2P and I don't think it's going to last a lot of time. I'm giving this a positive grade since the game was really good before F2P and I would love to see it leave the devastating F2P era. You can see from my hours that I do have some knowledge and I know the game well enough to judge it. No, I'm not buying platinum bars, I'm sorry but I bought the game when it was 13E so no, I'm not willing to give anymore money, instead give me the chars for free. I know that this F2P thing is to attract people but Jagex you already had the demo, wasn't this good enough?Overall this game was pretty ok, if they remove the F2P (which is obvi the same thing as the demo for people that didn't buy the game before + they have to spend 10E in order to buy 3 characters and also each one of the new chars costs 8E , *are you out of your mind?*) I think it's going to be more stable since it will attract back older audience. Prepare for trolls and little kids everyone, you've been warned.			"

												Actualy liked Ace of Spades. Figure I'd give this a try too. Launch game. Get all set up with character and watch loading video. Hey, looks hopefull! Click lanch game. 25 mins later it queus me into a group. Ok, new game with small playerbase I figure. Lets see how it plays. Join ingame, figure out how to procede to gear out my character with zero instructions it gave before hand, not too bad you can figure it out I figure. Players start harrasing other players who couldent figure it out fast enough... Well, there are allways gonna be a**h**** in games, nothing new right?Finaly get in match. Start building up defences... Fall to my death because teammates are leveling everything.... Well, at least there is block physics right!?Start building again with bumpers to jump up high. Teammates start placing blocks to block bouncers....  ok..Start to play game, typical fast paced shooter. Nothing new or out of the ""norm"" of other games. Linear maps that force player interaction which is good. Team gets rushed with in 2 mins. Surrender on screen and team surrenders. 25+ mins of waiting, over in under 8mins (including 5 mins of initial build time). Get to scoreboard. Figure, ""Well, it was just a bad round, happens in anygame, lets try again!"" Ok, so how do we get into the next round? Looking... Looking... Looking.... Seeing everyone ""discconect"" one by one... Realize, you don't get another round! You don't requeue... Only one button, return to menu to start this ""fun"" series of events over from the begining.... Well, that's enough of that. The way it seems now, this game is not gonna get enough player traction to go anywhere. Then, noticed the price they will try to sell this for... I would have been dissapointed at the $9.99 mark. But $30.00? WOWZA. GL to this game. In its current state, its gonna need all the luck it can get. Final verdict. Get the beta for free and give it a try as long as you can bear it. Perhaps things will improve as time goes on, as is the point to Beta's. If nothing changes... I wouldent even think of spending money on this.***TAKE 2***If you would like to hear how the second round went, scroll to the top of this review and re-read.			"

												PROSNo pay to win mechanics only paid skinsNice selection of characters and three play stylesUnique game play not like other shooters you can build and shootMatch making is quick, balanced and it's easy to get into a matchMax of 3 people in a party so no 5 premade stomps if you go soloSimple game to learn but a hard game to master at high ranksRuns on low and high spec PC'sGame devs communicate often and updates are frequent including balancingMap editor and custom gamesCONS Low level and early play can be very frustrating until 10-15 hour markCommunity is strong but needs more players (it's not dying though 1500+ a day)Better choice of paid skins most of the skins aren't very excitingSo I'm re-writing my review now this is Free To Play, I was a paid player however the game was dying due to lack of players, I'm glad it's free because there's now over 1500 active players daily on Steam and the game is in a much better state! Firstly unlike a lot of free games here's no pay to win which will please lots of people everything is unlockable over time apart from the skins and cosmetics which you need real cash for. Paid players who bought the game before it was free get character unlocks and skins as a reward for buying the original. Block n Load in my opinion is in the top ten best free to play games on the Internet or Steam. It's primary a shooter but has some Minecraft building mechanics and 5v5 game play like a moba which I'll explain below.This game is simple but great though you need to get through your first 20-25 matches before you start getting team mates who know how to play and want to improve and learn the meta. Early on people clearly have no idea how to play, they troll a lot and argue and make stupid decisions which lose matches quickly. Low level players think they are playing team deathmatch game and generally do stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥so expect 10 hours of frustration before the game comes into it's own.  Once you hit match 25+ or above half of those lowbies carry on playing and get better and the others leave. Things get very fun once the competitive players remain and only the core community who understand the game are left.Matches in general can last between 10-30 minutes and some occasionally an hour when teams are very well matched on the bigger maps. I love jumping on with a friend or two and found teaching new friends to play was nice and easy as there's a tutorial video and you can make custom games. What I enjoy most about Block N Load is some games are a long tactical slog where as others are rush rush rush and lots of killing and carnage with a quick win or defeat. One match you might be dug in on a stale mate and others you push early and gain the upper hand for a quick victory.Block N Load certainly feels like a moba mixed with shooter mechanics and Minecraft block placement. It's matches feature 5v5 gameplay, choice of loadouts, cool skins and there is a kind of meta for each champ some are attacking and others defending play styles. There isn't any minions or skill trees like you'd get in a moba but your base is effectively the nexus or objective.As you can see from the pics and vids it uses Minecraft like voxel graphics and engine which suits it nicely. It runs very well and is stable I never experience disconnection from their servers or get lag at all I've played ona 4mb connection and my home 70mb fibre. The combat is first person shooter like where you shoot other players with a small selection of weapons and fit out your character with perks and building objects but the moba element is basically two teams attack and defend each others cubes (Nexus) trying to destroy it to win.Think DOTA/LOL but without minions, no buffs and there's no number based combat or pointing and clicking. Just a side note I have never ever seen a hacker on this game either!So basically to explain a match or the core game play a you get a build phase/resource gather phase which is normally 5 minutes to prepare your cube defence. After that a shield wall goes down and you battle until one team loses all their cubes (some maps have more than one). There's not much else to say it's build then fight and then either win or lose. Games can be pretty intense and action happening all the time. My only complaint is the game should force at least one player to play an engineer or defensive class as sometimes you can lose a match in character select and build phase if no one on your team can build decent walls, traps or turrets. The game can be won or lost in hero selection and in build phase if a player disconnects or leaves they are replaced very quickly, this is a great feature.Block n Load is the best voxel based builder and shooter game out there!

												This game was fantastic in beta and even more fantastic now. Its a great game to play with your friends. If you want to have fun and just mess around and build i dont recommend this game for you but if you want to get competitive and work as a team to win this is a perfect game to you. Some people think of Minecraft the first time they see it, why you wonder? Probably beacuse you use blocks and you build with them. Minecraft and Block n Load are like two different worlds. Minecraft go creative do whatever you want. In Block n Load you can be very creative but in a different way. Maybe in minecraft you build a really nice castle you and your pigs can live in while in Block n Load you build a strategic base with maybe cool traps and defences. Before you buy Block n Load you probably wanna find somone to play with. It can get a bit repetitive at some times but there are many different maps and actully alot of events with maps and new playable characters in a limited time. Dont judge from if i do a thums down or thumbs up. I recommend the game to people who like strategic, ""creative"" and wants a game to play with your friends :).			"

												I was a beta tester for Block N Load, so I've been playing it since the very beggining, and to be honest, there was nothing wrong with the pay-to-play version. It feels like Jagex realy took down the game's quality in an attempt to make this game more widely available. I mean, we used to have all heros and the only problem I can think of is a semi-long que time, not to mention the fact that most people had to pay $30 for this, and are only compensated with a $10 premium package. But with the addition of having to buy heros, perks, and other things, it seems that this once great game is going to freemium purgitory. However, the game is very innovative and fun, especialy if you're a fan of minecraft or TF2. overall, I would give this game a 7.8/10 for the new updates. Please Jagex, if your reading this, make some sort of change for everyone who is very dissapointed, who bought the game and are now disgraced by the fact that they have to share a que with unskilled free-to-play players who only make the game that much more frustrating. I would recomend something like a server for premium members, or even better, a remake of the origional.			"

It has the perfect blend of building and fighting as well as well thought through characters and abilities. This game should be one of the most popular on steam.

It makes it hard to remember them all, and the fact that they have personalities is good, but not if you make heaps of them.			"

												Love this game, incorperates a suprisingly detailed and strategic foundation for such a simple looking game, the atmosphere is light and not too serious yet it caters towards thinking not mindless point and clicking. Different characters, different abilities, all having their own unique playstyle,movement animations,weight, size.  dialogue. which is something i find very refreshing when playing with some good friends with good team coordination.Teamwork, or atleast communication is absolutely essential for having an effective outcome and it encourages players to tailor their strengths to compensate the weaknesses of their teammates and vise versa. metas are starting to form and deform as this game gains new players everyday and its a thrill to observe.I highly recommend this game for anyone who likes to put their reflexes to the test aswell as their creativity.

												I'm not an FPS gamer, but this is what they should be in my reckoning. Fun, funny, made up of layers (as in ""not just mindless killing""), and with ever-evolving experiences. No game is ever the same, as the developers were so keen to point out. You can play the same map many times over, but the building (and destroying) element of the game allows for infinite strategies. Of course, you have to figure out which ones are the most effective...The heroes you can play as are diverse, with their own amusing dialogue and weaponry, and the gameplay is intuitive.However, the one problem I have experienced is the occasional lack of teamwork. For example, the start of the game can be awkward when you prepare your base and don't know which blocks you should put down because you don't know what kind of base your team wants.Even so, this game is a gem. I mean, what's not to like about running headfirst into the front lines with mortars blasting away, or sneaking underneath the enemy base to pop up with a surprise attack as you prepare a camp nestled in the lion's den, or perching atop towers in the ultimate sniper stake-out as you take potshots at the enemy with healing stations and ammo supplies trustily keeping you alive?Just...download it. You'll see what I mean soon enough!			"

												It's fun, but it's hard to get into a match because on average only 9/10 players will 'accept' the match and you'll have to go through the system again. (and again, and again, and again.)			"

												I'm not an FPS gamer, but this is what they should be in my reckoning. Fun, funny, made up of layers (as in ""not just mindless killing""), and with ever-evolving experiences. No game is ever the same, as the developers were so keen to point out. You can play the same map many times over, but the building (and destroying) element of the game allows for infinite strategies. Of course, you have to figure out which ones are the most effective...The heroes you can play as are diverse, with their own amusing dialogue and weaponry, and the gameplay is intuitive.However, the one problem I have experienced is the occasional lack of teamwork. For example, the start of the game can be awkward when you prepare your base and don't know which blocks you should put down because you don't know what kind of base your team wants.Even so, this game is a gem. I mean, what's not to like about running headfirst into the front lines with mortars blasting away, or sneaking underneath the enemy base to pop up with a surprise attack as you prepare a camp nestled in the lion's den, or perching atop towers in the ultimate sniper stake-out as you take potshots at the enemy with healing stations and ammo supplies trustily keeping you alive?Just...download it. You'll see what I mean soon enough!			"

												A decent game combining tf2 and ace of spade, but it falls a bit flat.1) you have no characters to start off with. You get to use 3 characters for free, in a cycle (think league of legends). This doesn't do anything but make the characters you got good at disapear until they're back in the cycle or you buy them with either a) in game currency htat takes a while to earn or b) your own money. This is stupid. It doesn't add anything to the game and just messes up what could be a fun free-to-play game. I want free to play, not fee to pay.2) no single player with bots. this means if you have bad internet, don't buy this game.3) as of this review, there's only one main gamemode - classic, in which you defend your core and attack the other teams core. it need a capture the flag mode or something else to make the game better.4) respawn times feel a tad to long, with them being between 10-15 secconds usually, it rips you out of the action and makes you just sit there5) needs better server selection and more server capabilities. look at tf2 with its excess of server type, with different add-ons and plugins that make the game last a lot longer.6) skins can only be bought with real cash. your money takes ages to get anyways, let me buy a skin for my characterall in all a decent free-to-play game that sadly falls flat 7.5/10, would reconmend but because its for free and has a decent concept behind it			"

												I have not yet put 100 hours into this game (at the time of this review) and I already have over half the availible characters (aas of 2/16/2016). The economy in this game is fantastic, it is not P2W, and it is not a super hard grind to get gold either. There are personal missions that reset every day, with rewards for completing them either fully or partially. This game is also a great game to play for fun, as its comical nature and easy-to-learn play style make it an enjoyable game for anyone willing to play. This game also doesn't have many trolls, as there is not much for them to do to harm their team, lest they be subject to the working report system (yes, it actually works). If you are interested in playing this game or want to learn more, please either check out the Block N Load website www.blocknload.com or watch the character videos in-game under the characters profile, as it greatly helps you to learn how each character works. The community is, hands down, the best player community I have ever played with. If I ever need help, I ask either in team or all chat and I get actual responses to my questions, not some troll spamming chat with 'Darude - Sandstorm' All in all, I rate this game 11/10, would play over and over and over again.

There is a high skill ceiling and due to so many variables like different characters or maps just as the trailer suggests - no game is ever the same. Even though some classes are more powerful than others the developer team is constantly working to balance the game. 10/10 <3			"

												great game 10/9. but didn't know what to review so instead i made this peanut butter-chocolate cookie recipe.INGREDIENTS1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, (spooned and leveled)1 teaspoon baking soda1 cup peanut butter (smooth or chunky)4 tablespoons ( 1/2 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature1/2 cup packed dark-brown sugar1/2 cup granulated sugar2 large eggs1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract8 ounces semisweet chocolate, cut into chunksDIRECTIONSPreheat oven to 350 degrees. In a bowl, whisk together flour and baking soda; set aside. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat peanut butter, butter, and sugars until light and fluffy. Add eggs and vanilla, and beat until smooth. With mixer on low, gradually add flour mixture, beating just until combined. Stir in chocolate chunks.Drop dough by heaping tablespoons, 1 inch apart, onto two large baking sheets. Bake until golden, 13 to 15 minutes, rotating sheets halfway through. Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool. "

												This is a great game... But if they added a better ranking system it would be even better! like a gamemode where you just play for fun and dont lose ranking points and then a ranking game... I think this would make this game a lot better :P			"

												I personally loved this game, though there is so much it needs to work on.Pros:-Interesting gameplay-Really focuses on teamwork-Interesting characters-Not pay 2 winCons:-Matchmaking is crap, you are a lvl one sarge against a expert team of yetis and juans ( Plus tony and the occasional pro sniper or doc )-You earn way too little gold per match for 3,000 gold heroes  ( i am talking 75 or 50 per match )-Some classes dominate, others suck.Otherwise, it is a amazing game with solid gameplay and some hilarious traps and walls.

												Okay, i am a huge tf2 fan and play minecraft when i am bored.. But you didn't ask this, no you didn't, but that's what's the wiki says: '' ..takes a bit from Minecraft, a little of Team Fortress and mashes it together..''.But the trailer of the game says ''no games the same''.So, which is right? Well i say NO game is EVER the same. TF2 is a gem and games that say they are like tf2 are just saying they a multiplayer objective based FPS with a cartoony style. TF2 is so much more than this, you could give a thousand more tags.This is not minecraft ethier, minecraft has a very strong indie style and is very customisable, this game just uses the block mechanic and there are a thousand games that do also.So what makes Block N Load not like any other game, it's because of its way if posing the matches, the way you have a build time and you need to defend and attack . But what some people may criticise but i think is what makes the game awesome is gold system and the way you buy heros and level up and get perks, if these systems weren't in place i would have played 1 round and went, this is because i play to level up and get enough gold to get the next hero or a new perk it's great and keeps you coming back for more because when you unlock a new hero it's not like you got a new skin or new rank you now have a WHOLE NEW playstyle to play around with.I love this game and unlike most new multiplayer FPS’s there's always a match running for you to jump right into. Download for FREE now and make sure you block and load.Have fun!! "

												my search is FINALLY over!i have been looking for a multiplayer game that i haven't gotten bored of and that i could find fun for a while. i saw yesturday that block n load went free to play. i didn't buy it because i never found any matches in the beta and i wasn't sure if i'd enjoy it but now that its free to play i thought i'd try it. turns out its fun.matches can be a pain to find but at the time i'm writing this review it takes me up to 3 minutes to find a match but usually it doesn't take that long. the reason it takes so long is when you find a match you have to click the accept button and some people don't know how to do that by the looks of it.who ever says it takes a long time to find a match OR that block n load is pay to win is full of♥♥♥♥♥♥ it doesn't take long to find a match and the ONLY thing you have to pay for is skins EVERYTHING else can be earned by playing the game.also people who own a tropico game might get a skin of el presidente from the game for block n load. i tried the beta but the skin i know i have looks too much like el presidente from tropico to be a beta reward so i think you have to own tropico to get it. by you have to own tropico to get the skin i mean 3 or 4 (those are the only tropico games i own) but it may be for all the games OR theres a VERY small chance it could be for playing the beta so if anyone finds out which it is let me know!

												This game is choc-a-block with cool features. It’s like playing and FPS version of Lego! The shooter part is pretty classic, and if you are into other FPS titles, you'll enjoy this game already. But it has so much more to offer than that! This game is highly tactical: you need to protect your base and find the best way to breach enemy defences. Each character has a role to play and can contribute differently to the defence of your base and the destruction of the enemy. The game is great fun and I definitely recommend it. Thumbs up! "

												Saw this trending on steam over weekend and tried it out, had tons of fun and bought it after free play period ended.While its only one game mode (several maps) the amount of things you can try on defense and offense has kept the game from getting stale for me so far.  Classes all feel pretty good, engineer specifically feels like a defense only class due to short range of shotgun and repair secondary but i guess thats to be expected somewhat.Pretty high time to kill which is a nice change of pace compared to most modern shooters.  Shooting and movement interaction is somewhat unique, you can move across map and up ledges very rapidly though you move very slowly while actively shooting, seems to simultaneously make positioning very important for the shooter while allowing enough fast movement for others to close into better range quickly, and also allowing for rapid escapes.  Its somewhat unique but i think the system works well here.Even if not a shooter player at all, the building portion of game is just as important, and you could just focus on mining / setting traps and not fire a gun all match and still be pretty helpful to your team.

												Saw this trending on steam over weekend and tried it out, had tons of fun and bought it after free play period ended.While its only one game mode (several maps) the amount of things you can try on defense and offense has kept the game from getting stale for me so far.  Classes all feel pretty good, engineer specifically feels like a defense only class due to short range of shotgun and repair secondary but i guess thats to be expected somewhat.Pretty high time to kill which is a nice change of pace compared to most modern shooters.  Shooting and movement interaction is somewhat unique, you can move across map and up ledges very rapidly though you move very slowly while actively shooting, seems to simultaneously make positioning very important for the shooter while allowing enough fast movement for others to close into better range quickly, and also allowing for rapid escapes.  Its somewhat unique but i think the system works well here.Even if not a shooter player at all, the building portion of game is just as important, and you could just focus on mining / setting traps and not fire a gun all match and still be pretty helpful to your team.

												If you're interested, try the Demo; it's essentially the full game sans most of the heroes, which is more than enough to enjoy it. It's a cross between Minecraft, DotA, and Team Fortress, or--if you're familiar with it--a lot like the Source mod SourceForts, except with Minecraft's construction/deconstruction.There really isn't much else to say about it... I just wish the community for this game were larger, as it is an absolute blast to play.			"

												Fun if you play with a few friends. Not sure the $30 price will ever be justified based on what I've seen. Even $20 is steep imo. Gifted by a friend, can't say I would've bought it. Now onto the game. Don't let the animation fool you, this game's not just for kids. There are tons of different strategies you can use and the different classes make for a relatively fresh experience everytime you play. Especially when you have 5 people who have half a clue what to do, it can be very fun. But....- needs a TON of balance work- you can just play as Sarge and spam rockets to win- the tank class isnt even a tank (a mortar cant blow up a sandbag?)- the ninja can spam endless throwing stars- you can't leave a match- achievements are bugged- you can't votekick or replace a player, so an afk usually means a loss- no voice chat, super important for a game like this- too many viable cheap, trolling options for easy, boring victories- map design in general needs work, and more maps addedI understand the game isn't fully released yet, and hopefully the game has an active dev team that is aware of most of this. I could certainly sink some hours into this game. I'd say keep an eye on it, and look for updates/reviews. Personally I wouldn't pay $20-30 for it right now.			"

												At first I thought it was just another low effort minectaft shooter for free on steam that I would play one game with some friends just to mess around. It actually turned out to be pretty fun.  Hero choice and teamwork plays a huge role in the game. There is a pretty decent learning curve. Even casual matches are pretty competitive between teams. Think of it as minecraft mixed with overwatch.It does have some bad parts. The hero balance isnt great. You basically need a tony to do any defense/win. Sarge, Tony, Ninja, and cogwheel are all really good. The rest need to be used is very niche roles to be good.Overall its a fun, underrated game that deserves more attention "

												This game is actually pretty good and it is a good game for anyone with a crappy computer. The gameplay is like an FPS version of LOL which makes it special. The characters are also special and have variety and the perks that you can buy allow you to customize your character a bit.There are some balance issues with the heroes. The ninja is just way too OP (as in the name) and if you have to 1v1 him you know you are dead. His sword and shurikens do loads of damage and also apply bleed which is annoying if you are playing against him. Also Nigel needs a buff as his rifle is supposed to be a sniper rifle but it does hardly any damage. It should at least do 90 damage on a headshot. Anyway, great game with great potiential that i think will rise up in popularity soon.			"

												Hi all,I really like this game, I played a little on free weekend and then bought it. I have about 20 hours at this time and it's great fun. I love how i'm always learning new things with almost every game, there are so many ways to do things that you can always find a way to turn the tide of battle (well, not always but if you play smart you will be rewarded!)I've been in several games where we were about to lose and someone made a brilliant move and we ended up winning by pushing forward as soon as we got the momentum. I've also been on the losing end of those moves haha. We are about to win and all of a sudden we are scrambling because we messed up something or other team made a couple good plays.I highly recommend this game and at under 20 bucks, it's well worth it.

												This game is a very fun, challenging and entertaining game. I think one of the most important things to remember about this game is that it is in beta, sure there are glitches and problems, but thats why you are playing a game in beta, thats why it isnt released. All these people giving it negitive reviews, complaining about queue times, you have to remember that the game isnt released, its not the devs fault if there arent a lot of people playing. At the end of the day, i really enjoy this game, its true every game is different. It totally reshapes your thought process, it is something that we havent seen executed well, and i think it has a lot of potential. If you are having doubts, try it while it is in beta. you will be pleasently surprised.			"

												block n load, a game that IF you played the original which was ace of spades you would probably have 2 opinions of this game :opinion A: your extremely glad to see that the idea of a sand box first person shooter isnt dead and you really want to buy this game :opinion B: your not sure wether or not you should buy this game after the train wreck which was ace of spades. now first of all i want to say this game does a sand box first person shooter REALLY well, to a point where i would call this the first sandbox shooter game in history (that i know of), it has 6 characters to choose from and they are all amazing in their own way's, and speaking of ways this game did things right i personally love the art style of this game, now at first this game seems like it takes alot of its art style from tf2 and i see where that comes from, but in my eyes it reminds me of toy story in the way it looks and feels which is a HUGE throw back that i welcome with open arms, the only problem this game has is that its abit TO team based, so if some A hole disconnects or if there is some guy running round not helping his team then I JUST LOST THE MATCH!, but aside from that the game is flawless in every way compared to the original ace of spades, im soo glad to see that what ace of spades was trying to accomplish didnt die in vain and now block n load is here to make what ace of spades failed to do into a dream come true.

												Easily one of the best games so far this year as your combining the building functions of minecraft and a typical shoot em up. other factors that are enjoyable are the enviroment physics and maps.You may think what are these weird charectors making you somewhat not like it(which i at first didnt like about it but when i did try i i absolutly loved it!+Would recommend to anyone+			"

												In my opinion, Ace of Spades was actually pretty decent... This game makes AoS look pretty bad, haha. This is such a fun game, in my opinion! It is everything you would expect from a voxel-based shooter and then some, with great gunplay and teamwork mechanics. A very solid download, and you really cannot go wrong now that its free-to-play, haha. Give it a try! <3			"

												it's great it takes way more tactical thinking then you would expect from most free to play games it's almost complicated with how many ways you can go about attacking or defending oh how i like the narrator there is just something about him that makes him funny and the characters are pretty good too with how funny they are and there abilities and weapons and unique blocks fit there character theme pretty well most of the time any ways i would say kira has the most out of place block for her character kinda but i would sugest paying this game it's great and hey it's free so why not it should run well on anything it's not demanding i mean look at it it's not that heavy duty looking of a game but at least it looks better then minecraft wich isnt that hard to do but it looks nice nothing so far seems to op honestly			"

												83 hours played in last week. I do recommend this game to all the people who are thinking if to buy it or not. The best is to play with friends or people from forums, who are up to speak on teamspeak or other talking program for the best results !This game requires teamwork and each 6 characters (1 will come out soon, 2 in the future) should communicate with each other and support with its tool, special abilities and other ways, so you should choose 5 people team carefully ! For each map you should choose different tactics if to dig under and blow up the base - or try to infiltrate and create spawning points at the back of the enemy base and rush the cube !Really nice gameplay, easy to play, requires the strategy and coordination together with other team mates. I give 9/10			"

Pros- Building- Character choice- Team Work- Use different strategies- Gameplay- Devs and updates- New mapsCons- Large learning curve- New heroes start gimped (at a disadvantage)- Jump mechanics (Once you jump your trajectory cannot be changed)- Grind for blocks at the beginning of the round- Need more gameplay modes			"

												I bought the game when you had to pay for it and I played it with a friend we had fun thought the game was amazing it was something different that once you knew what you were doing you had a wonderful time. Then soon after, the free to play update came out. I did not care much for the update but what got me was the poor amount of compensationt hey gave for people. Instead of letting us still get all current and future heroes they give us a skin pack and tell us we now need to purchase future heroes. A skin pack does not compensate the amount spent to pay for it. What makes things worse is this attracted the FTP crowd of children that make communities so much worse. These kids jump on anything they can find that looks good and is free to play and just make the community♥♥♥♥♥♥ For example now instead of balanced teams which were easy to coordinate with reasonable people everyone wants to be the sniper and God help you if you try to tell them otherwise. Kids like snipers kids want to be mlg so they pick the kit they think will make them mlg. These kids focus on setting up their little bases to camp and snipe from mostly leaving the core exposed. 90% of games I have played the only person building defenses was me. I would also like to add the complete lack of looking for the objective as all these kids do is go off on their own and try to get as many kills as possible. It almost feels like there is no objective at all other than shoot the enemy snipers. The only way to counter this stupid strategy is to dig under the map and crawl your way to the cores which they NEVER try to defend. This game used to be fun with mutual defensive builds and tactics to get in but now its just dig under the snipers and win this game quickly turned from fun action to how much longer am I going to dig my way through this game. I am extremely disappointed the way the developers screwed over everyone that supported the game when they paid for it and let the community fall to the FTP kids that kill all FTP communities. If you want to play this game anyway after reading the review I recommend planetside 2, first person shooter in which people actually DEFEND THE BASES AND PUSH AT APPROPRIATE TIMES. the kits are also free so save the grind.

												This game is absolute garbage. Just yet another game that when i downloaded it, it was an early access game that you had to pay for and now has nothing but microtransactions. It was fine until it became f2p then a swarm of 2 year olds came to the game and sucked at the game and didn't attempt to give any effort into playing somewhat well. Nobody plays it anymore and anyone who does has either A: bought every character and skin with irl money and just destroys everyone because of the pay to win nature of this game or B: found this game beneath the $20 visual novels, rpgs, and early access ""survival"" games and will soon want to throw their pc out of the window...

												I have played this game throughout its time in Beta, and therefore have formed a few rudimentary opinions. TL/DR: Buy it if you're a casual gamer, but if you hate the thought of losing through things which aren't necessarily your fault, this isn't for you.Firstly, there are many positive attributes to this game. These are: a good blend between building and combat, with what ultimately feels like two substantial halves, some good map diversity, and an enjoyable experience that can either end in 5 minutes of mayhem, or 30 minute long sieges with ridiculous defense lines. Both of these present their own challenges, and ultimately enjoyable experiences.However, the game falls down in both its players and design elements. Firstly, I have found the community to be less than helpful, with toxic players often weighing down games. Beyond this, a lack of rating results in you often being saddled with players far below the average level. Characters suffer from being unbalanced, and the game itself has issues with queue times and a limited pool of players. I think this game has potential to evolve into something great, and would personally say buy it, but given Jagex's record, dont expect them to listen to community advice anytime soon. Either way, if you're willing to cope with a sometimes toxic environment and losses you feel cheated on, this game is worth it's modest £10 price.			"

												Underated game of the year.This game is a lot of fun and its graphical style is appealing.The way this game can drop you in, allowing each character to make a difference is impressive.The game is a lot of fun. Every game leaves me wanting to play a bit more. The only downside to this game is the smaller community. At the time of this review, averaging 1200 players a day. I feel this is a mistake by the community as the game is actually really fun and free. It deserves more light than it is seeing.There could be some balancing issues, but I am too new to know if that is the case.			"

												Do like First Person Shooters or Sandbox games? Well then what are you waiting for the download is free!There are quite a few one to two sentence reviews that say this or that but then you look at there playtime, it is usually under a few hours. In my opinion you should have at least 100 hours before you can really see the big picture of this game. Many reviews simply state this game is P2W which is just not true. Anything that affects gameplay can be bought with in game currency that you can earn, you guessed it, in game. Block N Load requires skill and that is something you can't just pay for. There are some cosmetics that you can to buy with real money but like I said right before this it is nothing that affects gameplay. After 200 hours of Block N Load I think this sums everything up...The Good: - Fun and unique combat mechanics for each hero.- Block N Load is visually pleasing even with lower graphics.- Literally an endless amount of possibilities for every match.- Fairly balanced in terms of mechanics and abilities (though some heroes can be a little better then others).- Can run on most computers/laptops considering my old laptop can run it on lowest settings fairly well.- Fully destroy-able terrain with a 5 minute build time (before the other team can attack you). - You can make some cool traps and defenses.  - 3 Different classes: Brawn, Skill and Brains. Each class has their own special class specific blocks along with general blocks that all classes can use.- You start out by not owning any heroes but there is always 3 different heroes (one in each class) that are free for anyone to play (I believe the rotations change weekly or every other). This allows you to try a hero before you buy it.- You usually get little gold (the main currency) when completing a match but quests (daily) and the single player time assault (every week) mode can make up for this.- Once you really understand Block N Load you will learn that is doesn't matter if you lose or win as long as you had fun!The Bad:- More people need Block N Load (Que times can be a little long sometimes).- Depending on your geographical location you may experience lag.- Need some programmers on Block N Load (To my knowledge there is currently just one developer that can only change things like system variables (dmg, health, movement speed, etc.).- Support (aka support tickets) has been slow according to others (I have not submitted any tickets myself).- Matchmaking is not the fairest but that is mostly just because more people need Block N Load.TL:DRBlock N Load is an extremely fun game that I recommend everyone to try out. It has a few flaws here and there but it is more then worth it to give this game a shot!So... WHAT THE BLOCK YOU GONNA DO!			"

			Block N Load is a First Person Shooter that lends a lot of things from Minecraft too. All in all a pretty interesting game that you can find at Steam and especially for this weekend play it for free.

												Surprisingly fun. The moba-style character system actually works to keep the game interesting, and the maps are varied. A game can last anywhere from five to fifty minutes depending upon how competent your team is at building defenses during the preliminary phase. The only problems are the immature and clueless minecraft-playing fanbase and queue times (only about 1k active players). This game would be a blast with a more active community and demographic of ranked mode players.			"

												One of the best games I've played in a while, if you're looking for a cartoony fun and exciting shooter, this is the game for you. Each class has it's own perks and when playing any of them you really lose track of time fast. I'm not quite sure it's worth $20 yet, mainly because the game hasn't received much publicity and the wait times for a game match can be up to 5 minutes depending on what time of day. Overall it deserves a 9/10.			"

												I'll start by saying the mechanics are very good. The digging and building both work very well, and the shooting is fun. I don't think the shooting is anything revolutionary, but it's not bad by any means. The classes feel relatively balanced.Adding minecraft mechanics to a shooter doesn't actually add too much. It's an interesting concept, but there really isn't much it adds in terms of strategy (and it adds very little to shooting). There needs to be so much more done to really be tactical and deep.This game does all those things needed. While the game may only look like a shooter with minecraft mechanics, it uses those mechanics and many others to create a game all about tactics, resource management, and most of all deception.That's a very nice summary, but explaining why the game is about those things can't be done in a paragraph. The objective in this game is to defend your team's cube while destroying the enemy cube. There are so many strategies that both sides can use.Maybe you'll charge in and try to hit their cube with your shovel, maybe they'll have mines waiting for you. Maybe they'll dig under your base and try to disarm your traps, maybe you'll see them on your radar (which you have to set up, and can be destroyed) and dig down to them and throw some grenades in their tunnel. Maybe you'll try and sneak behind their enemy lines and set up a spawner so you can attack from a better angle, maybe they'll use radar to find and destroy it. Maybe they'll put down radars on your base to try and find your radars, and destroy yours, or you'll see them and stop them. Maybe you'll have a teammate set up some mortars and try to get close to call in a mortar strike on their defenses, maybe they'll send in a teammate to find and destroy the mortars. Maybe you'll build a bridge in the sky above their defenses, put a bomb down, and then destroy the block under it so it falls, maybe they'll dig out whatever's supporting your skybridge before that happens (blocks can't just float like in minecraft, they'll basically ragdoll if they're not attached to the ground at least through some other blocks touching it). Maybe they'll dig under your base and place bombs to completely devastate your defenses, maybe you'll disarm them, or maybe you'll turn the huge pits around your cubes into an even more effective defensive structure.There are so many ways to attack and defend in this game, and they give you so many tools to be creative.

												Gotta be honest, this game is just... No. Just no. It's laggy, unbalanced and people even saying the TF2 name beside Block 'N' Load is just a complete insult (Even with the state TF2 is in currently). On paper combining Minecraft with an FPS might of sounded good and interesting, but thats on paper, when you bring it into actuallity, It's just straight up dumb. Even on paper it sounds pretty dumb. But when I first got this I went like ""This is gonna be dumb and gimmicky"", it sorta was, but it was still fun for a bit. But then the game got changed, Just like TMQFEL (The Mighty Quest For Epic Loot), They completely changed how things were. Completely ignoring ""Don't fix something if it isn't broken"" and the game suddenly got laggy, too many heros, unbalanced, and just it lost what it was, then they give some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to people who already bought the full game with real money with some♥♥♥♥♥♥as skins just like Evolve, showing they don't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about their audience.Overall my experience for this game was promising but as expected current gen developers don't give a damn about the audience or game and seem to be a bunch of idiots. Just... Don't get this game for your own good, even if it is free. It's a waste of memory space.			"

												I really do like this game, however unless you have a full squad with your friends or something you are pretty much garuanteed to have 12 year olds on your team that have no clue what they are doing. If you are a competitive person like myself, you will have a hard time enjoying this game. Also there are many people that just spam the chat since there are no restrictions. Once again if you are competitive like me - I hate to lose lol - then you might have a hard time enjoying this. I do really like the game, and think that when it grows and gets more people above the age of 12 then I will enjoy it more, however at the moment it is either AFK's, people that have no idea that there is even another team, and spammers. I recommend it because I see the potential that it has and can't wait for a little bit better community.			"

												I was actually surprised by the game, I thought it was just one of those P2W games with hard to understand UI however it's not.It's very fun when you know what to do and have friends to play. What is not fun is getting lost and you have to dig yourself up again which is quite time consuming.It'll be a lot better if both the teams had more communications tho. But that's up to the community.			"

												As far as block based shooters go, Block N Load is the best in my opinion.Me and my friends are having a great time with this game. We experiment with new tactics and defenses. We co-operate and talk with each other more often than in any other game. Each victory we get together as a team, makes us more invested than before.I can understand why other people might not like this game. The gunplay is competent, but it is difficult to switch between weapons quickly. Charecters have a small amount of lines they spew out all the time, but at least they say somewhat humorous stuff.My only real complaint is that keybinding isn't compatible with all keys on the keyboard. For instance, I can't bind crouch to shift.All in all, I think Block N Load is a fun shooter, and is worthy of your time and money.Don't forget...Building is awesome.			"

												As I first saw this game I admired the complexity and depth this game offered for a beta.So i decided to stick with it leveled all my charecters to max, dragged 2 of my buddiesinto this game and was very excited as i saw the ed of the beta phase incoming.Then as the beta ended and the new characters got released I was a little bitworried that the new characters would destroy the carefully constructed gameplay systemand unballance the whole gameplay.and they didAstrella destroyed to fast to many blocks, and her doublejump was pretty opSweet Sience´s health regen destroyed any need for the ninjaand Dream Genie was surpriesingly balanced and a great addition to the gameplaybut jaggex turned the car in the right direction and nerfed it all outThen nothing happend and I invested litterly 300 houres in total and spent a great timewith my friends and i found myselfe thinking in class about posslible new characters, talked with my friends about the great sessions we had(fun-fact: my character ideas were an electric themed Alien with a taser, a yetti with a snow minnigun and a chinese dude with a bow and arrow whom were groomed with fireworks)And THEN a new character bundel (over which I crunched again) was on the way with an anouncementBnL is going to be free 2 play and i was shockedAt first I tried to think positively about the free 2 play model,then I read the update thingyemaho where all the updates are written down and i abandoned the game.Because what i read was:-All mylevels will be gone-The game will be flooded by noobs-I cannot play with my friends anymore (!!!)-there are gonna be micro transacions-I will have to buy all the new heros-ALL MY LEVELS ARE GONNA BE GONE ALL OF THE 300+ HOURES AND THE TIME I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT IT""But don`t you worry core community,"" the developers said ""You will get a ""special"" skin which does nothing""What I think they should have given:-A special Titel for playing their game until now-All heros + the new ones/make the new heros cheaper for them-A skin of choice for your favourite character +all the old skins-ALL THE NEW SKILLS (only on level 1 though)What that would have caused would have been a new spark for old and new playersand not an annoyence for old players to clear out the feld for the new onesWith this action they disrespected the core community that stuck with them during their hardest timeof BnL and showed that they dont give a bull about us new or old playersAnd i know that they were short on money and so they moved to the more lucrativ Free 2 play modelbut by showing that they dont think that they NEED us anymore in the new game by reseting ALL the progress made makes me feel disgussedSo thanks for nothing Jaggex I played your game so much that I nearly predicted 2 of the 10,11 and 12 characters of the update.Bye-			"

												I would rate this a 4/5. It is an extremely well done game with thrills around every corner, however the base and cube mechanics leave much to be desired. On a map with multiple cubes, after the enemy destroys the first one it should not be a mad dash to the second one/the base to destroy it before you have a chance to respawn and defend it. A few ideas that could help are as follows:1. The forcefield around the second cube/base will disappear after a time instead of immediately after the first cube is destroyed2. Wall type barrier (Like the one at the beginning of the round) that will fall after a timeThose ideas would make the game much more enjoyable for many people that I know have the same frustration I do.Overall, Block N' Load is an amazing game, but needs some nerfing/buffing when it comes to the bases and cubes.Okay, more ranting and raving from me, thinking anyone is gonna care. I'm going to get right into business now. Yuri. Yuri sucks. Yuri needs to go back to Russia and die from frostbite. Then no one will ever care about his worthless body, and it will juts get packed under layers of snow until it inevitably rots into the waste it is. There... now that that's off my chest, lets talk about why. Yuri's snowballs. They can one hit Nigel (100 health) if he hits a headshot, while Nigel can only 4 shot Yuri with headshots. Let me remind you, Yuri has snowballs, Nigel has bullets. Are snowballs suddenly more effective than bullets? Let's take an in depth look. Bullets are launched using black powder, or gunpowder which can release them at an average of 2,500 FPS (feet per second) or 1,700 mph (2,735 kph) from the barrel of the gun. Snowballs are... well if you don't know how snowballs work, go throw one. So, what Block N Load is saying is that, instead of using guns and bullets in war... we should instead throw snowballs at the enemy? Of course, what have we been missing?! Snowballs are obviously the way to go, and simply put, are better than guns. Alright, let's get the SEAL team loaded up with their new snowballs, that'll scare ISIS. Whatever, I just wanna say that snowballs are nowhere close to the power of a bullet, and it should be represented accurately in the game.			"

												As soon as you start to understand mechanics in the game, you soon realize this game requires great coordination yet provides you with so little tool to coordinate and also balance seems out of window as some characters have abilities such as throwing ""hacking device"" that simply turns all the turrets and traps you spent so much time building into theirs.

												All in all it is a great game. It's worth spending some time fooling around with. I used to play this game quite a lot, but when they switched to free-to-play they destroyed my entusiasm. All we loyal backers who bought the game got was a single skin from Nigel Longshot and all points we had gained over the year of playing was all gone. Heroes had to be either bought up with xp (for real money) or trained up all over again. Fighting one vs one with a unleveled character vs a fully leveled character = loss. Did also not help that you still appear in the top league because of your experience in the game and facing the hardcore players with your now low level heroes. I did not like the new direction and how they treated their loyal players who actually bought the game. At a minimum we should have recived at least one or two of the new characters for free. At a minimum. The game is in its basic fun to play. Chaos and structure well combined. But I do not like the producers any more. They ruined the game.			"

												We were very excited to play this game because it looked like a lot of fun but the 5 of us got on the game to find out you can't have a ""squad"" or party of more than 3 people.  For a 5 vs 5 game.  This is the stupidest thing I have ever seen in a game before.  We all downloaded this for nothing, now we have to find some other game that lets the 5 of us all can actually play together.  Would not recommend this game unless you don't have a lot of friends.  And don't try making more than 2 friends because you cant all play together!!			"

												A fun FPS with a twist.  Choose one of serveral characters, outfit them with different placeable blocks/weapons/etc., and start the match.  You have about five minutes to build defenses on your side of the map, and then the separating wall comes down and you defend your cubes and bases, while trying to destroy those of the enemy team.  Build up turrets and radar and walls for defense, charge straight for the enemy, or be a sneak and try to dig under enemy lines and place spawn points, bombs, and more on their side of the map.  Nearly every block in the game is destructible, so you have a lot of freedom.  Definitely worth trying.			"

												this game is revolutionary game where it doesnt exist before(not that i know of), its not just minecraft texture fps game, it use the advantage of minecraft gameplay and combine it with fps. i really like the beta so far, have tons of fun and the best part is, its not gun aim and shoot, its a strategy game where you need  team work, choise management and defends strategy. best game so far. and i know its beta, it has minor bugs, but the fun gameplay buried all the bugs that it hadand i really hate to said it, its better than minecraft itself!

												  I've gotta admit, Jagex really stepped up their game after the release of this beta. I remember when I used to play Ace of Spades, before Jagex bought the rights to it. I loved that damn game! I was REALLY bummed out that the creator, Ben Akoroy or something like that, decided to sell it to the ♥♥♥♥♥iest company that he could think of. How could you put so much time and work in to the game, only for it to be wasted and absorbed in to the trash heap, and then use the same game, only now it's covered in dog crap? I can confess, I was not thinking of the amount of things that Jagex ♥♥♥♥ed up, RuneScape, and now AoS. Even if you liked the new AoS, who the hell were you gonna play with? Servers on that game were empty, and now it's even MORE empty! I bet I can't even find ONE damn server that doesn't have the game mode ""Classic"" or ""Zombies"", and is full! Yeah, that's how much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t I put up with Jagex. Fortunately, I don't have to put up with that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t anymore.SUMMARY: Good game, has several bugs, but these can be easily fixed with a build or two.PROS: Great idea, good elements (Blocks, traps, etc.), very fun as it's never possible to have a perfect building strategy, and as it states,  ""No games the same"".CONS: Few bugs, voice actor is not bad, but could be SO much better.8/10- The Nerd			"

												The game is pretty good over all, Like people have been saying there are problems such as the FPS being really bad or how theres alot of AFK's and theres no punishment, But since this game is in beta i would give it a chance. Many others have said the gameplay is slow but its all on how you play it with your team. You can either be defensive which will make the game slow or be agressive which will speed up alot. On top of that people have said the price is not worth the game, but later on there should be a different offer to purchase from since as of right now the package you can buy is the "" Block n Load: Fully Loaded Editions"" which comes with not only the game itself but AOS and skins.  My overall raiting for this game is a 7/10, if they can fix minor problems with the game in my opinion it should be a great gameAnd yes the game is made by Jagex which from my knowledge is a horrible company but i think this game is going to be a prety good one.

												Ok here is the complete honesty of the game. It was fun at the beginning but after playing for so long its become a game of these simple things.#1. Almost everyone who is a top player in this game is a hacker, radar hacks, bot aims, you name it they use it#2. I dont know why they even put in a report button because they really dont care what you say its pointless.#3. Games take 10 mins to find and end in 5 to 10 mins.#4. The main thing is spam thats pretty much all people do is spam, its one thing to use what you start with but setting up ammo boxes to just sit there and spam with are a complete bore. #5. With the rank system its become nothing but competative you cant get a decent fun game anymore,#6. The heros are completly unbalanced and they always ruin all the defensive heros by making offense 10x better. There is so much more but you can figure that out if you play it. My say is this im getting out of it because its gone rock bottom was a fun enjoyable game but now its not. This game makes League of Legends so much better and more worth playing.			"

												THIS GAME IS FUN. However the tutorial for this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ This results in what feels like %80 of people not knowing how to play the game. This is a team based game where there are 3 classes and you want a combination of the 3 types to achieve a good team dynamic. However, many people dont understand and dont care that if everyone plays 1 character that they really stand no chance. There is brawn/skill/brains roles and each type gets access to certain types of equipment others dont. brawn gets radars and respawn pads, skill gets movement pads and jump pads and the brains get health and ammo. These thing are to be placed around the base to keep it safe and around the map to get to the enemy cube as fast as possible. Many times there will be 1 brain on your team who doesnt put health or ammo/1 brawn on your team and he doesnt put radars/respawns.This game is great. Its fun and the mechanics are really interesting. However with this learning curve you will find that 8 out of 10 matches will always have 1-2 people who dont help on your team. losing 8 games in a row is a big waste of 2 and a half hours. They dont attack or defend. Matchmaking is also super unbalanced. There are times where you will be going against a party of 2 and a party of 3 with people all over level 100 and on your team have everyone under level 10 unless you have a friend or 2 with you. It's a 5v5 game so when 1-2 people are trolling (or griefing which is common) you stand no chance and just end up screaming at your monitor while the enemy team just spawn camps you and doesnt end the game because you get more ingame money the longer the match lasts.Finally the community of this game is toxic. If you play expect to get called a♥♥♥♥♥♥alot and have people troll you by destroying your teams health and ammo/turrets/defenses then quit out 1 second before game end so you cant report them. The worst part about this toxic community is that at any time unless playing ranked (servers only open on rare occassions) you can only have a party as large as 3. I would give this game a 7/10 but the community is so toxic and ally players are such trolls I would have to give it a 3/10. The game is simple, but people just dont know how to play it and it results in loss after loss after loss. sucks to have 30kills and 5death but your allies more often then not ending with 0 kill 30 deaths 0 items build and 0 team money made.

												When I used to play, it was a bit of fun and a pleasant way to waste some time. No restrictions and a PROPER free to play model where you could access everything barring skins, some of which you could unlock just from playing as a hero for some time. At that point there were only 6 heroes.I come back to the game after roughly a year and all the issues with the game that were present still remain, a bunch of new ""heroes"" (which I have no idea as to why they were even implemented?) seem to fart around doing nothing special, you can no longer use any hero that you'd like to, you're stuck either grinding currency (which is also new) to unlock new heroes or just using the ones that are on rotation (free to use I guess). Previously, if my memory serves correctly, you had access to an array of blocks and utility items which were unique to each hero. (un)surprisingly, you now have to grind out levels to unlock these things which undoubtedly require more in game currency.Don't quote me on this though, I redownloaded the game to play with a friend, got lost in the new and unimproved UI, only played half a game then left due to the sheer incompetence of my ""Team"" mates. As somebody who signed up for the beta quite some time ago, it's perplexing (But probably not surprising) to see how a development team can make something Worse. Should you download Block 'N load? Sure, why not, it's free so what've you got to lose? But as far as I'm concerned it's just a dull, unengaging and a ""not-worth-the-effort"" time sink.			"

												From my experience in playing this game, it may have been just 1 hour, but it was the worst hour of my life. Let's start this off with the servers. The servers are horrid. I had a 23 ping on the server (on average[US server]) and everyone else was lagging around like their getting their internet off of a dead raccoon.The Balance: There basically is none. Leveling up grants you more power basically. So a new player will have no chance of beating a higher level player.  As you level up, you gain access to more abilities such as lower active cooldowns, more uses on your active ability, and so on. And not to mention that you have to be level 6 to get access to change what blocks you can use. That might not sound bad, but here's the thing, those blocks have more heal, plus there's an actual bomb that you can use to destroy blocks. You'd figure that everyone would have acccess to it, right? Nope, you have to be level 6 to get it.  But wait, there's more. One would think that if you're new, you'd go against other new players, right? Wrong, you get thrown in with higher levels, so have fun trying to play a game where everyone who's played longer has abilities to destroy you instantly.The ""heroes"": They're okay at best, but the only way you can do anything to kill enemy heroes is pay to get better ones.On the topic of paying: The game has a P2W (Pay to win) system. You can pay for new, powerful heroes that will just destroy everyone else and there's nothing you can do about it. The IGC (In Game Currency) you get is literally nothing after any match making it so you have to literally grind the hell out of the game to even afford someone new to play. Yes there is a free rotation, but you still have to buy someone to play as no matter what (unless you wanna live off the rotation for the rest of your life). Last words: The game it's self is an ""ok"" game, it's just that all the bull♥♥♥♥♥♥that they just packed in makes it literally unenjoyable to play. The leveling system breaks it, the pay-for-perks system breaks it more, and the heroes that just destroy everyone else just puts the final nail in the coffin. A game may only be as good as the player, but when the game has too many broken aspects, the game is the bad one, not the player.			"

												i dont care for this type of game but it was good enough to enjoy my time. i dont play fast paced pvp type games so i was just here for the runescape cosmetic and to support Jagex.It enjoyed it enough that now that I'm done I asked the kids to get it so we can play together this weekend. It's deffinatly thier type of game. They might buy.Jagex has been around for a long time. Runescape has been around forever and is a skill/combat grind type game. Runescape attracts everyone but it's not for cheaters. MANY botters and real world traders have fallen. There is much negativity.			"

												So, they claim that this is a combination between minecraft and TF2 form the reports that i have recently seen, and i must agree to that because the developers cleverly murged both games into one while adding diffrent textures etc. For a free to play game, this does in my idea need to be a paid game, because the game mode and the way the game works, was obviously thought out, otherwise, this should be a free to play game, but because the makers/developers thought of what they were going to put into the game and asked the community in a way, i really do think this game is great and how they introduce the character.

												Game 10/10Community -1 / 10.Game play is amazing, no p2w stuff. You can get matched in 30sec in EU server and an average of 3 mins for ASIA server.Everything about the game is fun and amazing except the community !Lemme explain why !Match 1 :-A bunch of chinese players. Call us black , tells us jesus made mistake of making black people. Calls us ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and a lot of bad words.Tells us we are ugly and useless n brainless. All this before even start of the game.Moving on to the start, non stop harrassing and absolutely no way of reporting them,unless we stay in the round and play till end to report them. We raged out and ripped them, well techinically, we♥♥♥♥♥♥♥them.Non stop super bad words ...Match 2:- Asks a player to get ready , gets replied with ""SHUTUP ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" , this time it was a russain guy.Match 3: -Chinese people again, more bad words.. I get teamed up with these low lifes....... They destory all my stuff, calls bad words...use all sort of words.. Tells my country is♥♥♥♥♥♥ crap, useless etc...........10/10 would play against chinese ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s again !			"

												I have been playing this game for only a few days and it seems pretty fun. This game has a combination of some of my favorite games such as league of legends, minecraft, etc. This game has it's own unique style which I love a lot. Of course there is a major flaw right now that I do not like about this game, and that would be the limited amount of people you can play with, currently you can only play with 3 people in a squad, previously only 2, at this point I would enjoy this game even more if there could be a total of 5 in a squad. Don't get me wrong, I love that you updated it to 3 people being able to be in a squad but I would see more potential in the game if there were more squad spots available such as 5. The game is great by itself and it will be a really great game if you can play with your friends. For now I will give it a thumbs down for it because I stopped playing it since I can't play with all my friends. Please add more squad members and my rating will surely be changed to a thumbs up. Wouldn't recommend it because usually the people I would recommend it to is my friends and I wouldn't be able to play with them due to the minimal amount of squad members.			"

												Tactics and Strategy combined with creativity at its best.all yous out there who think this is minecraft or Tf2: lol no you are wrongits pretty much Base building games (no, not clash of clans) with a mix of FPS and a bit of Moba.The art of war is based heavyily on this and this game literally says: ""take down the enemy core in anyway. You name it: explode it, dig under it, go above it, throw ninja stars at it, anything to take it down.Characters are diverse and (yes, its official) no game is ever the same. Adapting to your enemys strategy is a key thing in this game and most of the time you will struggle just to find the enemy as they slowly drain the life from your base ;_;A small learning curve with basic controls (rebinding keys for those people who just get comfortable with other controls)and teamwork is encouraged. Give it a try, its quite a good game.TL;DR: its good, get it			"

												6/10 In BetaI enjoy this game very much. I find building the defenses very relaxing at most times, and the offense very intense at times. A couple things do need worked out though.1. Spamming/GriefingI do not come across spammers or griefers too often but when I do it's very annoying. I feel there should be an anti-spam system and possibly a vote to kick for griefers.2. O.P. Juan Shinobi is very overpowered as he is VERY agile and can 2 hit sometimes 1 hit enemies.3. The sniper, Nigel, is underpowered with his primary weapon.4. Not very many maps. The map selection is very slim and they get old after a while.Other than those things the game is good. I just hope that the game does not become pay to win and those problems are fixed. :)To quote another reviewer about defending.  ""you always have something to do and are not just sitting there in a corner with your level 3 sentery waiting for someone to come and take the intel.""I just love this reference.			"

I think it is a very good game and you should definitely install it.The building aspect of it makes it very fun and the heroes are fun to play.			"

												Pretty fun game. But the playerbase feels pretty low at times considering I was in queue for like 10-20min before finding a game. Involved a lot of teamwork and coordination for plays and attacking/defending. The game doesn't seem P2W since the only premium currency is used to buy cosmetics. The only thing I suggest is for casual queueing; I want to queue with more than 2 other of my friends compared to ranked which has up to 5 man queue.			"

												Has Minecraft gotten boring for your 12 year old self? Do you want something different than Team Fortress 2 or Dota 2? Do you want to blow the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the enemy base? Then Block N' Load is for you!Not only is it free, but it's actually good! This is one of the few games that shine in the Free To Play section of Steam, which really says something when almost everything in the F2P section of Steam is complete garabage. In Block N' Load, you and 4 other teammates must destroy the enemies base (Cube) to win, while your opponents try to do the same. Before each round, you choose to defend or attack. Next, you pick your class (You start out with 3 and can buy more with in-game cash which you get from matches) and select your perks and blocks. Before the fighting begins, there is a small setup round which allows you to build defenses or traps around your base. Once that's over, you get to work with your team to defend and attack, blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up along the way as the map gets ripped to shreds. Most of the map is fully destructable, and it's always a great feeling to destroy structures or bring down buildings with explosives.The community isn't too bad, and many seem to be helpful towards new players. Although you`ll still get a fair helping of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in the game. It's very easy to start playing and even easier to get addicted to this drug of a game. Preformance wise, it runs alright on my computer (My computer isn't meant for gaming). This game isn't Pay 2 Win, although paying allows you to get Heros faster, get perks faster, and allows you to buy skins. I seriously reccomend this game, I`m loving it more than a Happy Meal with a Neo pet inside. Go get youself somthin' nice and play Block N' Load.Verdict: 9/10 ""A game where you have these blocks, and you load them""			"

												Pretty fun game its like TF2 and minecraft mashed up into a game. Had the opportunity to play this thanks to the keys given to my esports society in Manchester.TL;DR Pretty fun game with a nice concept but some balancing may still be needed in terms of team composition.Long wall of text here of my nitpicking opinion mostly from playing solo (because giving a review based on a group of us playing each other without a clue of what's going on isnt really a review xD):Pros:Gameplay wise is really fun to prepare your base and see how well it fares against one another. Thinking of creative ways to build a defend from turrents and tikis flanking the cube to underground mines that will leave a nice surprise for tunnelers is really satisfying when you see it working.Attacking is also really fun with multiple revenues of assault. Ive seen various creative ways people attempt to siege ranging from backdoor spawn point assaults to overhead bombing using a bridge which all ends in a beautiful carnage. The reaction on the opponents face when you successfully destroyed half their defenses with a giant bomb from down under is really satisfying.The characters are really unique with each character bringing something different to the lineup (other than Sarge and Cogwheel whom I feel both are more or less the same in terms of weapons and playstyle). The maps are also unique with each map having a different building style to ensure its fortitude.Cons:I would hope there would be more effective long range sieging/front up assault methods. In most cases long range attacks via rocket launchers and etc would just get patched up too easily by new blocks or the turret guy's repair gun.  Playing cogwheel for example, I felt that its fairly pointless to attempt to break the enemy walls up front with my cannon considering the damage will be patched up when I respawn and return to it.Upfront assaults will rarely work too with most of the defense mechanisms shredding you within seconds unless your team have 3 ""Sweet Sciences"" rushing your base which is pretty scary if you're the defense. I would debate that using bombs  are considered to be upfront but as long as the opponents are somewhat decent they would easily spot your attempts and foil it before you could even plant the bomb. I feel you guys should work on improving  long range sieging/upfront method since it's the most generic approach most people would think of and it should be at least somewhat viable rather than relying on sneaky tricks or incompetent defense players.There were also a few moments of server lag which causes everyone to freeze and we had to leave the game prematurely. Hopefully you guys found the source of this issue. Also the number of times I have died from shift climbing a wall into oblivion is countless. Not sure if its just me but I feel there should be a slight pause for whenever you climb using that method rather than continuing to sprint after you reached the top. "

												Ok first yes it does feel like a tf2 minecraft but just for having blocky grapics does not make it minecraft by that logic shouldnt minecraft be lego? Case and point this game is a TF2 playstyle but just because it is like tf2 doesnt make it bad. For example Overwatch is a game comeing out by blizzerd and is already hated for tf2 elements when why does it matter if its like a game. Now that my mini rant is over lets get to the game. The game it self is very enjoyable for me however its hard to get a good team for you end up with people who all play the same people (mainly The Ninja and Robot from what i see.) thats it hard to get a team that isnt just repeats. The best idea is a MOBA take where once a person is a person you cant pick it. Right now it does have some bad people but thats everygame lets be honest. The point people make of ""its a jagex game"" (ive seen that alot) doesnt mean♥♥♥♥♥♥nintendo was doing♥♥♥♥♥♥but now there doing awesome.

												Not another minecraft-like shooter. It's actually full of tactics and well-balanced catchy ideas that may simultaneously remind you of team fortress 2 with it's classes, ace of spades with it's building system, any strategy or tower defense game with the option of placing various traps for enemies before the round. What's also important it's not played like your weapon and character are both made of wood. It has decent physics and dynamics alongside decent aiming and recoil.I haven't played this game much, as you can see. But I can assure you it will be pretty fun, especially with a friends or two on your side. Damn, I sound like I'm selling this♥♥♥♥♥♥ Just try the game if you want. Don't if you don't.

												Imagine this game to be a blend of numerous video games into one. It's a unique design, it's a first person shooter in a 5v5 setting with the sole of goal of protecting your base and its assets while destroying your enemy's base and their assets.The inclusion of being dictate and shape your base is a strong plus for the game.  Destructible environments are in this game and because of that, this game utilizes mechanics similar to Minecraft to create a dynamic environment. You and your team can create strategic ploys to seize victory.The only problem with this game is that some characters are actually useless while there are characters like  O.P. 'Juan' Shinobi that are absolutely ruthless and can dish out major damage, flee, and rejuvenate hp and ammo in moments alongside with being able to just vanish and gain some cover. It's not game-breaking, but pair this with an experienced player and that player alone can probably solo the match. The game needs to be tweaked more for balancing, all classes have their strong points, but there's no reason ever to not use Juan as he is a reliable offense and one hell of a defense character. "

Build your defensesand 2. Defend your location. I am not a player that plays many of these type of games, (TF2 or TF).  I am more of  COOP FPS, (Borderlands mainly) When I considered purchasing a second copy (1st Copy was a gifted key), my opinion changed, $30 for this game, NO WAY, I would maybe pay $20 tops, $10 if on sale, but $30  HELL NO!.   NOT THAT DAM GOOD. Overall, it is a great game, but not for the listed price.  If you got it for free, enjoy, if you want to purchase it, then wait for a SERIOUS price drop, below $15.   "

The game can be very challenging at times if the opposition has a really good setup or if Tony and Eliza are defending. The only cons to this game that I can think of is that there is not a high player base so queue times can take a while and when you are matched, most of the players are still new to the game.

												It's okay. They need to balance the classes a little more. I wouldn't pay for a game like this. If it was free to play I'd consider playing it every once and a while. Matches seem to last anywhere from 10 minutes to 45 minutes. I think it would be better if there was a timer of 15 minutes or 30 minutes. Got boring after a while.			"

												Doc Eliza Doolally is a fun to verse fun to play hero. She utilizes mechanics such as: Tilt Feeders and low elo players. Never have I lost a match since they buffed her already busted kit. Now my winrate is 100% since the patch and I kill people through walls with my chem grenades. Sadly in the height of Doc Eliza's prime my real main Tony has fallen off. He now only  1 shots people and can't 1 shot with turrets. I really hope they buff him next patch. My next character to highlight is Kreepy. He is very fun and requires high skill such as: Jumping over the tallest walls and one shotting every character (Expect for Cogwheel) I am now coming up to my real main. Cogwheel. Or as I like to call him: ""The moving win condition"" 270 health is very fun to verse and I like the way that all defenses explode when he just breathes on them. His minigun has fun mechanics and really gives that raidboss feel. Will he one shot me from far away? Or one shot me up close. Very fun. I love his mortars they really ruin the sense of building together since you grief your teams base for blocks to make enough to be useful with them. My next favourite character is Astarella. She has really fun mechanics  such as: destroying everything that the enemy team did in their five minute build phase and tilts the enemy defenders of the planet. I really love playing her with my 4 other kreepy squad members. Rushing the enemies core has never been so fun. Overall this game is really fun and helped me deal with my hearthstone addiction I now have enough salt in my daily life that Kripp is not needed. Would play again.			"

This is defnetly worth your time but if your a rager and if your team loses then tone it back befor you play. But before i end my small yes or no answer i would try to support this game so its community will get better because as i play games theres always people who leave mid game so just play fair.

												I have played over 60 hours in this game with a close friend and colleague, which we would often play on a daily basis. I am both appalled and disgusted by the negligence of Jegex for the distribution of the version 2.9 'Matchmaking' update which was released on 4th July 2016. Since the Release of this update, neither me nor my friend are able to find or connect to any matches, which was a great disappointment as we are no longer able to play this game which we have enjoyed greatly in the past.It is because of this that I can no longer recommend this game to neither friends nor family, and you would all save both your time and effort by NOT playing this game.

												WALL OF TEXT***********************************************************************************************************Installed it... my eyes started to get tired after a while... So I decide to take a break. Long and behold 7 hours of gaming had past! This game is cocaine on steroids! But... but... but.... but there is a tiny problem gameplay turns stale after a while.You realize you can divide the map into two and force players into awkward entry points that your team has the upper hand.For example: There is a map divided by a bridge-like wooden structure with tons of wooden crates. As soon as the game starts I would go to the part near the trees and make a 2 blocks with hole straight to the water. This makes it harder for tunnelers to simply dig a hole from their base into ours. Next I make a huge hole on top to make sure who ever is above ground has a hard time getting passed and if he does he would have to 1- build his own way into our base or 2- be funneled into our base.So that's it that's how you win that map.Next there is a map with some sort of tower thingy idk hard to describe and another that has both bases separated by 2 bridges.... Both use similar tactics, make a huge hole all the way to the lave (bottom of the map) and defend the cube from above. See where I'm going with this? Once you figure out the best strategy that's pretty much GG.Another map you can dig straight through your base and you find yourself on mid air so you build a bridge that will lead straight to the enemy's base... GG.***********************************************************************************************************TL;DR = Great game but get's stale fast once you figure out the winning strategy but I still think it's a good game.

												This game was great. Was. The new update has turned it in to every single grinding free to play at the top of the steam free to play list. Everybody who played the game prior to the recent update and had any form of character levelling has been reset, you must now pay either in game money, or of course, real money to purchase back your favourite characters, mine personally being the great Tony Turretto, but of course, grinding a game endlessly to make your account stronger with characters, perks and platinum bars is obviously more fun that just simply hopping in to an match with a few friends for a couple of hours and enjoying the game, i do however not have a problem with the game going free to play as more players has always been necessary to this game and of course the more people that play this once amazing and unique game the better, but i find the fact that the freedom of just playing with any character i wanted and the game being balanced so that a new player was on the same statistic level as an experienced player was great, fun and enjoyment was right in front of you as soon as you hit that 'Go' button, but now, a unique game of instant fun and even playstyle has been ruined, and i feel deprived of a great game, which recently, great games have been hard to find. If you love mind numbing grinding for endless hours with little reward other than 'Why don't you pay £6.99 for a booster pack!?' then this game is perfect for you, but if you enjoy hopping in for an hour and having a few fun matches, then sorry but you missed the time for that version of Block N Load.

												What I do I think.... Well from the title defenately steals two things. A Guncraft slogin and ace of spades classic. This is 100% TF2. Somebody, MAKE THE ANNOUNCER SHUT UP! Please fix the Female character model. I think it looks more like a guy or an it to be honest. Does sound barely femine. Making outlandish has been copied a thousand times. The game is overall... Okay... Just make the female sciencist look like a woman, it can still work with the art style, Just not femine enough. Please the guns don't do enough damage! I can see this as a likable game, but the charm here plays off quite bland. Due to having refrences to other games like Guncraft "" BLock 'N Load "" and ""  Ace of spades classic font on the name "". As it worth getting, yes it is to see what Jadex done with the game. If played TF2 YOU KNOW EXACTLY what to do. I am not a big fan of TF2. I can recommend it to you guys, but honestly do not buy because it does not do Justice for a voxel fps no custom content and no hats. Steals Guncraft's slogin which pisses me off.			"

												I had the opportunity to play this game at RuneFest, a convention for RuneScape which is one of Jagex's most-known achievements in its game history, before it was even mentioned to the public. Right then I knew it would be a fun and casual game and not something that requires too much time.The concept is brilliant and the amount of teamwork needed makes it a great game to play with friends. Alternatively, this also leaves you prone to being teamed up with people who could care less and just do their own thing. Luckily, I haven't experienced the latter and have actually seen a good amount of willingness to teach and help players that are newer to the beta.The only concern I have is that Jagex is going to be charging a price for this game according to the description. If this is the case, this game will fail, just as the several games that Jagex has tried to make before it. There is no way I would pay more than $5 to play this game the way it is. It's too simple and too casual to invest more than that. If you want to gain $$$ then add skins (like you are doing) and possible even characters but try to stay away from pay-to-win mechanics (which unfortunately you are also known for in RuneScape, your most successful game). tl;dr Not worth paying more than $5 for, a fun and casual game, has potential, hopefully Jagex gets it right this time.

												Block N Load, is it good, yes. Is it bad, no. Block N Load is a great example of a well made FPS builder. It's not all about shooting and killing, it's not all building as well, it's just a great blend of both. It's creativly made and lets you build/destroy however you like! I personally love FPSs' and this is a game that gives FPSs' a good name. I would recomend buying this. It maybe $9.99 US but it is certainly worth it. 9/10			"

												From what I have played of the beta from their website this is a huge improvement over the previous fps i played from Jagex ""Ace of Spades"". Imagine if you take the previous game, actually have a reason to build due to the build up round, have the classes system from Team Fortress 2 and quite a few block puns. The only thing that may turn you off is probably the £23 price tag since as of this review there's not exactly much in the game but this was only the beta i've played so it may change once the full game releases. So if you're interested in a mix of defense and fps games then this game is for you.			"

												Block N Load has a very steep learning curve so if you want to be really good at the game you are going to have to put some serious time in it... The game is really fun at the beggining tho it can become really frustrating later on if you don't find any friends to play with.There are 3 servers (EU, NA and APAC(Asia - Pacific)) tho only 2 have an active playerbase (EU and NA) for you to play some casual games.Some heroes are easier than others to play and harder to counter if you are really new to the game and it might get a bit frustrating so be carefull, they aren't actually op as you may think.Be patient, make friends and destroy cubes. By doing this you will soon reach the high lvl community and possibly even reaching the god tony status.			"

												The devs bit off more than they could chew, ignored community feedback and generally made poor decisions with changes/updates and took way too long to release a map editor, as well as the game just generally having AWFUL performance and being poorly optimized.  Game is grindy and gets old with huge disparity between bad and good players, no real matchmaking to speak of and not enough players even if there was.  Game is dead and they are moving on to another game while claiming ""player-driven updates"" will keep BnL going.  Well all that says to me is they won't have anybody working on it, and they will occassionally add a player made map to the game.It's free for a few heroes, try it if you'd like, it was a great concept, ruined by incompetent devs, but I don't recommend buying any DLC unless you truly love playing a game with 800 peak players with no real updates or optimizations forthcoming.

												i dont't really recomend the game for some reasons and those are that when  i was queing i got kicked for  being in ques and not accepting when i was loading to the home page becuse it took me 5 minties to get there. before this game was the best but now with all the noob influx it feels that the game wants me to lose all the time by queing me up with noobs or new people when im player level 60 and there level 15s, before i was playing with 50s all the time not on my team but the enemy team as well now i cant find a great player anymore when before i was able to find great players all the time.i also find that im always on the losing team with people who arent that skilled becuse they always cover up the cube even though its the worst thing to do and everyis saying dont do it also that only tools can damage the cube so whats the point is covering it? i will still play but every time i play i go in happy and then come out sad, heartbroken, or just frustrated or just mad becuse how annoying the queing is.

												Positives about Block N Load:* Free to play* Custom maps* Quick to learn how to play* Lots of different characters* Nice custom map servers, which players can host.Negatives about Block N Load:* In game perchases which allows you to get other Characters, which are more powerful, so a bit P2W.* You only start with 3 characters.* Friendlys can get rid of all your work in the 5 minute build time. With a bomb....* Custom map building takes ages. ( I dont have 2 hours to make a map, I do have a life. )* Some characters are op as hell, free characters suck.My Opinion of Block N Load:I would give it a go ( It is free ), but dont rage when friendlys get rid of your work.5/10 because of the P2W and op characters			"

												Could be a fun game if it wasn't ruined by EU people playing on NA region causing serious lag. You can't win when the person you are trying to hit is skipping across the map. Also a lot of the weapon effects don't make sense; Take Doc for example, you are damaged from the splash from the Primary weapon, but the gas nades have no effect on you. Most of the weapons have a range on them; but those that really should don't. The Sniper does as much damage from a large distance as he does if the person was right in front of him. The Bazooka for Sarge has no distance restriction or drop so he can basically stand at the other end of the map at take out defences. The Genie has very little ammo, does very little damage, but takes forever to reload. Her ""bombs"" do no spalsh damage; if it does its very little and random. You might hit right next to the enemies foot and cause no damage, but hit the same spot a 3rd time a cause a tiny speck of damage. There is no balance at all...Only thing this game is good for is to waste time; and if you have a crap computer/laptop since it runs on just about anything made in the last 5 years.			"

												At first I did enjoy this game. It was fun, balanced and intresting to say the least. As I continued to play this game I noticed quite a few this about this game, one being that it is extremely Pay-to-Win, and here's why;You get next to now credits for playing a game of this. You could say that it's like a game such as leauge, but it's not. Then you could say ""do the objectives, those get you credits fast"" to of which, don't, this implys that you either grind alot, or take out your dearest friend, Mr.Credit card, and use him to buy your broken characters.This brings me to my second point of how it's pay to win. Normaly in games like this charcters are strong against certian ones. This game takes it to a completely new level of how one character can take out an entire team (These of course being the extremely broken ones). Some can say play the roation, but none of them are generaly the most broken, as the game wants you to buy that charcter. New characters are generally ALOT more broken then the origonal, there is no reason for it, in saying that, as you could piece together, are very expensive.Also the gameplay itself. It took me a while to notice that this game doesn't have ANY aiming animations. The gameplay is alright but what puts the cherry on the cake is indeed the players. Trying to play this game as a team is the same as cutting off a bunch of chicken's heads and telliing them to stack up in a pyrimid, it does not work for many reasons, one of them being becasue the chickens, belive it or not, cannot communicate with you. People on the game seem to not read chat and proceed to do the most silly things, such as enclosing the cube with layers of cubes, you tell them no, yet they continue to do so.Overall I don't recomend this game, I do understand that it is free, but there are far more better games out there that are free. This game has a wonderful concept but. unfortunatly, not deliver.<- THIS IS MY OPINION, TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT, I AIN'T A GOD ->			"

												This game is FPS. If you are good at other FPS's, you are still nothing in this game.[h] What is this about? [/h]It is about 5vs5 game where you usually want to destroy enemy core cube. There is 3 characters in free rotation, but total of 12 in total to play with in the moment I post this.You can buy characters with either in-game money, which you get from playing game and once-a-day resetting small achivements, such as kill 3 brawn-class heroes or build 3 dynamite blocks. There is also this better money which you can buy with real money, which can be used also for purchasing heroes. Each class also has skins which you can buy with it, but real money makes you no better player than other. Each class is different, and by different I mean by A LOT different. Sniper can only fight seriously from range, ninja brutally murders anyone in melee range and engineer keeps itself alive with turrets. So this game has 12 heroes whose all have this much difference. But each class have blocks, the building is important for all classes. For engineer it is the whole life, but ninja needs ninja nests which he can teleport into with his ability and sniper again can build tiki towers which can work as personal defense, or for greater good, for defending the core. Build, Build, Build.The video in startup of the game tells much. You have to watch it to understand many things in first place, but there is perfect line picked from there:""If you can't get there, go over it. If you can't get over, get under it. ""This game is about strategy. You have to plan how to defend, or you will lose. You will know how to counter a defense to win in first place. You need to know how classes work in order to do anything useful with them or even counter them. Killing only slows enemy team, but never stops them from acting.To this all, you need to know how to shoot. It is important, but it only is only partion of total image.In it's finest this game is a strategy game. I would say it to be mix of Minecraft, Team Fortress and League Of The Legends.To make FPS gamers sad,[h]You need to know these to be good[/h]* how to defend* how to counter as many different defenses as possible* teamwork. TEAMWORK.* knowledge of all special blocks* know how to use class* know all the classes by look and voice, it it important* know how to counter any classIf this didn't scare you enough, well, I can't tell how this game works by typing letters here. You must see it.Not recommended for devoted CoD or CS players. Game is too complex. You need more than gun and reflexes.Recommended for Minecraft or Tf2 players. Game shares many core ideas like 3D building and required teamwork.Must-have for ones who would like to see Minecraft, Team Fortress and League Of The Legends together.			"

												TF2 + Minecraft = Block N LoadThis is a Team vs Team FPS in the style of Team Fortress 2 combined with the building mechanics of Minecraft. It is a really fun game to play if your computer can take it (unlike my own), however i have one problem with the game. I got this game as a beta and was sadly unable to play due to the servers being locked. So i waited till i could play on other servers and played it then. However even though i owned the beta version for some odd reason i now have to buy the game to play it.Update: The game is now F2P and i no longer feel cheated out of a game i barely got to play. Nowi  have no gripes with this game and it will take uo my time.			"

												Block N Load has a very steep learning curve so if you want to be really good at the game you are going to have to put some serious time in it... The game is really fun at the beggining tho it can become really frustrating later on if you don't find any friends to play with.There are 3 servers (EU, NA and APAC(Asia - Pacific)) tho only 2 have an active playerbase (EU and NA) for you to play some casual games.Some heroes are easier than others to play and harder to counter if you are really new to the game and it might get a bit frustrating so be carefull, they aren't actually op as you may think.Be patient, make friends and destroy cubes. By doing this you will soon reach the high lvl community and possibly even reaching the god tony status.			"

												The devs bit off more than they could chew, ignored community feedback and generally made poor decisions with changes/updates and took way too long to release a map editor, as well as the game just generally having AWFUL performance and being poorly optimized.  Game is grindy and gets old with huge disparity between bad and good players, no real matchmaking to speak of and not enough players even if there was.  Game is dead and they are moving on to another game while claiming ""player-driven updates"" will keep BnL going.  Well all that says to me is they won't have anybody working on it, and they will occassionally add a player made map to the game.It's free for a few heroes, try it if you'd like, it was a great concept, ruined by incompetent devs, but I don't recommend buying any DLC unless you truly love playing a game with 800 peak players with no real updates or optimizations forthcoming.

												A really great game, the gameplay is great , it feels balanced and fair, doesnt feel like its play to win.Sadly, the community is not so great...  if you play with friends youre gonna have a really great game , you really have to play like a team because of the building elements, each class and charater has to support each other to be the most effective as each class can be quite different. but if you play the ingame casual youre gonna be lucky if you see someone type anything in the chat once a game or two. most of the time im matched with people that literally dont know what theyre doing, and rarely does someone cooperate. many of the times you play as tony ( an engineer that can build turrets ) people either destroy your turrets ( and it costs you all the bricks you spent on it, you dont get them back for that ) leaving you useless. Other times they just build a bunch of blocks around your base blocks so that the enemies just dig in and hide in there rendering tony useless again.In summary the game is really great and i see great potential in the future,but the community often can ruin your game but we can hope it getts better as the game gets established.and i would like to try the beta competetive ( although the server is online only at designated times making it hard for me to join.(btw im from Europe, yet rarely does someone even understand english in games i join, and sorry for any grammar errors.)

												I highly recommend this game, very fun. I have yet to have two matches which are the same, so the developers aren’t lying when they say that! Unlike so many other pvp games where the only difference between characters is the stats of the gun they’re using.A unique experience, adding a bunch of insidious traps to your base before the match begins is very creative and enjoyable and also important to victory. This is a game where it is actually necessary to have at least one person camp, so if you like lying in wait, there’s something here for you because few people actually seem to want to do so in the game. The characters have a great deal of variety, from ninjas who can teleport to yetis who call down avalanches to eye-talian construction workers with nailgun shotguns who build turrets you’ll not find a more diverse mix of special abilities and unique building components. There are also characters with a more traditional repertoire such as the Sarge, with his machine gun, rocket launcher and grenades or Cogwheel, a robot with high health and a minigun/cannon arm that builds mortar turrets that he activates with his special that then fire upon the beacon for great damage and lulz. Speaking of lulz, though this game has cartoony graphics the humor is definitely more Adult Swim than Disney. Every character is a true stereotype but not in any sort of offensive way. The one-liners are quite enjoyable and reminiscent of impressions of various cultures around the world, often a strange mix of two. The Mexican ninja comes to mind. There are regularly three characters on rotation that you may use to get gold for unlocking a permanent character, and by leveling up these characters you get bonus gold in large quantities, encouraging trying all of them. You even get the bonus for the free rotation characters as you level them. The maps are varied, featuring everything from symmetric opposing castles to green hilly areas that look similar to the backgrounds in the early levels of Super Mario World or Sonic the Hedgehog. If you don’t like a map, you can always remodel it with explosives to better suit your tastes.  You are able to dig into the various parts of the game world to construct tunnels and hidden alcoves where you may place healing/ammo stations or radars which reveal enemies and their defenses even through walls – very necessary to prevent the aforementioned tunnels from getting into your base and providing the enemy with cover and concealment to attack from. The maps range in size from just one base to destroy all the way up to three. There are even challenge maps which are single player and give a great currency reward simply for completion, with extra but smaller rewards for doing so in a shorter time.There is no pay2win - all characters and abilities are able to be acquired without spending money though as tradition dictates, you may buy premium currency to unlock special skins as well as acquire characters faster, but you may NOT use this currency to buy perks. Perks must be acquired using the f2p currency you get from completing matches and challenges, and are more often side-grades rather than direct upgrades as they always remove one stat to buff another, though higher levels of the perk provide returns typically well worth the cost.As a noob, I found myself able to have plenty of fun. It’s rare to run into a team so well organized that their experience allows them to completely trounce you without you even having a chance. This is in part due to the party system allowing only premades of three out of five in the casual mode, so both teams are bound to have at least one or two experienced players and a noob or two or three ;) . The game is very easy to get into, but the skill ceiling is very high. There are always better and more creative ways to do something, and any character may be used effectively for attack or defense, though some seem to favor one play style over another. The colors are bright, the characters are colorful, and mass destruction abounds! Get this, and support a f2p game that is AAA quality and truly is not pay to win in any way.			"

												I love this game. It is a class based shooter where you build and defend a base while attcking the opposing team's base. The classes are divided into brawn, the front line fighters, brains, builders, and skill, high skill high reward heroes. Overall a great game to play with friends. i give it a 8.5/10 for blocky graphics but fun, Great voice overs, and a fps. I reccomend to anyone wanting to have a game with friends, just remeber getting in a server may take 2-4 minutes.			"

												It's a great beta game, could use a lot more optimization. But again, it's in beta so you have to expect it to be under optimized and unbalanced. I usually play as Nigel, the Sniper and I find that his primary weapon (Nellie) is very underpowered. I also feel that the Ninja (O.P. Juan Shinobi) is way too overpowered as it two hit kills (and sometimes one hit KOs) most of the time and is very mobile. So far from what I've observed, the community isn't too nice or educated about the game. Alot of people attack their teammates as they do not know that there is ""Friendly Fire"" and they destroy their own bases and do not know the actual objective of the game. I feel that the game is poorly optimized (in terms of smoothness and FPS rate) but of course, it is a beta. One thing I hope that does not happen is a pay to play or pay to win game, in which you need to buy the game (although I may buy it - if the game is updated and new content is added that makes me want to constantly play the game) or pay for microtransactions to gain an overpowered ability in the game.All in all, it's a good game but it still needs a lot of updating. I definitely recommend checking it out. Sign up for a beta key on their website - it's free! https://www.blocknload.com/PS: Will update later. "

												I'm trying to be as critical as I can.  But this game ROXOZ MY BOXORZ!!!I haven't found anything ever quite so entertaining.  I love TF2 and I love MineCraft but both can get a little dull.  What makes this so exciting is how you can be creative and build defensive (sometimes offensive) items and still get the chance to enjoy some good old fashion kicking your mate in the face fun as well!I am hoping the rest of the world sees how cool this game is and comes to play!XCD			"

												The amount of hacks in this game is just stupid. From aimbots to insta build blocks. The developers do nothing with this game. You can see from a recent post in the forums the stats on the top hackers. Seriously the reason why only 300 people play this game is because of the stupid hacks. When you watch the speed runs on youtube and watch some guy insta build blocks while falling. When you play and a ninja can hit you with their sword half way across the map. Then some people take zero damage because they have some hitbox mod. The new radar range are so limited its almost useless against the people with hacks to see everything. Before you say this is all b$ and this is all made up, look at my playtime. I am always at the number one spot, unless there is a cheater. Even if there is a cheater they still don't usually top my stats. To back up my claimes I will give you some links...there are lots more. I report them everytime yet nobody gets banned, they are on the top of the stat list.

												Most of the time when people talk about the idia a fusing minecraft and a shooter, i just shake my head in disaproval.  people have tried, and most of them have failed. but this game was a pleasent surprise. its a minecraftish shooter that acualy works, and is realativly fun. The microtransactions can be a bit annoying, but if you enjoy the game you can succesfuly grind your way to classes and perks, and the game has a moba style class rotation so that you can still play a variaty of classes. my only complaint is that the game isnt extreamly high activaty so it can take a while to get in to a mach on a bad day.

												In a simple world, this would be a good game however this is not a simple world therefor this game is bad, very bad. This review is coming from the beta however I have participated in many beta's and have not had nearly as many issues as I've had with Block N' Load. So for starters the ping spikes are horrendous, the server constantly spikes from a range of 40 to 600ms during combat. I played on a GTX 970 4GB and an AMD FX-8350 so FPS was not a problem for me, or well it shouldn't have been. Due to the ping spikes, the game ran at an avg of 40 to 80 frames with excessive spikes which caused me headaches. The game itself looks alright I guess, though this is certainly a TF2-Minecraft clone. The stuff that's lacking on the TF2 side of things is proper hit detection for starters, non-split channel team chat, inability to change classes during a game, a very very basic scoreboard, no voice chat, small maps and no satisfaction when winning a game. The game is fun fo about 5 minutes and I'm being generous by giving it 5 minutes because after that it becomes extremely stale, bland and boring. The beta takes up around 2.5GB's and if the full game takes up anymore than that, don't waste the storage space on it. Highly don't recommend this for play ability, I suggest you do play it however so that you can experience the buggy mess for yourself. If the game ever gets a price tag slapped on it, which I believe it will be $30 USD, don't buy this for your own sake. If this were to remain F2P it still wouldn't be worth it because Jagex is surely going to force a P2W model on the game.			"

												Ok so don't get me wrong I LOVE this game but when they made it F2P they ruined a whole part of the game. The Heroes. Half the fun of the battles was testing out the new hero everyone just got (for free i might add.) And the battles were about just playing around not being super serious so you get more gold so you can get another Hero. Also the Hero's cost a truck ton of money basically forcing you to pay if you want to test out the new heroes. Which causes another problem where the people who do buy the new Hero's are way more powerful than the people who don't because most people don't have those people and they don't know their weaknesses. So to wrap it all up this game is great, If you wanna spend Money on it .			"

In a sealable jar, combine instant coffee, sugar, and warm water. Cover the jar and shake until it is foamy. Pour into a glass full of ice. Fill the glass with milk. Adjust to taste if necessary.

												cons:pay 2 winunbalanced heroesm60s beat miniguns?WAY TOO MUCH FALL DAMAGErockets explode 3 seconds after firingunicorns and uzzis = deathstar combomatchmaking is terrible*no vote kick optionterrible community**no skill required just a working spacebar and some money.*how is it that lvl 170s get matched with lvl 5s and then the lvl 5s cant rank up because everyone has unicorn shooters, katanas and really expensive heroes.**people just beat on lvl 20s and lvl 38s and lvl 3s etc, etc, because they think that your level reflects how good you are and not the amount of time you've wasted on the game, so now the low level players rage quite, argue or have no self esteem. People who beat on low level payers seam to forget that they were a lvl 1 when they first started.pros:unique gamerequires teamworkfree to playfun for the first 2 hours or so...uninstall button works great!!!!!!!!!! All hail Gabe for the uninstall option!as of this review I am lvl 49 and have 97 hours in this game from when the game was playable, now its a♥♥♥♥♥♥fest for ocd people with a desperate need for ultimate rage.Summary: game is for iether crazy people with a good spacebar, no actual skill and a ton of money to waste on a free to play game or the casual people who join a match to find themselfs wondering how they got matched up against lvl 183s then get beat on by players who think that they are really good because they spent a few thousand hours in the game and forget that they were once a lvl 1, so now the low lvl players are wondering the map dying from katanas, unicors, uzzis and ESPECIALLY fall damage with a K/D of 3/47 and also wonder why liquids don't flow or how there is no match making system or how rockets explode before they hit anything or why its a destructible map but has permanant blocks in the most random places ever like a pillar holding a up a bridge thats supposed to be destructible or how m60s can destroy robots with miniguns for hands before they get absolutely destroyed by a Bhopping mom with unicorns ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rainbows that explode. So just stay away from this game because it will make you lose your grasp on physics, want to destroy your pc, even buy a custom keyboard where the spacebar takes up half of the whole keyboard, and this game will 100% give you a 5 inch brain tumor.  JUST NO, DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT CLICKING THAT INSTALL BUTTON.			"

												I've only played a few hours of this during the ""Free-2-Play"" phase, but so far, IT'S AMAZING!!It's an awesome game. It requires teamwork and strategy, as well as smarts to get around. The music is upbeat and gets you pumped up to attack and/or defend. So far the people I've met are pretty awesome as well, so it's a nice community, as far as I know.Though, there are some pet peeves of mine in this game(i.e. not being able to move while in the air), the game is awesome overall. It is, also, a mix between Minecraft and Team Fortress 2. And despite what everyone else says about the price tag, I do agree with it. I'll definitely be buying the game when I get the chance. So much work was obviously put into it and its awesome.			"

												Do you enjoy 5-man teams that only allow 3-man premades?Do you enjoy getting dicked on by level 173 players that instakill you with perked-out weapons?Do you like playing a defensive character and inevitably getting your base chipped to death because the rest of your moronic team cannot understand the concept of ""pushing""?Do you like insanely high character unlock costs that attempt to force you to pay real money to unlock characters, as no sane person would grind 18,950 gold to unlock a single character?Do you like playing in games where the expensive characters have a disgustingly unbalanced skillset that deals massive aoe damage while your terrible shotgun can barely kill a single target with a full magazine?Then Block 'n Load is for you! It's like TF2 and Minecraft made babies, except the community is from Minecraft and the balance of TF2 got thrown to the curb.Enjoy the wide variety of a handful of characters, only 3 of which are ever actually playable unless you grind yourself into a coma and spend the gold to unlock a single additional character.Do you like balanced, well made maps? Too bad!Experience CQC ♥♥♥♥fest maps where your only option is to die repeatedly to the 2 enemy ninja players while Eliza instakills everyone on your point by spamming poison grenades that destroy your defenses and erode most of your health. When you aren't playing one of the horribly designed close quarters maps, feel free to experience the wide-open ♥♥♥♥fest maps, where you'll constantly be spammed with rambo rockets and STILL somehow get caught in tons of acid grenades.Features include:--Huge variety of maps, all of which have the same exact meta of ""dig a tunnel under their base and constantly zerg rush the cube""--Tiny variety of characters, none of which are balanced. The cheapest characters are stupidly underpowered and the most expensive characters can take on 2-3 lower cost characters simultaneously--Terrible destruction and climbing physics, which generally results in the map being an un-navigable, overly frustrating hellscape of potholes and deathfalls.And so much more!

												Stay away from this game and this developer. They have got a rotten mentality. They like to take away things which were rightfully earned (read: after the F2P update all hero levels of users who paid for the game were reset, so they have to start all over again).It looked like a great game at first with lots of potential, but it has been totally destroyed by r€tarded business decisions. I'm pretty sure they will screw gamers again in the future.			"

												What I liked about the game were classes, ability to customize your loadout and destructable terrain. It plays like normal fps except you can dig under them, jump over them and set all sorts of traps for enemy team.  Gameplay for the most part is good but there are some bugbears for me. Matches can drag on and being on a losing team for 45 minutes because people refuse to surrender can become a massive chore if you're only one on your team who is not turtling. So your enjoyment of the game is reliant on the team you play with. Playing with random teammates at worst can be a massive chore, since it's really hard to get anything done by yourself especially considering you need to be point blank range to actually do proper damage to the core, and good luck with that if all your team does is turtle.On the technical standpoint I didn't see any massively glaring problems and fps stayed good at all times, Characters speaking same one liners all the time does get annoying and frequency should be cut to half.I feel another thing that might put off people from the game is the pricepoint, I myself got it with 33% discount but I'm not sure I would have paid the full price at 27 euros.Overall a decent game with some annoying flaws from what I played. Might be too expensive at full price point.			"

												The game is a 4/10, and here are the reasons:1. Its Pay2Win, you can buy every hero in the game with real money, and the problem is, most of the times you will need to do that, because the hero's price with normal money is so incredibly high that you will need to play a huuuuge amount of time to get one.2. The Community is Sh#t. And yes I mean  Sh#t	 there are only little kids playing the game and in Europe there are only kids from arabia, or Turkey, and there is nothing wrong with that, the problem is they cant speak english most of the times so you cant really play with them as the game is teambased.3. The Winning&Losing System is a pile of  Horsesh#t	 when you win you get a good (still really low) amount of money, depending on your performance about 100-500 bars (500 if you are really good) and when you loose about 20-120 and nothing can help you here, you supported your team? We don't care, you lost. You killed a ton of players? We don't care you lost. 4. It's really unbalanced, there is the Ninja, which is a REALLY annoying class, and he can do a ton of damage, and he doesn't even cost much. So all the little kids use him to defeat you, especially if you play support you will die from him as he can just teleport away and leave a bomb. And if you play Support/Builder you will not gain anything as you get money mostly from killing.5. You can't really play the game in the evening, or at any time really as there are nearly no official games, and if you join an unofficial game it will most likely end up in spawncamping.The Game itself is good, but the community is really bad, so if you want to play a good game thats like this maybe try Ace of Spades, its probably better.

WTF GAMEPluses : Real sound when you shootCool characters like Science man , i dont know he's name Like the crouch mode .Then , this is like 6/10  , if you will do something with the FPS , the evaluation will be like 9/10.What can i say , i don't know ... i'm not recommending it until the fps is more higher.

												Block N Load is a team based PVP shooter game with building blocks added for base defence. It worked, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok.  Has a tutorial map and video. Has free heroes in rotation. You can earn some currency to buy heroes and perks.  Creative block building and mining can help in defence and offence. Maps have a destructible environment so you can tunnel your way to the enemy base. Has support class heroes. Some heroes are disadvantaged to certain game roles and experienced player will have permanent bonuses. Matches are rather long. Try it if you like games like team fortress 2 and minecraft.For more info:

												Good, clean fun and some decent originality to boot! Great to see Jagex coming out with some new games after Transformers fell through (shame that as TU was looking very good). BNL's block building can get a little too addictive, so much so you can get carried away constructing rather than fighting! Thankfully the start of each match has a period of time reserved to let you build unhindered before you get mobbed by the other team. A lot of promise already, looking forward to seeing how Jagex build the game over the next few months. Great stuff!			"

												Good game, the block building element adds a great angle. My only complaint, which does significantly impact your ability to play is the fact you can't join existing games. You have to find lobby games and there simply isn't enough players to make this work.It's a shame, because other then that it's a good game, but a good game you can't play is a bad experience.Despite this, I still recommend the game if you can find one.

												A minecraft and TF2 knockoff, but probably one of the best knockoffs I've played in a long time.The game blends building and destruction from Minecraft with the modern weapons, graphical style, and gunplay of TF2.  Add on some strategy for the icing on the cake, and you've got Block n' Load.The game stays true to the ""No game's the same"" line, as every time the teams are different, and thusly the strategies change from map to map and team to team.  One time, I played against a five-player team made entirely of Cogwheels.  Other times, the teams can be perfectly balanced and equally matched to the point of one destroying the other's cube as they watch their own cube blowing up.  We BOTH lost!The controls and climbing can and probably will feel clunky to dedicated FPS players, as they're a bit odd.  Optimization COULD use some work, but it was made with Unity, which is not brilliant for optimization.All in all, I would recommend for anyone who wants something a little different in the FPS department.Tony and Nigel FTW!(Sidenote: This is my first Jagex game, I cannot really give a yay or nay about them since I haven't been around for them ruining Ace of Spades and other stuff I hear them getting ragged on about.)

												Block N  Load is a great game.It may be in Beta but it has great gameplay and a big community. The staff are great and are pretty active within the community, which is great because you are able to give your own opinions.If you haven't tried it yet, you should. It is a cross between Minecraft and CoD~ but it has its own uniqueness and I love it.Good Job BlockNLoad Community team and Jagex!			"

												I found that in the matches I played the same tactic always was used. Tunnel down at the start, tunnel from your side to their side, and come up under their feet. Whoever manages the feat first, most likely wins the round. The radar stations aren't large enough in radius to cover enough area leaving blindspots. The matches were hide & seak, until one got below the base. Then it devolves into a brawl. Two games failed because my own teammates sabotaged the game by destroying defenses and creating access for the enemy.Further detriment is the fact that you are stuck with whatever loadout your character has. Once you get to level 6 with a character you can diversify a little, with the additional options that character has, but you are restricted in which blocks you can use by your character. You better like the blocks and weapons of your character, because you are stuck with them. Guy is melee? He always will be, no choice. Guy has no radar? Never will have.Wish I could say I had an enjoyable time, but the matches were filled with toxic players and trolling and the lack of freedom and weapon selections, with no real influence on the loadout, just makes me suggest to avoid this game.

												First of all, fun game. Interesting Gameplay and games never get stale. Next, I'm really dissappointed that the game if going free to play, as I have already paid for it. and even though it isn't very popular- hardly anyone greifs or trolls in the games. I feel that once we hit free to paly, yes, there will be more people, but most people won't even care and just troll the teammates for fun. It's sad to think about. Some people think the game will get better with more people from free to play, I just think the community will get trashed.			"

												A minecraft and TF2 knockoff, but probably one of the best knockoffs I've played in a long time.The game blends building and destruction from Minecraft with the modern weapons, graphical style, and gunplay of TF2.  Add on some strategy for the icing on the cake, and you've got Block n' Load.The game stays true to the ""No game's the same"" line, as every time the teams are different, and thusly the strategies change from map to map and team to team.  One time, I played against a five-player team made entirely of Cogwheels.  Other times, the teams can be perfectly balanced and equally matched to the point of one destroying the other's cube as they watch their own cube blowing up.  We BOTH lost!The controls and climbing can and probably will feel clunky to dedicated FPS players, as they're a bit odd.  Optimization COULD use some work, but it was made with Unity, which is not brilliant for optimization.All in all, I would recommend for anyone who wants something a little different in the FPS department.Tony and Nigel FTW!(Sidenote: This is my first Jagex game, I cannot really give a yay or nay about them since I haven't been around for them ruining Ace of Spades and other stuff I hear them getting ragged on about.)

												Decided to play this, and I will say it does have some competence.Too bad the ♥♥♥♥ing devs couldn't use that to do anything but wipe their asses with it.This game forces SOOOOO much stuff down your throat. It will force you to either:A.) Not have fun,B.) Lose every game,or C.) Pay some money to completely ♥♥♥♥ your progression.This game is about teamwork (to an extent), if you want to defend your base correctly, you'll have to have a man who can place turrets (Tony). If you want to attack the enemy base correctly, you'll need a man who can charge in there willy-nilly (Everyone else). Tony is so weak it's pathetic, his turrets have the worst targeting I've seen to date, with enemies just able to run past their FOV and only lose 20-30 health. And Tony's shotgun takes about 3 reloads to kill a single unit. Now maybe I'm just nit-picking, but let's see what else the game does wrong.When you watch the tutorial video, you are given 1500 ""Gold"", which is a free currency obtained from playing games/completing challenges. When you play and finish your first game, you're given another 1500 gold. Now that you have 3000 gold, you think ""Hey, that's quite a lot, maybe I can pick myself up a new character because I don't like the starter ones?"" and then you go to the shop, click the ""Hero"" tab and see that the cheapest heroes available are 6000 gold. Now you're probably thinking, ""Oh, well if that's the case, I should have them in a couple games, right?"" Wrong. In experience, I only get about 50 gold for losing, 75~ gold for winning. Challenges, some of which are hard as hell, give you about 300 gold. This model is so ♥♥♥♥ing cheap that it's a scam at that point. Now maybe you're willing to cough up some real life currency to aqcuire a character you REALLY want? That'll set you back about 5 American for a single hero. In conclusion, this game will force too much down your throat and reward you with very little if you suck it up. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY NOR YOUR TIME. tl;dr: This game sucks.			"

												Do not play this game. While the free to play model may look nice, this game is nothing more than a pretty troll game. I was able to reach Pro rank easily, up until they reset everyone's rank standing for some weird update to the ranking system. Now I'm being stuck in games where the teammates don't know how to fire their gun or stare at bricks all game. Meanwhile, the enemy team is some three-stack clan that knows the ins, outs, and arounds of every map, every character, every tactic while also spewing at you with toxic and salt-ridden messages.The devs are slow, add useless updates, and don't revamp crucial game mechanics that need it, This game is, pardon my language, a ♥♥♥♥♥how.You'd be better off playing Dota 2.

												I downloaded this game to play with my seven year old. He liked it, mostly because of the goofy voices and characters. However, even he could tell after an hour of play that it was pay to win shovel ware. Sweep this one under a 1x1 tile and forget it ever existed.Just have to add a comment to fellow reviewers. If in your postive critique of this game you mention it is not pay to win and then mention unbalanced character classes you obvioulsy live in a trumptastic world of delusion. If a character is OP, and is purchasable, even if it can be aquired via gameplay it is pay to win. Especially if obtaining that character takes dozens of hours of play. That is the definition of free to play. The lack of balance is intentional as well as the absurd time to unlock without paying all designed to force you to pay. Use some common sense.			"

												Pro's:-Unique gameplay, a first person shooter in a mostly destructible environment.-There is community made maps along with custom lobbies.Con's:-Characters mostly consist of stereotypes with some going a little too far in my opinion.-Game is poorly optimized-Characters are poorly balanced-All characters are locked but there is a free rotation of 1 character per class every week I believe, however only some of the characters cost a fair amount while it could take weeks to unlock others. The higher priced characters are unjustified as they're not better or could even be worse than cheaper ones.-Each character has an obscenely large amount of voice lines that activate at random times which could give away your location and can get bothersome quickly. While you can mute this feature on your end, everyone else can still hear it.-There are custom skins available for the characters, but they're not available to free to play users.I would not recommend this game, there are likely better alternatives. The developer also appears to have abandoned it.			"

												Ok, I've found something. A reason why this was released. Once upon a time, a company called Jagex wanted to make a block-based building shooter, they were about to release it, but being the ginormous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s they are, they wanted to ""eliminate the competition"" so, they did research and saw that ace of spades was their biggest competition, they bought ace of spades and then broke it, so that block and load could be the lord of the block games.

Sniper does basicly no damage unless its a headshot 2. Sarge is op as **** he has long range and short range op weapons 3. builder is so bad at long range (i know he has a shot gun) but he should have some sort of long range attack 4. lots of bugs5.  all heros cost so much 2970 for the basic ones? really? thats something worth WTF6. you only get 50g per round that should be higher example 100 150 200. because as i said all heros cost WAY too much7.

												I feel this game is absolutely amazing to just spend some of your free time playing because there are different heroes (people in the game you can play as)to play as with different powers and blocks its so satisfiying to sit under the enemy base and blow the pathway around it , plus their defenses too! i'd give this game 9/10 because its one of thos games aswell that changed from paid to free 2 play and i gaurantee you you will not have to buy anything to have more fun the heroes you start off with are good enough to keep you playing and earning gold to buy other characters but all in all as i said before 10/10.BUT W8 THE DEVS ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE GAME ASWELL whitch alot of other game devs dont.

												I'm addicted to how fun it is. I lose most of the time, but it's fun.You learn different strategies to do, and the game play isn't a grind. Just played the free version, but I'm getting the game, just because each character has different abilities and play styles. I highly recommend.You may find that people quit when your team starts losing. It's ok, if you're good enough, you might still win. I just have fun playing regardless. btw, mines are awesome, and if tunneling in doesn't work, building a high pathway in the sky that drops in the other person base might. It's a one way ticket in.

												I enjoyed this game Immensely! I only played a few rounds but I had so much fun. Only couple of problems I found was that people on your team can be an absolute jerk and destroy your defenses. That was a community issue I had but my personal one? I signed up for the beta a while back, got my key and entered it in and played. Well, after a while I didn't play and when I finally came back it was on a free weekend. Well after the free part was up I can't play the game at all now.			"

												This is coming from someone who has only played over the free weekend but I assure you in time I will have purchased this quite enjoyable game!In a nutshell, think Minecraft and Team Fortress 2 blended in the best ways possible.Though there are still a few class balance issues and not that much variety in maps as of yet, the level of map customization and the overall FEEL of the game is wonderful.So I very much recommend this game and hope to see it progress and evolve further!

												I have been playing this game for a couple hours and I can say this game is worth your money. This game has strategy mixed with fast paced action. This game gives you ample amount of time to set up your base and matches can be really strategic unless you get a team of potatos then the game can get really bad. If you have friends who are going to get this game tell them to get it this game is much more fun with friends because in normal lobbies your team will sometimes just sit in spawn or just troll you. If you liked ace of spades you will fall in love with this game.			"

												Great execution of the ""shooter-block"" genre, all the controls of the guns feel snappy and effective. Aside from a few strange setups I've seen, most teams are pretty vigilant about at least attempting to defend thier core's which leads to some decent strategic framework to build on. Once the main group of players get ranked and get the hang of it I'm sure this will change and there will be less random building and more stragety once people know where to place blocks etc.All in all it has great promise, lets hope they can keep the playerbase attracted with new maps (hopefully playermade will be added) and keep the classes properly balanced. Buy it and you'll have yourself a great timesink for the foreseeable future.			"

No, the dlcs from back then doesent even exist and all my progress has lost, it feels like a new game plus there are microtransactionsBut without that I still love the game!			"

												Block N Load------------------------------------------------------Once apon a time there was a gamer. This gamer was really intrested in FPS games, epecially free ones. He noticed a strange looking game on the store, and he decided to get it. This game was called Block N Load and really did look great. He won a few games, he lost a few, and he really enjoyed the game. The physics were a bit wonky, and there were many annoying scrubs. But he still liked the fast-paced action. A few days after, he decided to play again. But something was... different, the game kept kicking him, it lagged a lot, and it was just generally broken. He decided to try to join one last game, without any lag or getting kicked out for ""no connection"". (sarcasm intended of course) He accepted the ""join game thingy"" and then the game said he is blocked for a few hours because of not accepting ""many games"". The gamer raged, and decided not to play it untill the next update, or for a few weeks. And this gamer, is still raged writing this review.The gamer would've recommend the game,but now, he doesn't know what to say about it.You know what? Screw it, I'll just recommend itbecause I really liked it.~ MagikalMystery			"

												Absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing amazing! I have sunk so many hours into this game and not getting sick of it one bit. Think Minecraft meets Team Fortress 2. The whole world can be destroyed, build defences or tunnel your way to the enemies ""cubes"" to destroy them and claim victory.Only downside at the moment seems to be the lack of players, especially in Australia as we seem to get some large queue times and have to sometimes play on NA region.

												I've been a major supporter of Jagex for about 10 years now, and when I heard about this game, I figured I'd give it a shot while it was free to try for 3 days after release.I was worried it may have ended up a Minecraft ripoff, but I was pleasantly surprised. Block N Load takes 2 ideas that have already been done (Minecraft and Team Fortress 2) but mixes them in a beautiful symphony of game design, creating its own original style that I've never seen done before, with replayability beyond my initial expectations.It truly is a different experience every game, primarily in part due to the near unlimited potential to destroy and build.Unlike Minecraft, you won't be able to build in bliss, you're always under pressure. In the preparation phase, you only have so long, and need to hurry. In the actual battle, you won't even have that luxury, you'll be building walls, placing bombs, and even establishing a forward base as bullets fly overhead and artillery is tearing apart the world around you, and you'll never know whether or not someone might sneak up on you while you're building and knock your block off (pun intended).As soon as the game's free to play time was up, I immediately purchased it and haven't looked back.The only major problem with the game I've encountered is the fact that my account is level 90 (currently the level cap) and can still get paired with four level 0s, which means certain defeat for your team no matter how good you are. This could be easily fixed by only pairing people of similar skill levels, though the exact method would be up to Jagex.Unlike what many others have said, I have to disagree with the opinions on the overall community. Though there are plenty people who take me back to my Modern Warfare days, it's pretty tolerable, and not TOO common for me to make any major complaints. It could use some improvement, but so long as you're not too thin-skinned, you should be fine for the most part.I'd highly recommend this game to most everyone, and will continue to play, myself.

												I feel this game is absolutely amazing to just spend some of your free time playing because there are different heroes (people in the game you can play as)to play as with different powers and blocks its so satisfiying to sit under the enemy base and blow the pathway around it , plus their defenses too! i'd give this game 9/10 because its one of thos games aswell that changed from paid to free 2 play and i gaurantee you you will not have to buy anything to have more fun the heroes you start off with are good enough to keep you playing and earning gold to buy other characters but all in all as i said before 10/10.BUT W8 THE DEVS ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE GAME ASWELL whitch alot of other game devs dont.

												I'm addicted to how fun it is. I lose most of the time, but it's fun.You learn different strategies to do, and the game play isn't a grind. Just played the free version, but I'm getting the game, just because each character has different abilities and play styles. I highly recommend.You may find that people quit when your team starts losing. It's ok, if you're good enough, you might still win. I just have fun playing regardless. btw, mines are awesome, and if tunneling in doesn't work, building a high pathway in the sky that drops in the other person base might. It's a one way ticket in.

I signed up for the beta a while back, got my key and entered it in and played. Well, after a while I didn't play and when I finally came back it was on a free weekend.

												I have been playing this game for a couple hours and I can say this game is worth your money. This game has strategy mixed with fast paced action. This game gives you ample amount of time to set up your base and matches can be really strategic unless you get a team of potatos then the game can get really bad. If you have friends who are going to get this game tell them to get it this game is much more fun with friends because in normal lobbies your team will sometimes just sit in spawn or just troll you. If you liked ace of spades you will fall in love with this game.			"

												Great execution of the ""shooter-block"" genre, all the controls of the guns feel snappy and effective. Aside from a few strange setups I've seen, most teams are pretty vigilant about at least attempting to defend thier core's which leads to some decent strategic framework to build on. Once the main group of players get ranked and get the hang of it I'm sure this will change and there will be less random building and more stragety once people know where to place blocks etc.All in all it has great promise, lets hope they can keep the playerbase attracted with new maps (hopefully playermade will be added) and keep the classes properly balanced. Buy it and you'll have yourself a great timesink for the foreseeable future.			"

												Block n Load characterizes upon the aspects of a MOBA whilst bringing in building & first person shooter into the mix. Each character has their own arsenal, as well as building materials, that give them their advantages and niche role in the team. Despite taking on many genres, Block N Load actually preforms very well in terms of balanced gameplay and performance.			"

												Now before you go judging this game by its vector style graphics and shouting the forbidden word (Minecraft) take a look at what the game is trying to offer. This game is nothing like minecraft, sure it has the cube like style and ability to build but it is done in a unique way. You start off on one side of a symmetrical map, your primary objective is to build defences around your various ""cores"", after the pre-round timer has reached zero the wall in-between you and your foes will disappear, allowing you to attack them and them to attack you. This is where the games first person shooter / MOBA style combat is introduced, fighting off against the opposing team in an aim to destroy their base and simultaneously defend your own. This game is tonnes of fun and best played with a couple of friends. Although it is not without its downsides, for example how repetitive the gameplay can get or the limited range of classes available, but that being said this is in early access and you should not let these factors deter you from playing it. We can only hope that the developers continue this great work with the players in mind and listen to what we have to say.			"

												Imagine a crappy TF2 with the worst ""building"" mechanics you've ever seen. That is this game in a nutshell. Almost all of the classes are worthless and the mechanics are worthless, except Ninja who can kill anyone else in ~3 seconds. Everyone except Ninja does moderate to low damage (even the turrets are like squirt guns).You can also build throughout the entire match which makes this less strategic and more spam than anything. The combat itself is also lackluster and laggers have an advantage. All in all, this game plays and feels like a crappy clone of a f2p Minecraft style gun game that I cannot remember the name of.All playing this game did was make me remember how awesome Team Fortress 2 is and to download it after uninstalling this.

												Very fun, relaxing game. Fans of TF2 and Minecraft alike will love. Think a Moba, where farming is Minecraft and combat is TF2. Characters are comical and colorful enough to keep it loose, but gameplay is engaging enough to keep it competitive. Open world allows for dozens of strategies, and each map feels unique. Beta can be buggy every now and then, and que times can be long, but overal very smooth for Beta. Would highly suggest for people who just want to some fun for 30-45 mins at the end of the day. 9/10			"

												Just a heads up, I played in the Beta  and it was so much better in the beta than it is now ProsUnqie heros: all the heros are really fun to play, and none of them are copys of echotherUnqie Game: You don't see many Build n Shoot games, and if you do most of them don't last that longGood Teacher: Block N Load does an amazing job at teaching you what it can, but not so much as to overwhelm youEasy to play: This game doesn't have weird gameplay strats that makes it hard to learn, its simple, and strait to the pointCustomisation: you can customize the blocks your Hero uses so you can defend/attack differentlyFast matchmaking: The match making in this game is verry verry fast, sometimes you can even get a match as soon as you press the play buttonCons:F2P: Its a Free To Play game, so of course you have to expect some sort of way for them to earn money""Gold"" locked hero: Since its F2P all the heros are locked by default and they have a free rotation, and when you complete a match, you get gold, if you win you get more gold, this wouldn't be a problem, but heros range from 3k gold, to 13k gold and I get 75 gold every win, this is not counting the daily/level up bonues.Locked block changing: You can customize your blocks, but you need to play a lot and get your account to level 6 before you can do so, this is quite bad, cause not only it is a gimic to get people to play more and more, and they do it by locking of a core mechanic of the game and this is not something a game should have to result to doing.Bad matchmaking: the matchmaking may be fast, but its so bad, its something to laugh at, 1/6 are acutaly fun to play (this doesn't mean a win, even losses can be fun sometimes).un-even matchmaking: the problem with matchmaking being bad is the fact that even though its your 1st or 2nd game ever, you could be matched aginst someone who has a hero that costs 13k gold, or is lvl 6 with their account so they can use blocks you can't, giving them an advantageArt Style: the comicy/childish style of the game is its bigest downside, its atracts childred, making playing the game quite hard because their young minds arn't quite as develped as olderminds, resulting in slower reaction time, and poor judgment.Stupid players: I'm not going to be blunt with this one, its true, even the tho game tries so hard to teach its new players how to play the game, there are always people who will not take the time to watch a 3 to 5 minute video, so almost every match at least one of your allys is either a child or an idoit, so they destory your defences because they think theirs are better, or they are just trolling, or sometimes people don't know how to recall to base (b button), so to get out of a pit they desotry half the pit just trying to get out, or people don't take a few seconds to read a summary of what their hero does, meaning the wound up fumbling about only building basic blocks and shooting with left click.un-balanced heros: some of the heros are just either overpowed, or underpowerd, someone with a minigun can do 20dmg pershot (body shot), while someone with a siper can do 40 dmg per shot (body shot) TL;DR Block N Load used to be a great game, but then it went F2P and in doing so added F2P gimics, making the game grindy, not fun for new players, and hard to find good team mates that don't troll Score I rate this game 4.5/10Its a great game, it can be fun, its a uniqe game with uniqe heros,But its hard to have fun, it has tomany gimics to get people to spend money or play moreand one of its gimics locks of a core mechanic of the game, and the matchmaking makes it even worse for new players, and on top of that half of players don't take the time to learn the game, they just jump in, not knowing how to play or what to do.so the reason for my score is cause it was a fun game, but it going Free to Play forced the Devs into adding gimics that took away more than half the fun, and making the Cons out weigh the Pros please excuse any typos or grammar errors I am dyslexic  "

												yes it can be very fun but some of the matches drag on. today i had a match last just under 1 hour and ten minutes it can be painful playing through them also the fact you have to accept to join a game rather than just auto putting you in the game whilst you queue means i have been restricted from queueing more than once which is frustrating it is a good game that need tweaks			"

												When the Game startet in early 2015 I loved it! It was a great and ballanced game.But there was only one problem....the game had no players becouse it was 40 euros.Luckely the game went f2p and there are thousands of players!!But I bought the game for 40euros and I doesent even got an special reward for that. No, the dlcs from back then doesent even exist and all my progress has lost, it feels like a new game plus there are microtransactionsBut without that I still love the game!			"

												This game is a good idea....kinda. Mixing arguably the 2 most popular games minecraft and any FPS (cs:go, CoD whatever), but it is honestly the most unbalanced, unplayable waste of space on my hard drive. 35 second respawn times.....really....along with maps that are 5 times longer than they should be causing the game to take more than an hour if you are (which you will be) teamed up with 7 1/2 year olds that not only don't own a mic, but don't chat in the chat. I loved minecraft a few years ago, i love cs:go and CoD now, so i thought this would be a great game. it isn't, do not buy unless u want to be destroyed by pay to play premium members whilst you hit them in the face with a sniper 3 times and their health is still at half.

												Block N Load------------------------------------------------------Once apon a time there was a gamer. This gamer was really intrested in FPS games, epecially free ones. He noticed a strange looking game on the store, and he decided to get it. This game was called Block N Load and really did look great. He won a few games, he lost a few, and he really enjoyed the game. The physics were a bit wonky, and there were many annoying scrubs. But he still liked the fast-paced action. A few days after, he decided to play again. But something was... different, the game kept kicking him, it lagged a lot, and it was just generally broken. He decided to try to join one last game, without any lag or getting kicked out for ""no connection"". (sarcasm intended of course) He accepted the ""join game thingy"" and then the game said he is blocked for a few hours because of not accepting ""many games"". The gamer raged, and decided not to play it untill the next update, or for a few weeks. And this gamer, is still raged writing this review.The gamer would've recommend the game,but now, he doesn't know what to say about it.You know what? Screw it, I'll just recommend itbecause I really liked it.~ MagikalMystery			"

												yes it can be very fun but some of the matches drag on. today i had a match last just under 1 hour and ten minutes it can be painful playing through them also the fact you have to accept to join a game rather than just auto putting you in the game whilst you queue means i have been restricted from queueing more than once which is frustrating it is a good game that need tweaks			"

												People may wonder why I'm reviewing a game I've only got a little more than an hour into. The answer to that is simple. The first part of a game is crucial to the whole experience, and the start of this game didn't impress. The review they proadly wear from PC Gamer says ""...it could very well rival TF2 for approachability, quirkiness, and staying power"" This may be true, except the approachability isn't there.    When you start the game you only have access to one of 3 different free champions, and they may mostly be advanced or they may be starter. It's all about when you play the game, and this does work with some games. Which brings me to what I think is the source of most of the problems ""It worked for League of Legends.""    The ""Hero"" system is basically the same right down to the cycling free champions, but it's not as good because League has better assigned roles that are obvious, and 2 skill based heroes can play very differently from each other. This means that starting out can be more challenging because you're playing with things you don't understand. On a side note to this. Why can't I play the characters that look cool? I'm stuck choosing between Mr. fishbowl-head, a robot, and a pop star. All of this combines to make starting the game hard.    It may be fun to play later on, and I'm sure that high level play is awesome; but in multiplayer games players are content, and I feel like I'm being cheated becaues I want to see if I like the game before shelling out $5 for the champion I thought I'd be able  to play from the start. I know that it would be hard to get people to purchase champions if they were free, but here's an easy solution. Temporary/noob heroes. You could let players who have just started have a few free heroes for the first 5 rounds they play, and then after 5 rounds those heroes are accessed the exact same way they are now, but it would prevent a player from having to either be a boring support hero or being unable to due to choosing a cool hero that relies on advanced tactics.    If this was how the game worked it would get an resounding yes from me for being cool and unique and all the other things it does well, but if it's hard to start then it doesn't matter how good it is because not many people will reach the good part.Side note: People say that it has a good F2P model, but it feels pay2 win to me. In my first game I was dominated by a yeti who pummeled me with infinite snowballs, and I know he either got that hero by.A) Spending money to buy him (and as he had a skin that's what I'm guessing got him that hero)Or.B) Playing the game for a long time. Which makes me wonder why a noob got matched with people who have a lot of experience.			"

												this game is terible cons:runs terably on a laptop that an run payday and other games that look better at better fpsnot fun and is just frustraiting most of the teams tunnel under the map andsit and hit the core there is no way to stop that and it needs to be fixedpros:good f2p model but even with this the game isnt funthe characters are fun ish the sniper is decent and they are all balanced but you will pick your faviroutthe cons outway the pros the game is terrible to run and i havnt found a way to fix it. i met one of the developers of the game and he said there was a large comunity and the competitive side was large and good but when you play for yourself the competitive side just seems like it would just be people tunneling under the map  and the matchmaing is pritty bad. over all of jagex could put as much time into fixing these things in this game as they do in runescape then it would be fun.

												Where to start? Well the idea is cool, and that's about it. Little to no community, 2-5 Minute wait times to find a match. The few that are still playing, have such an advantage, its quite pointless for a noob to attempt to start.  All of the characters need a revamp and to be buffed. As the game stands now, I would not recommend it for anyone, unless you want to wait forever, and then play a crappy match. You might not have to spend money on it, but they make it extremely hard for new players to get a grasp on things and or do anything without it. So as I said before, the community, extremely uneven characters, and long a** wait times. Are enough to break this game. Thumbs down for me. This game does have the ability to be a good one, but I feel it needs to goto a company with money and actual time to spend on this!			"

												Game still feels early access.. Some characters are ridiculously op compared to others.The defence aspect of this game is ruined when enemy players can set extremely hard to find respawners next to your base and suicide rush your defences over and over again. (You and your team work together and spend 5 minutes creating an epic impenetrable defence.....one enemy walks in..... Aaaaaaaaaaaand all the blocks are destoried)Another problem with building is that even the most strongest blocks are very weak, this turns the concept of ""Build defences and shoot the enemy"" to ""everyone go full offence and whoever has higher level characters (Cogs) wins""As said before other classes are outright more powerful than others and character to character counter-play is almost non-existant.--------------------------------------------Not worth buying, just buy Minecraft and play defence mods.

												This game has a really good concept of defend the base or attack the enemy's base.Adding the graphics from minecraft and adding a little bit of shaders and great modeling...Gameplay is not linear, you're not a super op guy who can kill everyone by shooting people in one way.There are tactics for defending AND attacking, so that adds gameplay and fun.But the shameful thing is that they dont give you the freedom of using all the characters. I guess it's a reason to buy stuff.Well, is this game worth playing?Yeah.Did Jagex ♥♥♥♥ up again?Keep this question. I don't know. Varies on the person who's playing, if it's a hipster who says ''Ermagerd ace of spades is soooooooo 20.... idk''What's the verdict?I give this game a solid 7/10 for an actual good game that jagex didnt ♥♥♥♥ with.This review is horrible and comepletely uncalled forbatteries not includedWhy are you still reading this♥♥♥♥♥♥thanks			"

												A Awesome Team based game where I get to kill the following:-Mexican Ninja, His ninja-ness AH!-J-pop Singer, She has a thing for cats and Uzis.-A Genie, She likes to call the player ""master"".-Italian Construction worker, Watch out he'll call his third cousin Luigi.-A Texan Talking Hamster, A Rolling ball of Death.-Creepy Killer clown, Don't worry he'll give you his best punchline literally. -German Steam punk Boxer, You'll love the science, it's pretty sweet. (pun! get it because his name is ""sweet science"" Funny right? :D)ETCPros: Game is based on teams building, traps, vision, bunkers and defenses.Different characters, with their own unique weapons and abilities each in one of following three roles: Brawn, Skill and Brains.Brawn Classes: Have radars and re spawn pads that help their team with showing where the enemy is and spawning their team mates closer to the enemy's base. Always in the Front of battle.Skill Classes: that require a bit more technique due to how they fight. but have more traps blocks, such as fake blocks (breaks when a enemy steps on making great for hiding traps), Bear traps, and caltrops. Can be in the middle of battle but also can sneakily take out enemies and trigger traps from a safe distance ( All class can too but skill classes have better weapons for triggering.)Brains Classes: are more of a support unit, they can fight but are more in to defending ally bases and supporting, using their Health and ammo crates to hide them all over the map can really change the battle, Also having Force which let allies in but blocks all bullets and enemies. They are mostly in the back defending off invaders but can sometimes push forward.-Good videos are how to play each character. (except Kreepy the clown because he's newest one.)-Steam workshop maps for custom matches. Cons: You have grind a bit to get some characters but missions come daily which give you a good amount of in-game money every day as matches don't give a lot.-Sometimes Players are new to game or just plain don't listen, and makes people get mad as they don't do their roles.-Players who block the cube in, A term which means a team will build a shell your cube (base), sounds like a good plan but allows enemies to have more cover and are able to hide in the shell.Characters have levels that the more you play them they level up and their abilities become stronger, I don't see this as a problem but some people might.Queue time is a slightly a bit long due to a bit of a low player count.Overall I give this game a 8/10, While this is fun its not all perfect, Make sure your PC can run it and please be a good sport to make the community slightly bigger :3Also WHAT THE BLOCK YOUR WAITING FOR?! GET IN HERE AND BLOCK IN!!!p.s Sorry about my grammar.			"

												This game is so amazing. It makes you feel like you are leading a team, and the best part is setting the traps for the other team and knowing that they're going to spring it. It is a great way of doing battle, and if you are a fan of strategy FPS games, you should DEFENITELY play this one. It's a charm!			"

												I'm addicted to how fun it is. I lose most of the time, but it's fun.You learn different strategies to do, and the game play isn't a grind. Just played the free version, but I'm getting the game, just because each character has different abilities and play styles. I highly recommend.You may find that people quit when your team starts losing. It's ok, if you're good enough, you might still win. I just have fun playing regardless. btw, mines are awesome, and if tunneling in doesn't work, building a high pathway in the sky that drops in the other person base might. It's a one way ticket in.

												I enjoyed this game Immensely! I only played a few rounds but I had so much fun. Only couple of problems I found was that people on your team can be an absolute jerk and destroy your defenses. That was a community issue I had but my personal one? I signed up for the beta a while back, got my key and entered it in and played. Well, after a while I didn't play and when I finally came back it was on a free weekend. Well after the free part was up I can't play the game at all now.			"

												Please listen to my review. I understand that many people are upset at Jagex for their past mistakes. Every company is going to make mistakes, some more than others, But the main point here is that we are all human so is Jagex. So of course they are going to have made mistakes. Block N' Load is a revamp of Ace of Spades and it is perfect. It is so much better than Ace of Spades. The graphics are awesome, the gameplay is awesome, and the Devs actually read your posts and reply to them. I know many people complain that the game costs 20$, BUT IT IS SO WORTH IT AND ITS NOT A PAY TO WIN GAME! TL;DR BUY THIS GAME, YOU WONT REGRET IT!			"

												This game mixes your creative side with your destructive side, and does it in style.I don't recommend running in guns blazing, neither do I recommend camping like that one dude who throws urine at his opponents and slices them up with a Kukri. (seriously, that dude is insane!)If you want to win, you must combine offense with defense, give the enemies pressure while setting up traps and defense to negate some of the pressure that the enemies themselves are giving you. Each hero has a slew of slick tricks and guns in order to keep every other hero on their toes, and if you slip in the slightest; you will regret it dearly. Know when to apply pressure, and retreat to defend against enemy pressure, as this will be an extremely valuable asset to you AND your team on the battlefield.You will see quickly that your pretty N' pristine base that you once thought was indestructible, was quickly destroyed by rockets, mortars, and extreme carnage. Working together in this game is essential, stray away from your team and expect to get blasted by a group and/or whole team of enemies VERY easily. Voice-chat will aid extremely well when working together, and will be similarly good if not better than the teamwork shown within the hero's trailers. Coordination is key!Moral of the Story: You will most likely get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked when you first play, but after the first five matches, you begin to kick♥♥♥♥♥of your own, eventually becoming a very good player and learning the maps, tactics, and strategies in order to win the match(es).So what are you waiting for? GET IN THERE BLOCKHEAD!			"
