												This game is from my childhood, and I loved it back then, and I still do. However with latest hardware, and operating systems, it has rendered this epic game completely unplayable (laggy mouse, low resolution, and crash to desktop every 5 minutes). This should have been re-worked, and re-patched, before being allowed on to Steam. As mentioned on even the positive reviews, Desperados does not work on Windows 7/8/10. At least, not very well. I have reported this to the developers, but my thread(s) were completely ignored, and we have never received any acknowledgement that these compatibility issues even exist, even though they clearly DO. My current issue is a complete freeze up of the game after 5 minutes, followed either by a crash to desktop, or a BSOD.It's a BRILLIANT game, but you will likely be put off of it by the performance issues before you have a chance to appreciate it's brilliance. Save your money, and just pray that the developers fix the issues with W7 and W8.Update 1st Dec 2013: There is a ""directdraw"" fix available in the forums which fixes mouse lag, however the crashing is still ongoing. It seems that patching has stopped for this game already.Update 25th Feb 2014: There appears to be an unofficial work around for the crashing issues available in a stickied forum thread. This is not developer supplied, and edging on the side of caution, I would prefer NOT to download random "".dll"" files off of the internet - especially those hosted on rapidshare. I am unlikely to ever try the fix for myself, and the ""Negative"" review stands, as long as the developers fail to patch these aweful compatibility problems.			"

												This is not a game. This is THE game.I've completed this game at least 10 times when I was younger, and I'm happy to know it's on Steam now. This is on my personal top 3 of the best games I ever played. Good story, good gameplay with a mix of action and stealth, good atmosphere, good locations and the characters have a nice voice acting (In Italian).Anyway, if you have Windows 7/8, I suggest to DON'T BUY this game, because it doesn't run pretty well. Most players say the game is unplayable for who have the newest OS, because there's a drop of FPS + laggy mouse and multiple crashes during the game, but there are some ways for fixing part of those problems if you read the threads in the community hub. So, think twice before buying it!I use Windows XP and the game works fine except for some crashes (2 in 16 hours of gameplay, for me).You should play it.10/10			"

												WARNING! The game uses DirectDraw technology. That means that if you run anything newer then Windows XP you will encouter problems with this game. I have Windows 7 x64 and managed to bring the game to mostly playable level (the game slows for a second down everytime I change a character or choose a skill to use.That said the game itself is quite excellent. The artstyle still looks just fine even though it is an old game. The 6 characters you will play as have variad skills, which you can use in creative way. There are no easy or scripted way through enemis and you will have to make your own way using tools given to you. The game is hard and you will have to use quicksave a lot on your first playthrough. Still, it is a great game in a long forgotten genre of games. It was fun back in 2001 and hold up really well to this day.			"

												This game is masterpiece.The humorous and deadly atmosphere keeps it together.What I like about this game is that most levels can be finished by various tactics.. You can gun your way out, sneaky clear whole level or set a dangerous environment with traps. And this really suits this genre. Though the levels are really challenging, you do not need too much strategy to finish it. I will always recommend this game.20 ish hour packed single player that you should play through at least once.			"

Short version: 89%Desperados is a squad-oriented stealth/action game following the footsteps of Commandos, but with a Western setting. It may be a copycat, but a copycat with great levels, good mechanics, and memorable characters, easily earning its rightful place among all real-time tactical game fans.Long version:Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive is the proof that you can create a copycat that can be on par with the original. In our case, it is a clone of Commandos: a series of WWII real-time squad-based tactical/strategy games, where you control a group of highly trained specialist through a set of mostly stealth-oriented levels.The core mechanics are the same: your task is to clear each level from enemy guards and bandits to reach your current mission mark. To do so, you take control of a colourful cast of Western stereotypes, all with their unique abilities. They are maybe a little too unique, as even mundane tasks as tying a knot or saddling a horse need their own specialists.Another similarity is that diversion tactics are the bread and butter of gameplay. This is where Desperados outdid Commandos: you can pre-record a set of commands for all characters to execute a complex plan with the push of a button. Thanks to the devilish enemy placements, this feature is almost essential after a while.The setting makes one big difference though: we cannot have a Western without some shoot-outs, so Desperados puts a smaller emphasis on sneaking to give way for some old-fashioned gunplay instead.The story is built from spaghetti Western tropes: a mysterious bandit leader pulls a few high-profile robberies, which attracts the attention of a veteran bounty hunter, who then collects a few outlaw buddies to get to the bottom of the events. After this, the plot runs into a few dead ends on purpose, which may be a little tiresome, but eventually it reaches its typical adventure-oriented Western movie conclusion.			"

												This game is a gem, at least what I remember of it back in the day. But I couldn't get it to work on either my laptop or desktop. yes I know there's a workaround guide around here, but that involves downlading files from not official sources and I don't want to do that.So here's the thing, this developer put this game for sale, knowing that in [current year] most users are running Windows 7+, and didn't bother to make it compatible, so why would I?

												So much pressure in my recent daily life and I found that video games couldn't offer me much relief as they did in the past.Talking about most games in my steam library,some of them I play for burdening purposes like achievement and most of them I play for reasons of nothing,I just have to play them because I bought them with stupid meaningless sense of ownership so I must play them to pay up the debt.And all of these,boring.But This Game! I play this game for fun,for a long-lost feeling of self satisfaction and I just can't have enough of it,even though it has already offered a huge storyline of 25 delicately designed levels.I gave it my first try back in the days of 2001 and I just finished my 4th playing through yesterday,and I must say this game still doesn't seem to be out of date even after all these years,still has tons of new tactics to be tried out and still holds so many excellent funny little details to be discovered then grin my face.What I like most is,this game has a large variaty of enemy types,and diffrences among them result in diffrent tactics(Just compare all these with those copy-paste nazi soldiers in Commandos series,you will see what revolution in enemy system Desperados Wanted Dead or Alive has brought in 2001.Even Commandos II Men of Courage wouldn't surpass it in this aspect )All in all,this game offers me great enjoyment from which I've been away for so long.I own it my gratitude.

ENGLISH and Italian Review Recensione Inglese ed ITALIANA WARNING, if you run Windows Vista or newer you'll have to tweak the hell out of this game to make it work!ATTENZIONE, se il tuo sistema operativo è più nuovo di XP dovrai fare un casino per far funzionare il gioco!English:Let's forget compatibility problems and talk about this game like we were still in 2001.

												A real gem from the Germany-based Spellbound from 2001! It plays exactly like the Commandos series except this time we find ourselves in the Wild West! You can control 6 characters throughout the 25 missions the game offers. Some are pretty hard (again, a similarity with Commandos) and quite long. The characters of course are not present in all missions - the game gives you a different variety all the time.This was one of my favourite games more than 10 years ago! The game still looks decent as the levels are quite detailed and I'm sure there are a lot of people who can appreciate 2D graphics these days. If you liked Commandos and instead of replaying it you want something new feel free to pick this one up. It's only 1,24 EUR at the moment.			"

												Probably the best in a genre. I loved it when it came out and loved it now after buying and replaying it on steam. Graphics still looks very good, sharp and clear. Controls are bit clunky at times but it doesn't break the game. The worst thing is that the game crashes sometimes. Had maybe 5 crashes in whole walkthrough. You can use different characters for different aproach doing the misson. It's really hard, especially some levels, i don't know how i completed it without any walkthroughs back then, i coudn't do this now :)Nothing to tell more - just buy it, it's worth it :)			"

Be nice if they would make sure these games were formatted correct before selling them to the Steam Community.			"

												The first time I came across this game was somewhere around 2001. I got a copy of the demo on CD from a cereal box. I was instantly hooked on the game although it was very challenging. Sometime after that a friend of mine had received the full version of the game. We spent countless hours with the darn thing and we couldn't get past level four. But at that time, fooling around with the game was enough for me, so we started over many times and took turns playing. It wasn't about victory at all.And now, more than ten years after the first glimpse, the game has landed on Steam, and I am eager to buy it. I got the game and I was instantly fulfilled with memories from the past. This is such a great game, there is no other like it. Commandos 2 and Robin Hood are close relatives, but there's something very special about this piece of art. The game features absolutely gorgeous graphics even with today's standards and the voice acting sounds more than professional.If there's one thing they could have altered with the re-released version, it's the aspect ratio. There is no native widescreen support for the game, so you're stuck with 4:3 ratio. This however, isn't as big of a problem as one could think. Since it's an isometric game the gameplay doesn't look too bad at all even though it's stretched out. But just a fair warning...			"

It's certainly a game I've been re-visting for years, and a game I'll certainly continue to play for years to come.Bought the original on disc, bought it on GoG, and now I've finally also bought it on Steam. The extra cost is just a small price to pay for a game that I've always enjoyed so much.Unfortunately it doesn't always run well on Windows 7 or 8 - but if you visit the Steam forums page for the game you'll find two pinned topics detailing a simple fix.

												Easily one of the best games ever made. Amazing gameplay, different ways to complete levels. Are you into making noise with guns and killing a bunch of enemies at a time? Or you prefer sneaky one by one knife kill? Or maybe you want to poison your enemy, hide and watch as they kill one another? What about big boom with a dynamite? Your choice. I completed this game at least 5 times already, and yet, every time I enjoy playing it and play each lvl differently, using different players and combinations. You can really finish a map in 10-15 minutes or 1 hr, all depends on your choice and actions. The farther you go into the game, the more fun maps are. I will never delete this game from my pc. I know that each time, after completing the game, I will return and start all over again. Game control is simple and game price is just silly. You have nothing to lose.			"

I bought it, installed, launched, and the graphic settings were wrong, so the menu was cut off the screen. I looked up many guides, followed them accurately, but still no result. A friend of mine bought the same game and he's happily playing. I guess he was lucky.The reason I asked for a refund  isn't for those precious 1.24euro, but because I feel fooled by people who sell games without testing them properly. As usual, asking to develop a patch, or fix the problem is pointless, so I prefer not being part of this.The game itself is amazing, nobody can argue with that, but if you buy it you might get fooled like me.Good luck.

												Wild west themed, top down, isometric view, commandos style action game. In Desperados you control group of characters with their own strengths, abilities and uses. Game has rather enjoyable art style, with great, detailed environments. Characters have different abilities, weapons, items they can use to accomplish mission goals. Most of the time you have to use multiple characters to complete mission. There is a stealth element in this game, and in most missions you can complete it by silently knocking out, killing enemies, sneaking around undetected. Or you can raise hell and shoot everything that moves, but doing that you have low chances of survival. Game has some humor here and there, voice acting is decent. Game may not work on newer computers, running windows 7 and 8. Other than that it's fun game. If you enjoyed Commandos series, then you might like this.			"

(1280x720 resolution is recommended for FullHD displays, because some levels will become very tiny and fill only a part of the screen if you play it at 1920x1080 resolution.) "

For me, this game perfomed for most time, but I suffered numerous crashes or otherwise the game froze to point I had to restart my computer. Because of that, and the fact that this game was released in this poor state, I cannot recommend this, despite this being an amazing game worth my time. If you still wish to endure this and somehow got the game working to some extent, revell in its glory and remember to save very often. You will find out why.  "

Not working on modern PCs Tested on Windows 10 - Not working Tested on a virtual machine with Windows XP Professional - Not workingI think the only solution to play this game is to run it on an ""old"" real PC with Windows XP or 2000. It is very disappointing that you think this offer is made for modern PCs - it doesn't seem to run normally. The workarounds some people told are only a temporary sollution. The developers should compile the game for Windows 10 and its API.The game itself is a tactic shooter in which you have to control a wild west gang through 20 missions. Every crew member has his or her special abilities. Playing in different locations makes the game diversified.EDIT: I found a solution how it is playable without ingame or mouse cursor lags: Create a Windows 7 86x VM, install guest additions and then install it through the steam app.			"

												I am running this on Windows 7 Pro 64bit. It works just as I remember back in 2001 when I first bought it! Many of you will have seen lots of comments and discussions about how this Steam version doesn't work well on newer versions of windows, including Windows 7 64bit. I read everything looking for the fixes, but it in the end Desperados worked perfectly without any patches or modifications. I'm guessing the developers cleaned up this release over the last 3-4 months so credit to them.If you haven't played Desperados before, it is essentially Commandos 2 but set in the wild west with hilarious cliches to the max! Very fun, lots of character, beautiful artwork (although it has obviously aged quite a bit), excellent story, and lots of tactical variety. There are many ways of getting through each level, and the difficulty scales up nicely.Bargain at a fiver.			"

												Great game that I would recommend to anyone that like action and strategy games.The game is around 20 hours long (Ignore my game time, I had to run the .exe directly to get things to work a bit more smooth) and it has a pretty good story although I would have liked to have a few bounty hunting missions at the start like the demo was, before getting set off on the adventure.The game play is fun, not easy at all and you will spend a lot of time watching your enemies to learn their routine, then act on it using a range of abilities that each of the characters have. Strategy goes a long way as shooting your way out usually does not end well.Like several people mentioned though, this game do not work to well with Windows 8, although I cannot confirm this as I have Windows 7 64x. With my play though, the issue I ran into the most was crashing, anywhere from 1 - 4 times a mission, but it wasn't enough to ruin the game as it loads fast and easy to continue from where you crashed (If you quicksave a lot).

												It took me a year to beat this game - I got pretty bored after about a dozen of missions, because every one of them requires almost the same actions to take and is about an hour long. However, the difficulty level causes great satisfaction after making your way through every group of enemies. So, if you plan to finish this game, you must arm yourself with patience. You could need even more of it, if you encounter the same issues as I did - during my gameplay (on W7x64), the game was FREEZING A LOT and the only way was to kill the process from the task manager.This game can be fun over time, but can get dull if you play it too much.

The game seems to work perfectly now on Windows 7 x64, no cursor trailing in the menus or anything so far, so I'm changing my review to positive.I wanted to give this game a good review but unfortunately it has serious issues on modern operating systems. There are many fixes around but none of them remedy the problem 100%. The best fix I've seen is to use a customized DDraw.dll which causes an annoying graphics glitch in the menus where your mouse pointer leaves a trail.

												This is a good and very fun, there is just a problem It isn't running with high amount of fps. And that is weird because i have a pc which can run The Division on ultra with 120 fps if somebody can help me fix this problem i would be happy :) But i recommend it.			"

												This is one of the best games released in the early 2000s. It is one of the most rewarding strategy games I've played, with an engrossing movie-like atmosphere. The AI is quite advanced, with each (kind of) enemy reacting differently to the player's tactics, and can be quite punishing when playing stealthily.Sadly, though, it hasn't aged well. While there are wide-screen patches available, this DirectX 7 game runs poorly on Windows 7 and later, so keep that in mind if you're considering buying it.On the other hand it runs almost flawlessly on Linux under Wine, so it is a must buy for strategy/western Linux gamers!

												Like many of my fellow gamers who own and play this game, most of us found this gem as a gift among our favourite cereal  and play that demo until the game was unreadable. Then we saved up to buy full game or if we were lucky it was bought for us and the magic of this game continued, i still have my hard copy of this game and demo and when i saw on steam i had to have it as it was and childhood reminder of good gaming. How it took forever at that bloody loading screen, but it was worth it!Good gameplayGood  2D graphics (for the time)Great story and characters (made you feel part of the game)Prefect strategy and stealth gameI hope that Nordic games can bring it back to life so it can run on newer OS's			"

												Desperados is a fun squad based game with a real variety of actions your players could do. Some parts of it, are kind of cheap. For example the lady that can both attract and knock out an enemy once they are close enough. But it does require careful work. It does suffer from one of the problems that a lot of stealth games have. That weapons are over-powered. So if you're not a puritan you can just start a firefight while sitting in a safe place. Overall though, it's fun and runs well on modern systems.			"

												I was looking forward to giving this game a try after enjoying the demo that came in a Kellogg's cereal box long ago (along with Lucky Luke). My friend gave it a quick spin some time ago and I didn't really get to try it until today.It seems that even with a GTX760 OC the game gives low FPS after doing certain important actions. Changing compatibility mode settings doesn't help, so the game is unplayable.			"

												The game is really good but I don't think Steam should be selling it until they make it work with modern OSs. It does work if you put a few workarounds in place but it still lags a lot when there are a lot of enemies on screen.			"

												WARNING! This game is not compatible with Windows 10. No matter what instructions you get to try to fix the issue it will still crash. If you want to risk it, that is up to you. I am now having to do a complete system restore. Even CTRL/ALT/DELETE would not allow me to close it so I had to shut the computer down manually. (DOWNLOAD AT YOUR OWN RISK)			"

												I fell asleep several times during the tutorial waiting for the characters to move around and do their thing. Pretty much unplayable. It's funny because Baldur's Gate is older and has almost the same graphic style, but it works just fine! I'm glad I got this one super cheap.			"

												I was really looking forward to playing this again but sadly even though my laptop runs rome total war 2 it just wont run desperados properly. not only did it shut itself down during the first cutscene, after i restarted, the actual game runs so slow its impossible to play. Its as if it is constantly lagging.I know my laptos not the problem, I can only assume the download is due to the fact commandos behind enemy lines download doesnt come with a save/load system.			"

												Mission 13: I give up, this is just too frustrating. Horrible ♥♥♥♥ing game, almost nothing works as it should (and everything happens slooooooooooooooooowly), the game mechanics are downright broken. No wonder Spellbound went under.There's only one thing I don't understand: the good reviews at the time. Has any reviewer even completed half of this game? The first few levels are charming but then the flaws start coming out more and more to the point where the whole thing becomes a barely playable mess.Let's take the supposedly 3D environment that would let you take advantage of the height differences. The idea is great, hell, it's even more realistic than what you have in Commandos... but the developers just forgot to program it 75% of the time. You're crouched behind a small wall? Doesn't matter if it's not programmed to make you hidden, guards will just spot you even on a night mission.To make things worse the game is just full of great ideas that simply doesn't work as they should. It was awesome to see that Sam can take control of gatling guns... then I got the chance to use one in mission 9 to find out that it's absolutely useless. Dynamite? Have fun spending half a minute with getting it to the right position with the trajectory display before you throw it instead of you know, having it work in the obvious way (you click on a spot that's in range, you throw it there and it explodes but nope, that would have been too ""casual"" I guess, too logical for a game like this). Sleeping gas? Again the idea is great but the Doc can't throw it above a ♥♥♥♥ing wall. The first time I managed to make myself go to sleep instead of an enemy I laughed by the 5th time I was furious. The worst part of this is that it just makes reactive gameplay non-functional, you can't just lure a group of enemies to a corner and throw some sleeping gas at them because it's just too slow and the trajectory is too random (sometimes you can throw it well enough, sometimes you can't and the 2D graphics makes it hard to judge without waiting for the trajectory to be displayed - why isn't that instant btw?). Also it's sleeping gas you know: a guard shouldn't just kick a gassed collegue out of it, it's a chemical substance that makes you sleep.The 2D graphics btw? They get in the way too much. You know why Commandos very rarely made you do things outside of your field of view? Because that's bad game design. I shouldn't do stuff blindly, ever.The worst thing however? This game simply doesn't let you make even the smallest mistakes which is again horrendous game design. I should be able to make a mistake and correct it by reacting accordingly (you know, like in Commandos) but here? Nope, you make a mistake, get shot in the face and it's time to reaload.Horrendous, just horrendous.			"

												Picked up Desperados because it looked beautiful for a low graphic game and it was something my laptop could easily run, but when I started playing it I found the game to be awful is almost every aspect. The tutorial was not informative what so ever, half of the time playing the game was spent trying to figure out what all the icons meant. The game play itself is rough for a turn based and the main character is a cheesey hard♥♥♥♥♥which isn't too big of a deal however when the game isn't enjoyable it's just another add on to the dissapointment. It is a pretty game but unless you want it for a desktop I do not recommend buying this game.			"

												""Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive"" is the first strategy game ever to combine a movie-based and story-driven atmosphere of an adventure game with the intellectual challenge of a real time tactic game. In this western-style title, discover a game of strategy and tactics played out in exceptional real time. You're in charge of a team of 6 mercenaries and must find a way to complete your missions, be it infiltrating an enemy fortress, saving a team member or escaping an ambush... Combine the different skills of your 6 heroes to lead them to victory.			"

												First of all: yes, this game is nearly unplayable on Windows 7 and newer. I applied an official patch, but it didn't help a lot. At the beginning, the game froze every 5 minuts, so I had to kill it and start again. Then, after few levels, the situation was better. Frequency of freezing was lower and lower. Finaly, I was able to play few last levels without any problems.I tolerated all of those restarting because:- starting this game on curent computers with SSD disk is really fast- you can (and you should) use quick-save all the time- this old good stealth western game is just AWESOMEI enjoyed the game 15 years ago, and I enjoyed it again.

												Fantastic game! Even better if you have played this before and you get that nostalgic feel. For me this game has a really high replay value and is and always will be one of my favourite games.However: The steam version of this game is no better performance-wise than the retail version from 2001 (its probably identical) and WILL run poorly on this generation's computers for some unlucky people out there.How to make this game playable:Make sure you follow ALL the steps posted in the pinned thread in the forum called ""Workaround Windows 7 / 8.1 / 10"" this does not work for everyone but it works for most players and it works perfectly for me.

												Desperados is a fantastic tactical game that manages to build up the atmosphere of the Wild West as well as games like Red Dead Redemption. Back in the old days I first came across this game through the Demo Disc that came with Kellogg's cornflakes. The demo was fun, which made me buy the game afterwards and I can't recall how many hours I spent playing this game. It was one of my favourites when it was released, and still today I really love it. You can play the game in many different ways and solve the missions either by shooting your way out, or using stealth. The story and the characters are great, but most of all the map design is amazing.Sadly the game does not work too well on modern computers, but using DxWnd it has worked really well on my computer. If you want to play this game, be prepared to do some fiddling to get it to work. Even though it can be a bit messy, when you get it to work this is a great game for all Wild West lovers. A thread named ""Workaround Windows 7 / 8.1 / 10"" can be found in the game's forum, which will guide you through the process of making the game work.Score for the game: 9/10Score for the poor port: 2/10			"
