												Oh dear. This game isn't really good.The storyline is quite hard to follow, especially with all the funky names and stuff.The gamplay is very simple. Pause the game, click your actions / press the hotkeys, unpause the game, and watch. There is some lag even when you don't actively pause the game, and this gets rather irritating when you want to band-aid/heal the characters. It kinda sucks that you can't heal yourself, and you need another character to do that.The camera is awkward and clunky, and you might have problems moving your troops/team around due to the camera positioning. Although you get to rotate the camera, it doesn't feel natural.What is good about this game is that it is short. There are only 3 chapters (according to the Steam achievements). However, paying $19.99 for a short game isn't that worth the money. I would rather you spend it on X:Com. But that is just my opinion. "

												I really wanted to try and finish Confrontation before I gave my opinion, but it's really just the same as the others.  There are a couple of things that it does decently, but overall, it's just not a fun game. :/Pros -*Decent story and narration*Difficult encounters that require strategic forethought*Good battle music at various points of the game*Customization of your mission group (choosing from a small variety of characters)Cons -*Dull scenery*Repetitive level design*Repetitive gameplay*Delayed and clunky movement, controls, and combat*Shallow character talent trees*Terrible, boring and dishonest achievement ideas (I.E Kill '20' of a type of enemy, when in actuality it requires '50')I'd give it a 4/10 -- couldn't finish.

												The game was a mixed bag.  At first it didnt seem like it was going to hold my interest.  There are many lands, peoples and places which use alot of obtuse names.  Fortunately, the story is very well narrated, so even if you have difficulty keeping track of things, it moves right along with the narration.  The game is somewhat linear and introduction of other playable characters helps to offset the feeling of redundancy and or repitition.  Graphic are nice but character control in narrow and tight areas can be somewhat problematic.  There were a couple of maps that had the old ""can't unlock the door unless you pull a lever from a far off room"" scenario.  I was not to keen on the games that implemented this problematic scenario back in the day and I am not giving the game any bonus points for using it.  The story was ok, something bout men, orcs and genetically modified scorpians and machines or something (as I said, lotsa obtuse names).  At least it was well narrated. lolNot a bad game, but don't expect much and you wont be dissapointed.			"

												I see too many reviews for this game from people who have not given it enough gameplay time.I can in fact say that the game lacks polishing, the story is highly forgettable, music is passable, characters have mild customization and there is no loot besides bandages, graphics are dated, pathfinding is strange, character skills and abilities upgrade oddly, etc etc.However, in what it aims to be, which is a tactical RPG, it totally fails in the RPG part, but it's quite challenging in the tactical part:  it's not a cakewalk in the ""easy"" setting and it's definitely complex in most encounters in the ""hard"" setting. In that regard, in making some micromanagement of skills, buffs, debuffs, AoE, etc, I'd say it's quite alright and even unforgiving on the player. It's not a D&D title, it's a B-series game, but if taken for what it is and graphics, story and such is put apart and the tacticality of the gameplay is highlighted, can be an interesting title to play. When the game was over, though, I felt a bit tedious of it, I didn't even play the extra maps since I was so fed up! The campaign is way too long! I don't recommend playing it in long runs, as it can be a bit repetitive, most game is just linear walking and encountering battles. I don't think it's worth the full price, I got it in a bundle and for that I believe it is more than acceptable.Considering it is a mixed bag, I cannot recommend it for the average player. But if searching for a challenge, do take a look at it (in a bundle!), and for that kind of player I'll give a ""yes"".			"

												Confrontation is a simplistic linear action RPG. You will face few choices throughout the game the biggest being which generic heroes you want to use at any given time.What ever happend to the deep RPGs? The ones driven by skill, story and exploration?In Confrontation you take control of a number of Griffin Hero's as they travel through various hostile lands in the search of secret enemy cloning labs. Although the back story and lore in the world of Confrontation seems pretty interesting the game never manages to portray it in a favorable light. Everything is locked into classic fantasy stereotypes and even the slight steampunk elements feels bland and unimpressive.The gameplay is your standard team based action RPG, you control 4 heroes that level up as you go along and upgrade their various abilities. Unfortunately the strength and usefulness of the heroes and their abilities are quite skewered and many of them is not worth using outside of their required sections. On normal difficulty almost all of the fights can be won by simply clicking attack on the enemies as they pop up although some micro management is required that is mainly due to the horrendous AI that makes your heroes go idle at the end of their action unless they are literally standing next to an enemy.Graphics and sound are of the lower end of the ""We actually spent money on it"" range and generally UI and menus seem slightly dated and underdeveloped.I'd love to have evaluated the multi-player but nobody seems to be playing and looking around on the official forums this seems to have been the case from day one.All in all this is a game to avoid. It's boring and bland and has little to recommend it. The developers have had no interest in supporting it past release and there is no community to make multi-player a viable gamemode. Truly a wasted purchase.			"

												This game is buggy, feels like a port (wouldn't be surprised if it was), controls and movements are wonky, units run in place at times (...?); graphics are very sluggish, and Anti-Aliasing is badly done. The units at times don't respond very well (even when the game is paused, they don't carry out the order) and the game feels outdated even though it was made in 2012 (...?!). I didn't enjoy playing the game. I didn't feel the immersion behind it like other games of its genre and it was rather bland.I'd stay away from this game - don't believe me?

												No... Just no.  In a universe where Baldur's gate, Icewind Dale, and Neverwinter Nights doesn't exist.  Confrontation would still be a clunky uninteresting game, of repetative combat, linear gameplay, and lacking upgrades. But in a universe where Those three games do exist, as well as many more, there's nothing to recommend with Confrontation.  The story is weak, the enemies are repetative, the characters have no real upgrade system to speak of, there's no inventory outside a minor weapon/armor upgrade system that feels cheap, and the gameplay is monotonous. There's no ""Exploration"" in this game, you play through linear levels with a very similar party.  The combat is mostly fast paced which requires either a lot of micromanaging before the battle starts, or a lot of pause and resume. The problem with this is that all the combats are the same, in the classic Fallouts (or even the modern ones) there's snap decisions that require a pause system because it's a new enemy, or you need to utilize a large inventory.  In this game, a simple autocast system would have made the combat dull.  Well duller than it already is. There's a FEW interesting ideas in the game regarding death, but overall, I played two of the maps, and neither were that enjoyable.  I mean how many of the same soldier in the same formation do you have to kill to show you ""understand"" how to kill them.    In between battles, you heal up so it's not even like the game can wear you down with multiple waves of enemies. If you're considering this, buy Baldur's gate, Icewind Dale, Disgaea, Wastelands 2, or something along those lines.  This game, well maybe if you've played all of those and simply MUST have yet another game, and can ignore a poor story, and uninteresting characters, then maybe buy this one, but honestly, you should have more than enough hours in any one of those other games.

												I'm sorry, I can't even bring myself to properly review this. I just can't stand playing it anymore. Confrontation is supposed to be a Tactical RPG. However, there are huge problems with both the Tactics, and the RPG. It just seems very rushed and unpolished.I'll only write about 2 general points: Story and Combat.Regarding the Story, this game seems to have a huge lore. That lore is, of course, necessary to understand what's happening. However, they decided to give you access to it through pages and pages of text in the menu... I doubt anyone will read those out of nowhere. It's clearly for the people already familiar with the universe.Besides, all the exposition is through narrated walls of texts. It's just like getting a few pages of an audiobook between each mission. It's completely separated from the game itself.Now, about the Combat. First off, it's clunky as hell. I've played a few tactical games like this before. The fact that this game is in Real-Time rather than Turn-Based only hurts it. I've played Krater, though, and however flawed, that game feels good to play. Where this fails is that it's completely unresponsive, in the literal sense of the word. You command your character to do something, and they generally just ignore it. Either that, or they take several seconds. After those seconds, someone important has already died, so tough luck.The abilities also have long cooldowns, meaning you'll only be able to use them one -- twice at most -- per encounter.The level design is also just a corridor with combat after combat. Sometimes you'll have to press levers, but that's about it.Maybe I'm not giving it a fair enough chance and it gets better later on. After 6 hours, however, it feels just like I'm starting with it, and the game has done nothing interesting... and I can withstand not interesting, as long as it still feels good to play. With the clunky mechanics at play here, though, I won't.I doubt this is very helpful, but hey, the fact that I don't have any intention of continuing with it should give you an idea.			"

												Well the reviews for this game are incredible. It consists mostly of people who only played a few hours and didnt even give campaign a shot. This game is not the greates of its genre or the year it was released, but it certainly does not deserve such a low rating in reviews. Lets talk about some of the common points made the negative reviews for this game.- The game has linear. It certainly is and the game is described as one. This is not an Open-World Rpg, it is a Tactical one. - The story is not good enough. Well the names might be awkward to hear for the first time, but after a couple of times listening to the great narrator you ll get the hang of it. The initial lore of the game can be learned from the game manual, the story is told through a narrator and codex pages acquired after certain events in the game enriching the lore.- There is no loot and no items. This one is justified, but you are presented with a lot of characters you can choose for your 4-man squad. Each of these heroes have different weapons, secondary weapons, skills, upgrades and glyphs to choose from, making the customization of your troop interesting.- The game mechanics are clunky. They are pretty smooth once you get the hand of it. Ordered commands cannot be broken is the rule of the game. If you invest some hours into it, the problem will be solved.This game does not deserve this score. It seems people jump on hate-trains to eagerly. "

												Did you ever wonder what it sounds like when you clap your two hands and nothing is heard? This game will help you discover how that feels when you are using your skills; no sound ques.Did you ever wonder what it feels like when your cat doesn't obey your commands? That's exactly how the units you control behaves throughout the game.Did you ever wonder about those times when you were already sleepy and then you somehow move a little slower with every minute passing? Well, that's here in this game as well as it somehow suffers from a sleep disorder.Did you ever wonder what it feels like to read a novel? This game has you covered with its engaging text walls that challenge you to in explaining something very simple such as basic controls and the like.All in all, this is the kind of game that reminds you of the beauty in the outside world. But if you insist on playing a game of this genre, just get a Warhammer game instead. "

												I am only part way through this game at the moment. Having bought this title on the holiday sale 75% off for £3.74. Compared to its regular list price of £14.99. Would I recommend this game, the answer would be no. There are better action rpg titles around for the same price. It does feel clunky at times. There are pathing issues. though I do like the visuals, the lore and some of the mechanics. That is why I picked up Aarklash: Legacy to give this series another chance.If you have bought this title, and are having issues with reading the manual. For some reason, the manual is not accessible via the right hand menu in the library. So you will have to google steam powered + confrontation manual to get it.There are no loot drops what so ever. You can only upgrade armor and weapons via weapon stands. Which are located sporadically around the various maps. Other upgrades include glyphs, which are obtained via plinths a giant magic rock.Main Screen - On the campaign menu there is an Additional Content button, but when selecting it. There is nothing listed, and I cannot find anything regarding additional content.The main menu is located right at the bottom of the screen. Where you can access options, switching profile and quiting the game. It looks out of place on the main screen, compared to the other buttons. Which have a UI element to them.GameplayNaration - The naration feels like the old pen and paper DM, explaining things to you. Other than that it is uninspired.User Interface - In game with the party interface it does look nice and clean. Though the minimap is rather lackluster, even worse when bringing up the full map. You cannot zoom into the map. Though it does leave white dots showing where you have been on the map. It does seem out of place compared to the rest of the UI.Character Panels - Pressing I gives you the character panel, which shows you their attributes, skills, armor etc.. One gripe is it does not include all of the stats. Which are on a seperate panel pressing O. So you will not be able to see when increasing attributes what they are improving. The tooltips on attributes do specify what they improve. Also their class should be on the panel as well.Skills and Armor - I would have liked a way to respec my characters, this feature is in Aarklash: Legacy. So I can make the party I want, with the builds I want. Healing - Some characters have a heal over time. Others have an aoe heal. There is the option of using bandages to heal. But you can only use them on other characters, not on yourself. Frustration can set in when due to pathing you cannot reach the character you want to bandage.Codex - Only accessible in the main menu, and not while you are playing the game. Also they have missed adding lore and character biographies to the character entries. Character entries only have a visual model of the character, plus a list of their abilities. In Aarklash: Legacy you are able to examine enemy units and their abilities.Combat - Rushing blindly into rooms, will definitely get your party killed in this game. Some fights do take some strategy on what to focus on, what to crowd control. Line of sight, and pulling groups away from patrols. So you do not end up in some crazy cluster frak wipe, when a party member gets feared. Combat is mainly pausing, chaining some commands, such as move here, attack this, use this ability for each party member. Unpause then watch the fight unfold, pause and reissue commands when required.Multiplayer - I have not tried multiplayer, but according to the forums and how this title was recieved. Do not expect any.I do not know what the original price listing was for this title at launch. This title does feel unfinished, and would need more polish. Personally I would not have released this title as is. It should have undergone some closed or open beta testing. Taken onboard player feedback and improved this title immeasurably.Anyone who has played this title and has not gone all angry german kid. Deserves medals and a parade, Personally I think it is worthy of a visit by an Enforcer droid and vaporized. Am I going to play the game to the end, yes I am. To see if anything can be redeemed before summary vaporizing.			"

												The game attempts to kick off epicly by explaining the status quo of the world of Hnng'nmar to the player but does this via a voice-over read by a bad voice actor. It speaks of the Orcs of Kranga-mar and the Inquisitor army of Kerplunkaplunk duking it out while the armies of Da'ark are amassing somewhere in the Cockawocka wilderness and whatnot. It bombards you with made up names making use of that ages old acclaimed storytelling technique of tell, don't show.I almost made it through one mission. The game looks mediocre, it's hard to tell which of your party members are which and the tactics in your arsenal are limited while the control is clunky. This uses the compromise of letting you issue commands while the game is paused, but it only hurts the experience. After just a few short battles I decided I don't care about anything that's going on in front of me and that I'm not having fun. It MIGHT get better later on, but it certainly made zero effort to get me hooked during the first mission.			"

												I tried to give this game a chance, but I just couldn't stand it anymore after only 26 minutes of play time. My first impression was that it was a little like Diablo (click for movement, open-ish area to explore). But the battle mechanics are just silly. During a battle, you pause the game, select your abilities, and then unpause to sit back and watch. I much prefer a game with more active battles, where I get to really use the abilties in the moment (Diablo III comes to mind, obviously).The camera is also a bit clunky, and movement gets annoying when the camera isn't really listening to you. I wouldn't recommend this game, unless you're into the whole ""pause > select abilities > watch the battle"" thing.			"

												I found the gameplay to be highly engaging. Okay, the story was mediocre, and there wasn't much going on besides. But the combat was challenging and really fun. This is how I play the Dragon Age series - queue up all the actions, unpause for a couple seconds, then repeat. If you like that sort of thing, I would recommend.			"

												Sadly, this game ended up being a lot less fun than I expected.The game keeps trying to be both Diablo and Warcraft, but fails miserably.  The squad selection mechanic makes it difficult to select the abilities of your team mates without de-selecting the other members entirely. The pathing was mediocre at best, and  the animation left much to be desired.Part of the draw for Warcraft was that it still managed to have humor whilst still involving the terrors of war by using witty dialogue and enticing quests.  No such humor or enticement exists here, though - one can only really stand so much of the main character shouting ""CHARGE!"" over and over again.			"

But it's clear they didn't even try out their own product and the lack of testing is evident. Controls are garbage and combat is frustrating. It was, whole-heartedly, a waste of time.			"

												Well people say alot of bad stuff about the game but i got into it, im an RPG fan and my first PC game was Dungeon Siege 1. I like games that offer gameplay and variety over graphics and storylines tho i do enjoj good story lines. Overall this game is not that bad if u want an RPG with semi good graphics. The game is not turn based its more like neverwinter nights style of gameplay, it takes time to hit, move or cast a spell once ur in combat but outside it you move normaly. Each unit has its own spells, weapons and skills. The camera is a ♥♥♥♥♥, its glytchi sometimes get stuck and wont move, controls are a pain because sometimes the selection cyrcle gets stuck, sometimes u wana select 1 unit but it wont it just keeps selecting the same one over and over, sometimes you group your units into group 1 but when u press number 1 1-2/5 times it wont work, sometimes characters run to pull a lever for around 20 secs eaven if they stand right infront of it... Overall if u can look pass these few errors the game is not that bad and its enjojable. Combat is hard, u need good tactics and planing ahead is the onli thing keeping u alive most of the time, your units are not much stronger than enemies so the combat is pretty balanced, when u go 4v4 u can lose very easy or win just by an inch from losing. If the game is in a bundle or on sale and ur bored pick it up and try it, just give it time, pass 1-2 chapters before u give up.			"

												As much faith as i have in Focus, i do not share with cyanide. I spent a very short amount of time with this game, so this isn't a very fair review to be honest, however, i will say that if you expect a diablo style action/adventure hack and slash, thats not what this is. It's more of a rts than anything, minus the base building. I will give it a chance as i know games like this typically aren't strong out of the gate. for now i'll give it a recommendation, but when i put more time into it i'll make a more final review. however, if i know cyanide, this game will be full of good ideas but terrible mechanics and generally poor execution. cyanide doesn't make BAD games, they just make horribly underachieving games			"

												Do not play this. Do not buy this. It is nothing anywhere close to the former glory that was the table top games.The graphics would have been amazing 8 years ago, but cyanide studio has slacked off horribly with this game.Combat is sluggish and there are multiple ""Duh"" moments. Like when a character will stop attacking in combat after they cast a spell and stand there while enemies kill them.Movement pathing is also horribly bugged, characters will run in place, or in some cases simply run into another character or run circles around a enemy instead of actually attacking it.Cyanide studious has done a horrible job in this game. Its even 5 months after release and there's no update or new patches.They have soiled the memory of beautiful tabletop game with this sad pile of excrement that now takes up space on my hard drive.

The textures were fantastic for a game made in 1981, the game was clearly optimised to run on a high-end system, with the best teleporting and stutterstepping available that would make wizards and top FPS players jealous.The only problem I can see, and the only reason I'm giving the game 11/10 instead of 12/10 is that Darius clearly does not use an axe.

												Some time ago I decided I was going to try and beat every game I owned on Steam. This game has completely sapped me of the will to do so. It is, without exaggeration, one of the most mind-numbingly dull and uninspired games I've played in nearly a decade. It looks bad, it plays bad, the voice acting is horrendous and the story is the blandest of fantasy fare, but the most damning aspect is that the game is just plain boring. It's a slog to get through.On the plus side, it's taught me to not buy bad games in the future, even if they're dirt cheap.			"

												Oh my what a waste of game time.This game feels like it is still in beta mode.The mechanics are clunky and the gameplay is way too streamlined and boring.And besides that the story is unoriginal and feels like they have copied ideas whereever they could without really coming up with anything original themselves.I had to stop playing after 17 minutes, where the tutorial stopped. I had no motivation what so ever to continue this game.			"

												Buy This Game if you know what are you looking for.I find all the problems not enough to stop me of playing it and when i did i really enjoy it.To me 6/10 and for steam sales or if you buy it for less than 5€ is worth.It´s not the best and it have a few minor bugs (like push v twice to apply the changes on stats on your team) i don´t find any other to comment.But i play it and find it really fun, the multiplayer is dead (`cause old) but with a friend you can play (problem resolved).The grafics are not the best and it can require a bigger machine than it really need to do that, but the gameplay still ok.

												First impression: It's Dawn of War as a tactical skirmish game, and I loved Dawn of War. Awesome.Second impression: Dawn of War would have sucked as a tactical skirmish game, because having the same four soldiers doing the same one or two actions and then auto-attacking everytime they run into a couple of dudes gets boring before you've finished the first mission. Not awesome in the slightest.Play Aarklash: Legacy if you want the same game in the same setting, but done better. Or Dogs of War Online for the same setting with grid-based, multiplayer combat. Or play anything else.			"

The maps had bumpers to guide you to the fights, the maps were small and uninspired, if there was a story i couldnt tell or care because there was nothing to do with it other than waste your time running to the next uninstired battle. dull dull stupid and dull. dont waste your money.

												Cyanide continues their grand tradition of being utterly mediocre with this thoroughly underwhelming action RPG, the lore is dense convuluted and utterly boring, the gameplay is sub-par jerky, awkward bleh as per the course for Cyanide, and the graphics are less than impressive. Plenty of better options in this genre, I only got this because I found it in a discount bin at EB games, and Isaw it had a steam key.			"
