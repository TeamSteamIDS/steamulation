												THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON THE LAUNCH STATE OF THE GAME, I DON'T HAVE IT ANYMORE SO I DON'T KNOW IF THEY FIXED IT BY NOW.Oh, Team17, why you do this to us...Pros: 1080p gameplay, yayCons: Everything else, the menus are in 640x480 so it's a pain in the capital B to alttab and don't even try to use the overlay, this will make multi-monitor users have problems as well, there are no key bindings nor control schemes for keyboard/mouse, lack of graphic and audio settings, basically is just a copypaste of the original game interface, by the way the ""new"" audio isn't a great thing either, you will be turning it off because it doesn't match the game style. There's no good online (yeah, wtf Team17), no steamworks matchmaking, I don't remember seeing a direct IP connection so I guess you will have to use Hamachi and similar software to play with friends without lag, because there's just this UK Wormnet master server where I was unable to join a single damn match and there's no people whatsoever, ""the perfect online gaming experience""?! yeah sure. Did I mention the game crashed 3 times in 20 minutes? what the hell? and there are people having compatibility and optimization issues as well in the forums. I heard people having FPS problems as well, so yeah, another strike.Don't bother buying this, don't even think of it, is a copy-paste of the original game with no improvement aside from the 1080p gameplay, all it's features could be achieved with a free mod for t he original game. If you are wondering why I don't have this in my library anymore, it's because I asked for a refund, you should do the same. Developers should learn how to do a proper ""remastered"", don't give them your money so they can undestand that and stop releasing lazy games like this.If you want a true 2D Worms experience, buy Armageddon.

												FIrst of all, let's make one thing clear: All of the negative reviews, including this one, are not towards the actual gameplay, Worms World Party was a fantastic game all those years ago, and is just as much fun to play today, same as Worms 2 and of course, Worms Armageddon. The reason for the masses of bad reviews is because Team 17's idea of ""Remastered"" is far from the truth of what a remastered version of a game should be. As a seasoned fan of the Worms series ever since the Amiga days, it really pains me to click ""Not Recommended"" on this review...Worms World Party Remastered, it's essentially exactly the same as the original, but with 1080p In-game Graphics (this does not include the in-game menus unfortunately) and 60 FPS gameplay, both of which have been a part of Worms Armageddon for a long time now, so ultimately it's nothing new, and seeming as how they're almost exactly the same game, it feels very much like we have been cheated paying £10.00 for something that isn't new and far from actually being remastered. Worms World Party itself does offer a handful of features and content that were never included in Worms Armageddon, the Wormpot options for example make for a ton of unique options to give the gameplay a litlte more variety, it also has more missions and a co-op online mode, but aside from that, Worms Armageddon is easily still the superior game due-to the fact that it has recieved constant updates for many, many years after it's release. What I expected to get from Worms World Party Remastered was the second coming of a Worms Armageddon so to speak, the entire game being completely remastered, updated and with a new layer of polish to compensate for todays standards, but most of the updated and awesome features included in Worms Armageddon were not included in Worms World Party Remastered, what we were left with was nothing more than an option to use some remastered sound effects as opposed to the classic ones. I am thankful that the new sounds are fully optional instead of being forced down your throat though as it just doesn't feel the same without the classics. Right now, this needs a lot of work to justify it's price tag and the title of ""Remastered"", online play doesn't even work properly as of the moment without some pain-staking workarounds (see the 'Guides' section on the Community Hub), the frame rate can sometimes be incredibly choppy and the fact that Team 17 didn't think to include the updates that Worms Armageddon received just baffles me... Just before this was released, they delayed it's release a little longer after discovering a bug that they wanted to fix first, which shows Team 17 care about their products, they always have done and I salute them for that, but re-releasing a game that hit shelves over a decade ago when Worms Armageddon is already available and vastly superior is just something that I can't support. I am hoping that this game gets the patches that it deserves and truly needs to live up to what we all hoped it would be, but until that happens, I'm sorry, but I just can't recommend this to anybody else, I even told my brothers to steer well clear of this game and stick with Worms Armageddon instead, and I give the same advice to all of you. Don't pay for an inferior product when there is a better and very similar option available instead.			"

												If you want to enjoy a few hilarious weapons(Note: Armageddon also has those weapons, but WWP seems to drop rare weapons more frequently - through ""Crates, crates and even more crates"" lobby setting. Thanks master of memes!), game schemes and modes from 2D worms universe EASIER, and only if in that case, get this.Otherwise you may want to stick to Armageddon. This game has a few issues yet to be solved. Such as voices doesn't quite match what you have selected(e.g. Russian voice still has English screams),The biggest setback is Network part. Without TCP/IP option, and wormnet doesn't work(for me), It gets very tricky to have fun with your friends over Internet.I'll check later to see if it gets better.			"

												Pros: - It is Worms World Party. One of the best games I have ever played.- You have Wormpot options. Enable blood, x2 damage etc.. Something Worms Armageddon never had.Cons: - Menus are 640x480- No Windowed Mode (If you have double or more screen your mouse can easily go to the other screens while you are playing)- Almost impossible to play online. Even Armageddon have 60-100 online players in their lobbies. WWPR have max 10 players. (Same like other Worms games - I am looking at you 3D Worms games - unable to play online because of lack of players)- Even you find enough people to play. You need to struggle like 15 to 90 minutes open ports, change your net settings etc to host a decent game. Even at Worms Armageddon you can easily host a game with hostingbuddy but not at wwpr.- Some voices are wrong, missing.If you have Worms Armageddon or Worms World Party do not buy that game. If you dont have well I think Worms Armageddon is still better. At least you can able to play online... Waited like 2 weeks for WWPR (released with 1 week delay) and I am just heartbroken.  "

												I was expecting this game to be fully modernised for PCs of today since the old version's menu and gameplay are in low resolution, the controls are slightly awkward, and online play was sometimes hard to get working (I feel as if that's okay considering the game came out in 2001 before Steam.)They promised us an improved frontend and 1080p/60FPS which as a customer I can assume it was for the entire game, but upon purchase and launch I found that the main menu ran at 640x480 which is exactly the same as the original release of the game, and the mouse movement in menus was far too sensitive with no way to change it at all. I didn't see a keyboard rebinding menu at all in the options, only a button that opens a screen displaying gamepad controls. The keyboard controls were awkward because I had to use the jump button before I could even move at all, and the keybinds were not displayed for me anywhere.I am severly disappointed with the quality of this game and I hope that they take the criticism recieved on board. If they bring this game's quality up to the standard expected then I'll be happy to re-purchase.			"

												as much as i adore the Worms series and World Party to me is the best one of the series, this is a joke of a port yet they call it a remaster. believe me it is not a remaster and not even a good port. low resolution menus, unstable framerate and some audio glitches. this game isn't that hard to remaster yet Team17 managed to screw it up badly. it all looked fishy before release when they kept ignoring many of the questions we were asking in the forum and now we know why. coming from a really die hard Worms fan, it really pains me to say this but stay away from this terrible port, trust me on this .

												Worms World Party Remastered is a complete disaster. The only changes applied is the 1080p option, and adding ""Remastered"" to the title's name. You might be dissapointed about this game. You might feel like ""Oh  boy, WWP! What a nostalgic game, I can't wait to play it!"" And unfortunately you have became, or will become something like ""Well, this is even worse than the original WWP lol.""Well if you want to get the retro Worms experience you were looking for, I suggest you to refund this game and buy Worms Armageddon instead. You may thinking ""Why? Worms Armageddon is prequel of Worms World Party. Probably it's even worse."" Well guess what? It's far better game than you can imagine. It's the perfect online gaming expreince Team17 talking about. Well though, funny thing is Team17 didn't do much to improve, the superiorities of WA are there thanks to it's fanbase and 2 coder (Deadcode and Cybershadow) hired by Team17 from community to make patches.Well you might be wondering why should I refund WWPR, and get WA instead? What are those superior features of WA? You may think I'll just wait a bit for WWPR to get his patches etc. Well, don't wait! Everything you are waiting for is in Worms Armageddon!Let me count some, for example bigger sized map support, you can play on maps with any size, you can play on any png-8 bit maps in WA. Also replay recording. You can watch played games exactly how they happened. And replay files are ridicilously small, such as between 100kb-500 kb. And there are very active community, with over 50 new game modes. There are active leagues working with replay sharing, if you win a game, you send your replay as a proof for your victory. And you can watch every replay of any game whenever you want. There are over 200k games played on leagues so far! And it's still active. For example, the recent games page of the most active league, TUS:http://tus-wa.com/leagues/recent-games/About new game modes I previously mentioned. For example, you remember the famous ninja rope right? Imagine racing on a map with it, it's called Rope Race in WA. An example video of a Rope Race:

Well, do you want to know what other spectacular features the game has? Check this video on wormtube, to understand why Worms Armageddon is so superior to Worms World Party Remastered:http://wormtube.worms2d.info/81/wa_beta_showdownYou might be thinking is this a Worms Armageddon promotion or WWP Remastered review? Well the reason why I talked about WA is, WA became a such game with only 2 people and the fanbase. And Team17, after all those years, with all the resources they had, they can't even come up with a better game. That's why this game is so bad and that's why I lost my respect against Team17. And I want people to have the game they deserve, Worms Armageddon.			"

												I bought Worms World Party Remastered because I need to own every Worms game.Worms 2 and Armageddon are my favourite Worms games and I figured since WWP was remastered it would be my new go to Worms game since it was the last of that group of games.I prefer the older style of game play rather than the new Worms games especially because of what they did to the ninja rope!I thought since they had delays releasing the game that it was going to be impressive but I was mistaken.To start off you load the game and you have the old 4:3 menus stretched to whatever screen size you have, mine is 16:9. It could be because of my graphics drivers but I don't have this issue with other games.The mouse cursor still tracks like it is on a 4:3 screen so moving up and down is normal but left and right movements of the cursor are just too fast.I have 3 screens and WWP was playing in the centre screen.Now the game menu runs in psudeo full screen which caused some issues.When you move the mouse to the left or right of the game window you actually scroll on to the other screens that arent used in the game. You try to move the cursor back to the game screen and it sometimes blocks the cursor leaving it on the unused screen.I had to move the cursor back and forth a few times and it eventually went back to the game screen. N.B. because the left and right scroll is accelerated due to the 4:3 stretch you can get the cursor to the middle screen but I actually had the cursor go from my left screen, past the WWP screen in the middle, and to my right screen because the cursor was so fast in the game screen.Starting a game is just like it used to be on the original WWP but the stretched menus just don't look nice.Once in a game it played just like it used to.The updated sounds were nice but just didn't match the graphics.The graphics are the same as the original WWP and the old soundbanks just fit better.Moving the cursor off the screen isn't a problem during a game since moving the mouse will just move the camera or weapon selection cursor.The game defaulted to my 2560x1440 graphics but the game didn't run like it was 60FPS.It was a bit choppy and just seemed dated.I quit the match changed the graphics to 1680x1050.I loaded a match and it was smooth but still looked the same as WWP back in the day.I quit WWP completely and saw that because I changed the game resolution to a lower resolution than my 2560x1440 desktop it had shifted all of my cursors that were on the lower part of the desktop up higher!Luckily I have DesktopOK running so I can just restore the icons to their original positions easily but this is just rediculous.This game was a rushed port, which is odd since they had delays, and I recommend only die hard Worms fans purchase it.I didn't try online play and only had a quick few test solo games and it plays ok in lower resolutions but the implimentation of the game seems like it's still designed for Windows 95/98 or XP.One other issue that I encountered was loading the game.If you load the game and in the part with the developer Team 17 and Tick Tock names appear you click on a different screen the game screen will minimize but you can't restore it.Alt-Tab doesn't show the game is running and I had to kill W2.exe with task manager to quit and then I reloaded the game.There's just too many issues with the game and I think it should have been redesigned for Windows 7/8/10 not just ported like this.Team 17 please release some major patches to fix everything that is broken so we can enjoy this game on our new computers without these issues.

												I don't know why people have negative reviews for this game but this is the Worms World Party that i remember.Pros:-It really is remastered. (I mean the original game was only works fine with Windows XP or older and it was never ever worked with Vista or 7. Team 17 did a good job and i want to say ""Thank you"" after all these years.)-You can use the good old sounds, but you must turn off remastered ones.-Aqua sheep-Everything is in HD and 60 FPS.-If it is too HD for you, you can always switch back to 640x480 resolution. (I'm serious. This option is for old gamers.)-Achievements, cloud save, leaderboards etc.-Hotseat-Long rope-Did i say aqua sheep?Cons:-You can have never enough aqua sheep !?-Some FPS drops-No 42 flagWould incoming again. 17/17By the way, i still have the old WWP CD for the nostalgia and i think i don't need it anymore. :)			"

												The only ""remastering"" they've done is improve the screen resolution in-game (frontend menus are still 640x480), replace the in-game sound effects with sounds from later Worms games (which can thankfully be turned off) and touched up some of the frontend graphics.Other than that, it's almost identical to WWP at launch, which means it lacks many of the features, enhancements and improvements that come with the similarly-priced Worms Armageddon. The game also struggles to run on modern systems - I get, at best, 35 FPS, compared with the 60 FPS I get in Worms Armageddon.If you really want the featureset of WWP, wait for a major patch. If you just want a good Worms game, get Worms Armageddon instead. It's the same price, uses a near-identical game engine, and runs a Hell of a lot nicer.TL;DR - Not remastered, possibly broken. Pass.			"

												If you are expecting an elaborated remasted with lots of new things better don´t buy this game, instead if you don´t have any worms game on Steam and this is your favourite one go for it. Also if you wan´t to play Worms online W:A is the most played with the biggest community.The reason for this negative review is highly caused by the ""Remastered"" word in the title, this game looks exactly like the Armaggedon on Steam except for the sound, for sure most of the negative reviews came from this fact.Pros:-It´s a Worms Game, so its fun-Sound better than the original WWPCons:-The game lacks fps, I think this is a minor problem that T17 is going to resolve soon-The Main Menu isn´t remastered, stills at old resolution and isn´t friendly as in newer worms game, for example you can´t use arrows for preview sounds or maps fastly and need to click the drop-down menu, select the map/soundbank, preview it, and again...-I expected for a new online system with some kind of matchmaking, but still the old system.-Graphics are not redone (I understand thats a Remake, not a Remaster), so at 1080p the game feels bad with a high zoom out to keep the pixel ratioAt last I want to sorry for any misspelling at this review and hope this help you to decide if you are going to buy it or don´t			"

												**Edit: As Viisas_Mekkatorque reminded me... they did delay the game once so good job to Team17 for fixing the critical bug they discovered. However, this still doesn't remove the annoyance factor and occasional issues caused by the low resolution menu.**Original Review**I've spent countless hours playing the original version of Worms World Party on the Sega Dreamcast. When I saw the announcement that this was coming in a ""remastered"" version to PC I could not have been more excited.Unfortunately, this game did not deliver like I thought it would on Day 1. As many others have noted, the menu screen is at a very low resolution. With Team17 touting 1080p and 60FPS, one would think that they would deliver this ""standard"" throughout every aspect of the game.All I can say is this... If you are interested in this game, just give it some more time for Team17 to fix some of the Day 1 issues. However, with the ""trend"" in gaming of companies delivering broken products on Day 1, I am not happy that Team17 fell into this trap as well. A bit of a PSA to game companies: Please delay your game if you know it is not ready for release yet. You have a greater chance of losing fans if you release broken product than if you were to delay the game and have a proper release.			"

												I published a first review about this game a few hours ago. Maybe it wasn't clear for some people previously, so I'll try again to make them understand better about my opinion on this game:As a Worms Ultimate Mayhem player, I was curious about this WWPR and I purchased it to find out if it's a good Worms. The thing is, I couldn't have gone far enough. Why? Probably not because of the game itself, which seems quite feature-rich and fun for some players here. I requested (and obtained) a refund because of the so-called remastering we've been promised. I think it is just some kind of emulation of the old game, with some tweaks to ensure it works on the latest Windows:1-Menus and UI (in Menus) aren't upscaled, they are stuck to default resolution from back then when the game was released for the first time;2-There's no Windowed mode (I guess it wasn't available in the first release either, but for a remaster, we could have expected to see such a ""basic"" feature available on day one);3-Alt+Tab should be avoided with this game (I was stuck once, unable to do anything with the mouse, I had to open the task manager and kill the game, hurray...);4-The 1080p/60 fps combo: 1080p only during a match, and framerate usually drops to 50 and below.Selling a game with such a price for such a lazy emulation is quite steep...You'd better keep playing at your current Worms titles than buying this one.

i would advise buying this only on a deep deep sale if you want to play the campaign and don't own the original WWP already. Worms Armageddon is this game but better in pretty much every regard.20-10-2015 UPDATE: initially this release was really bad. a 640x480 frontend, alt+tab crashing, poor performance and corrupted last mission, all of which have been fixed with today's update! many points made in other reviews which have not been updated might be void, which is fair because this patch released very late. this release is still not worth buying. this review has been edited and partially rewritten sincethe main selling point of this release is high resolution support, which has been possible for years in the original version with a community-made patch. this is practically the exact same game with added leaderboards, generic resolution support and achievements. the achievements do not seem to have had any thought put into them, seemingly created by people who have never played the game before. the leaderboards are functional, but they could use more polish. (not that there's many people to compete with...)this game doesn't utilize any of the features added to Worms Armageddon over the past 14 years. not that it really matters because it would have been a wasted effort anyway. this release was dead on arrival and will never revive.the new sound effects are taken from some of the latest Worms games, they are not exactly new. most of them fit well enough, but it is good that they are optional. the implied ""Full Controller Support"" is just a lie, as there is no way to remap any of the buttons. unless you have a xbox controller, you are better off just using software like joy2key. not sure why anyone would want to play this game with a controller anyway. ""Imagine taking the perfect online gaming experience""; as far as Worms go, that's Worms Armageddon. it is updated and maintained by people who actually care about the game. team17 do not even know what made armageddon so great and keep on releasing inferior and unnecessary additions to the franchise. this release in particular is a cheap cash grab pandering to nostalgia, for the people who are not aware that WA exists and has been taken care of.what should have been done instead is a DLC (and a free update for owners of the original WWP) for Worms Armageddon that migrates all original Worms World Party content to the better version of the engine. when (if ever, hopefully) WWP exclusive content becomes usable in WA, all iterations of WWP will become fully obsolete.

												Game lacks any type of video options to change resolutions. Exitting the game from the in game menus results in the game merely being minimized and not closed. To boot the menu is extremely low resolution and, while the actual game does play in 1080p, the game screen is much to small on a 4k monitor to be playable and has no way of zooming in. Very annoying and led to my request for a refund.			"

												This is my first ever review. I do not consider myself a negative or toxic person, but this ""remastered"" version is bringing out the worst part of me. Me and my mates have been playing Worms World Party on LAN for ages now. We've used the original version, and that have been troublesome and exhausting at times. But more often than not we managed to pull through all the nonsense and actually have fun. We were very happy to see that Team 17 was going to release a remastered version and put it on Steam. We really didn't care much about the updated graphics, we just wanted to enjoy this little gem over the internet.So why am I fuming? Why am I not recommending this game?Well for starters, they really didn't remaster anything. It's so called 1080 - 60 FPS, but that is simply not true. It's a blatant ♥♥♥♥ing lie. Whenever you blow something up (and that is the ♥♥♥♥ING PURPOSE OF THE GAME), the whole screen freezes and the game drops BELOW 1 fps. And keep in mind this game is older than♥♥♥♥♥♥ And this happens for everyone in all game modes. Have Team 17 ever heard about testing? How the ♥♥♥♥ can a bug like that be able to survive to the launch? Are everyone at Team 17 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥?I must admit I was a bit disappointed about that. But you know what, for me it is not game breaking. You can still enjoy a nice round of fun Worms with your friends even if the FPS is terrible. So why am I still not going to recommend this game?Because you can not play over the internet. Well you can sometimes. A few times. But mostly you can't. Wormnet is really unstable, or it is something else with the game that is really unstable. Team 17 doesn't know. Team 17 doesn't care. Team 17 can suck my hairy testicles. And it really doesn't make any sense as to when or why you can or can't play the game online. I'm gonna round this review off with a friendly tip for whoever is in charge of remastering things at Team 17. When you remaster stuff, please make sure it works, please make sure the game does not get WORSE than the original game. Because when people buy a remastered version of a game they already own, and the remastered version eats donkeyass compared to the original game, people are going to be upset. And the bugs and problems with the remastered version are not exactly very well hidden and only affects very few people. They ARE VERY VISIBLE AND AFFECTS EVERYONE!			"

												Worms World Party Remastered is a re-release of the 2001 smash hit, Worms World Party. This game was released in July 2015.  The remastered edition has proven to not be as popular as the predecessors with only 6000 people picking this game up from Steam. The gameplay of Worms World Party Remastered is essentially the same as the original game. Absolutely everything is the same. The huge selection of weapons in your worm’s arsenal makes a return; the classics are still here such as bazookas and grenades, along with some of the newer weapons such as exploding sheep, homing pigeons and napalm strikes. The game has a single player mode, online multiplayer, and local multiplayer. I only played a couple of matches in the single player mode against the AI, but this proved to be a difficult matter, simply because the AI in this game totally knows how to control their weapons more than me, and can take the wind and other elements into consideration, meaning you'll probably get beaten. That being said, the multiplayer is where you'll get the most fun out of Worms as you should well know if you played the other games in the series. The online play is broken though, I tried playing and it is a convoluted mess. You have to put in IP addresses of servers, ports, everything that shouldn't be needed to be done in a remastered version of the game - when I finally managed to get it all set up, there was two people playing...two people in the multiplayer side of this game. There was no point me trying to get into the game as they were just sat in their own two separate lobbies themselves.  Where I had the most enjoyment and gameplay was in the local multiplayer playing with my partner.  Before you start a match, you get to create your own team of worms, giving your team a name, then naming all of your individual worms - next you can give your team a style of voice, with a large selection of accents to just from, customize your worms grave stones, and your teams flag. Finally you also get to choose your teams ""victory"" music which plays when you win a match.  The hot potatoes style gameplay of passing the controller between each other works just fine, as we were both laughing at each other's failings on their turns. One matched slowly turned into eight or nine matches, it became very competitive at times too. The graphics in Worms World Party Remastered didn't really get a massive revamp over the previous games; the resolution did get upped to 1080p though, which is a nice plus to see. The UI is clean and easy to navigate around. The audio in Worms’s games is always fascinating to me. The cute little worm voices which act as a sort of commentator to your turns all have a comical value attached to their lines. All of the weapons have an over the top sound effect with them too. The holy hand grenade is just beautiful

			Worms World Party Holy Hand Grenade test. This is just a little test video, to see what would happen. 2x Damage, Extra powered explosives and High Damage explosives to also enhance the experience.		

Worms is always a pick and play sort of game, I had played the previous game so I knew what to do, but my partner who had never played a worms game before was easily able to pick up the controls after a turn or two of playing, don't tell her I said this, but she actually got quite good and managed to beat me more times than I am happy to admit! If you feel that you want a little extra challenge in the game though, you can give one team more worms than the other one, giving you a handicap situation. Every single match in worms has a randomly generated world. You'll never fight on the same map more than once. The worlds which the game creates can sometimes give one team an unfair advantage, such as hiding a couple of worms in a remote location with no hope of them either doing anything remotely for a few turns, but this also means they can't get hurt for a few turns.  Along with the randomly generated terrain, there are also a number of weapon crate drops which happen at random points too; these crates hold the more rarer and powerful weapons such as nuclear tests and air strikes for example. On top of these weapon crates, you'll also find utility crates which hold more useful tools such as blowtorches, parachutes, teleports and many more of the more random items in the arsenal. Worms World Party Remastered does not have an end to the amount of content you can get out of it. You could literally play this game for hours on end and not get bored of it. We have only been playing the game for three hours now and see no reason for us wanting to stop anytime soon. This is definitely a game to keep installed for when you want to have a couple of games with your friends on the local multiplayer mode. Even though Worms World Party Remastered is supposedly the better version of the World Party game, it still had technical problems. Firstly, the game will refuse to run if your screens resolution is anything higher than 1080p. I had to lower my settings to this from 4k in Windows before I could even get past the main menu screen. The technical jargon that you need to do for any sort of online multiplayer should not be present in a remastered game. The game is on Steam so it should just run off the Steams network multiplayer options. Be warned, when playing online too; your external IP address is clearly shown for everyone to see... The only other small issue is that the menus also don't show in 1080, they are in 640 by 480. Whilst this isn’t a massive problem, the game shouldn’t really be advertising itself for being completely 1080. The game also works very well with the Steam controller as well as the regular Xbox pad. Worms World Party Remastered is definitely a game I will recommend, purely because it works on newer operating systems without you having to download patches and mods. I will say that you should only be looking at picking this game up if you plan on playing it locally with friends. The single player is not worth it, and the online multiplayer is non-existent now once you manage to get past the strange setup. Playing this game with friends will bring plenty of exciting times and tons of fun for a very little price of £10, 99.

												Mike (or anyone else from T17), what’s going on with the game? I have to say I'm very disappointed with you guys dropping the ball so badly on this one. I can't believe there has been no road map, or anything since release aside from ""we are collecting your feedback"". You guys were definitely among one of my favorite devs as you can see by my library but this one is starting to tarnish my views of T17 because of how poorly you have handled this giant disaster of a release.

												Worms World Party is a good game - is the remastered version 14 years later a good game?In comparison it is sad, how low the effort of work is, that was put into this game.Besides of the low res menu and the multiplayer browser, that is worse then the first battle.net from starcraft, things like 60fps are a joke, if it get's so serious drops on my laptop, that handles games like cs:go and skyrim easily, that even my keyboard inputs are not noted properly. Double Enter and Backspace becomes single enter and backspace all the time. And that's just for these controls. The other controls don't work any better. For the AI it works kind of smooth, but if it's my turn, the game is going dooowwnnn...I loved the old version and it's the reason, why I don't refund the game, but seriously, add some stuff into this game!Expand the Map editor and add more achievements. The existing 15 are such a joke and they don't even all work for me. Plantain Bombs and The Gun Show hasn't popped up yet.Adding achievements is such an easy task and all achievements that are implemented so far are plain boring:-Kill 10 Worms in one turn-Make more than 1337 damage in one turn-Make 1 kill with every F1(F2,F3,...,F11) weapon  -Reduce your own team health by using Scales of Justice-Gain 250HP by using Scales of Justice-Collect a crate with a sheep-Collect a crate with a super/aqua sheep-Get one kill with every f3 weapon in one match-Kill an enemy worm by using kamikaze while jumping(being mid-air)-Infect three enemy worms with suicide bomber-Teleport your worm to the height cap of the map-Win a (David vs goliath and any other mode) match-Drop a weapon while using ninja rope-Use all utilities in one turn-Kill with the Blow Torch and Pneumatic Drill in one match-Make 100 kills with Prod, etc.-Get a kill with fire punch, dragon ball and kamikaze all by the same worm in one match.-Drown all animal weapons at least once-Use freeze right before sudden death/indian nuclear test-Use three girder starter packs in one match-Destroy 3 crates in one turn-Destroy 3 oil drums in one turn-Kill a worm by a mine that was shoot by an arrow-Let a worm slide over water at least 6 times before it drowns-Slide over the water and survive-Kill all worms with armageddon in a matchAnd there are a lot more things, that could have been an achievement but no let's take ""Kill an enemy worm with the Holy Hand Grenade""I'll change the review, if you add a lot more features.

												Is this a good game? Yes. Should you buy this game? No.Worms World Party is at it's core, the great 2D Worms game that we have all come to love over the years. It is Worms at it's greatest. However, this game is being sold under false pretenses. Instead of having the title 'Worms World Party Remastered', it should actually be called 'Worms World Party Steam Edition'. Team 17 have taken Worms World Party and done as little work as possible in order to get it working with modern computers and modern monitors.The standout improvements to the game are 1080p support, and controller support. The problem is that these are about the only major improvements to this nearly 15 year old game and even those improvements come with caveats. For instance, the 1080p support is only when in game. The main menus have not been improved from the 15 year old game and are extremely low resolution. Controller support feels a bit tacked on as things like scrolling and positioning don't work as well as they should.It is quite obvious that this is just a port of the original game as many of the limitations of the original are still present. Probably the most egregious of these issues is the way multiplayer is handled. More specifically hosting of multiplayer games. You can't install the game then go straight into hosting multiplayer games. In order to host a game you first need to go into your router and set up port forwarding. You then need to edit the registry and finally you need to enter your WAN IP address into the game. This is unacceptable. The hosting issue alone has nearly killed the community for this game dead. I have seen the ridiculous situation where there were 10 people in a lobby all wanting to play a multiplayer game but none of them could host a game so no one could play. I ended up writing a Steam guide to try and help people get around this problem. It is this hosting problem which I think has led to the multiplayer being pretty much dead. The game has only been out for a week and the average player count is 9.5 players per hour (http://steamcharts.com/app/270910). This number is also made up of people playing single player as well. Good luck trying to find a multiplayer game.Then there is the menus. They look like they are presented in 640x480 resolution and they look dated design wise as well. When in game the resolution is 1080p but the weapon select screen is not scaled properly so is very small and makes it difficult to see what the icons are. Those are the major issues but there are quite a few other little niggles.This game is not a remaster. It is a quick cash grab. The original game has had a minimal amount of work done to it to make it compatible with modern computers and that is about it.We have been complaining to Team 17 on the forums and the Team 17 rep told us he would have a plan of action to present to us in order to improve the game by the end of the week. The end of the week has come and gone with no word from the rep. I believe it is pretty unlikely that the game will ever be improved as there is no financial incentive for Team 17 to do so. The game is dead on arrival. Basically I would say to any potential buyers, don't do it. Don't support Team 17 who have taken the good will of their fans for granted for too long. This is a quick cash grab and the game has no future. Don't waste your money or time on this.			"

They got a lot of time to do great remastered version of Worms World Party but they just changed it to piecie of bugged game. Nothing, NOTHING MORE than new sounds and resolution. You got at this same price WOMRS ARMAGEDDON - better game with more players.+ Refund system.+ Worms Armageddon are still better.- Bugs.- More Bugs.- Cannot change game schemes.- They still think everything is OKAY.- Low resolution on menu.- Bad optimization.

												I'm so disappointed in this game. 1080p remastered is just like changing options file's resolution to 1920x1080, I mean menus are all 640x480 and the most disappointing thing is game is laggy. Like old days I wanted to play some Shopper & Roper games and it's the worst money on steam that I've paid. As a worms fan that has been playing worms since Worms II just stay away from this game.

												This game is exactly what the title says: WWP Remastered (for modern systems). It doesn't add anything new, it's simply the same old game, now playable through Steam. It does have an option for new audio effects, but I switched to classic audio from the start so can't really say anything about that. So keep that in mind before buying! For me personally, it's everything I was looking for - pure nostalgia.			"

												I meet the minimal requirements to play this game but for some reason it is just really broken. It would run fine for a bit but then it will suddenly slow down and the fps would not come back until you quit the game. I spend almost £10 on this game excited at the fact that they actually released this game on steam and I was let down. If I can play CS:GO then I should be able to play this... why can't I?Update:Don't get me wrong I love Team 17. I have Worms Armageddon and it runs fine. It's just this remaster was poorly optimized.			"

												I love worms, I really do, but this ""Remaster"" is hardly an improvement and certainly not worth picking up if you have the original. The worst thing about the ""Remaster"" is that all the menus are dated and still in their original resolution, and switches to 1080p every time you start a mission and then reverts back to the lower resolution menu after the mission ends via success or failure. I like the addition of controller support and steam achievements, but they even managed to flop the multiplayer aspect making it difficult to connect to other players practically killing online play.Another in game offense being the tiny menus whilst selecting weapons and the lack of innovation with the UI such as the ability to restart a mission half way through like any other modern game; and not to mention occasional lag on a high performance gaming pc.Sadly the game was gifted to me and I'm unable to get a refund.I’ll update my review to positive providing the game is updated and fixed.TL:DR Not worthy of the title “remaster”, poor UI, and difficult to access online play.

												I've been massively disappointed in Worms World Party Remastered. It's great to have this game in 1080p and also to know that it hasn't been forgotten about. The game initially launched with a full screen menu resolution of 640x480 resolution which is unforgivable for a remaster. This has now been improved to 1080p but I still have multiple problems trying to run this game on a 1440p monitor, with a dual monitor setup. Going into the options menu also crashes my game every time. I might have been more forgiving if the initial settings/options/start a game had all been in a windowed mode before launching a full screen game. As it is, I'm not sure why I didn't just install the original Worms World Party and use some community patches to bring better compatibility for newer operating systems. I'd give this one a miss.

												I was so excited for this game when they announced it. Me and my friends often play Worms Armageddon but we felt that we wanted a new game in the series so World Party sounded like a perfect investment. As soon as it became available we all bought it but the problems started all at ones.The menu is not in a good resolution, the game lags at points, it crashes for some of us, the sounds are not always correct and basically, it's the same game as before. To every one who wants to buy this, stay the hell away from it. Play Armageddon or the old world party instead. I asked Steam for a refund which I got because this is not okay. I may pick it up in the future when Team 17 have hopefully patched it and it's on sale.			"

												As someone who's played the original game for 10 years, I couldn't find much new/worthwhile here. The new soundeffects are simply not needed since the old sounds are way more nostalgic. Introduction of hiscores in singleplayer however has made it more interesting to try for the best scores. I guess if you don't have this game anymore and want to experience the game again in a bit better resolution, be my guest. The pricetag may be bit too steep though.			"

												Absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing rancid.  You'd get more of your money's worth out of that Dishonored remaster... oh yeah, now you know you're in for it.The mouse is heavily filtered and will cross the screen twice with the slightest nudge, its performance is very unstable (on an R9 280, mind you), and the ninja rope physics are gimped.  Oh, and it's got ""Remastered"" tacked on as a buzzword, since the menus are still locked to 480p and the game doesn't scale well at all, plus it looks exactly the same as the original release.  No, telling us the resolution is unlocked does NOT count as a ""remaster.""There's no proper way to view the arsenal, because as I mentioned before, the mouse crosses the screen at 32x speed and is accelerated/post-processed to the point of unusability.  Combine that with the fact that it's about two cm on screen, and it's unusable.  Just use the arrow keys, right?  NOPE.  Instead, you'll have to memorize each microscopic picture for which Function button it applies to (as in, F1-F12) and which one it is in the lineup of shared F keys.  Did I mention that the ninja rope physics are a pile of♥♥♥♥♥  They're a pile of♥♥♥♥♥This is dreadful and yet another nail in Team 17's coffin as they fall from grace.

												""Remastered""? No improvements other than 1080p... I mean it.If you are looking to play with your friend over LAN, feel free to buy, during a Sale though. Not much problem with that part: the user interface is obscure (but you'll get used to it), and there is a tiny lag. Also, don't alt-tab. It crashes. What bothers me is that the game is not worth the price or the ""remastered"" title. (because of quality, NOT gameplay)-Don't expect much from ""online multiplier"" over server. see other comments for details.-The Local Area Network multiplayer is somewhat laggy; even when you really play on the same network (instead of hamachi). It is minor though.-Compatibility issues and crash..-Main Menu user interface has not changed AT ALL. They even left the resolution same. +Yet again, it is Worms World Party and still definitely wonderfully very much fun to play, But that's nothing new.			"

If anything its more of a ""Re-doing"" of the same game from years ago with a few updates that Does Not justify the price tag...I was suckered by the nostalgia I had for this as a kid and made me question if the game can even redeem itself anymore. On the up side the core gameplay is identical to the original so all the fond memories flouris back. The downer is everything else! low resolution in menu, no change to the original overview of the game other than it says ""Remastered"" underneath the title ::laughable:: and the online doesnt even funtion unless you go out of your way and configure your router. Bottomline, i was looking for a rejuvination of worms world party with easy to navigate and cleaner looking presentation. Overal the poor construct of the online multiplayer really hurt the game BADLY and does not carry the game at all with only the singleplayer and local matches...

												Would not recommend. Not ""remastered"" at all. Low resolution on large monitor means the whole level sits in a small portion of your monitor. No windowed mode available. Main menu contains rednering artifacts and only renders in a picture-in-picture 640*480 frame. Options menu only displays black screen. Gameplay is reasonably true to the original but game still stutters frequently during explosions.  "

												I see all the negative reviews below and I just don't understand all the ranting. Steam version of Worms World Party IS a remastered one - works on modern computers, has HD ingame (not in menus, true, but you REALLY care about these THAT much?...), also has new sound files - optional ones, can be disabled in options. All the rest is as it was several years ago. I was looking for this, for a familiar party game, I'm happy to have it. I recommend. :3			"

Product received for free
												First of all before starting this review, I admit I was worried about this port: there was a flood of complains back when this game got out on STEAM with many people complaining the game had many issues. Because of that I was with some doubts if I could get the game or not without fearing of having to ask for a refund. In the end I ended getting this as a gift and I decided to have a look if what people were saying is true. In the startup I did have two issues: the title screen and menu was a bit small with the clouds dragging on the black frame around it. Once I reached the Options screen, the screen went completely black, impossible to see anything. I had to open the task manager of Windows to exit the program. However, once I restarted the game those issues were gone. Since then I tested the game for several hours and I found NO issues anymore. Quick Match, Training, Missions, Deathmatch, Options and Online matches were working 100%. I dunno if I was either lucky or the developers launched patches in the meantime but by my experience with this port I can safely tell people that they can buy with trust.As for the review, this is a sequel of the best Worms title up to date, Worms Armageddon, using the same game engine. This sequel not only counts with the most positive features of Armageddon but it includes many novelties like Wormapedia, Team Battlefields, Wormpot for random match rules, new missions and a MUCH more complete training campaign, allowing both unnexperienced and experienced players to learn the possibilities and tricks of the game and improve their skills.The remastered version counts with new sound effects (that are optional to use or not) and a graphically improved menu. As a personal suggestion, I would like to see the game supporting in future higher resolutions than just Full HD: Armageddon is capable of this.To keep it short, Worms World Party is an obligatory title to Worms fans to expand even further from the Armageddon universe and to fans of fun and cartoony strategy games. 100% recommended!

												For starters, just to make things clear, this isn't a ""remake"". You know, like the old games getting remakes with modern graphics and possibly new features? No, no. This is not a remake, and people seem to be confusing it with one. This is a ""remaster"", which means you can just nicely run this game in 1080p on modern PCs without any pixelation or issues. There obviously isn't a lot to remaster in a flippin' Worms game, so the difference isn't huge, but the point is that it works! It doesn't crash, it doesn't bug out, it doesn't do weird things - it just works, and that's all I wanted. they also give you some remastered sounds as a bonus, but I just switched to the old ones to get my nostalgia fix (and because I think they still sound better than the new ones).Now that we have that out of the way, the actual review:It's a great game. It's basically Worms Armageddon with a few added features and most things unlocked from the start. (To be fair, I don't have the Steam version of Worms Armageddon, so I don't know how that looks like, but I at least assume they couldn't have changed much) It's honestly the golden era of Worms, and it never got even near the perfection of Armageddon-World Party ever again, sadly. So many hours spent in local multiplayer with my friend when we were young, getting gold medals in all the missions and challenges, achieving elite rank in the deathmatch, ahh. Worms is also where all the ""party"" games started, really. It's THE party game.The only real issue could be the online multiplater because that, too, has not been changed from the original. And you probably know how that looked like in late 90s to early 2000s in some games... I'm not entirely sure if it even works.If you have never played it and like Worms, what are you waiting for?If you have played it before you know how great it is, so what are you waiting for?If you are not familiar with Worms it's time to get familiar with this piece. What are you waiting for? (Also perhaps stop living under a rock)			"

												I have decided to change my recommendation since you can download the missing voices and other files and easily add them to the game's data, but those files shouldn't have been missing in the first place. I also can't seem to get replays to work, which is very disappointing. It's still a very fun game and playing in 1080p is awesome, so I do have to recommend one of my favorite games ever.			"

												If ths is the game post-update, I dread to think how this game shipped. I am dead serious when I say that my old PS1 version of this game ran smoother. Seriously, this is the fastest I have ever had the hype train derail completely.I can't make the game run fullscreen at 1920 x 1080p. For some reason, there's some letterboxing going on and the aspect ratio looks more like 21:9. 


What the hell, Team17?? 
A Screenshot of Worms World Party Remastered
By: Cheesesnakes




 <--- This is the only aspect I can play the game at. The dynamic zoom seems to be broken, at least for me.Attempting to change the screen resolution or render quality softlocks the game. Always a sign of quality.No AA-settings ensures that all the edges look like crap. Come on, it's 2015, this shouldn't be this hard. I swear the game looks so much better when I force AA through my graphics card settings. Another sad part is the criminal lack of game modes in the multiplayer game menu. There's no ""for fun"" mode with all weapons. And I mean ALL. Don't hide away the concrete donkey, guys. I remember my PS1 version having a metric butt-ton of pre-defined weaponsets and half of them seem to be missing.The interface for the terrain generator/pre-made backdrops is abysmal. Worms Armageddon / Worms 2 has a better one. In a HD remake, I expect to have a proper preview instead of the gallery thumbnail. The game seems to abandon all settings you toggle. I tried to turn off the remastered audio, but the game clearly didn't agree with me and checked the box right back like I had offended it dearly.Font rendering is also screwed. Team17, if you want to include an ümlaut Ü in your game, pick a font that supports it. It is jarring as all hell to see a letter rendered in Arial just sit there, being taller and blockier than any other text. TL;DR the boxed copy I got fourteen years ago that was bundled with a shockwave-based installer somehow manages to run better than the remaster.EDIT: No Low Gravity mode. Is this the same game that I used to play daily in the past??			"

												First of all, I know I have low hour's, but please read. For those who are wondering, This is a digital re-release of the game Worms World Party, This remaster add's the ability to play with a controller, resolution's up to 1080p, a completly redrawn UI, and optional new sound effect's. This may not be enough to be considered a remaster, but let's be honest, I am sure a few people out there wanted a digital re-release of this game for some time, and the fact that Tick Tock and Team17 went out of their way to do these new thing's, to make the game fit better with modern time's, show they care about this game. Amother great thing about this remaster, is that the original engine is here, with the psyics's you love and remember. Overall, I highly recommened this for any Worms fan, especially if you are not too sure on how to get the original world party running on newer OS's.			"

												The majority of the negative reviews have played leww than 2 hours and are outdated. The worms series, for me at least, has always been what's kept local multiplayer alive. From the chaos of the Armaggedon to the careful precision of the grenades, Worms World Party is guaranteed fun, and there is finally a version that works on newer computers! So pull up a seat, turn on Aqua Sheep, crates, crates and more crates, and every crate contains sheep, prepare to kiss your friendships goodbye and play!			"

												When this game was first released, it was terrible. Team 17 somehow managed to poorly remake this classic game, but two patches later, and it is doing the original proud.I have always thought Worms World Party is the best worms game around, and is better than Armageddon, simply because it's pretty much exactly the same as Armageddon, except it has several new additions.Sure Armageddon is good because of the countless community updates, but this is the best 'official' one.A must have for any Worms fan. This is the best 'classic' Worms game.			"

Couldn't get it to work on LAN.. I had old CD of my game which I bought 15 years ago and I was able to make it work better with hamachi.

At least now everyone who doesn't have a physical copy can easily buy a virtual one now. :PIf you do have the physical copy though, you probably don't need to get this (unless, due to lack of compatability between the two versions, your friend has this one and you want to play mulitplayer).P.S.

I have some strange box that looks like it came from Windows 98 in the top left (i presume 640x480, so its a fairly large) covering the screen. The mouse also does not work in match, meaning i cant use half the weapons, the controls seem really backwards, (back space jumps while space is fire, may be changeable in settings i never looked) the game flat out crashes when you start it on windows 10 and it just IS NOT remastered, all they did was change a config file for extra resolution, aspect ratios  and FPS.Severely disappointed!Should you buy it?: NoWould I get a refund?: Tried.

												It's WWP. It works in modern systems in 1080p. It continues to be insanely fun. Cons:- It's the same as it was 15 years ago. Don't come expecting anything new- Replays don't seem to work at allHighly recommended			"

												This gets a very tenuous reccomendation from me, as..well, it's not a remaster by any stretch of the imagination. As many have said, and I will say again, there is nothing to support the idea that it's a remaster. I mean, Team 17 could have just as easily not used that word, and release it in a smilar state to Worms Amageddon, and I think everyone might have taken kinder to it. This is could be considered false advertisement, and with good reason. If it's not what it claims, then people will call you out on it.That being said, the good points I can make about the game are that..well, it's the WWP game, unchanged, and maybe, it's a good thing. Aside from the naff effects, which you can thankfully turn off. That..seems to be it, really.Like I said, I can't give it a full reccomendation, since it's not 'remastered' anymore than just slapping a patch on it.  If you don't have it already in any form, you might consider getting it. If you do, then it's a little pointless, since you can get the same thing using mods already. If T17 dropped the word, and just stated that it's a new patch for Steam, then maybe, they might have a chance. Right now? I'm not in a hurry to reccomend it.			"

												Worms, what a great game it was.First I bought Worms Armageddon. I wanted to play it with a friend, we couldn't figure out how to play together. It sucked, it sucked hard. A few months later we wanted to give ""Worms"" another try. At this point we already knew we would regret our decision. Whatever. We did it anyway. We bought THIS. Worms World Party Remastered.REMASTERED! It is from 2015!! It has to be playable? It has to work properly?! right?! NO!! No, it doesn't.♥♥♥♥ THIS. This ""remastered"" version is worse than Hitler.If you want to be disapointed go ahead, klick buy. 5/7 would buy againgreat game			"

												In my personal opinion, I think this game is getting far more negative reviews then it deserves...Not only is this the same game that I remember as a kid, but it's also the game that introduced me to the Worms franchise in the first place!So I applaud them for the fact that they even re-released this on Steam at all!Basically; what you’re getting is the same Worms World Party from 2001, but with better resolution and enhanced (optional) sound effects. Other than that, it’s practically the exact same game from when it first debut.So if you liked Worms World Party when it first came out and still enjoy it today, then I highly recommend getting it. Especially since the original disc-version I own doesn’t seem to even run on Windows 7 anymore...So while I techinically wouldn't call it a ""remastered"" game, it is still the same old fun game that I can remember.

												Worms World Party was released in 2001, two years after Worms Armageddon. It was referred to many as a big disappointment, because it hardly offered anything extra to the plate – Wormpot (where you can alter the game in various ways), some extra single play missions, a mission editor… and precious little else.In Mid 2015 – Worms World Party Remastered was released on Steam. Once again, the new features were very minimal. It boasted higher resolution (which Worms Armageddon had YEARS ago), Steam Trading Cards, Achievements and a few other things that in my opinion, were not very noteworthy.Thankfully I bought this on a sale at around £3, and that was only to revisit the single play missions. There was no way I was going to fork out £10.99 for this half-baked product.PROS:-	Achievements and Trading Cards, which is something I guess.-	Wormpot offers a lot of diversity. You can have permanent Double Damage, Super Rope, or Unlimited Crate Shower           to name but a few selections.-	A lot of Single Play Missions. Although some are pretty samey, some are really unique and actually quite fun to play.-       The Mission Editor is also fun to use; good if you're the creative type and you know a group of friends who will play your missions.CONS:-	Let’s get the biggest problem of the game dealt with first. Online Multiplayer is virtually non-existent. Compare that to Worms Armageddon, where you usually see twenty plus people during the evening (UK), here, you are lucky to see one person at any time. This is a major issue, especially since multi-play is the absolute foundation of Worms. -	Although Wormpot is a unique feature, about 75% of the options to choose from are just plain uninteresting and lazy. High powered Firearms, High Powered Animals, High Powered this, High Powered That. We’re not all kids that crave ‘big-boom’ weapons. It just shows a lack of originality.-	The screen feels ‘choppy’ , and that’s with all the features cut down. Likely, this is something I encounter on my computer only, but when Worms Armageddon runs smoothly on the same resolution, why am I having issues here?-	No features to unlock. It was a rewarding experience in Worms Armageddon, where you got an extra utility or an extra option to modify should you complete a mission. Here, everything is unlocked at the start – so it doesn’t feel all that satisfying when you do beat a hard challenge. Then again, there isn’t really a lot more features at the start anyway.-	The Steam Achievements, again, are unimaginative. Complete all the missions, Complete Deathmatch, Drown 100 worms… yeah fair enough, but the majority are pretty lame and can honestly be accomplished by accident. Woo, I attacked the same worm with the bow and arrow twice. Wow! Have an achievement!Overall, Worms World Party is the inferior younger brother to Worms Armageddon. Unless you can get it really cheap – and that’s really just for the single play missions – don’t waste your money here.52/100			"

												This is Worms World Party, just the way I remember it. It's the best Worms game ever made, and, after years of terrible Worms games and 3D, it has aged remarkably well. Running without issues on Windows 10.It's getting alot of justified criticism due to the word 'Remastered'--it shouldn't be called a remaster, rather a 'Steam edition'. It is false advertising. This is because the game has  is still in the original resolution outside the gameplay, and not much has actually been 'remastered', apart from the gameplay, which is in 1080p and a solid 60fps. It's the same game with more resolution options tacked on and Steamworks support.However, why would this matter? Of all the games, a 2D Worms game is the last one that needs to be in 1080p and 60fps. There are also new audio and sound effects, which, as a fan of the original release in 2001, I really appreciate.This is the same game that shipped in 2001, with 1080p gameplay and new audio. However, despite the false advertising, I'm still inclined to give this a positive review. This is because this is a working version of Worms World Party for modern operating systems--the old 2001 'Sold Out' version, which I still own a physical copy of, no longer works with Windows 7, nevermind Windows 10 which I recently upgraded to. I have been longing to play Worms World Party again for many years, so I am thrilled to be able to do that again.So in short, if you don't care about the false advertising and, like me, just want to play LAN or Local games of Worms World Party for nostalgic value or fun, pick it up. It was my first Worms game, and has always been my favourite, due to the amount of fond memories I have of it :)			"

												only sale :(By saying ""only sale"" I meant only for the summer and winter steam sales. Why only on sale ? 1) Screen is stuck at 640x480  resolution  in the main menu and you can not change it2) Description says that the game should run at 60fps, for me personally it was 20fps 3) Multiplayer through wormsnet like 10 years ago :( 4) The game is essentially a rerelease of the original game intact. If you have more questions, ask and I will answer. I am a fan of worms series, I really love this game but this ""remaster"" is not very good.			"

												Worms World Party Remastered is, fundamentally, unchanged from its original version. Team17 seem to have misunderstood a bit what ""remastering"" actually is, meaning that this is only a ""remaster"" in a very loose sense. However, there is no denying that whilst it hasn't undergone any radical changes, the result is that this is still the same Worms World Party we know and love, for the same price as Worms Armageddon on Steam, and arguably offering a superior experience due to the new ""WormPot"" modes and the added controller support, which is surprisingly well-implemented.Originally, ther menus were rendered in 640x480, but with a new update, the menus have now been vastly improved with much nicer graphics and fon, not that the menus actually looked any worse with the old resolution. As for the ""remastered"" sound effects, I really quite like them, they sound a lot nicer than WWP's original sound effects, and if you turn them off you've basically just got the original Worms World Party.

												I don't need to grind hours of gameplay to make a review about this game. I started playing WWP when computers still run Windows XP (or earlier versions?) and I fell in love with it. Being able to customise it to my own liking is the grand icing on the cake, and a reason why I still go back to it from time to time.PERFECT to play with friends, still great if you plan to go solo, haven't played much in Online but those few times I did I learned something new.The only downside to this game is that some content from the original game (some speeches and flags, and some other things I assume) are missing.BUT, since WWP Remastered is still the awesome and highly customisable game that I learned to love, AND I just happen to still have my own copy of the original game, I just copy-pasted the missing stuff in the proper Steam folders.So that drops the downsides down to NONE.If this isn't clear enough, I am definitely recommending it.Even if you have the original already, meet someone who has the Remastered version and give it a try!

												It's hardly a remaster but it's still the best Worms game they ever made. The Worm Pot adds so much more that Armageddon just cannot compare to. I spent hours on this game with friends when I was younger, from trying to get the highest damage in one turn to making the best base to survive Armageddon (bonus points for doing it on 2x damage!) and it's a hell of a lot of fun doing it all over again. The only downsides are not being able to add bots to multiplayer and they removed some of my favourite accents from the soundboard (RIP Rasta and Kamikaze).10/10 would drop concrete donkey again			"

												I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews, so here's some counterbalance.It's still the same adictive game that we've grown so fond of, with excellent gameplay. However, there are some things you'll wish to consider:This is still Worms world Party, so if you already own this game, you're not gaining a lot by buying this version. all you get is native 1080p in the matches and some fancy new sound effects.About these soundeffects: I'm very gratefull that Team17 gives you the option whether to use these new effects, or stick with the classic set. While I respect the effort they put into the new  effects, they just sound too overdone for my taste.If you have Worms Armageddon, there's a few different consideration. WWPR, just like the original WWP, added the Wormpot feature: 3 slots where you can set additional rules/features. such as red blood graphics or earthquakes between each turn. Be advised, however, that hosting from behind a router is less easily setup compared to W:A. WWP doesn't have the Hostbuddy system. So if you want to host, you'll have to portforward (there's a guide on here already which worked for me)Performance: NO, WWPR does not yet perform at the promised 60fps for me (I get 40 to 50 with R9-270x). For me, even if this doesn't end up being fixed, the gameplay is smooth enough and there's no need to worry about it. So if this is your only fear about buying this game, I would suggest you just try it. Either it works and you'll have one hell of a blast, or you can easily get a refund from steam.			"

												Well we start at the beginning, my first computer got it in 2006, Worms World Party was one of the first games that I had in it and thank you to my brother to get me this fantastic game, since that day I loved the Worms series, I am fanatic since today, I have played all their games including those who are not on Steam, and I have to say that this game meets promised at the foot of the letter, it meets every one of its features, in my opinion people who valued the game negatively are ignorant, not are if they expected a 4D Worms with variations of weapons or something but I regret to tell you that this is not his game.Worms World Party Remastered is just what I expected, hours of fun as when was 6 years old, Worms World Party in its former glory with a small touch of current technology.I recommend it with the heart 10/10 <3●Thanks to all who bothered to look at my analysis completely●			"

You enjoy the old days of ""worming it out""? ""winkwink*You don't care for the word ""remastered"" but the game you loved in your childhood to experience again on pc with controller support and online capibilities?If any of the above apply to you...THEN LOOK NO FURTHER LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.FOR THIS GAME IS WHY PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF FELL IN LOVE WITH WORMS.Just buy the game to experience some fantastic old school coach gaming with a hint of more modern features to help bring the game forward to more recent days. Are other worms games of the same generation very much like this one... Yes in its core but the extra features such a more weapons, decent controller support and online capibilities is enough to swing that to a very much recommended game over the others.			"

												I think that people need to get the F over the fact that the menu isn't in 1080p. Yeah its a pain but get over it already. Also I'm really apalled at what some people think 'remastered' means. It doesn't mean that the game has added elements into it, it means that the game is now up to current gen standards with its graphics. Look at the Last of Us Remastered they added absolutely nothing to the game. Sure they added the dlc to it but that really doesn't count because in this situation, Worms World Party doesn't have any dlc. But again all they did with the Last of Us is up the fps and resolution. So get the F over not having anything new in the game.			"

												THIS REVIEW HAS BEEN EDITED AFTER SOME MORE GAMEPLAY HOURS. PLZ READ BOTTOM. THE FIRST PART WAS MY POINT OF VIEW IN THE FIRST MINUTES OF THE GAME AND IT CHANGED DRASTICALY AFTER A FEW HOURSDont buy this game if you are expecting huge improvements in the previows non-remastered title. This, like i know you can guess from the title is a remaster of a game. ITS NOT A DIFFERENT GAME.  It plays like the old one, feels like the old one and overall is the old one. Remastering isnt about changing the game its about adding some more litlle things to make it more enjoyable. Team 17 added, like they said themselfs:""Shiny 1080p graphics with 60 fps""""Enhanced weapon sound effects""""Cloud Saves""""Full Controller Support""""Steam Leaderboards""""Steam Achievements""Besides this things dont expect other improvments to the game. it doesnt have them. The game is amazing and super fun and its currently my favorite worms game of the franchise. It feels a litlle bit cluncky when playing online and i think that feature should be improved but overall if you are interested in anything other than the online experience you should definitely check this out.Edit1: After some more hours into the game i finally understood where all the bad reviews where coming from. The main problem is definitely in the online version. The menus are very old and outdated and its hard to create an half decent room to play in. The only availble server is the one that was created in 2001 in the UK. THERE ARE NO MORE SERVERS!!! -Controller is not fully supported because still lacks stuff in many ways. expecially when traveling between menus. It still need a keybard for almost everything.-A lot of sound related bugs are found when playing the game very frequently.-Yeah it has achievments but 12 achivments or nothing is almost the same thing.-I honestly am never going to use steamleadboards because the online sucks soo much im only gonna play it from time to time.Veredict: is basicaly the same worms world party game with no improvments at all. Or at least i really can´t see why they call it a remaster. I still recommend it and its a good game but i honestly wasnt expecting it to be soo outdated. We are in 2015 not in 2001 Team17!!! THIS IS THE ORIGINAL GAME NOT A REMASTER. They basically added steam interactions to it. I still recommend it but buy it knowing that it is still the same old game and not a new one			"

On Controllor Support)Cons:-No 60fps-Bad Title Screen-Alittle Laggy-Weird Contols (For New Players)-I Dont Want To Call It A Remastered Version Of W:WP (I Will Call It A Steam Version w/ New Updates In The Game)Just Hope For All The People That Dislike This Game Because Of All The Problems, Just Hope There Will Be A New Update Soon Or Later (If There Was A Mix Button On The Recommend Buttons It Will Be A Mix)Updates: 6 (Times)			"

												You just CAN'T disrespect Worms World Party. If you wanted 4D Worms with infinite variations of weapons and the possibility to make them enter into another game, then I'm sorry. But Remastered is just what I expected, good old Worms World Party in its old glory with a little bit of most recent technology. PROTIP: If you are disappointed because of bugs or errors, go to community, post the problem and wait for it to be acknowledged and resolved.			"

												Basically the exact same as the Worms World Party I bought ten years before I got this edition. Except it's £10 rather than £5 (remember Soldout games?) and some of the sounds are different (if you want them to be). No new customisation options that I've seen, and the AI is still as terrible as it was (the difficulty level only seems to change what percentage of their shots will be unbelievably good and what percentage will be unbelievably stupid and innacurate). Even so, this might be the definitive 2D worms game for playing with friends.			"

												This game feels and plays just like it was 15 years ago! The remastered version includes updated graphics for modern resolutions, and a good take on ""remastered"" audio. There is even an option to use ""old"" audio - and, though new version is good, it seems to miss the old flavour.In terms of gameplay, nothing've changed, though it seems that the enemy AI reacts a bit faster now.Recommend for everyone!

												If you want to play an older version of Worms in multiplayer than buy Worms Armageddon instead (which is almost identical in terms of gameplay). It's nice that they are trying to resurrect Worms World Party and all, but the ressurection attempt is still buggy and has almost no players online. Worms Armageddon on the other hand is significantly better maintained and actually HAS a large community of players in multiplayer.			"

Favorite Worms game - least favorite Worms port, so farWWP is a childhood classic that I used to enjoy back in the Win 98/XP days. I was bummed out that it didn't work on modern machines until this Steam edition was finally unleashed in 2015. This ""remaster,"" however, is pretty crooked and selling it for $14.99 is asking a little too much. Frequent lags or crashes and lack of proper online support make it a big turn off. I did buy this for half-price in order to support the developers at least somehow, but I would agree with the rest that Armageddon is the optimal choice if you want to have the best classic Worms experience. My final verdict - World Party still screams nostalgia, but this particular edition can be improved big time. Play Worms Armageddon in the meantime.6/10 "
