													Avadon 2 very much takes the ""more of the same"" approach to sequel writing.  It has everything the first game had, only bigger areas, more side quests, new classes, and more companions.  Unfortunately, I've never really liked the Avadons as much as I have some of Spiderweb's other games and I think I've finally worked out why: they are games about politics where there's really not a whole lot at stake that's interesting.  This point sticks out more than it otherwise might given that Spiderweb has already done politics heavy RPGs so superbly in the Geneforge games.  In the Geneforges, each political faction was modeled around answers to central ethical and philosophical questions about the nature of personhood, human rights, eugenics, and  power.  This makes each of the factions not only easily identifiable, but immediately engaging as the issues at stake are so emotionally charged and relevant to our own world.  The brilliant thing about the Geneforges is that they use their faction systems to rigorously dissect these issues from a variety of different angles, continually muddying and graying them so that you often find yourself taking ethical positions that you'd never thought you'd take a few hours (or games) earlier.  	In contrast to the Geneforges, though, Avadon's political squabbles tend to be over much more dry and mundane things like land and political rule and the moral and ethical stakes are never as clear or well defined.  While the games do delve into the question of how much freedom citizens should be willing to give up in exchange for safety, the issue is never really tackled with much rigor or emotional resonance.  Likewise, the various political groups themselves are not as philosophically distinct and tend to blur together as a consequence.  Which ultimately makes it hard to choose sides, not because of the presence of any moral ambiguity, but because of the absence of any reason to care.  It's very hard to get invested in a plot that is, ultimately, about nothing more than squabbles over who gets to control digital land in a digital fantasy world.	All that said, when it comes to being not as good as the Geneforge series, many, many, RPGs fall short.  So I don't mean to suggest that Avadon 2 is a bad game.  I enjoyed it a great deal and if you like turn based, party focused, RPGs you probably will too.  It's just disappointing as I know Spiderweb is capable of doing way better. "

												Avadon 2 is the direct sequel to Avadon: The Black Fortress. You take control of a new band of heroes as you wield your might on behalf of Avadon.Battles are turn based and are governed by action points, which are expended through both movement and use of skills. As expected, health and stamina bars are also present alongside four core stats - strength, dexterity, intelligence and endurance. Additionally each character also has resistances to four damage types and four possible status effects. Character builds are developed using a skill tree, which requires you to pump more points into particular branches if you want to reap the full benefits of a particular branch. There is a retrainer NPC who allows you to redistribute all your points if you are ever unhappy with your character build, but you need to reach a particular point in the game before they become available. There are five possible classes to choose from for your character, with Avadon 2 adding in a new class, the tinkermage who specialises in creating turrets and machines that can aid you in battle. The entire cast of characters comprises one of each class type so you will always have the potential strengths of each class at your disposal throughout the game. Avadon 2 features a standard grid based inventory management system, a junk bag for storing useless items so they can be sold en masse, several slots for character equipment, scarabs slots (magical items which confer statistical bonuses and abilities), quick use skills and items for each character. Overall inventory management is fairly painless however during extended periods of adventuring, managing the many scolls and potions you find can be a chore but compared to Spiderweb's older titles it's like a gift from the gods.Overall, the Avadon series is weaker than the Geneforge series and more linear than the Avernum games but it does possess its own strengths, particularly if you prefer adventuring with a party of character who speak with each other and have actual personalities. Like in the original Avadon, you're going to be revisiting 3 main areas of the world 3 times each, each time with a different reason. I'm happy to say that this time around the rationale is less infuriating than Avadon 1 (a particular questline in Avadon 1 basically boiled down to a dragon being upset on your first visit, the dragon's upset AGAIN on your second visit and on your third visit - guess who's upset again... and you end up sent on a convoluted quest for a fairly weak reason each and every time. After playing Spiderweb's other games, I expected better than this so I'm pleased to say I was never rolling my eyes when asked to revisit a location in Avadon 2). Still, compared with Spiderweb's other games revisiting the same locales may be somewhat off-putting. I should clarify that you're not revisiting the same maps over and over, but instead exploring new locations in each distinct region of the game.One thing I'd have liked to have seen addressed in this sequel is the player character instantly being shipped off to the next location immediately upon their return from each major quest, sadly that is once again the case here. This squanders a great opportunity to experience some downtime in Avadon and to deepen friendships and bonds with other party members as well as make better use of Avadon as a central hub. As it stands, it makes things feel very ""gamey"" and Avadon merely serves as a crossroads between destinations. Avadon 2 is a sizeable game, it is fairly linear throughout but there are plenty of optional sidequests that can be attempted throughout the game, character quests for each of your party are interspersed through the game and serve to break up the main questline with some interesting little detours. Portals in Avadon's central keep allow you to travel between major locales in the game at any time, so you're never in danger of locking yourself out of particular quests. The writing is pretty strong throughout, the descriptive text (always a high point in Spiderweb titles) is top notch once again, sadly there's only minimal interaction between party members, it would have been nice to see some conflicting voices raised a little more often as in Geneforge 3. The story ramps up nicely over the course of the game and kept me playing till the end, it does suffer a little from being the middle game in a trilogy but Avadon 2 handles itself fairly well on the whole. I did notice a lot more humour and light-heartedness sprinkled throughout this game compared to Avadon 1. Tonally, I also noticed quite a difference between this game and Spiderweb's previous titles and I'm not convinced it's a change for the better. Although the trash mobs which plagued the original have been toned down somewhat in this outing, they did slowly start to creep back in towards the later parts of the game. There are some foes that have very large HP pools and are also buffed to take several turns for every one of your own, when fighting these enemies in large groups, it quickly becomes tiresome waiting for your turn to come back around while the enemy horde dominates the round. Boss battles, while few in number, form the most interesting encounters in the game by far, each of the mandatory bosses in the story line were fun and challenging to fight.Some old faces from the previous game return but there is no mention of your previous party from the last game, which again was disappointing considering the Avadon series greater focus on party interaction, a callback to the old crew would have been much appreciated. There are plenty of choices in Avadon 2, the vast majority of them are for flavour and building the character you're playing as, which is fine, there's a small amount of branching at work at particular points late in the game but like with Avadon 1, I didn't feel as though I personally was having much of an impact on the game world.Ultimately it's a decent game, it is very much the sequel to Avadon 1 and makes most of the same mistakes but it does also broach some new ground. The game's premise hints at something greater if the developer were to merge the open structure of Geneforge with the party based system seen here in Avadon but at least in this outing, we only get halfway there.

												A good follow-up to the first Avadon and another fine entry in the Spiderweb Software catalogue. The graphics are bad, the sound is terrible, and the presentation leaves a lot to be desired... but the writing is great, the story and setting are interesting, and the game is a fun old-school RPG. I suggest listening to some good instrumental music and playing this with all the sound off. There's a lot of reading.Recommended, if you can get over the bad aesthetics and are looking for an old-school RPG.			"

												One of Spiderweb Software's weaker offerings. The combat feels like a slog, with too many fights that seem to only pad out the game, and too many gimmicks in the more serious fights. The plot is not particularly engaging, and I could not really bring myself to care about the things going on. Finally, the ending was anticlimactic.Play one of the Avernum or Geneforge games instead.			"

Posted: March 25, 2014
												Sorry this review requires going off on a tangent, but I feel I have a theory to prove. Also this is long and rambling.I enjoyed the first Avadon well enough. But that's because it was a fresh IP. Spiderweb's last totally new IP was Geneforge. I loved the first game, despite its flaws, and hoped the sequel would be even better. Well, the sequel added a few new monsters to shape, but didn't do anything significant with the rest of it. He (Jeff Vogel) doesn't improve his games as he makes sequels. This is definitely true of Avadon. He added a new class without touching the others.So that sounds like purely a dig at Spiderweb's ability to make sequels. Other games get away with worse, sure (Dynasty Warriors, any sports game). So how about just talking about this game? Well, other reviews here are talking about some ""80 hours"" of gameplay. Many RPG's achieve higher numbers like these with things like down time (managing items, houses, crafting, etc.) and repawns/random encounters. Here he does it with backtracking and reading. And this is the kind of backtracking that involves checking EVERY NPC who gives quests just to see if new ones pop up. And reading is fine, obviously, and even having reading that covers narration instead of just dialogue is good, too. But I feel it's too much. He uses it in place of visuals to too high of a degree. I once read a description of an NPC I was talking to that described her as an old woman in rags. The NPC looked like a male blacksmith to me. This complaint sounds a little odd when talking about an RPG, but video games are a visual medium. And there is clearly room for some visuals in this game engine, like having the NPC's walk around or having things look more like their description so they don't ALWAYS have to be described. Simple things! Anything! More!On that note, the writing has gotten weird. It has this cynical tone to it. And not a ""this is a gritty place where every one tries to screw you"" tone, but a ""I'm tired of making video games"" tone.The combat has a delightful number of scripted encounters (interesting boss fights and not-necessarily-a-boss fights), but the difficulty of combat overall is wonky. I pushed up the difficulty a notch from ""normal"" because I remembered the first Avadon feeling easy. This did... something. Who knows. Most of the time is spent auto-attacking trash. Until you get areas with enemies that are inexplicably way stronger because they are color-swapped. The tanking abilities do nothing, so I use the terrain to trick them into fighting the tank. Sometimes this can't be done fully and my teammates would get manhandled. Then I would just chip them away slowly on my lonely tank. There's no telling what level things are, so my tank can go from being unstoppable to burning through health pots between areas. Much of this is also due to tanking being reliant on avoidance rather than mitigation. So sometimes he dodges everything, sometimes he'd dodge nothing. I suspect using a shaman and tinkermage and filling the screen with summons is a better plan. But I made myself a blademaster, so bleh.After 40 hours I was just too bored to continue, so that's when I had to give up and stop forcing myself to play.P.S. Why is there housing in a game where you have a home? Avadon. Avadon is your home. And it's better than the houses you can buy by a million percent.			"

Posted: October 3, 2014
												The first 10 hours of Avadon 2 brought me back to the old days circa Ultima IV, suggesting a sprawling world full of ethically ambiguous side-quests and NPC’s. Although the full game doesn’t quite live up to its initial promise, it’s still a solid CRPG experience overall. The graphics are like something straight out of the early ‘90s, and you’ll either find that charming or off-putting depending on your taste. I lean a little more toward the former, and although I did miss the ability to rotate my camera view a few times, overall the low-fi look didn’t detract from my enjoyment at all.What did put me off the game a bit is how the story arc kind of fizzles out not even halfway through. What starts out feeling like an interesting thicket of subplots and opportunities for interesting decisions ends up really boiling down to one grand choice of “taking sides,” expressed over and over again in pretty much the same way.The game is also quite long, and although the tactical combat isn’t terrible, it’s not quite rich or varied enough to stay fresh through 60-70 hrs of gameplay. The last third of the game was a bit of a slog, and although the battles were ramped up both in scale and difficulty, they felt more tedious than climactic.Still, it’s a solid game, and though I don’t see myself playing through it again, I might come back in a few months to check out something from Spiderweb’s back catalog.

												Avadon 2 is another great game by Spiderweb.If you played Avadon 1, you should get it straight away. The first one was good, but it was rushed and it can be seen when compared to the next title.Somewhat simplified gameplay, if compared to Avernum or Geneforge series, but offers the same book-like rich story and challanging battles, moral dillemas and... lots of loot, big world and pure fun :)Highly recommended.

												Gonna be honest - it isn't much to look at. It is, however, a strangely engrossing and surprisingly complex (in some ways) RPG, which has more life in it than you'd expect for a game that looks the way it is. If you'll forgive the fact that Spiderweb Software have been using the same assets for over a decade, you'll find a decent game with a solid story and decent gameplay mechanics. A minor complaint for me is that combat is too easy (and this is coming from someone who had to cheat to beat Baldur's Gate) even on hard, but it wasn't too much of a barrier to my enjoyment of the game.

												Avadon 2 reminds me of a solid D&D adventure in a tactical RPG. You have lots of bonus missions to do, several different characters to choose from for each adventure, a good story with lots of choices and you'll die A LOT! I'm far from the best at tactical RPGs, but I had to ramp the difficulty down from normal to easy to casual so that I could get past different parts of the game.I'm writing this review 24.5 hours into it and I'm only about 30% through the game! $9.99 (or less if it goes on sale) is an absolutely worthy value for the time you'll get and the quality of game play you'll get out of it!

												The Game in short:Old school ""crpg"" gameplay & aesthetics.Fantastic writing and a story you _will_ get drawn into (eventually - see extended comments below).Squad-based tactical combat and customizable characters.Enjoyable loot hoarding.Insanely good value (at time of writing I have 63 hours on one play through - not bad for $10).EXTENDED COMMENTSAs others have said, this game is graphically moribund. If you've played  other Spiderweb games you already know this (and you are already familiar with most of the sprites and textures). **However** the graphics really don't matter; after a while the graphics will look better and better because this game _will_ engage your imagination as you personally construct the world Avadon presents (this is probably an effect of all the reading you will do - think of how personal and vivid the reality of your favorite book was at the time of reading).The writing is great - I haven't been a reader of high-fantasy fiction in decades, but I have still thoroughly enjoyed the story so far. I believe this is because in this game, your decisions, well, erm... might matter? This is a key point: while other games claim to have 'decisions that matter' simply because player-decisions have some visible and immediate affect on the world, in Avadon 2 you are often forced into difficult decisions and then given no clear indication of what effect (if any) they had. This isn't to say that nothing happens- NPC's will mention your prior decisions and give you the impression that certain things may yet come to pass because of them, but you are left wondering until such outcomes do (or don't) occurr.With all the above said, I will admit that it took a while for me to get drawn into the game world. In the beginning, it appeared simple and I took it at face value - I was probably 30 hours in before I began to realize that the world of Avadon is truly constructed of shades-of-grey (and perhaps, like a good book, is constructed to allow the viewer/gamer to reflect upon their own world, should they so choose). For anyone not interested in contemplating the morally-ambiguous complexity of safety-vs-freedom and power-vs-control the story may remain simple.Combat is tactical and (mostly) squad-based. You will usually control 3 characters in a turn-based battle system that can have difficulty adjusted to suit your individual taste (I kept things at 'normal' and found combat satisfying, if not overly difficult).The game world is a scattering of regions, each containing 5-8 maps or so. Regions are all connected to Avadon, which serves as the primary hub and base for missions. Side-quests galore exist (I've been trying to do them all, which is probably how my hour count got so high).Prior experience with Avadon (or other Spiderweb games) is totally unnecessary. I own Avadon 1, but have never played it. My only other Spiderweb experience came from playing through the majority of Avernum: Escape from the Pit on an iPad (though I never did finish that one).My only real complaint about Avadon 2 is the lack of UI-control customization. I would love nothing more than to be able to toggle Windows open and shut with the same key. Additionally, I'd love to be able to stop accidental touch-pad clicks from closing important dialogue windows (I've several times now missed out on reading some vital piece of conversation because I accidentally shut the conversation window and the game offers no way to undo such actions).In summary - the game is fun, cheap, and surprisingly engaging on various cognitive levels. I recommend this to anyone, but particularly to smart 30-something gamer dads like myself.			"

It looked great on the mac (I loved the old ""flat"" graphics, best rpg at that time, especially the mac version with its prettier interface and music), but besides trying out the demos a little, I've never completed another of his games until now. I feel compelled to write my first review on Steam. I had a lot of fun playing this game!This game has a great beginning and hooks you in right from the start. I had lots of fun and finished the game very satisfied! Great job! I think anyone deciding to jump in should just start with Avadon 2, and skip Avadon 1, it is that good. Others have mentioned the one spot in the game (with the wind teleporting) that was a little too difficult so I had to buff up a little first, but overall I've not played another RPG like this in 10 years that i've enjoyed so much!

												I have nearly 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews - Game 14Avadon: 2: The CorruptionPurchase Date: 6/17/2015I just picked this game up in the latest Steam Summer Sale for half off.  Normally I wouldn't buy a game before playing the original, but this game is from Spiderweb Software, and if you have ever played any of their games, you already know what to expect.  I can see how that might sound bad.  After all, I often see complaints about how the latest annual edition of some game has barely changed from last year.  But I wouldn't go so far as to say that Spiderweb's games are cookie-cutter.  It's just that each of their games are inspired by old school role playing games like Ultima.  They look to recreate this kind of experience, but with some elements that you would expect to see in more modern games that make their games accessible.If reading lots of text sounds boring, this game isn't for you.  If you are looking for a game with cut-scenes and lots of voice acting, this game isn't for you.  If you don't find moving around on a grid in turn-based combat to be fun, then this game also isn't for you.I played and reviewed the first Avadon right before this one, so that I could compare the 2 games and give an idea of what's different.The first Avadon offered a choice of 4 classes, which I compared to the basic archetypes of a Fighter, Wizard, Thief, and Priest.  Avadon 2 adds a fifth class, the Tinkermage, which as the name implies is kind of a tinkerer type class with some thieving abilities mixed in.  I picked this class for my playthrough.One small difference I appreciated from the first Avadon is that now you can choose if your character is male or female for each of the classes.  In the first Avadon, your gender was based on which class you picked.  There still isn't much in the way of any character customization.  The character looks are predetermined based on your selection of class and gender.The interface looks exactly the same as it did in the first Avadon.  A minimap is displayed in the top right corner.  The map can be hidden, or hitting Tab will display a larger version of the map.  Character portraits are at the top left.  A series of icons can be found along the bottom, with static icons on the left for common actions, and icons to the right for assigning hotkeys.  It's a familar looking interface, not just from being the same as the original Avadon, but from many other RPGs as well.  Don't expect to be able to move UI elements around though; everything is statically placed.Like with the first Avadon, the game starts you out in a tutorial mode of sorts, with prompts to give directions on how to move around and do basic things.  Also like the first game, I quickly found myself in my first combat.  The combat early on is super easy and is really designed to explain the basics of combat, and introduce you to using abilities.I mentioned I picked the Tinkermage class.  I started out with 2 abilities.  One let me place turrets that would shoot at enemies, and the other ability basically acted as a heal for any turrets I had already placed.  Abilities come with a cooldown timer, meaning that once an ability has been used, it can't be reused for a number of turns afterward.  This kept me from peppering the field with turrets, which understandably would be a bit unbalancing.Something I neglected to mention in my last review is that you do have a party in Avadon.   Both Avadon and Avadon 2 will quickly introduce a second character to your party.  Sometimes these characters will be computer controlled, but most of the time you are directing the actions of everyone in your party.Obviously I can't really judge a game's story based on a one hour review.  But I will say I enjoyed the opening of Avadon 2 more than the original.  The first game starts out in  the fortress of Avadon and my first quest had me killing rodents in a dungeon, which is pretty standard way to open a game.  Avadon 2 by contrast had my character running for his life to try and get back to his keep to report an invading force.  It made for a more exciting opening.As I mentioned with the first Avadon, this game isn't for everyone, but I appreciate that these kinds of games still get made, and I will happily continue to recommend them.

												One of the most dedicated RPG developers, Spiderweb Software always delivers an in depth storyline with rich characterizations, detailed lore, and compelling storylines.Avadon 2 has all of these, and its visual effects, and artistic style are better than previous titles, imo.I would recommend this game to any RPG fan.

												Good oldschool rpg that has much more to offer then you'd expect. The story is well written, funny at times and has nice twists.   It has a good upgrading system, varied maps, tons of weapons, crafting, magic, looting etc.  The only thing that is missing is nice background music that fills the gap of having no voice acting or a narator in the game and to hide the basic environment sound loops (it's all text).If you like oldschool rpg's then this game should be in your library.

												 Tiny bad graphics, simple sound effects and a Gold Box-esque turn based interface. (If you don't know what the AD&D gold box games by SSI are (ex Dark Queen of Krynn, Curse of the Azure Bonds), you're a wet behind the ears gamer who probably sneers at anything not bump-mapped. And if you dont know what SSI was, you missed one of the best eras in CRPGs. If you live in a country where these games were not released, forgive me. Then go get them somewhere on the internet.)  Its Spiderweb. If youve played one of developer Jeff Vogel's games, visually/interface/sound wise you've played em all. You know what to expect and it isn't much.But you weren't playing this game to be wowed by the graphics and sound, were you?If you were, go somewhere else so you don't clutter the forum with your complaints. Id rather not hear it.But if you like immersive, in depth plots where you actually have to read and imagine what your character sees, and you like gewtting swept away be an amazing world and story,then go for it, you wont regret it.

												Played some of the avernum games from the same publishers a long time ago, so I thought I'd check out the this. Contains many fights that are rather boring clickfests with minimal tactical depth. It's just basically repetetive buff, attack, attack heal, attack, attack, buff etc. routine for hours on end.Plot is thoroughly mediocre. Never going to finish this. I Lost interest mainly due to the simplistic combat(there's a lot of it in the game) in the last 1/3 of the game.			"

												Starts out pretty slow. I'd say I'm about 3-4 hours in, and not too much has happened. This says I'll be playing it for a while, which is good: I like longer games. But it also says that there will be a lot of slow exploring and fighting, which is less good. However, I loved the story in the first one and I'm sure this one is more story-driven anyway. We shall see.			"

												Avadon is a good game so far as role-playing gamers are concerned. It follows the style of Baldur's Gate and other isometric RPGs. It is nothing along the lines of modern, 3D graphics powered games, but is a good experience to pass the time.You have everything from your warrior-mage-thief classes to different items to equip and lots of monsters to fight. The story, in text form, is also quite interesting in the beginning, although I haven't gone far ahead in the game to comment about it in its entirety.If you want a good RPG to pass the time, Avadon is a good game.

												This is another winner from Spiderweb Games. I have played them all and appreciate the graphical imporovements they make with each game. Where they really excell is the storyline and the conflict presented to players, there is never an easy choice. Avadon also engages you with the decisions that you make and draws you in. This is an old school style Dungeon Crawler where you play with at least 3 different characters from various classes to present a  balaced fighting team.I appreciate the choice of Easy to Hard so that I can play my own way as well as there being inbuilt cheats in the game if you get stuck. If you dont like reading a lot of text then I dont think that this game is for you. Play the demo on the developers website if you are unsure and then purchase it here. It is a big sprawling world with lots of surprises. I am really enjoying this game. "

												I grabbed this game while it was on sale and I don't regret it.  It has a very rich story and I didn't realize how much I missed until after the game was over.  To me, it's a nostalgia game.  Kind of like the old SSI Dungeons and Dragons games.  If you're old like me, that might appeal to you.MANY words of caution though.  This game is ♥♥♥♥ing hard.  Some games like to hold your hand.  This game uses its hands to choke you.  That was just Normal difficulty.  I eventually said, ""♥♥♥♥ it"" and lowered it to Casual.  From there, most fights were a breeze but there were still boss fights that were kind of tricky.If you play, try it on Normal first.  When you're fed up with it, drop to Casual and enjoy the story.Oh and always have lockpicks on you.			"

												Avadon 2: The Corruption is another excellent title in the Spiderweb Series of games. These old school RPGs might be lacking in graphics, but make up for it with a wealth of gameplay. This challenging game has you playing from an isometric view, free to move and explore. When you engage an enemy, it becomes turn based combat. Tactics are important, because if you charge in, most monsters will just slaughter you. The character system is great and while the story is  linear, it offers a lot of side quests and adventures. This is another excellent title in the series.Watch the full video review on ShotGaming.com Steam Shots EP125			"

												Spiderweb Software games do not change much from one installment to the next, so if you played Avadon: The Black Fortress you will find Avadon 2 pretty much the same, with ony slight improvements. For me, that means we have on our hands another excellent CRPG. And while complexity of politics and intrigue still not up to Geneforge standards, in my opinion, the game still delivers interesting story and great gameplay.My only complaint about it would be that graphics are somewhat hard on eyes, due to low contrast of some elements of the world and fonts that are a bit to small maybe for modern displays.Do try the new character class, Tinkermage. It is most enjoyable!			"

Do I really stink that bad?""As you leave, Silke puts out the fire""What fire? there is clearly no fire anywhere to be seen, and I was told a minute ago the fireplace inside hasnt been used for months...

												Cons:This game has reeeeeally bad combat design and major game breaking difficulty spikes.For example: There is a sequence early on in the game that has your party ""blown by wind"" from room to room. In reality, this mechanic requires you to start a fight in one room (and take damage), then you will be ""blown"" to the next room to start another fight (and take more damage). There have to be at least a dozen rooms. You never finish the fights. There is no chance to heal or save. If you die, you will obviously start again right before this nonsense. There is no way to exit this area to level-up more or search for additional items to complete this are (which is required to progress the story).There is absolutely ZERO indication that some nonsense like this is about to occur and that you should have a massive stockpile of items. Pros:You don't have to play it "

												If you haven't played the first Avadon game you should play that before getting this, as the story is essentially a continuation of the story of that game (though with new main characters), and the game play is very similar, without significant changes to the engine. If you played and enjoyed the first Avadon game, you will like this one as well, as it is more of the same. If you played and didn't like the first Avadon game, don't bother with this one because, well, it's just more of the same.So what are the Avadon games? They are old-school, turn-based RPGs. Lots of talking to NPCs. Lots of fighting. You get to build a party of 3 people out of 5 classes. You get some choices and branching skill paths for each character. You collect loot. You beat monsters. You learn about the world and what its story is. In the end you have some different possible endings based on the choices you made during the game, but the endings aren't all that different from each other, so I wouldn't call this a top selling point.Basically, the Avadon games are solid and very enjoyable, budget price CRPGs that are made by and for people who like old school CRPGs. If you are one of those people and you aren't turned off by the low production values (though the art is fine and is well enough done for its style, IMO), you're going to like this game. If you aren't one of those people, well, this series probably won't win you over as it doesn't do anything terribly different or new or genre shattering.			"

												I've been a fan of Spiderweb Software since I was six or seven years old; grew up playing the Exile series. So glad to see these guys are still making their traditional style game. Thoroughly enjoyable.			"

												A great sequel. Fixes a couple of the minor annoyances I had with the 'Avadon: The Black Fortress'. If you enjoyed the first Avadon, pick this one up!			"

												If you haven't played the first Avadon game you should play that before getting this, as the story is essentially a continuation of the story of that game (though with new main characters), and the game play is very similar, without significant changes to the engine. If you played and enjoyed the first Avadon game, you will like this one as well, as it is more of the same. If you played and didn't like the first Avadon game, don't bother with this one because, well, it's just more of the same.So what are the Avadon games? They are old-school, turn-based RPGs. Lots of talking to NPCs. Lots of fighting. You get to build a party of 3 people out of 5 classes. You get some choices and branching skill paths for each character. You collect loot. You beat monsters. You learn about the world and what its story is. In the end you have some different possible endings based on the choices you made during the game, but the endings aren't all that different from each other, so I wouldn't call this a top selling point.Basically, the Avadon games are solid and very enjoyable, budget price CRPGs that are made by and for people who like old school CRPGs. If you are one of those people and you aren't turned off by the low production values (though the art is fine and is well enough done for its style, IMO), you're going to like this game. If you aren't one of those people, well, this series probably won't win you over as it doesn't do anything terribly different or new or genre shattering.			"
