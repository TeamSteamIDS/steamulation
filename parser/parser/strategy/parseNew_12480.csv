												I picked up this Russian made RTS game in the Steam sale.The game is a tactical level RTS that follows the the 9th Company of the 345th OPPD through 9 years of warfare in Afghanistan against the insurgents and yes it is the same 9th Company in the film 9th Company. The game even has clips from the film.The campaign is good but short and you do a nice variety of missions. The tutorial at the start is comprehensive enough for you to get a quick grasp of the controls.It also has some nice realistic elements. Soldiers can get injured and can't fight until attended by a medic and if you're not fast enough may die from their injuries. You also get off screen support fro missions such as D-30 artillery strikes, rocket artillery and Hind CAS (all of which are extremely deadly) and so on. If you lose your radioman you lose your access to support. For some missions you get armoured vehicles to control and if these get hit you can bail the crews before the vehicle brews up. It's best to take care of them as they provide a great fire-power advantage over your enemy.The game does have issues though nothing severe. You can't map your own controls and moving the camera around is quite sluggish. The AI have a tendency to wander off and attack enemies though this may be down to me not knowing the best way to control the troops. For some reason all of your soldiers are privates apart from a couple of warrant officers. There's also some translation errors but this is forgiveable. There are also two missions with some bugs that force you to reload in order to get through them. also  there is a mod for the game that improved it a bit .Overall I think it's a good game. when I think of a game that I purchased and I write about it. I always ask myself ""Would I buy this again?"" In this case I probably would.			"

												Play as the stranded Soviet 9th Company in 1988 Afghanistan. Cut scenes include scenes from ""9 rota"" the Russian-Finnish-Ukrainian film about the battle at Hill 3234; which left the 9th company all but in ruins. Similar mechanics to the Theater of War franchise make this an rather difficult but very elaborate RTS, I wouldn't claim it for the faint of heart.			"

												I just wish this game is a bit more polished with less bugs. There are a whole bunch that you will meet when you playing though the story and if it happens you have to load from preivous saves.The graphics for this game is actually pretty good with movie clips in it too.The music is fine but not super.The control is a bit wacked but manageble.The fight is actually really fun. You have to fight enemy of over whelming numbers.IT's a RTS that in will keep you pretty busy.I guess for a low budget game it's pretty fine in it's own right but if the game company had more money i am sure this game can be improved much further. 7/10 for scoring.I don't recommend people to buy this game unless it's in a discount or in a package. IF you already own it.. give it a chance and try it out. ignore the low rating.			"

												Great RTS game.  I enjoyed every aspect of this game.  Some of the missions were actually difficult to complete, especially when you get ambushed while trying to clear a mine field.  Some might find the fact that your reallly need to keep close watch on all your troops movements at all times, especially if you split them up into 2 groups for a 2 pronged attack, a bit tedious, but I liked having to be constantly aware of my soldiers because you never could tell where the enemy would hit you next or when you would run into a MG nest.  If I had to pic anything that was annoying, it woul dbe the AI's constant targeting of my medics, but to be honest, that made it that much more challenging and realist, 'cause the enemy probably would target medics if RL anyway.  Anyway, great game and I would recommend getting it if you like rts style games.			"

												Liked the movie it was made after and I like the game too, as it conveys a lot of that dark humour and tension from the movie (btw, you can see the whole movie with subtitles on YouTube)The game takes your company of Soviet rookies through their tour of duty in Afghanistan, by making it through a bunch of missions. You can only take a certain number of them on a mission, so it's good to rotate guys a bit, to give all the experience they need for the hard final battles. It has nice pre-battle squad equipment management options and off-map close support options, which get better if you complete missions well. Interesting and rather difficult missions also teach you a lot about history and the nature of guerilla warfare in Afghanistan.It's possibly a bit too short so not all that much replay value, but if you play through it once every couple of years it'll be fresh enough. ;)			"

												has a good potential yet the balance ruins the experience. the afghan militias are highly trained soldiers that simply overcome our highly trained soviet neighbors which I find pretty unrealistic. sure they were trained by US special forces, but does not immediately turn themselves as US special forces. I was thinking more of outgunned, outnumbered angry militias and we get to assault, or defense, but instead I get to face expert shooters sometimes even better than our friendly red army. Aside from difficulty, I would recommend it.			"

												this game is ok but its a bit fiddly and slow paced for the average RTS gamer its some what realistic but unfortunately realism does not always mean something will be fine like in real real life you scout ahead locate the enemy set up then attack the enemy however it takes a while to set up for the actual engagement and its over so quickly that its not very enjoyable a lot of the time you can simply send a hind in to engage then send infantry in to mop up whats left it has decent mechanics but the guns on everything are very inaccurate to make up for the distance of engagements there is also an issue with not being able to access other soldiers inventory meaning if your medic gets killed or is down then everyone is going to be on the ground writhing in painif you want a semi realistic RTS then go ahead but don't expect a fast paced action pact game because this is not really that			"

												this game is a bit tricky lol i love it to be honest it's a great game it's like Men of War but with better graphics and arguably more interesting lol the only thing about this game that's bad and it's a pretty big deal is the bugs and glitches that do occur there are glitches that happen where you can't complete missions because something just decided to not work and it is very infuriating when it happens after you've just spent an hour trying to be a mission while also trying to keep your guys alive and then all the sudden the game just says ""♥♥♥♥ you i quit"" lol i was so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥i literally rage deleted this game and haven't touched it in a while lol but all in all for 10.99 it isn't that bad it is very fun the missions are actually challenging and your soldiers that survive stay with you and they slowly get new ranks which makes their stats better etc and if they die then you get a new guy and have to start over with that guy mind you though you don't always get the same number of guys all the time some missions you get more others you get less but it's a great game and has a lot going for it if only there were updates to fix the bugs and glitches this game would be even better lol			"

												Fantastic game. A hidden treasure. Excellent atmosphere. If you like tactical games, this is something you will love. A little short and an occasional bugg (mission events not triggering) can force you to restart a mission from time to time, but an excellent experience. To add to the historical atmosphere of the 1970s, when you succesfully finish a mission you get rewarded by the Soviet anthem playing, Recommendations.			"

												Great idea for a game; only game about the Soviet-Afghan War. Good war for a game- who doesn't want to root out insurgents and battle Mujahids in the mountains? And it is kinda fun. However, it is very poorly done. First of all, fun fact- all Russian soldiers in this war had crippling mental illness- also a little known fact. They don't take orders, they don't stay in cover, they refuse to heal each other, and they have an interesting tendency to walk right up to a Mujahideen machine gun nest and get wounded, then scream so that everyone else wants to run in front of the machinegun too. The command system is very poor- soldiers receptiveness to commands aside- you have lots of control over a single guy, but can't command more than one guy like that. This makes for a very unwieldy fighting experience against a historically incorrect enemy. If you value historical accuracy, you will be sorely disappointed. You go up against heavily armed, well-trained, entrenched defenders who outnumber you and have fully modern weapons in 1981 and 1982- thus, they are not only historically inaccurate, but also really hard to kill and quickly drive you to madness after a single Afghan you thought you killed in an artillery strike shoots down a helicopter and kills twenty of your men. On that note, actually, the Afghans shoot down your helicopters like nobody's buisness in 1981- when the first Soviet chopper was downed in '86!!! This all being said, 9th Company is a very hard game that will quickly drive you to madness. I mean, I've already lost several hundred men in 2.8 hours, and am still sorry for all the Soviets that died under me. Get it on sale if you really want to-for like two dollars- and give it a try if you want to. Otherwise, it isn't worth ten bucks.			"

												What can I say. It's a curiosity since I don't know of any other games that revolve around the events of the Soviet-Afghan war, but the execution is a little muddled. I probably didn't give it the attention it deserves to warrant a proper review, but since it's not my kind of genre to begin with I personally can't recommend it, though if you see it in a sale I daresay it'll give you a few hours of entertainment. If realtime strategy in real world events is your thing - probably worth picking it up!Though - if you'd like to see how I got on, I've catalogued my progress as always:

												Not going to write a long review because I didnt play it for very long. However from the short time I did this is what I thought.Game play and concept isnt not too bad, for an old game it has some play value for fans of the genre. Having spent alot of time playing Company of Heroes I just couldnt get into 9th Company.I would recommend this for people who perhaps dont want to pay as much for company of heroes, or want a first time game of Military RTS to see whats its like.There is loads of cheats easily available so if you do fancy a quick blast through you can create 100s of units in a quick few clicks and smash through the levels that way.All in all, im not going to recommend it purely because there is better games out there like this!

												Its the only game where the tutorial is harder than the rest of the game (On easy~!!!) and the camera fights back. I want to recommend this for the shear amount of detail going into the destruction mechanics, the squad tactics, the goofing around achieveable with cheats, and the popcorn-movie esque style the entire plot is based around. Its like an indie developer made Men at War! But, the camera is a ♥♥♥♥♥. Otherwise, get this game. A strategy like this for a price of 1.99 only comes around every now and then, and considering its one of the better titles by Strategy First (AKA the Simulator russo-german-polish-eastern european-game company)All in all, an easy 6.5-7 outta ten.

												Okay, so this game does have a few small bugs and it's based on the movie instead of on the real events (if you want a game following real events look for ""Pravda o 9 Rota"" - ""Truth about the 9th Company"" - sadly there is no English translation), but it's a refreshing wind in this stale hall of RPGs (pun intended) and RTSs.For those of you who have not seen the movie... watch the movie, it's pretty good. Anyway, it follows the experience of a unit of Soviet soldiers upon arriving in Afghanistan in the 80's where you fight against future Taliban.Game itself is a mixture of RTS where you directly control several squads together with armored support (each soldier separately, so not like Total War where you commanded only a whole unit) who level up with experience. Provided they survive, of course... You can also call in support such as artillery, strike aircraft and combat helicopters if available for that mission.There are bugs, of course. After all, this game was created on a budget lower than what an exec of a PR department of big Western publishers spends on business lunch. Okay, exaggeration, but hopefully you get what I mean. But still not as many bugs and definitely more enjoyable than some AAA games that required Day 0 or Day 1 patches and for which you also paid AAA prices. This game is only 2.50 euro at the time of writing this review, so it's well worth it's price.Graphics are pretty good, considering how old it is, just like the sound. The game itself can be pretty hard, so you either must be very good or very careful/tactical/reload frequently to get all your soldiers through alive.I admit I'm biased because I played the game when it came out and loved it and was happy to buy it cheap on Steam after so long, so I can only recommend this game and advise to keep an open mind.

												Didn't have the patience for it. Despite the tutorial and clear objectives, you still feel lost. On top of that unit movement is painstakingly slow and the vehicle AI is not very intelligent, causing them to collide into ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ things and having to back up, slowly pivot, and then continue. Also very difficult to keep your units together even in formations and hard to spot exactly where enemy fire is coming from.Seems like it might be an okay game, but not good enough to make me want to deal with the headaches.

												No keybind settings as far as I can tell. Seemed like a decent Squad-based RTS in terms of the mechanics presented in the tutorial, but I was not even able to finish that because I cannot rotate the camera (middle mouse, which for me is bound to Alt+F4 and I'm not rebinding my system settings for one game). PROS:-Nice squad based features (get ""on"" vehicle, get ""in"" vehicle, ammo count per weapon, automated ammo sharing among squad)-Varied weapons on each soldier, viewable range, could use grenades as traps.CONS:-Very simple graphics even on max settings-No keybind settings (can't recommend on this point alone, esp given the camera issue below)-Camera moves AND ROTATES on its own. (select a unit and the camera ""cinematically"" pans to it while rotating...)This seemed like it had some potential, but unfortunately due to the combination of unwanted camera rotations, unbindable keys, and the requirement of the middle mouse button with no keyboard equivalent (to rotate the camera) makes this a frustrating mess to play. Fans of the genre may enjoy it, but due to the above issues, I have to give this a ""soft"" no.			"

												10 missions and one secret final mission.You control soldiers and vehicles in a manner similar to Theatre of War and sometimes you will get air and artillery support, and scripted reinforcements.The game is hard you will fight against a superior number of enemies in addition the camera and gameplay feels clunky, the cover system is not as functional as in Men of War. The AI is not the best and your soldiers and vehicles will break lines to chase a random solitary enemyThe game is not bad but buy it only if you are really interested in it.			"

												well let me start with this the reason i am giving this game a bad review is the combat is just so bad its awful its hard to explain why but sometimes your units wont follow orders or sometimes they will sit and fire at an enemy for hours even tho his is completly visible and ahh i just cant if you want to really see how its like there are some youtubevids that will show you its quality or lack of it			"

												After doing onnly the first mission, i love this game! it's hard as hell but it's so well done. for those of you who haven't seen the movie this game was based on i definately recommend it, one of the best war movies i have ever seen and the game follows suit. pros- detailed and accurate vehicles, equipment and environment- commands you can give to your troops is quite large in number (for eg. run for cover, close in, spread out, search for mine)- cover system in place-customise your forces before each deployment-air support and artilery support- nice sound effect (russian national anthem at the end of every mission too)- get to fight the mujahadeen- challenging fights that are also costly to your troops if you're not carefulcons- bit hard to control- sometimes AI does dumb♥♥♥♥♥♥br>- no multiplayer or skirmish mode- can be rather frustrating at some hard pointover all i ♥♥♥♥ing love this game, i find that in this game i can manouevre soldiers and bricks pretty well and it's very satisfying using tactics watching how effective they can be.

												Russian budget game is a special category :) Pros: Afghan conflict is rarely seen in games. Based on real events and includes clips from a good movie""action documentary"" about 9th company. Quite detailed micromanagement of individual troopers and their inventory. Somewhat realistic combat tactics. Cons:  Poor vehicle AI, they drive all over the place. Very bad camera control. Bugs - the game crashed several times and I'm not able to finish 3rd mission, I have cleared required village but the mission does not advance. Soldier selection UI could be better.Summary: Not recommended, uninstalling.... I'm glad I only paid 2€ for it.			"

												This game has so much potential.The main problem with this game lies in the camera controls and soldier controls/selection. Unlike Men of War, they are just too hard to control. Especially with the soldiers not being able to stop moving/cease fire. Soldier skills and inventory system is unique. Highly customisability makes the game easily replayable without getting bored.

												Now I know where store troopers are made... If you like old school war sims, you'll probably like this. It's cute in an ""I'll never play it again"" way. It reminds me of what life was like before you could change keybindings in games. Though, I have to say, for a game that came out in 2009, it's a bit lacking. It is exactly as you see in the screenshots. If you loved the movie, you might like the game. But it's a bit slow for me.			"

												If you like men of war, you'll probably like this game, as it has very similar gameplay. It has a more modern setting, something that I desperately want from the men of war series, but has yet to deliver. Unfortunately this game only has a single campaign that you can probably finish in 5 hours if you just want to beat it, or about 10 if you want to lead your men well.There's a lot of cool finishing touches to this game that make me wish the developers tried again, but made a bigger game, and expanded the setting, like a Cold War setting (more broad than the Afghan war), or even a modern setting, like Russia vs, Ukraine or the EU. That would be mind-blowing.Wait and buy it on sale, I'd pay $5 max, but I'm a cheap loser			"
