												I'm in your base, killen your dudes! This is a very simple and shallow tower defense game with a cartoon look and characters that look straight out of Team Fortress 2. For those that don't know, it has no affiliation with TF2. The game is basically a wide open empty map. You start with a certain amount of cash to buy your towers. You can place these towers anywhere, well almost anywhere. The enemies don't attack, they just run from their starting gate or gates all the way to your base. The game says your base, by base, I assume they mean your gate, because you don't see a base. These are basically open courtyards. If enough enemies get into your base, you'll lose the game. The limit is 20. Each game has at least 100 waves of enemies, so in 30 minutes you can get through 60 or so waves. Its very easy, it just takes a long time to make it through, but luckily when you quit it saves the game.You're tasked with arranging these towers, making walls of towers, and making a winding path for enemies to follow. Basically make a maze of towers. Can you plug a gap and make an unsolvable puzzle? Nope. The enemies will plod through from left to right. If something blocks their way, they'll path around it, but not intelligently. They'll chose a path that can end up having more of your towers. There is a wide variety of enemies, standard soldiers that look like TF2's soldier character, a heavier character, that looks like TF2's heavy, they'll eventually get jeeps, motorcycles, tanks, helicopters and giant robots. What do they all do? Just walk. Again they don't attack you. The helicopters and planes will at least fly over your towers in a straight line headed for your gates. Your job is to destroy them before they enter your gate. Since every map is just an open courtyard, you can just make the same maze over and over again.Now that we've covered the enemies, let's talk about the towers, there are a few types of towers based on what mode you're on. Classic mode has only 4 towers on every map. Extended adn endless mode have 6 towers. Gun towers with short range, goo towers, that have a longer range, but will shoot goo to temporarily slow enemies down. Next up there are long range missiles, which are great to have. For the fourth tower in classic mode, there is some sort of electro tower. You don't unlock any new ones. In extended and endless modes, there are flame towers and minimum / maximum ranged giant bomb spitters that are pretty expensive. You can upgrade each and every tower by right clicking it and selecting to upgrade it for a price. Do you want to know which towers do the most damage? The stats are in the help menu item, but they should be hover items that just appear when you go to select which tower you'd like to place. The tower guns turn, but the electro towers don't turn and you'll pay extra for it. You can hit the space bar to pause the game to plop down towers, but there are only two speeds, normal and fast.The big issue that I have with this game is that its dull. There are far better and deeper tower defense games out there. This game throws 100 waves of enemies at you. It shows you a list of what enemies are coming next and where.... which is good, if I didn't have to click on it to open it up each time I wanted to see the list. Other wave based tower defense games simply have a list of what's next, like how Tetris would show you what block is next. Then the fact that each level / map is 100 waves. That's just far far too many. The game gets dull and boring long before you're done with 100 waves. If you beat 50 waves, then you unlock new maps. But really, the maps are all the same, entrances and an exit. The only difference is how it looks. If you get past 100 waves then it unlocks new modes for the map. The modes are painfully the same, just longer! After 90 waves I didn't even have to touch the keyboard anymore. I just watched the game play itself. There are also three difficulties for each mode if you dare.When you die or beat a map, it lets you enter a high score with leader boards for your friends and all of Steam. The sad part is the score system is flawed. When you defeat an enemy, you get X amount of points, so if you have a perfect game where you kill everything.... you'll get the same score. It should have been time based. Kill an enemy quickly, get more points. Another problem that I have with the game is the fact to move the map around to see everything, you need to click and drag, but for the most part maps are the size of one screen, so you don't even really need to move the map, except for when a helicopter gets past you.A lot of people on the forum complain about mouse lag, but really I don't notice it that much, other than in the menu, but its a game breaker for some. Another headache of this game is when you lose, you need to exit out of the level, then play it again, select the level and wait for it to load. A restart button after losing would have been appreciated.Maybe this is a great mobile game, but for PC and Steam, there are better tower defense games out there. This one is just forcefully long, boring and offers no depth or variety, but at least there are nearly 100 achievements. You can tell how dull the game is when you look at the achievements, there are 85+ easy achievements that only 15% of people have unlocked. Go buy Field Runners 2.			"

												If you are a fan of Tower Defence Genre, this game is only ok. There's only a few towers and upgrades, but there are modes and three difficulties for each, along with several levels.The AI isn't as good at TD as those in Warcraft III but it's addictive and fun for one evening.You will be done with the game in just some hours. It's a nice game, but it would be better if it's longer and a better graphic would be good (it is an android game first).Its a pretty good game to get in a bundle (with android-version!) or in a very very cheap steam sale.If you want a good strategy TD, get Defense Grid: The Awakening or other TD-games.

												Fieldrunners should have just stuck with the mobile platform. Compared to other tower defense games, Fieldrunners lacks a lot of depth. However, the main reason I cannot recommend this game is because it is just a lousy and lazy port from their mobile version. This game will not support 99.9% of today's widescreen monitors. If you do have a large monitor, the game will look pixelated and blurry. The developers will not fix this so please avoid at all costs!			"

												A good time waster but you won't need any stratedy to play. This game was made for tablets, albeit the commands were adapted to mouse and keyboard, it is an extremely simple TD game which can become boring quite quickly. Any TD game you find on Kongregate is deeper than this one, so if you want some challenge, try more evolved TD games.			"

												It's a classic Tower Defense game. You have a field crossed by minions and must kill them all before they reach the other side of the map. You have diferent kind of towers (slow, rockets, laser, etc) and can block them so they have to go through the path you make.A really simple to learn game and quite fun if you like this kind of game.

												Fieldrunners is a no b.s tower defense game. Fieldrunners is ported from mobile devices which may turn off some but regardless of the platform there is fun to be had.Fieldrunners does well at respecting the player's time and ability. There is no tutorial to suffer though, there's no two hours of tedious ""intro levels"" to endure; you click ""start game"" and you better be prepared to play. Playing through on medium difficulty will provide the player with a respectable challenge.Fieldrunners is a bit simplistic and if you are expecting an experience like Defense Grid you will be disappointed, however if you generally enjoy tower defense games you will likely enjoy FieldrunnersScore: 7/10			"

												Fieldrunners is a grid-based tower defense game where your job is simply to throw in enough defenses to make sure as few (or non) of the enemy units make it across the field. To do this, you are given a variety of towers, from slow to gun, from zapper to artillery, from missile to anti-air. Enemy units comes in various types as well, from weak swarm to heavy crawl to fast charge to air to heavy airships. As this was originally a mobile game, the graphics are a bit on the simple side, but this doesn't affect the playability. Additional modes with more weapons (flame and other towers), plus other modes adds to replayability if you are not bored to the repetitiveness. As each kill gives you money to buy, but building at the wrong time or wrong lace can be disastrous, this is as much resource management as it is tactics. While it's not a bad game, it's not necessarily a good game either. There are certainly more colorful, better graphics, more variations, better story, and so on other tower defense games out there. This one is nicely polished, but it's snack... it's not meant to be deep. and for $5.00, it's not expected to be.			"

												This is a game where you shoot the Heavy and the Soldier from Team Fortress 2 in the face without direct involvement. Unfortunately, the developers of this game are racist towards PC users and so you have to play this like you were using an iPhone. Except the finger you normally would use is your left mouse button. Other than that, I'd rather cut out the middleman and shoot the Heavy and the Soldier in the face by my-own-♥♥♥♥ing-self, like we do here in MURRICA.			"

ConclusionI Still recommend the game as a tower defense game. You can have fun finding the right maze for each map to win however don't expect anything new and exciting with this game.  "

												Fieldrunners was a great iOS tower defense game (although probably the difficulty could use tweaking on some of the later maps), but it's hard to recommend the Steam version for the following reasons:1. The price was always ridiculed on iOS, especially when the devs refused to ever bring it down, even during holiday sales, despite the fact the extra maps were actually at one point DLC that had to be purchased.  Even including the DLC levels, $10 seems a bit off for a bare-bones PC version that doesn't function properly (more on that later) and has been a mega-success for going on 4 years or so now.   This barely rose to the $10 level on iOS, and it's not remotely a $10 on PC in this condition.2. The Steam version has a horrendous bug/glitch that the developers have yet to fix where mouse input becomes severely lagged after the second time you play it.  In other words, the first time you play it's fine, but after that the game is unplayable with virtually any form of mouse.  Touchpads on laptops tend to work, but some bizarre problem with the port causes serious issues with mice.  As of my writing this, this is not fixed.  The glitch does not seem to effect everyone, but it effects enough people that it's unfortunate it is not mentioned in the game description.Fieldrunners is a great, basic tower defense game, but this port is really shoddy and the shoulder shrugging response on fixing the bugs frankly makes me regret ever supporting these devs back before they made their fortunes on the Fieldrunners IP.

												This is a solid tower defense game.  It gets the job done, anyway.  However, it's a bit limited compared to the sequel.  Most of the levels are of the ""build your own maze of guns"" variety, as opposed to td games that have you place towers along a predetermined path.Fieldrunners is a good value, but if you don't mind paying a little more, skip this one and buy Fieldrunners 2 instead.  There's nothing in 1 that isn't done much better in 2.			"

												I grabbed this game on sale for a dollar. After playing it for a while, I say it's worth it.It's a simple tower defense game. Build your towers, upgrade your defenses and make sure the enemys don't get through. Simple right? In a way, no. The game gets very difficult (at least for me) up to a certain point. Your game might start with some really strong guys running towards your base when you only have a couple of towers that don't do that much damage. Yet this usually depends on the difficulty you decide to play it on. The levels also look pretty nice too. Sometimes you might have to defend only one side and sometimes you have to defend 4 corners of the map. The game is mainly in 2D (Except the enemys) but looks quite nice. Each level feels different from the other one. One level you defend on a field, or you defend inside a large factory.The design of the enemys are interesting. I like the design of the characters. They remind me of the Soldier and the Heavy from Team Fortress 2. Sometimes I don't take the game seriously because I keep thinking a bunch of Heavys are trying to destroy my base.Overall, I give the game a 7/10 Mainly because I am not a big fan of tower defense games, but if you like tower defense games, then you might like it better than I do.They also have a mobile version of this game for the IOS and Android last time I checked.

												Tricky, Unfair, unfun and geenrally abrasive, Fieldrunners iss a sound concept with well designed towers, but a hugely underdevelped economy and a resentful amount of challenge. over the course of some of the HARDEST maps in the game, you might earn around £2000. THis is barely any money whatsoever, FORCING you to min-max to a ridiculous degree without any level of steadiness or a feeling of continuous challenge. The game just drops you in the boiling pot.Also, some of the achievements are Assinine, specifically the 1,000,000 fieldrunners dead one and the Win/Losses ones. It woudl take around FIVE DAYS of continuous play to get these, thank god for Speeding up the game with exterior means.GO buy this game's sequal, if you want a good tower defence game.			"

												The ""most anticipated and visually stunning game in tower defense history"" ? Certainly not. It may have been considered visually pleasant on mobile devices where it came out, but _certainly_ not on the PC. Gameplay is less-than-stellar, too. Personally, I found it to be rather bland, generic, and overall pretty much mediocre.If you're looking for a really good (and good-looking) Tower Defense game on the PC, skip this one, and go pick up Defense Grid if you haven't already.

												Fun tower defense with ground and air units, but sometimes doesn't feel fair - to you or the mobs. Its easy to build a map that makes a loop, and swapping two towers makes ground units stop and turn around to save them from exiting the level. Air units move quickly from entrance to exit, and some you have to build your maps with them in mind so you can stack air defense towers along their path. Also gives no starting resources so you have to build like a tower per round and slowly build up to make the starting maze.			"

												It's a tower defense game.  That's really all there is to say, it's relatively shallow.  It's not terrible or game-breakingly bad, but there are better examples of this genre available (probably for free).   The old Warcraft 3 customs were better than Fieldrunners.Wouldn't recommend it - I'd suggest picking up a different tower defense game unless this one is going to cost you next to nothing.  Defender's Quest is a better title, but for a more traditional example Defense Grid was a much better tower defense game.			"

												I did not like this game. It feels like one of those online flash games that you play obsessively for a few days then forget about and never play again. But it seemed to lack that spark that makes you want to keep playing. If this had been an online game I would have abandoned at the first level. The levels are too long and just get boring. It would be better with more shorter levels. Another thing that might have added a bit more longevity is if there was some kind of XP or leveling up or unlocking new towers. Another gripe I had is that the game crashes at the end of each level if you attempt to play it offline. The only good thing about it is that the graphics are better than an online game would be. So I'd steer clear of this game.			"

												It's a classic Tower Defense game. You have a field crossed by minions and must kill them all before they reach the other side of the map.

												The game is great. Graphics are awesome, sound is fine. However, there are two problems. One is the balancing problem which becomes obvious on latter levels and the other is the amount of bugs this game has. Sometimes it just won't start. Or it crashes randomly. I have played Fieldrunners 2 and I also have the game on Android and the same problems repeat. As it stands now, it doesn't look like the developers plan to fix that, so I really cannot recommend the game in the current state. You would start playing it and falling in love with it and then you will get frustrated when even a re-install does not help.			"
