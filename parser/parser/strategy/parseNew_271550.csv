												I really like this game. You can get all achievements without having three stars on every level. In fact merely passing the level is fine. This is a time management game similar to build-a-lot, royal envoy, etc.			"

												Tribloos 2 is a cutesy strategy game which puts you in control of a group of lemming type critters, who are trying to save their Island from a series of storms before Matilda the Dragon becomes tired from blowing them all away.I really enjoyed playing Tribloos 2. The graphics of the game are warm, friendly and inviting. Everything is simply laid out, I’d confidently say that even a complete novice could master the point and click interface to add Tribloos to individual tasks. It is by no means a strategy game to rival the likes of Command & Conquer or Civilization. It isn’t pretending to be either, what it is though is a bloody addictive cute little strategy game that will have you entertained for hours upon end. Although it seems the developers are paying more attention to the mobile market, the PC version is satisfactory and offers fun gameplay, which the fans of this kind of games will surely love.			"

												Tribloos 2 is a very unique and nice puzzle/management/action game. It's hard to describe because not many games are like it.In Tribloos 2, you control Tribloos throughout the game and assign them to different tasks: Reparing pipes, harvesting wood, using the sawmill, harvesting scrap, harvesting crystals, building houses... There's at least 30 different types of buildings to make and items to harvest or process. The game contains 10-20 hours of content, 75 story levels, 15 challenge levels and 5 bosses.You can play at your own pace because the time limit is only there if you want to get gold times to showoff that you completed the levels very quickly. This means the game is suitable to almost any kind of players and you can take your time!What more can I say... The game features about 15 well-made soundtracks that plays throughout the game, the story is fun to read, the game is really fluid; overall it's worth the purchase!To anybody that was looking foward to buying this game, it really gives you enough content for the price!

												Fun casual game.   10-15 hours to play it thru once.  A bit more if you want to achieve gold on everything.  The game has excellent balance.   Getting gold on a scene is challenging enough that you'll end up having to play many of them multiple times, while others you'll get right away.   All achievements can be made by simply playing the game from end to end inclusive of the bonus challenges.   One note:  Make sure you click ""next"".  If you click ""back to menu"" the game doesn't register what you've done in the scene as counting towards the achievements.  I played the scenes a couple at a time so found myself clicking back to menu quite often and when I did that none of the achievements were popping up (became very obvious when I needed to fix 10 pipes and I did the one scene with six of them twice that it wasn't working).For a couple of dollars, well worth it.

												Surprisingly good casual strategy game, don't let the somewhat basic menu graphics throw you off, the gameplay is both interesting and addictive while building up to a frantic pace regularly. It's like a Lemmings with resource production thrown in. Glad I gave it a shot (had got it in a bundle and was initially thinking of passing it over)!			"

												Full review: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/tribloos-2-game-review/Tribloos 2 is one of those games that are just a pleasure to play. It’s really peaceful and provides quite the laid-back experience amidst all of today’s more violent games.This is a time management game. You’re tasked with getting stuff done in a certain amount of time using the provided Tribloos. This usually entails building a certain amount of buildings or collecting a certain amount of items. For example, I may be tasked to build three homes, each of which adds five Tribloos to my workforce, or I could be tasked with making bread, which is a multi-step process for the Tribloos.The game does have a story to it, although negligible. Trey’s village is in danger due to storms. Yes, rainstorms and such. Matilda the dragon, who usually blows the storms away, is too tired to blow away these new storms and the Tribloos are now tasked with protecting themselves from the dangers ahead. I don’t see how this story actually plays into what I do in the game, however. Does making bread help protect the village? Now that I think about it, this may be because they’re stockpiling food, although I’m unsure.The game’s graphics are all hand-drawn and look fantastic. The Tribloos themselves look great, as do the game’s various buildings. Oh, might as well throw the backdrops in there as well, which are all very well done. The game also has its own original soundtrack, which was excellent. I wonder if the soundtrack is available for download separately?The game has plenty of content to go around, for a game of this scale at least. There are 90 levels. Each takes a couple of minutes to beat on average. This is, however, if you just play through the game without the goal of getting all perfect scores, which I had difficulty with. A lot of times I would simply run the clock until I got a bronze rating, not on purpose though. I’m obviously doing something wrong with my time-management here, not that I have any in reality (okay, maybe I do).Overall, this game is quite a treat. It may be lost in the flood of indie games coming out these days, but I can give this game my recommendation. It may not be for the more hardcore gamers, but I certainly enjoyed it, and I consider myself one.			"

												Tribloos 2 is a fun casual management game where you guide a tribe of small hairy creatures on a quest to stop the storms threatening their island and build dozens upon dozens of houses wherever they go.In each level there are various tasks that need to be completed, usually the gathering of certain resources or items as well as the construction of all the houses. To do this you send your tribloos from the main building to take care of business, wait for them to finish, make their way back and then send them to do the next thing.It's a simple concept, and there isn't much of a challenge or pressure there. Levels are timed, but there's no penalty to taking your time, and I'd advise you just play things at your own pace.The game slowly introduces new mechanics, like special headwear that helps you navigate the later environments more safely (like hardhats that save you from falling rocks in the caves). In the end there aren't any (positive) changes that truly shake up the core formula though, which isn't fatal to this otherwise neat little game.The only frustrating thing in the game is the later levels attempting to add challenge in the form of environmental hazards. Especially the leaky pipes, which stops any passing tribloo and sends him/her/it back to the main building. This leads to some frustrating moments where you have to time sending your units out at exactly the right time, except you don't know when that time is since the travel time they take to reach the pipe is virtually impossible to estimate.All in all this is a relaxing puzzle game. The flaws that are there are outweighed by its charm and the light-hearted story going on between levels.It's not critical to have played the first game, which hasn't made its way to Steam yet, and it's a fun enough little game.

												7/10 good, but only at a discount.I have to say I enjoyed this game more than I was expecting. The main game is cheesy, all-ages time and resource management, with some interesting mini-games in the mix. The timers on each level provide a decent level of challenge, and it's always possible to work out what you could have done to finish each level in time. The game functions well, the graphics all work together, the sound is a little annoying after a while, but easily muted. All in all a good game, but limited replayability means you should probably hold out for a sale.			"

												What an addicting game!! Totally loved it, really casual and the thinking aspect is not too hard. Anyone can 100% this game with achievements. The only thing that annoyed me was the sound of the sawmill but everything else was great. It can feel repetitive at times but it gets addicting to beat each level. The music wasn't that great so I just turned off all the music and sound in the game and played Pandora in the background. Great Game!!			"

												This is a welcome departure from the usual worker & resource management games. It's not a time management game as the time is only for arbitary bonus points. Unlike Alawar and similar light strategy games that follow overhead paths, this one goes the vertical and horizontal route. Also, it is possible to use up resources the wrong way and have to restart a level whereas the Alawar ones tend to not have a way to paint yourself into a corner.Some more aspects that make this game stand out to others in its class is the unique characters and story. Instead of following the tired ""inspired by history"" or ""rescue the whatever"" pattern, this one involves completely fictional creatures, the Tribloos. The story and dialog were entertaining and kept me going to figure out how it would end.Considering this game was essentially made by 3 people, it's very impressive. It was a nice addition to my casual game selection. There's nothing stressful about this game, the levels and puzzles can be worked out, and getting 100% achievements is simply a matter of playing the game, including the Challenge levels.The price is a bit on the high end, especially since the game has been out for over 3 years now, so you may want to wait for a sale. However, dedicated casual gamers might be willing to pay full price.


That AI puzzle wasn't very difficult.

												This is a quick, fun little strategy game suitable for adults and children aged 6+. Most of the levels are very easy to complete - the challenge lies in doing them quickly enough to beat the timer and get gold star ratings. There are 75 levels plus 15 bonus levels in the game, which for me amounted to about 20 hours total play time. Easy to pick up for 10 minutes and put down again.			"

												The fastest way to describe Tribloos 2 would be a simplistic The Settlers in 2D. The game consist of levels and on each level you need to build up all the building sites and/or collect the needed resources. You are in control of sending your workers to collect resources or working on buildings. You get a better score by completing the level faster and having more resources. The thing I didn't like about Tribloos is the artstyle. It's unappealing and the reason I never installed the game in the first place. I recommend this game, but it's much better suited for the mobile. So I suggest you get it for Android or iOS instead if possible.			"

												Tribloos 2 is about strategy and well-timed clicking rather than spam-clicking as fast as you can, so it should appeal to people who like to plan in their time-management games. (Like me!) Each chapter adds a new wrinkle, so you'll be learning new strategies throughout the game.The game's difficulty is moderate. For an experienced player, it is fairly easy to get the gold award on the levels in the first chapter, but getting the gold becomes a true challenge by the middle to end of the game. The punishment for failure isn't severe (you just try the level again, and you can skip the intro if you want). After the first few levels, you have to do tasks in the right order, or you'll get stuck and have to start the levels over. I found the art, animation, and music charming, and I also enjoyed the simple story. People with severe cuteness allergies should check the screenshots and videos before buying, though.			"

I'm thinking about finishing it up since they have added Steam Trading Cards since I put it down. It's a cute time management game with a story line to it. I can't speak for how good the story is since I never finished it. For all I know everyone blows up at the end. If you can get it for a few bucks and like time management games, I reccomend it.			"

												This is casual gaming at its most casual.  You control a certain number of Tribloos to break up rock, build houses, sawmills, tool shops, etc...  As you move from world to world you will find unique things that you can work on, but the basic gameplay remains the same throughout.  Once you have the correct number of resources, icons light up for you to click on so that work can get started on those things.  It's casual in the sense that the strategic portion fo the game is not intense, however, it's even less intensified by allowing you to beat the game without every getting a silver or a gold medal.  This includes obtaining all of the achievements.  This game does not have a challenge whatsoever.  The gameplay has its bugs too.  From time to time I would click for those carrying wood to bring the wood to the Tool Shop to makes tools and I'd have to wait for the Tribloos to get back home before venturing off to another chore.  Other times it would work perfectly.Then there's the annoying parts.  For a timed game where you should complete a level within a certain amount of time, it's annoying to have your Tribloos sent back due to a pipe leaking gas from time to time.  It's a difficult task to time it correctly, let alone time it and finish within a good amount of time.  Same with the underground levels where your Tribloos can get hit by a falling boulder if you don't have hard hats on.  I get that it's part of the strategy, but when it's random luck, or based on timing compared to an actual strategy, then it's just not that entertaining for a game.The sounds aren't bad and neither are the graphics for this type of game, but due to the issues that I ran into I can not recommend this game.  Try playing 12 Laborers of Hercules, you'll enjoy it more and it looks better.			"

												There isn't much I can add that many have already said about this game. But let's try this anyways without going into too much of details.""Tribloos 2"" is a fine example of a good ""more of the same"" sequels; while the gameplay is for the most part unchanged, most notable difference are the new visual-style especially the outlook of Tribloos themselves (jokingly saying: Very-long-distance Barnapapa-relatives have chapeshifted into Mogwai-Ewok-Wookie-offsprings).Story-wise not having the experience of the first game isn't required for the most part mainly due similar premise alongside very ""newbie""-friendly story-telling (I.E. Characters are explained briefly-enough without need of lenghty recaps and such; I just can't remmeber the name of the ""trope"" at the moment).Story while simplistic (and perhaps slightly dispointing in the end to some), is still a very delightful read / exprience-through: This is mainly due nowadays very uncommonly seen genuiely seen ""smart-characters"". Again, the Mogwai-analoque from earlier joke seems to be rather fitting here.For possible ""spoilers"" though, browsing though the screenshots of this game might give a rather good idea of the characters in general.The gameplay is very good change of pace in a puzzle / management-market which tend to quite frustating with too strict rule-set and such.Or what I am trying to say is that it's very enjoyable to be able to play games such as Tribloos which don't require lightining-fast thinking-reflexes alongside the need to thinking far too much ahead. Or anything else that would onstruct completing a simplistic game like this.Point being, that aside of course the initial player mess-ups at the beginning of stages (E.G. not building the Saw Mill), all players are eventually going to be able to beat the stages alongside seeing this game through; the time-bonus is mainly for completionist, although even ""casuals"" might find excitement to get their planning and timing bring big high-scores.Of course, the biggest question probably would be ""how much worth this game is?"". I personally can say that these 10-USA$ certainly were a better investement than 60€ for a 3-hours-game.			"

												Nice little game. Needs some work on the text style (white outlines and a white background...) and needs a lot of work on English grammar and spelling (which is *very important* if you're selling this as an educational game). The game mechanics themselves are nice, though.			"

												There are some graphics issues (weird outlines, bugs, soft or pixelly looking images) and I also got bored pretty quickly. It probably gets a bit more frantic later on, but with so many good puzzle games out there for so cheap I didn't feel like it was worth the amount of time I spent just watching meters count down and clicking in an obvious spot once every 30 seconds. I was told this was similar to lemmings and that's probably part of my disappointment, as that's one of my favorite game franchises - none of the anxiety and feeling of need to solve the issues present in lemmings is here - it's just a timer and apparently doesn't even matter if you complete on time to progress.

												This is a really nice game about building, well buildings, and other things. Often buildings have other buildings as requirements so you have to build those first. This may result in some complex build orders in later levels.This game is a race against the clock but just for bonus points, so if your timer runs out before you could finish a level you will just lose some bonus points which is how it should be.There are some broken pipes in later levels... those are rally annoying but aside from that this is a great game with a cute story and a definite recommendation from my side.

												I enjoyed this casual game. The achievement list isn't amazing, but you are likely to perfect game it easily.There are bugs... I've seen resource counts go negative, etc.There are design flaws... In a few maps if you build in the wrong order you will have no option but to restart. Basically taking the ""choice"" away and making it a puzzle you get one shot at. Note: These are not hard and the game does warn you about using your resources poorly. But still, I would never force a player to restart a level by design, thats just bad form.I got bored, but I usually do. I will for sure come back to perfect game this.			"

												This is one of those games where you have to build structures and collect ressources in a particular order within a time limit. (Like the Labours of Hercules series.) All time limits are fair, so that a good player usually only needs a few tries maximum to get a ""gold time"". There are also a couple of achievements to unlock. There are also some nice tracks within the sounds. ;-)All in all a great little game. A bit slow at times. Includes about 100 levels, and takes around 12-14 hours to get through if you want all achievements.			"

At the Time of WritingGame: Tribloos 2Price: $10.99*Genre: casualTime Played: 25 hoursPersonal Enjoyment Rating: ☺☺☺☻☻GeneralThough this might be most prominently categorized as a casual game and looks like it has been made for children, some levels had required timing which took me a couple of tries to get right. Being a completionist certainly contributes to my long playtime - I finished every level with a Gold time rating - but also bear in mind that there are 90 levels to work your way through.On the whole I think that there could have been more variety with the resources and more complexity to the resource chains, but at least it does have a fair variety and does have resource chains. Although I don't mean to mislead you here. This isn't a resource management game, it's more like a gentle logic puzzle that requires some timing.GameplayThis is a bit of a god game in that you order your little furballs around. There are set buildings to construct which require resources that you must gather. Some buildings produce resources or tools which you will need in order to access all of the buildings or special resource goals for each level.Although the basic concepts are rather simple, you must figure out the best order to perform various actions, as well as managing your timing well. You don't want to be short on a resource for a building when you should probably already be halfway through its construction!One big downside would certainly be the repetitiveness. Some new resources will get introduced and the scenery changes every once in a while, but every level is pretty much the same thing. It never really ramps up the difficulty or complexity of the game.ControlsAll done with the mouse. You click on the blue circles to initiate a job, and then you can choose to add or remove tribloos to that job. More tribloos means it will complete faster, but you will find you need to reassign some of them to other tasks.StorylineThere is a storyline with some rather nice comic strip style artwork. These little bits of storytelling happen throughout the game. I must say though that it was the artwork I enjoyed more than the story, which seemed to be rather one dimensional and the characters flat. Nothing ever made me feel particularly protective of the furballs or very concerned about their survival.This might not the sort of game you buy for storylines, but if you're going to go to so much trouble to create all the artwork, I think that one should go to the same sort of effort with the writing.SoundI found the sound certainly complimented the game. It was generally relaxing music, although the sound effects were fairly innocuous. I would say that the sawmill's buzz-saw noise got tiresome after a while. The sounds at an end of a level along with the giant rainbow are definitely obnoxious, but one only has to suffer it at the end of each level.GraphicsI really enjoyed the art style of the game. Sure, it doesn't look terribly complex, but there is a nice organic feeling about it. Where the sound falls down, the visuals certainly pick up the slack.Pros+ easy to lean to play and complete+ a little challenging to get Gold+ lovely art+ did entertain me for 25 hoursCons-/+ treats the player like a child- dull, flat storyline- gets repetitiveHelp me Help youPlease• give me constructive criticism in the comments - tell me why the review wasn't helpful• upvote my Steam review if you liked it so that others are more likely to find it too!Rothana's Steam Review ArchiveFor those that are interested in seeing more of my reviews, I have set up an archive of them at an external website. I don't earn anything off of this at all, it's just a little side project that I add to when I can.
