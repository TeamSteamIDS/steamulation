												I have a soft spot for the original Warlock in spite of its many failings (poor AI, poor play balance and numerous bugs). But I cannot recommend this new release.  It is basically window dressing on the old game without addressing any of its faults.  Aside from the revamped spell research, nothing that couldn't be provided in DLC. Oh it's got more, more pictures, more units and two new races. If you don't mind paying $30 (or $40) for your DLC then hop on board.  But if you were looking to address the fundamental issues (above) then don't waste your time and money.There is actually one group I can recommend it to and that is those that liked the Armaggedon DLC.  They didn't fix the pathing or the horrible NPC AI. (I think the monster AI got some tweaks) But their solution to those looking for a challenge is to introduce a whole slew of tough Spirit damage dealing monsters and unload wave after wave of monster spawns; very much in the spirit of Armaggedon.  The larger your territory the larger your clean-up issues.  As a plus you don't have to worry about your actual economy since the frequent spawns will keep you swimming in gold and mana.			"

												I've put in 8 hours and want to play more, so there's no doubt that this is a good game, nevertheless I can't help but feel a little cheated. Almost everything about this game is an improvement on the previous game (Warlock master of the arcane), but it isn't enough to justify it being a whole new game for this price. From what I've seen so far this could have just been a big dlc/add on/expansion, or something the modding community worked hard on.I suppose the best example that comes to mind is XCOM: Enemy unknown and XCOM: Enemy within. There's enough difference between the two for it to be an expansion, but not a whole new game. Please don't misunderstand, this is a good game but if you already own Warlock master of the arcane, I'd say wait until this goes on sale before you pick it up.P.S. this is early access, so there might be enough in the full release to justify a whole new game. Also I've only played 8 hours, there might be more that I just haven't come across yet.			"

												I've been enjoying this game immensely, but I can't recommend it until some issues in game receive some much-needed attention. In exiled mode, there are a few critical quests that can break via various common conditions in game, causing them to never be able to be completed. Though it won't halt your progress, it may create cripplingly challenging conditions (Think of all the land you own slowly falling into the ocean turn by turn.) that can be impossible to recover from. The AI behaves much like a stuntman running through glass windows, and it can create an unintentional mess (Or is it intentional?) when an AI settler barges into a dangerous dimension and invites an army of shadow dragons into your shard to do battle with  your tier 1 archers. Much of the game seems to be the luck of the draw, and though I do enjoy hitting my head against that brick wall over and over, I don't see the fun a strategy enthusiast less masochistic than me would have with it. I'm saving you a headache. Definitely keep an eye on this title, but I wouldn't throw out any money just yet.			"

												This game is Warlock 1 with an expansion pack. It has more races, more building and unit options, and an improved interface but they aren't really enough to make it a game in its own right. The main scenario is interesting but it suffers from the issue that many strategy games do where they compensate for the AI being a bit dumb by throwing huge numbers of units at you instead. As you approach the finale, 10 or so high level units randomly spawn across your lands every turn making that part of the game a frustrating grind.Basically not enough new content to justify a new game, I would stick with Warlock 1.

												Update 9/2/15 From this thread: http://steamcommunity.com/app/205990/discussions/0/611696927914646122/BjornB Dev ""Thanks for the feedback! Sadly we don't have much resources for this game anymore. There are some brave souls working on the Linux/Mac version. But that's about it for now I'm afraid.""So that is Apr 2014 - Oct 2015. (Last meaningful update in OCT) Something to bear in mind, considering its bugs since release.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 7/2/15 Still working my way thro latest campaign evaluating current state. Looking promising so far.Video series below.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 01/11/14 New mini campaign ""Wrath of the Naga""  - currently evaluating changes, see video below.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update - 04/10/14 No new expansions or additions to change this recommendation so far. Just the tweaks to fix spawn rate as detailed below, some ai fixes (needed), the controllable city changes(see below). Ingame store has been removed: http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?803742-No-more-in-game-store!-The-contents-will-be-made-available-through-other-means-later!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------First off, this is not a sequel, its warlock 1 with a few new features. Limited fully controllable cities ( can now be toggled on/off in sandbox, warlock 1 mode). Different research mechanics ( see below ), 2 new races and a single player campaign ( think portal worlds from warlock 1 linked together ). Same pointless diplomacy ( NA, Alliance, Declare War, Repeat).I love the original but the problem here is this feels like paying again for the exact same game. Put it in sandbox mode and you would be very hard pressed to tell the difference looking at it. This should have been an expansion. £44.99 for the base game and 0 day dlc..... It staggers my mind.If you own warlock 1 your not missing anything and should wait for a reduction in price. If you dont own the original this one has most of the features of the original (no armageddon mode but thats understandable) with slightly different mechanics for research (more choice in the order of research with a view of what to research later) and  a horrendous amped up spawn system in exiled mode (thank god now its adjustable).Unfortunately I cant recommend this based on the price. I desperately want this to do well but i cant in all honesty support this growing trend of releasing what is essentially the same game for a premium price.Wrath of the Naga playthrough currently in progress:

												Edit: You can disable the city limit at the startup. For some reason I thought it was included in my original review, I was mistaken. Disabling it does make the experience a lot more like the first game and more fun in my eyes. Also tried to fix some spelling errors – no excuses for those.I wish I could recommend Warlock 2. I really liked the first game as a cheap, fun little Civ clone with a bigger focus on combat. I thought number 2 would address some of my complaints about the first game or at least change things up. But what I didn't like about Warlock 1 remains and also has some new annoyances: bare-bones diplomacy system, random AI opponent decisions (really alliances don't matter - you'll end up warring and clashing with everyone), limiting how many perks you can give to units, enemies spawning inside your territory at random times (especially when it decides to create enemies FAR too powerful you to deal with), random quest spawning that creates enemies that you need to fight, even if you refuse those quests...the list sadly goes on.And while I understand the new Unrest rules and city limit, Warlock pretty much thrived on expanding and creating more and more cities and the Unrest system pretty much makes it so you need to play it small. And considering how massive some of the worlds can be you'll run out of effective cities really quickly. That means you need to convert old cities into special cities: free cities (like Civ puppet cities, only they only generate an insignificant amount of gold, fortress cities (which is pretty much a range 3 tower) or religious cities (which give a small amount on mana and improve relations with the chosen god). Maybe if people don’t like managing large amounts of cities they'll enjoy this focus but for me it just didn't work.I did have some fun with Warlock 2. In the 70 hours I put into it I really liked going through portals and discovering new worlds in the Exiled mode. But honestly if you need a fantasy 4X game go with Civ 5 (with some of the fantasy mods), Fallen Enchantress and Warlock 1. If you do want to play 2, I recommend a really big steam sale.			"

												I bought Warlock 2 during the Summer Sale, and I've quite easily gotten my money's worth. It is a lot of fun, though not without serious flaws. My review is based on three (partial) plays of ""The Exiled"" story mode, and one full playthrough in ""Battle for the Outplanes"" mode.A big complaint a lot of people have is that it seems like a content update, rather than a sequel to Warlock. This is true to an extent. However, the handling of the planes was the biggest flaw of Warlock 1 but seems to be the central appeal of Warlock 2. In Warlock 1, there were other planes, and they were full of big bad monsters, but they weren't very interesting and the rewards for going there weren't significant enough to bother with them. A game of Warlock 2, on the other hand, has a hierarchy of planes, where you (and your A.I. opponent mages) start on less threatening planes, and you work your way down through to planes with significantly more dangerous fauna (and sometimes flora), or back up the hierarchy to fight the other great mages. Each plane has its own unique flavor, and most special resources only occur in one or two types of plane. The special resource thing is key... most races don't have strong research-producing buildings, so you need to chase after the research-producing resources, which tend to be a couple planes down from where you start. The first time I reached a Shadow Plane, and established a fortress there to defend myself against the horrible shadowy horrors that awaited me, it felt ... well... I would say ""epic"", but that word is way overused these days. But it was awesome.I was also impressed with how much the game made me care about terrain, and provided a multitude of terraforming spells that I actually want to use. The ability to throw up a mountain where I want a defensive chokepoint, or to raise up a landbridge when I want to cross an ocean is quite empowering.The big flaws of the game, are that the AI is quite poor (and the game is pretty easy in general), and that the game gets tedious once you have a big empire. Planar portals provide your primary military chokepoints in the game. The A.I. takes advantage to this to an extent, in that it's smart enough to build fortifications on its side of a portal. However, it's really bad at launching offenses through portals. If you stay perpetually at war with an A.I., it will continually send a trickle of one or two units at a time through the portal to be slaughtered on the other side. The only threat the A.I. can pose, is if you let it build up during peacetime, and send a large number of units through at a time. If you let this happen, A.I. units will pop up in funny places as they exit at the nearest unoccupied hex on your side of the portal.The late-game tedium arises mostly from troop movements. Moving troops across your empire takes an awfully long time when you're spread out across several planes. I don't trust the pathfinding of the game to do it for me, as it often works rather poorly (though this is somewhat understandible technical hurdle, given the many movement modes of units, as well as all of the terraforming). One thing about the game alleviates some of the late-game tedium though. You are limited in the number of normal cities you can have at once (starting at five, and increasing with research). But you can also have an unlimited number of special cities, which are less beneficial than a normal city, but require no management. Managing cities doesn't become a slog, because you typically only have 5-10 of them that ever need any attention.The story mode (""The Exiled"") is cool the first time, but is essentially the same each time you play.My plays thus far:1. Exiled Mode, average difficulty, small multiverse, two opponents.  I was friendly with the other great mages and focused on the storyline. I had a lot of fun exploring the game for the first time, but ultimately got bored while fighting through the penultimate plane (which is full of tough monsters, but is way too big and unvaried to hold my interest) and quit.2-3. Exiled mode, hard diffuculty, small and medium multiverses, max opponents. Did some conquering of great mages and had fun conquering my first few planes, but ultimately got bored.4. Battle for the Outplanes mode, impossible difficulty, small multiverse, two opponents. I played this one all the way through . I had quite a bit of fun with it, but was overall very dissapointed with just how easy I could conquer the ""Impossible AI"" opponents.I'm off to try Sandbox mode next. I'm hoping the A.I. will handle it a bit better.			"

												Warlock 2 is a truly fantastic game, despite what some of these reviews may say. If you're a lover of 4X strategy games and fantasy lore, get this game -- you won't be sorry.One of the reasons this game has so many harsh ratings is because it can be a little buggy. But on the right system (Windows 7, 8 and 10 all work well), it's a ton of fun and you'll encounter few bugs. I can safely say this after 2000+ hours of game play.However, the Linux and Mac versions do not work. The developers were forced to abandon the game before they were fixed, so avoid this game if you're using one of those OS's.PROS- Tons of flavorful units (15+ for each race, several more 'wild' creatures)- Varied and unique races- Interesting lords (hero units)- Simple but highly strategic combat system- Wide variety of fantasy resources- Strategic spells (terraforming, empire boosting, unit enhancement)- Great game modes (sandbox maps, shard worlds, boss-killing campaigns)- Rich lore (with a good sense of humor)- Excellent replay value- Tons of fun -- one of the best games I've ever playedCONSBUGSThere are a few stubborn bugs and the developers are no longer able to work on the title to fix them. On Windows, none of the bugs are game-breaking.To give you an idea, roughly 1 in 20 games I've played have crashed at some point. (Games are usually 20+ hours long.) The good news is that you can usually ""correct"" a game-crash bug by loading an autosave from just a turn or two prior and doing your turn a little differently.Note that there are also a few mods that fix a number of minor bugs -- Renaissance Mod fixes many of them.SUBPAR AIAs a beginner, the AI seems quite strong. But once you know what you're doing, the AI is lackluster and you'll catch it making some bone-headed moves, even on the most difficult setting.Luckily, a number of mods improved the AI -- Legendary Mode AI is one and Renaissance Mod is another. The AI still makes the occasional poor move, but the games themselves are much more challenging with either of these mods.NOT FOR LINUX / MACDespite what the description says, users agree that the game is not in a playable state for Linux and Mac users.DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WARLOCK 1The first Warlock was widely criticized on two counts:1) It looked like a Civ 5 clone. True, it does have a very similar feel to the UI in Civ 5, and it has retained this feel for the sequel. But the gameplay is quite different than a Civ title, with only passing similarities.2) The game lacked strategic depth. To win, all you really needed to do was to ""city spam"" your way to victory. There was no downside for having multiple cities, making most games feel like a race to see who could expand the fastest.You could also ""perk"" (buff) as many units as you wanted just by capturing a single resource tile. Very easy to abuse.Warlock 2, however, changed both of these things for the better by adding some much-needed limitations.SMARTER LIMITATIONSSome people who enjoyed the freedom Warlock 1 granted with regards to city spamming and limitless unit perks are likely to be turned off by the sequel. I know I was at first... until I played a bit and realized how much these changes improved the game.In fact, fans of the first title pushed back so hard on the city limit that the developers added the ability to turn it off when you create a new game. But just as the developers noted that disabling the city limit is ""not recommended,"" I strongly concur. The gameplay is so much richer with some scarcity and consequences for overextending -- just as it is in the best 4X games.MORE STRATEGIC DEPTHAs I learned to play with the newly laid out limitations on number of cities and availability of perks, along with the new unrest system, I discovered that the developers really did know what they were doing. The game has TONS more strategic depth than Warlock 1. So again -- take some of these negative reviews with a grain of salt.The developers really did a lot to improve the game with these simple changes. When people say Warlock 2 is just a clone of the original with more content, they are sorely mistaken.MUCH IMPROVED RESEARCH TREEIn Warlock 1, researching spells is entirely random. When it's time to research a new spell, you're given a small selection of random spells and are able to chose one.The sequel offers an actual research tree, with clearly laid out paths to acquire new spells. This gives you the ability to navigate the tree and strategically chose your preferred research path. Many players consider this the best improvement over the original.SUMMARYAside from World of Warcraft, I don't think I've ever spent so much time playing (and enjoying) a game.Is Warlock 2 perfect?No.The cons I described above should be fair warning to those who are concerned about getting this game.Is Warlock 2 worth your time and money?YES. Absolutely.Sure, It does have some imperfections -- many of which I've managed to correct myself in my own popular mod for the game, Renaissance Mod:


Renaissance Mod 
A Workshop Item for Warlock 2: the Exiled
By: Chumley

			 THE NEXT BEST THING TO WARLOCK 3!  A Renaissance has come to the lands of Ardania! New spells, artifacts, lords and Great Mages have been spotted throughout the land, as a Sylvan Order arises to protect Ardania...		


Note that Renaissance adds loads of fun new content to the game, too.TL;DR - If you're running Windows and you love fantasy and 4X games, get this game and the DLC -- especially if it's on sale. You'll be doing yourself a disservice not to give it a try.If it was as bad as some of these other reviews would have you believe, there wouldn't be such a loyal fanbase for the game.			"

												Full disclosure: I never played Warlock 1, so I'm not comparing this game to it's predecessor. Secondary, I'm a latecomer, so by now I have not observed any issues and bugs that no doubt where present at launch - at the current date of September 2015 the game works just fine, excluding the odd twist of slowing down your typing if you alt tab out of it, nothing else is affected as far as I can tell. And thirdly I picked it up on sale with a huge Paradox bundle, so my expectations where not colored by trying to figure out if I got my moneys worth.Having sad all that I found the game highly enjoyable, what sets it aside from other 4x is the spell casting system that lets you take very active role in the world, up to and including fully transforming it, you are a great mage and you do feel like one playing it.The unit verity is great, attention to details and races is very noticeable, the world is deep and detailed and well thought through (it is the world of Majesty 1 & 2 btw.) the sense of humor is subtle and clever and does not get in the way of immersion.The IA is uncomplicated - it is unlikely to wipe you out but can put up a fight if you are the one going against it, yet the spells can make it a very interesting multiplayer experience.Do keep in mind that if you played a 4x before you need to start on Challenging difficulty or higher, normal is really designed for people who don't get the principle behind the game at all - you as a player have an inherit advantage over AI so it needs a boost desperately.And remember to concentrate on quality instead of quantity - spawning a horde of tiny low upkeep units does not work well with having to travel through portals :)Oh yes, and DLC - the Naga expansion is done quite well - another fun and unique race and a game mode that is quite different from the rest (can be very frustrating thou if you are not playing as naga yourself, take the ""clean land"" spell at the start or you will suffer). The small 5$ dlc is not worth the asking price, if you are after the content, but if you want to throw some money as a donation to the devs than go for it :)			"

												So I and my friend pre-ordered and played Warlock 2 in Exiled mode.First of all - game is too easy. Literally no challenge. After Dremers it's incredibly easy to play. (We played on Hard this time)Second - there needs to be an option to tune size of shards and their landmass type. In our game all except one were solid land and one was continents. Most of them were tiny.AI is dumber than W1 - it can't pass over water, lower mountains. So it's even possible to lock AI in home shard by raising mountains around portal. AI does build good units, it does not use them, for example human mages with range 3 are often in front line.Late game (150+ turn) offers no challenge, only annoyance with easy-to-kill-hard-to-find-them-all low-tier units like red dragons, undead and so on. Shadow dragons and spiders do offer some chllenge but could be ignored by just killing United One ppl - cause they're so weak, we got them all with 2 rainbow dragons, 3 legendary heroes and 2 starting heroes. Dragons and 1 basic hero died.I had over 9000k (literally) gold and over 5k mana(some time mid game it was even 7k) at the end of game cause there's no need to use it.City limit is fine tho, makes sense, but there should be at least one more spell to increase it maximum(myabe not researchable, but only in chests).Most of powerful resources are not used(dragon eggs, nevril, uranite, obsidian) cause - first, you don't need em, when you have 150+ res each on all of your heroes, second - you don't have enough free cities to capture em, and it's too long to develop new one in case you decide to shutdown old one for resource capture means you lose much of production(however, thats actually not that important - read above).Overall feeling - game is not worth its money, it should be DLC for the 1st one for 10-15$ max.P.S.: IMPROVE THE AI!!!

												For the person who is NOT familiar with Warlock:Warlock is easily comparable to Civilization or any other turn-based strategy games (4k). Think Civ 4 with magic instead of nukes, werewolves instead of tanks, and heroes that kill everything. The only real difference is that YOU have the power. Any single creature on the map is ultimately powerless against the almighty Great Mage (you). They are unable to attack you directly, leaving you to cast hellfire and lay waste to your enemies. However, you are not alone. Others like you have taken up their roles as leaders. It is a strategy game in which the king himself is not useless and everything is your pawn. It has diverse abilities for the Great mage. Abilities such as healing, fireball, frost nova, and even ones that allow you to modify tiles around you. Using this to your advantage you are to beat the other mages to a bloody pulp with your wit and charm... OR JUST RAMPAGE THROUGH EVERYTHING WITH AN OP ARMY OF GIANT HELIAN WEREWOLVES... or is that just me.... Anyway, interactions with other mages can either lead you towards joint prosperity or a WAR. Random occurances can just as easily wipe out a city as any of your enemies. Oh, all your troops on the front lines? Have two annoying dragons harrass your Capital. It's alright. I'm sure you'll survive...Gods are important, and thus your relation to them can alter the tides of battle in your favor. They can provide you with epic level units or give you a spell that can obliterate your enemy. With many Gods to choose from you will learn who suits your playstyle very easily.There are several worlds that coincide with one another. These worlds are split up and can be navigated between via portals. There are several miniature locations all set around different biomes and then the main land. Ardiania. Fun place. Green grass, blue water, giant serpent monsters, massive spiders... You know, epic vacation level stuff. Beautiful terrain where everything seems to want to kill you. Why did you ever leave?TL;DRWarlock is one of those games you can spend hours at a time and never get bored. It never slows down and always has you focused on complete anihilation of your foes, or desperate survival from hordes of enemy forces. Every turn is something new. If the game slows down, it'll throw a personal quest at you, sometimes a band of misfits, maybe an elemental, or sometimes an enemy epic level creature that can eat a city in one turn.Anything Goes. It's mostly unexpected and on the harder difficulties any wrong step means certain death. Are you up for the challenge?For those who know Warlock:UI is the same as Warlock 1, however, it has multiple modes, new races, new units, an actual storyline, and the best part? It is mod compatible, something the community of Warlock: Master of the Arcane asked for, for a long long time. At first glance you might think ""there isn't anything new here... It looks just the same.."" but it makes it easy to just pick it up and go. If you are familiar with Warlock 1, this should be a cakewalk... With one exception. You mage is limited, you have to learn a specific number of spells in a few catagories in order to gain access to the more powerful ones beyond. These catagories are Wizardry, Sorcery, and Divine. This means you have to plan ahead, also... It means that the spells that you choose while customizing your wizard are actually worth choosing now and you are limited to 5 different choices, especially when what you want isn't what was listed as a choice.The game is also modable. You can add your own race, units, heroes, and portraits for your own great mage.			"

												On its own, Warlock 2 is a pretty good game, and a must buy if you don't have warlock 1. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a lot of difference from Warlock 1 which is why you see a lot of negative reviews because a lot of people expected more considering its been a long time since the first Warlock game and the DLCs aren't value for money, they cost a lot but don't really add a lot to the game. Good news is, there is this amazing fan who made a patch that adds way more content (2 entire races, lots of perks, abilities, upgrades) and fixes some of the broken parts of the game (Dragon faction too weak etc) so it becomes a much better game overall. Pros:1. More combat and magic spell oriented Civ 5, don't expect diplomatic or economic victories here2. Lots of spells and differentiation between races and Lords, unlike say Civ 5 where you have unique unit and thats it3. Rennaisance mod makes it value for money*Cons:1. Expensive - Unless you buy it on sale you need to pay a lot for expensive DLCs which add little to the game, to play the Rennaisance mod requires you to buy every single playable DLC in the game2. Without the R Mod you are basically getting a repackaged Warlock 1 game, might be better to just buy Warlock 1 and all its DLC since that would be cheaper and you essentially get the same experienceTLDR: If money is a concern then just buy on sale or better yet buy Warlock 1. If not, buy everything so you can install and play the Rennaissance mod and have a great experience.			"

												Save your money for something else. Not only is the developer and/or publisher overprice this game with DLCs, they also don't care about fixing the game post-launch.The game itself is similar to Warlock 1, but with supposedly many enhancements.

												This game is bad and the devs should feel bad.It is awash with bugs, menus consistently have things overwriting each other, producing nice bits of illegibility.As a turn-based strategy game, of course it will take a good deal of time to move each and every one of your units every turn... but is it really necessary to have them all walk incredibly slowly from one point to the next?  And to be unable to do anything else while they're walking?  It's... time padding a game with an already near-glacial pace.  Turn-based strategy is slow, that's fine, good, great... but if you're making one, you should try to smooth that, make moving from one of your actions to the next a nice, smooth experience... not... make it take extra time, as though you were trying to turn a short single-player campaign into a long one.

												I was really looking forward to Warlock 2, but the game quickly became repetitive and tedious. As much as I enjoy building an army of monsters, dragons, warriors, and the like, the game pacing, ridiculous number of randomized monsters, mediocre diplomacy. and uninspired spellbook really squanders this game's awesome potential as a great 4X fantasy game. I guess I'll have to wait and see if Endless Legend succeeds where Warlock 2 clearly fails.			"

												Updated: The Paradox forums indicate no further patching will be done on the Mac or Linux versions of this game:http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/new-osx-linux-patch-2-2-203-live-on-beta-branch.818297/#post-19299159The game remains broken in a number of key ways on these platforms and should not be purchased. Extremely shabby practice. Original review: This game seems to be very solid mechanically. I wish that what buildings were available was tied to a tech tree of some kind, but that's a minor complaint. What sticks out is that Warlock II solves the late game micro Hell of most 4X games without sacrificing early and mid expansion and development play by making it prudent to convert your cities into automated gold or mana or piety batteries. I think this is a brilliant design decision. Compare it to Civ V BNW. In BNW, hard nerfs to science left four to six cities optimal for most of the game, which means that decisions about city placement and development are kind of limited in scope. By mid game these cities will be strong enough to each build everything useful, and because there are so few multiplicative national or great wonders there's little incentive to specialize. Here, because you're constantly expanding outwards and throwing your initial core cities onto automated gold production, you have all kinds of opportunites to specialize your new settlements according to the local terrain and to make decisions about whether to maintain a well-built research city that puts you over your limit and will never be strategically useful as a unit production center.So while I think this is one of the most ingenious design decisions I've seen in a strategy game lately, I can't recommend this game. First, there are major problems with the AI. I don't especially mind this because the game's emphasis seems to be on using your empire as an engine to reach and generate units powerful enough to defeat powerful NPC units rather than on direct competition with AI empires, but it bears mentioning that the enemy empire AI basically can't play the game.The most major issue, though, is the huge array of bugs on the Mac and Linux ports. I bought this without looking into its technical side because I was under the impression that Paradox had really cleaned up its act in terms of publishing non-functional products, but these versions of the game are virtually unplayable. I was most hit by the fact that the quests system, which is integral to progress in some places, is completely broken on both platforms in both release and beta versions, but browsing the Paradox support forums reveals a huge number of other issues from broken saves to constant crashes. After the backlash Paradox has had from putting its name on busted stuff and its subsequent attempts to up the standards for both its in house development and its publishing side, it's extremely disappointing to see something in this state for sale. Presumably they're working on fixing these issues, but these ports have been out for months and are not playable in a meaningful way.			"

												To All Hope Filled Great Mages,At this very moment, Warlock 2 is not worth the money.  Now paradox has always done fantastic games in the past, and Warlock 1 was absolutely amazing, so I hope one day this game will be worth the effort.  Maybe it's just because it's not fully unlocked yet, maybe the new features will come on April 10th, but as it stands right now, it really feels like the designers played Eador: Masters of a Broken World, and said ""Hey, that's cool, let's do that for Warlock 2.""  Except in the process, they missed the things that made Eador awesome, and failed to keep the good aspects of Warlock 1 in check.The interface is glossy, and all the voice acting is virtually the same.  Most of the units sound like they're exactly what they were in Warlock 1.  Granted they added a few new races, so there are new sounds, but you'd figure they would try to entertain us somewhat with new material on old units.They also tried to add the morality that is found in Eador.  They did this by giving us decisions where we could upset our people for gain, or make our people happy at a cost, but they fail to put anywhere near sufficient effort into the descriptors.  For examples, vampires invaded my city, and the description said one line about how vampires were at my front door.  And I had four options.  Fight, give in to their demands, or negotiate (the fourth option was grayed out).  Well I have no idea as the player what their demands are, all I see is the end result.  I don't know what I'd be negotiating, and fighting is pretty self explanatory.  In Eador it gives you paragraphs of knowledge about each event, making sure you know exactly what you're deciding on.  There is no evidence of that here.Next, they make the world much larger, and yet smaller at the same time.  Now that you have to portal jump between worlds just to get to other mages...you'd think cities and controlling borders would become easier and more important.  But alas, as they've increased the overall size of the world (though made smaller the majority of the floating shards, which is another concept from Eador..) they have put a cap as to how many cities you can control.  Even with some of the best research you can manage, this number might in a long game hit 10.  There are more worlds than that in a big enough map!  So how do they expect you to resolve this issue?  You can designate cities to be independent and just pay you a small tax as the great mage.  And while this sounds great at first, these cities do not produce food, they -never- expand their borders beyond the starting 1 hex size, and they will still require being defended by the units that you can't feed because none of these free cities produce food for your army.  Not to mention they don't always build on what little territory they have, so anything can spawn there if it wants, making the need to protect the home front even more important...with once again less food.No, the game is not impossible.  No it's not filled with bugs.  In that aspect it is very much any other game by paradox.  But if you buy it, I think you'll agree that at the current moment in time, it's just lacking significant needs.  I'll be on Warlock 1 or Eador until I hear better news about this game, that's for sure.With Regards,Sea.			"

												""Disappointed"" would be the one word I would use to sum up Warlock 2. It's the same bugged engine from Warlock 1 only now it seems the poor programming can no longer be ignored. The Editor is hardly even useable and crashes constantly. It's as if they released the game before it was finished. Feels like a beta, and plays like one too. This entire game would have made for a good DLC for Warlock 1, but as a stand-alone it is not justified in it's current condition.			"

												Little more than an expansion of the previous Warlock, this title's horrible AI, crashes, buggy maps, and poor design choices leave it as a game worth skipping.All the same design flaws present in the original remain in place, all the same art assets as well.  This feels like someone was trying to pad a DLC out and ship it as its own game.Moderately fun, but not a full price title, not to mention this is Paradox, and therefore will have at least enough DLCs to choke a whale.

												Being a huge Civilization fan, I was very happy to find out about another series that is very very similar in gameplay style - but not that similar so is different having it's own theme.Having played all the Civ games it was very easy to jump straight into this,  for those new to this genre you should play the tutorial and read a little online tips and tricks,  to get you off to a smooth start.You build up your own civilization, you create soldiers to defend and attack, pioneers to found new cities, you construct buildings to help your city grow and research spells to help you advance.There are many modes to choose from, you can play relaxed to impossible. You can custom design your starting lands which also come in a few flavours,  exiled, sandbox and one other - you choose your Mage (leader) and how many Mages you compete against.Your armies are supplement by arriving lords, whom you can equip with special artifacts. They are very powerful fighting units-  and wise to keep them alive as long as possible.You move your units and research/construct in turns- you make your moves and then the opposition make theirs and it is your turn again.There are many enemies to deal with, not just from the Mages civ-  many creatures that spawn themselves for you to battle as you discover new lands.It is not a quick game- you need to spend a lot of time just to play through one full game, but it is addictive and easy to keep having that one more turn before you log out!  It is very interesting and quite fun.A couple of annoyances like always having to give your units orders each turn-  unless i am missing something there.There is a  multiplayer option too.  i rate this game 8/10 and highly recommend it for strategy game lovers.

												I feel compelled to write a review on Warlock 2 because I've notices quite a few negative reviews.  As someone who has never played the first Warlock I absolutely highly recommend this version for fans of the 4x genre.  The main gripe I've read in reviews about this game is that it is so much like the first rendition of the game.  I personally can't verify that but if it is, I might think about buying that version too because I LOVE this game.If you like Civ 5 you will like this.  It's basically the same game but with Fantasy lore.  There are some additional features like improved diplomacy, Heroes and quests.  I've found that different heroes are available for hire dependingn on my Factions Race.  I was the undead and I had the option of hiring a Giant Ogre.  I was the Planestriders in another game and had the option of hiring an Elemental Mage.  So many possibilities.  There are also outposts and/or castles that are occupied by neutral or hostile clans.  The technology, city building, and battles all play out similarly to Civ 5 with the exception of the ability to cast spells (And there are a lot of spells).  There are also a ton of units, and buildings etc.  The variety is almost overwhelming at times (But in a good way).Warlock 2 has all the pros of Civ 5 but with some added improvements as previously mentioned.  I don't have a single con for this game!  Not a one!!!With that being said, I haven't touched on the best feature of the game yet.  The ability to mod anything and EVERYTHING!  You want a new Faction?  Do it!  You want new spells?  Do it!  You even want new races or units?  Do it!  New artefacts, Mages, and even buildings?  Yup, you can do that too!  You can even upload your own photos into the game to have whatever picture of your new Mage and/or Faction you may like!  It's absolutely incredible and simple to do!  I can actually see myself spending more time in the mods than the actual game lol.  However, if the mods aren't for you, the game in itself and the gameplay is great within itself.Highly highly recommend for any fan of the genre.			"

												EDIT- Crashing in this game has gotten worse since posting the review. Every game I've played the save file has gotten corrupted and the game crashes. Game is unplayable with all the bugs. I'm a big fan of strategy war games but I can't give a positive review to Warlock 2. The game doesn't have much strategy to it at all and it's very tedious when the game gets larger. Having an army isn't really important and units strengths/weaknesses are only there for show. In Warlock 2 you want to get the biggest unit and have it fight everything. Rinse and Repeat. That's pretty much all there is to it. There is also no good explanation of how the game works and a lack of tutorial and a good way to look at the skill tree and unit specs was frustrating. Warlock 2 also has the problem where the missions don't have an explanation as to what you're supposed to be doing. For example, I got the the very last ""mission"" where you're supposed to kill a boss (2 headed dragon with lots of HP) and spend a long time killing him. It turns out; he's unkillable and ignores damage once he hits one HP. Again, no explanation as to why or what you're supposed to do. I'm sure I could figure it out but the game just isn't worth the time.			"

												After playing Warlock and enjoying it, in spite of some niggling issues, I looked forward to trying Warlock 2. Anticipating new features, cleanups of quirks, and hopefully expanded content, I purchased and began playing. At first things looked good, however, after getting further into the game I quickly encountered several issues that caused me to throw my hands up and remove the game from my system. To whit:Building buffs (like unit armor, combat training, resistance potions) are now limited to a very small quantity. For example, i was only able to outfit 5 units with basic armor. So once equipting my 4 heroes, I had to pick one lucky unit to get the last set.Random monsters that spawn quite a bit more frequently than before (on default setting) now include creature types like shadow dragons, units with 300 hp, immune to a variety of usual attacks, and flying. So much for several of my cities.After building up what seemed like a decent force of heroes, strong (100+ hp melee units) and ranged units (casters and archers), I daintly sent my forces into an outer plane. The horde of shadow dragons, deadwood elementals, gold dragons, and evil warlocks promptly showed me the error of my ways. And this was on the easiest difficulty level.While the gameplay has indeed improved, it feels like the AI was improved by the use of power boosts rather than intelligence. I am not a big fan of 'meatgrinder' type campaigns, especially after the game was modified to restrict me to 5 starting cities (bumpable to 8). I simply could not generate enough quailty units fast enough to replace lost units.If you appreciate running a constant stream of units to be killed while trying to achieve your goal, this game could certainly hold your interest. It does not appeal to me in that it pretty much makes the leveling, buffing, and equipting I prefer in building a fighting force completely moot.			"

												TL;DR Don’t get this game get Warlock: Master of the Arcane. It’s the same and better.I do not recommend this game, because I believe the previous game in the series, Warlock: Master of the Arcane is more fun. Even though this game tries to improve on the previous edition with more races, more features, and even some better systems, it also creates other problems that overshadow the improvements. Being less fun would be ok if this game was different from the original... it's not. Alot of the art and models are literally the same, the gameplay is almost identically, even entire tech trees for races remain the same. This game feels like a bunch of mods/dlc added to the old game instead of a new game. So since its not different and is worse, just get Warlock: Master of the Arcane.First, what the game got right, because credit where credit is due:Spell research is much improved over the previous edition. You pick and plan your spell research instead of being given 5 random options to pick from.Monster lair spawn rate can be adjusted to be less annoying in the late game, or you can have more of it if that's what your into.Some of the additional races, spells, perks, and resources add some complexity and are interesting. Temples allow you to gain reputation with specific gods, even in early/mid game.Now the bad:Too many strong neutral monsters are found everywhere. You're early game, the most crucial part of any run, depends almost entirely on whether you can find city locations away from strong mobs. Too make maters worse, sometimes monsters wander, so it's even more random whether you are going to get crushed. Worst of all, because the Player AI is not great, the neutral mobs end up being a more of a challange than your computer opponents, even on higher difficulties! I want to fight other Players not the environment! While this is somewhat true of W:MotA, its much worse in W:tE.The unrest mechanic adds nothing. One new feature is that unrest can build in your cities which if it gets to 100 unrest overall leads to bad things. What bad things? I'm not sure, and neither is anyone else. Sometimes mobs spawn, sometimes growth is affected, sometimes... nothing. After looking online and trying to figure out how exactly it works, it seems to be pretty universally ignored mechanic. The only way to stiffle unrest is by slowing expansion and its simply not worth it. I've now completely ignored unrest for 3 games and have been no worse off for it.Exiled mode is tedious. Like Armageddon mode in the previous version, now there is alternate mode that has different objectives to the normal game mode. But all you do is slug your way across many different ""worlds"" until you get to the final set of uber bosses. Once you have an economy going there is almost no chance of failure because you never get attacked, you just have to wait to build very powerful units to take on the bad guys. Its slow and requires almost no strategy.The game help and info system sucks and there is too much complexity. With 20 something resources, which each may or may not have a unique application for each of the 7 different races, you find yourself having to constantly look at the tech tree. There is too much. If it all added something to the game, then maybe it would be worth it but often times you find that different units, with different upgrades, and different perks, do the exact same thing and are just as strong. In conclusion, this game only adds minor improvements to the original while also adding many more unneeded features that just make it worse.			"

Posted: April 9, 2015
												I *REALLY* wanted to like this game... I really did -- but the bottom line is that it is convoluted and stupid. Close up, the game is AWESOME. Lots of different units, spells, monsters... Plenty of everything you'd expect and desire in a game like this. Why does it suck? I'll give you some examples -- The campaign world is a series of linked world-shards, or planes, or whatever -- these are connected by gates. It may take several turns for a unit to travel from one connected plane to the next much less to a plane several links away. Your economy cannot support large stacks of units for every city you have on every plane -- so the bulk of your army has to be at the forefront of your campaign. However, no matter how domesticated the planes you conquer become, wild monsters always pop up there. You're forced to summon or send back units to places you've conquered over and over again. It also gets confusing which planes are connected where, and it just seems there should be an easier way to move around and control things. Also, city development is based on a flowchart where to build more sophisticated buildings you must have prerequisite buildings -- this is a common element in this genre of game. HOWEVER, despite this being done right in almost every other game where this is an element, it manages to somehow be opaque in this game what structures a city should have to enable you to build higher tier buildings -- you can either constantly refer to the flow chart button (annoying, and sometimes doesn't scroll anyway) or try to figure it out which the tutorial itself says is just going to lead to frustration and wasted effort. Why not have the city building be done ON THE FLOWCHART, then? Beats the bloody hell out of me. Instead you're wondering why one city you have can only build a million craftsman districts while another one can have a bank and a mint in it... is it because the other city in question has a granary? WHY THE HELL SHOULD THAT MATTER, and if it does why isn't it more obvious!? It's so sad that this game sags under it's weight like it does, because there is plenty to recommend it if such key aspects didn't suck.			"

												Extremely disappointing.  The two new races are ok but would have been better as a simple DLC.  The changes to the core rules are not an improvement.  Your number of cities is limited and troop upgrades from a building site are limited to 4-5 uses per building site.  This has the effect of the upgrades only being applied to your top 5 heroes.  Basic troops are much less useful and strategies now must revolve almost exclusively on your heroes.  Overall the game just isn't that much fun.  I do not recommend it.			"

												I'm a longtime player of a variety of different types of strategy titles... This one doesn't really do anything well enough to stand out from the pack.- The spell and research system has a little potential, but it's not really realized.- The tech tree, construction, city development etc. isn't anything special.- The units don't have anything new for mechanics or elements.- The unit progresison/advancement and lord development don't appear to have anything special about them either.The big downside to me is the pathing and command system for units, it's a little clunky, and if you click through units it doesn't always center you on the selected unit, which leads to movement errors. It also gets increasingly clunky the more you have on the go to manage movement, especially with allies units involved - you'll wind up being blocked by their units from reaching goals - or using your units to block them.All in all, it's a mediocre title that falls short of many similar titles already out - Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes and Eador: Masters of the Broken World are titles that share a good deal in common with this one (Eador's ""shards"" and Warlocks are strikingly similar) - but both of those titles do a better job than this one, in my opinion.

When I first played the ""original"" Warlock, I kind of enjoyed it and gave it a decent review.  I cannot do that for this one.  If you want to play an excellent game, try Masters of Magic.  That is the game Warlock is attempting to emulate here.  It isn't succeeding, but it's trying.  I don't hate or think this game is the worst thing I have ever played, I just...well, like I said, think it is MEDIOCRE.			"

												So very under rated.  If you like Civ 5, but want to play in a Fantasy world instead, then this is the game for you.Many of the critical reviews put me off at first, but after playing for a while I don't understand the complaints.  If you see this on sale - I highly recommend you buy it.			"

												I know a lot of people are disappointed that it's so similar to the first Warlock. I can't argue with that, but I do enjoy the new races a lot. I also think that the new campaign mode works really well. I enjoy working your way up to the fight the 'big bad', and splitting the map up into small shards is a refreshing change of pace.			"

												UNPLAYABLE ON MACVery fun, great concept, but does not work on Mac.  It will launch, and play, but quests are bugged so the game will crash or not correctly advance.  I hope the devs get these bugs ironed out soon, right now its not worth sinking any more time into.			"

												Warlock 2 does, at least in my humble opinion, exactly what a good sequel should do.  There are no sweeping changes here, there are no completely different mechanics, there's no arbitrary new mini-game that fundamentally alters how you play.  Warlock 2 takes all of what made the original fun and polishes it, adds to it, develops, evolves and improves.  City and army building has been greatly improved with more transparency of 'tech trees', unit-improvement resources are now handled better and spell research is leaps and bounds better, with direct and clear choices offered to the player at each step of the way.While many of the art and sound assets  are direct from the first iteration, everything seems just a little more nicely rendered, a little more well built and just, well, better.  The UI is clearer, there is far more help available in-game and everything seems more to-hand than the original did.  With the new game mode and the editor, the wider selection of races and units, there's a lot of content to explore and consume before the well runs dry.Overall, this game is a superb example of what happens when you build a sequel not by reaching for new faddish quirks, by trying to cater to the lowest common denominator or by bloating the game up with reams of pointless minutiae that require advanced statistics and spreadsheets to manage, but by playing the game and understanding that the game was already fundamentally good and simply tweaking and polishing and improving every point.If you liked the original, you will love Warlock 2: The Exiled.  If you didn't like the original, there's a very good chance that whatever put you off has been addressed and improved in this new edition.			"

												It's basically the same as Warlock 1 (which in turn was basically the same as Master of Magic, which was also a game I liked), but it's a bit more balanced, the alternate worlds (which I found to be one of the most interesting parts of the first Warlock game) play a much more signifcant role in the game (and in Exiled mode include a world which is more closely equivalent to the alternate world from Master of Magic), there are more playable races, and the game runs more smoothly.

												I sank many hours into the original Warlock. When I started playing this game it had me like 'been there, done that'. This game is way to similiar to the original to warrant any price tag. This company is just trying to milk the cow, But that's a typical thing nowadays for developers to do, who's fanbase is greatly composed of inexperienced gamers. Any seasoned gaming vet will realize how originality and hard work has disappeared from franchise games during development in this day and age.			"

												Warlock: Master of the Arcane is a very good game. Warlock II: The Exiled surpasses it every way! First let's talk about changes! Spells now have a meaningful tech tree and this tree is expecially useful as spells are grouped such that researching stage one spells for instance will unlock access to stage two spells - more powerful - and so on. Also, depending upin what you research, you gain favor with certain gods and disfavor among others. If you play Magic: The Gathering, think of the color pie on the back of a card. If you curry favor with a god, you also gain some favor with the godto the left and right ofit while simultaneously losing favor with opposition gods. I really like this mechanic as it really makes you think about your spell research more carefully, that is to say, youare not just thinking of your immediate offense and defense but also the longer term metagame.Gone are the downward planes. Instead, similar to Eador: Masters of the Broken World, you play on ""shards"" and portals must be found that connect to other worlds. Space game vets who remember Conquest: Frontier Wars will remember this type of mechanic. And unlike Eador, in this game, you are creating a power base that carries over seamlessly to each new plane you visit. But, the futher you move away, the shards become (naturally) more dangerous. I like Eador, but, THIS is the superior game - the game Eador SHOULD have been.Quests are numerous and interesting and the game retains a nice bit of humor, but happily, it feels a little more serious than the first Warlock. Even if you are a Warlock I veteran, I would advise you to play the tutorial to get comfortable with the changes.			"

												There are a lot of mixed reviews on here about the game.  I bought Warlock 2: The Exiled for quite the bargain and didn't buy it when it just came out years ago and when it was still full-priced.  The reason for bringing this up is because its pricecard is very important. I feel that the game is good, but I wouldn't have been as satisfied about the game if I payed the full price for it. The game is pretty good!  But why? There are a few reasons, but let me start out by stating that which I found the most enjoyable: its gigantic, open feel.  There is so much to explore, so much to see, and so much to figure out.  The whole world is out there for you.  Aside from its sandbox feel, there is pretty intriguing lore available, the Lords (heroes) are enjoyable and unique enough, and the art is far from displeasing.  It's not a fantastic game, let me pop that bubble, but it's fun and customizable. It's a turn-based, challenging, customizable, exploration, strategy game that will suit your needs -- if and when -- for the right price. Now, about its flaws.  The game has quite some bugs in its system.  I had moments where I couldn't click/attack an enemy unit for no reason and also encountered problems when alt + tabbing back into the game, such as, a complete game interface freeze (I could still move the screen around) and clicking not working.  Some weird spells were missing too, the gamed 'Unity' spell. A really frustrating part about its gameplay so far is the random AI spawn.  They spawn random turtles/dragons/skeletons around the map to '♥♥♥♥ around' with your previous bases in other dimensions/worlds, but all it really does is make it a horrible grind fest where you have to keep behind somewhat stronger units to defend older bases.  These older bases become a bit redundant as they barely level up and just offer sustainability in the shape of magic, food, or gold.  But for the rest, this world has been conquered, captured, and is LONG IN THE PAST.  But what we consider to be done becomes a horrible grind-fest of killing 'new enemies' who aren't challenging and really just ruin your progressive game-plan.  It's also quite annoying when the enemy mage shows up and messes with your land and turns it all into volcanoes/snow/whatnot.  I just want to move on-- but wait, oh ok, a random aggressive turtle shows up and it's snowing in my otherwise very lucrative city that I conquered fifty years ago -- great.  Just GREAT. The game does a pretty well job of being decent on its own for the rest, but I have to admit that the challenge is a bit hard to find after a while and battles turn a tiny bit boring. Don't let this faze you, though!  It has been a worthile experience so far and I can't wait to play more.  There is strategy, economy-building and balancing, exploration, and much more involved.  A world of lore awaits.  "

												A gem of a game if you enjoy a fantasy theme turn based strategy game. Especially worthwhile to get it and the 5 expanded content add-ons (Everything but the E-Book and Soundtrack) in order to download the Renaissance Mod, which may as well be the definitive version of the game. It transforms it from a solid game with a lot of a bugs and weak A.I, into one packed with more options, races, challenge, better A.I , less bugs, active improvement, responsive and helpful community. It may as well be Warlock 3 for all intents and purposes.I bought the game here on steam with all the expansions (Which are needed) SOLELY for Renaissance. I hate wasting money on games, but this is one that is worthwhile. Without a sale the price of roughly $50 for the base game and add-ons is a bit steep and concerning (Albeit still worthy if you have the $ to spare), but don't hesitate if there is a sale (i got all the relevant pieces for about $16 or so), you won't regret it!

												So the short answer to ""Do you reccomend this game?"" is yes I do, but I feel a longer answer is needed. You see I play the Civilization series quite a bit and it's one of my favorite games. After experiencing Civ Beyond Earth I was curious if there was some fantasy based game that was similar to Civ. Warlock 2 is pretty much that without being that. While I would overall say it is a good game, it does not come close to measuring up to Civ high bar that may be. There are many things I wish Civ would take from this game IF they were to make a fantasy version. But there is a LOT of basic things this game could have taken from Civilization. Breakdown as follows:Things that SHOULD have been taken from Civ:-Diplomacy: The diplomacy here is really lack luster. There's no trading of reasources because the reasources act differently. Your stances with rivals are pretty much non-aggression, alliance, and war. There are no real reprucussions for breaking the first two. Your relationship with them goes down but who cares you're fighting them. It reallys lacks the diversity in Civ where you can denounce a rival leading to possible make shift alliances. Betraying an ally or breaking non-aggression has an impact on how other nations view you, Instead you trade spells or currencies. That's about it.-Minor Nations: Warlock 2 has small independent cities much like Civ 5's city states. Unlike Civ 5 these cities are always and perpetually hostile. This is boring. One of the beutiful things about City States in Civ 5 is their ability to switch sides as they are courted by other nation and the benefits derived from such an alliance. Here your options are bypass them entirely or take them over. This is particularly irksome when they happen to settle right on or near a world portal.-City Upgrading: Another key difference from Civ 5 is that you have to build your cities buildings on surrounding tiles instead of in the city. I can see why they did that but it's made complicated by some of the ludicrous building trees. Some of them are so convoluted it's a wonder if you can ever access hire tiers and still have reasources. It pretty much means you have to build entire cities devoted to a reasource with a base city where you produce all your units which is not ideal should your food city fall to an enemy for example.-One More Turn: Oh you just won? Game over. No one of the coolest things about Civ is being able to continue playing your empire even after victory. Closet thing you can get to that on this game is trapping you opponents on their starting shards.-Hotkeys: Dear Lord this game needs some hotkeys. In Civ when a unit needs orders it sends you directly over the unit. Here it just sends you to the shard it's on. Now for Civ it wouldn't be a problem. You press C and it centers on the unit. In Warlock 2? Nope just scroll following the units movement path which is frankly another thing that needs work.Things to praise about it that are different from Civ:-Currency Resources: I love the way army upkeep works in this game with units not only needing gold but food and mana. I like the fact that your food feeds your entire empire and not just your city. I know sometimes in Civ it is annoying trying to settle cities in food scarce areas for a reasource and then it can't grow. I like that all excess food is converted to gold. In this way I feel Warlock 2 actually does a better job at simulating a real economy with areas of various terrain contributing differently to the overall empire.-Different Races: Obviously a game about history like Civ is not going to have Elves and whatnot. But seeing the unique units and architecture for each race is unique. Each has a varied playstyle with Svarts having strong expensive units or the Undead consuming mana instead of food.-Leader Customization: Choosing a leader in Civ basically amounts to a civlization bonus and a couple of unique units. In Warlock 2 you can allocate points to different bonuses as well as choosing your race. It makes for a unique experience each time until you find that combo you like most.So if you're looking for a game that's a Civ fantasy game you're going to either have to download a mod or wait for them to make one. But if you're looking for a fantasy turn based strategy game with slightly clumsy controls and a decent backstory this is it. I won't compare it to Warlock 1 because frankly I never played it. I'd advise choosing this one over 1 simply for the new races. If you already have the first one just wait until this one is on sale. I'd also reccomend downloading the mod to prevent the rare crash problem.			"

												Tentative recommendation.  Basically an expansion pack for the original Warlock, it fixes two of the problems (random spell research options and infinite city spam) and adds two new races and some new monsters, a new story campaign, and the planes mode, in which you hop between portals on a bunch of differently themed floating islands.  Unfortunately, nothing else about the original, like the poor AI or balance, was addressed (if anything, the AI is even worse at dealing with the planes mode) the new story campaign has typos in it, which is pretty tacky, and there's a really obnoxious bug that prevents you from manually saving once you have too many save files and requires you to manually clean out your Steam save cache.

												I want to love it, and it could be incredibly fun. New spell system tech tree of sorts is good and more everything basically. But serious game breaking bugs, and some minor annoying ones, still exist after having been out for quite a while. AI is pants on head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, making outrageous demands while at a serious military disadvantage, suiciding the few troops they have, then offering everything they have for peace, and then repeating the process just a few turns later. The game really shouldn't still be in this state. At this point i would just say play original Warlock with all the DLC, which is far more stable, smoother and enjoyable then get this after a few years when hopefully patches (official or fan made) has made it a truly great experience.As it is i would only recommend it to people who are really into the franchise, or can enjoy flawed games that carry a good risk of killing your current saves at any moment for various reasons.

												Warlock 2 has randomly generated levels. It's done poorly.Playing through the tutorial level, my randomly generated world had terrain that was impassable. Not impossible -- I just had to research Tier 3 spells of a particular path and then teach a settler to fly, so that I could follow the tutorial and expand. The game would give quests I simply couldn't do half the time because I was choked for resources due to lack of expansion options. Then enemy AI from an unknown location woke up and started pelting me with land-destroying spells, which just extended the time until I could teach my units to fly. Tier 3, as it turns out, takes a really long time to get to, and the gameplay in this period was horrible: set my units to defend, set a new research target (no research or construction queues), then skip turn after turn while my research progressed. I quit before getting to the spell that would let me get off my starting location. I imagine that the correct response is to restart the game and get a better shaped world. I'll play a different game instead.(The narrator Sean Connery soundalike is awful.)			"

												You know, I really am ticked right now. I truly enjoy the game, been hooked on it for the past three days, and I truly enjoy the first one, but I have never run into so many bugs and crashes from a game before. I do this, crash. I do that, crash. I'm not one to be writing reviews, ever, but this game truly has made me mad and disappointed. I enjoy it, I truly do, but the crashes are out of hand, and the editor!! I love making maps, I have made many from HOMM to Kohan and I have never been so frustrated with a game as I have been and am with this game. I want to play it, but after it crashed on me over 25 times in the past hour (NOT KIDDING) I truly regret ever buying this game, and that is truly sad becuase it's truly a fun game.As of 7/29/16, the game is more playable now, only crashed on me a few times when last I played. Though I have noticed that around turn 150-200 the computer seems to stop playing. Which if you are like me and try to get everything you can out of the game, all troops, near perfect economy and so on, it is a huge let down when you are the only one playing. As for the editor, tried it, crashed on me a bit too much so didn't go back. The game is still fun but up to a point. I still don't recommend it, but if it is on sale and you want a game to play quick and just to win it, then go ahead and get it. But to build a grand army,empire, or to simply truly enjoy everything the game has to offer at once or in every play-through, forget it.			"

												WARNINGThis game is highly frustrating.This games has the worst controls and interface I have ever experienced!!! Please do not waste your time on this...SELECTING UNITS IS A CHORE...- The ""select next unit"" button selects the unit, but doesn't centre your screen on that unit. Once you have 15-20 units you spend literally minutes each turn just finding your own army.- To make things worse, units with a thin red circle are stunned, yellow circle means low movement and then there is a thin white or blue circle for the unit you have selected, so there are just seas of circles and symbols, it's very hard to see!ACTIVATING SPELLS AND SKILLS IS A CHORE...- Units cast spells with left click, but if you want to cancel the spell you need to right click, but right clicking on virtually anything opens up a description page instead of cancelling the spell, if you are warring against an enemy its common for virtually every field nearby to be filled... CONTINUAL POP UP TEXT BOXES...- If you have a unit anywhere near a portal to another world it will literally pop up and ask you every freakin turn to complete the quest until it's done...- There are random events every few turns which are really fun at first, until 5 mins later when you have clicked on the 10th dialogue box ""There is a lvl 1 rat threatening your kingdom, Sire should we A: kill it, B: Feed it, C: let it cause a plague, D: Use magic to teleport it away"" and there is no option E: Who really cares? Even when you select an answer, yet another dialogue pops up to show the outcome and sometimes a third dialogue box pops up because it starts another quest...These are just a few of the many things that make this game virtually unplayable, each turn starts to take 10-15 mins because everything in this game seems to require like 3-5 clicks to do one action.

												Did you enjoy Warlock 1 and wish you had a bigger sandbox with more toys, but the same dumb AI to play against?If your answer is yes, then this game is for you.Here's an excerpt from my full review:Is Warlock 2 a sequel? Is it a reboot? Is it both? Is there even a difference?  I have followed the game online for months and there is no general consensus. I could not form my own opinion until the game was ported to OSX in late October ’14. Now I’m finally going to set my sights on Ardania. I have a score to settle. I seek revenge. I’m going to wipe out the other great expats of Ardania, and seek control. But first, I have to fight the non-stop hordes of monsters that spawn everywhere. I have a schizophrenic AI to tame, it’s time to break out my wizard hat. Let’s begin.TL;DR: If you wanted a true sequel to the surprise that was Warlock 1, you’ll be very disappointed. At best, Warlock 2 is a polished Warlock 1 with a bit more content added. Granted, it was ported to MAC, but in it’s current state it is a broken mess. Warlock 2 is probably only worth buying on sale at a deep discount. You might like this game if:You’ve always wanted to play a fantasy 4X game that mirrors a lot of what Civilization 5 does but with an even more neurotic AI.You like having a plethora of choices with faction units and don’t mind that they don’t look graphically up-to-date.You like the idea of one unit per tile and possibly prefer it over the “stack of doom”.You just want more of the same Warlock, with some minor upgrades and additions.You might NOT like this game if:You like having meaningful diplomacy. None to be had here.You like your AI opponents to give you a challenge in single player.You enjoy stable games (on a MAC).You’re looking for a game that dares to be different. Warlock 2 plays it pretty close to Warlock 1.a link to the full review: http://explorminate4x.com/2014/12/15/warlock-2-review/ "

												This game may look a lot like the original Warlock: Master of the Arcane, but it's got a lot more under the hood, besides new content.Be prepared to experience something new, as a lot of the game mechanics have evolved and the old metagame is dead. As is always the case with innovation, things aren't necessarily right the first time but it's fair to say the devs and the producers have made substantial communication efforts with the community and have managed to instantiate a healthy feedback cycle.Modding has also received official blessing and an editor has been developed to help create and edit maps and game content. There also appear a mysterious ""campaign mode"" but nothing is clear yet as to what this will be.Anyway I could keep writing about the merits of the game but I'm drawn back that ""one more turn"" addictive feeling and I'll leave it at that. I hope to see you in the game lobby soon!			"

												This is  a lost oppertunity for Paradox. If you've played the orginal then you will know the appeal of the a game which combines the best of Civilization with elements from the 90s ""Master of Magic"" and Stardock's more recent Fallen Enchantress. The  Warlock series is steeped in Ardanian lore from games such as the Majesty collection and so has quite a bit of inspiration to draw from. And this, sadly is where Warlock 2 falls short. It is little more than a carbon copy of the orginal with a few changes to the mechanics, some additional units, races and spells. As some have already posted it's more like a combo DLC than a stand alone game. Paradox could have done so much more by expanding gameplay, improving diplomacy and building on the mid and late game events introduced in the Armageddon expansion from the first Warlock game. It is clear that the game engine is the same as the original however. The game is also buggy even as of the latest patch with, in my experiance at least, constant crashes, freezes and stalled AI turns. The AI, is also somewhat flawed and does not give the level of challenge in later stages of the game that you would want. By around turn 80 you know who is going to win. Your greatest challenge mostly comes from the monster lairs and the occasional random event. So should you pay for this?  Well it depends. If you like the Civ-type game with magical elements then yes you probably will find it interesting for a while and you will get a moderate amount of replayability. If you are a fan of the orginal and are looking for some modest evolutionary changes, then again you will continue to enjoy the franchise. If you, like myself, are looking for the next step in magic based strategy games with lots of intricate gameplay, deep diplomacy and challenging AI then you will be disappointed. For those who do play I would strongly recommend the Renaissance Mod from Chumley - it's practically a DLC in its own right. You can find it here:  


Renaissance Mod 
A Workshop Item for Warlock 2: the Exiled
By: Chumley

			 THE NEXT BEST THING TO WARLOCK 3!  A Renaissance has come to the lands of Ardania! New spells, artifacts, lords and Great Mages have been spotted throughout the land, as a Sylvan Order arises to protect Ardania...		


It's easy to tell if a developer puts care, ethusiasm and energy into a release and when they just phone it in for the sake of a few dollars. I never recommend paying full price for games which fall into the later category and unfortunately Paradox on this occasion are well and truely in this space. There is only one sure fire way to make developers take notice and thats through poor sales. At the time of this review, the game is several years old. I would suspect that you can pick it up on sale or relatively cheaply.  "

												Great turn based fun.Yes ""fun"" is the best way to describe Warlock 2. I picked it up cheap on sale, and it was easy to learn, relaxing to play and very accessible for quick 10 minutes sessions over coffee in the morning.It lacks the polish of Endless Legend, but it makes up for it in its simplicity and surprising variety. And it doesn't take itself too seriously either.I haven't had any major glitches or crashes, although I hear other have. The editor works a treat too.8.5/10 "

												If you enjoyed the first warlock then this game is more of the same with improvements here and there, most are overlooked however by the new voices you can choose for your advisor (dam the guy from the first one was awful)New units, new factions, new story... the DLC however feels like a huge let down :( the packs are pretty much the same as the ones from the first game and if you purchased them you feel less inclind to buy similar content for this one.

												This is an excellent remake of the original Warlock game. If you are fan of the first or just a fan of Civilization style games, this game is for you. Think Civilisation with magic and monsters. Virtually every part of the game has been tweeked to be just a bit better than the original. Exactly what a sequel is supposed to be. I saw a previous review mention micro-trasactions. The in game store has one item in it so far, and its a free mod for alternate voice overs. It's likely the in game store will be for upcoming DLC's. There are NO microtransactions that i can see.I haven't messed with the built in Mod creator yet, when i do i'll update my review and let you know what I think.So far i'd say the game is a 9 out of 10. fun and entertaining. easy to get into.

												Certainly one of the most underrated 4X games on Steam and a lot deeper than it might appear at first. One of the rare 'easy to learn but hard to master' types of games. Especially the building system where you have to decide what you build instead of just building everything *cough*Civ*cough* stands out. You have to specialize cities since you can't have everything in just one mega city. Special map resources often allow different buildings to build upon forcing you to make a decision what is more important to you. Economy seems simple at first until you suddenly go banrupt because you were underestimating the upkeep costs of certain buildings and units.This would be one of the best mulitplayer 4X games if it would support simultaneous turns, but unfortunately it does not *sigh*. Research and diplomacy is also a bit lacking, but otherwise it's a very good game which also doesn't take as long as Civ and is also more fast paced. It's a shame that these days every hex-based 4X game is suppressed by the Civ franchise.Renaissance mod is also a great mod for it, adding several races, heroes and lots of other stuff.			"

												It's like Civ with a fantasy theme and more of a focus on combat e.g. you're leader can cast spells down on the field. Building and resource gathering is very streamlined compared to other strategy games. The theme, visuals and gameplay are good all around, very lean yet still deep enough. The ai is weak. There are some minor quirks to this fledgling title, like the counterspell system,  or undead being able to go into negative food with no ill effects but they give you a mod editor so you can change things around to you're liking.Overall, it's an easy recommendation, tops my list of favorites and still feels fresh after many hours of play.

												Paradox took Warlock: Masters of the Arcane, slapped a novelty glasses-and-mustache disguise on it, and called it Warlock 2.Warlock 2 is essentially Warlock 1, and, in my opinion, definitely not worth the launch price.  There's minor differences here and there, but unless you squint really hard, it's still the same game.  The units are the same, the spells are the same, the voice clips are the same, the soundtrack is the same, and even the ridiculous AI is the same.  The biggest feature to the new game, the world shard system, has been more annoying than anything.  It's such a chore getting your units from shard to shard, and it takes 'forever' to do so when you have a large army, because you're constantly bottle-necking at the portals.  I can only see it getting worse and worse as I'm forced to travel to more and more shards.I really like Warlock, and Warlock 2 is fun (because it's the same thing, essentially), but I don't recommend paying the full price for it.  If you can skip it, wait for this game to go on sale.  It'll be a steep discount.			"

												I've tried several times to get into this.  Sadly I just don't think its going to happen.  The main reason being that although looking and feeling a lot like Civ V is generally a good thing, the emphasis on the combat side of things just isn't.  Its always been the most tedious aspect of Civ for me and not where its charms lie.  So you're left with war(lock)mongering to victory against a bunch of randomly spawning mobs and if i'm going to do that, then i'd just rather play Civ which is just a much deeper game.   It doesn't help that there doesn't seem to be much community around the game either.  r/warlock is just dead.  Still if Civ style hex-based combat  is your thing or you just really wanted Civilization : Fantasy Tropes edition, then you might well enjoy it a lot more.  Me not so much.			"

												**If you enjoy Civ V or the HOMM series then this game is a bargain bin must buy!**The world map and battle system play like Civilization V except you have hero units and spells you can cast to assist your units, towns, and even morph your landscape.  The hero leveling system takes a large part of its functionality from the original Heros of Might and Magic series (Pre V and VI) were you get a random roll of abilities, these abilities then stack and you get unique heros.  This game isn't for everyone its quite slow paced and the mulitplayer is a completely different beast from the single player.  Meaning multiplayer is more intense but still turned based it takes anywere from 1-6 hours to complete on average for me.  Over all the further you get into this game the more you will come to appreciate the depth of the game as i have read in other review and as i will put in mine the more enjoyable the game becomes!  Oh and i almost forgot the game has a sort of quest generation system that seems to be random at points similar to FTL and other story games quest for things like resources, artifacts, and even spells.  Hope you enjoy			"

												This is a peculiar title, in that I enjoy it quite a bit, but would have a hard time recommending it to someone who played the original Warlock.  The game has traditional 4x gameplay in a fantasy setting, with hex-based territory management and some interesting spins on the world map and city management.  There are even some very nice quality-of-life features, like the building progression map or the spell book.  These features are all very competantently implemented; the problem is that the previous game did these exact same things as well.  In terms of game rules and over graphics, the game is essentially the same, aside from a new game mode entitled Exiled mode, which puts a new spin on the classic Campaign paradigm used in such games.  However, aside from all that, I dont think there is enough here to justify someone who owned the original to upgrade to the sequel.  I enjoy this game a great deal, and if this is your first foray into the Warlock series, do buy it, as its a fantastic title, I just dont know if returning Warlock players would be justified in spending $30 price tag for a game that is essentially a DLC updated version of the original.

												I have 460 hours of play into Warlock I and was very excited about this release. I even beat Armageddon mode in the original.However after just a few minutes I'm sitting here shaking my head asking myself ""What did they do?"" Very disappointed. I wish I could get a refund.Feedback:-Looks like the same game with a worse UI-I don't like the dialogue boxes or the font of the text in them. Its hard to read.-I don't like the new spell research tree.-The graphics are sharper but somehow don't look as cool as the old graphics.-I don't like the town graphics. And when the town is selected it covers all the buildings with dumb little circular icons. Why was this necessary? You can't already tell what the buildings are by looking at them? -They made the sand on the desert tiles so bright it whites out. Feels like its hurting your eyes and you cant see the map.-I found myself having to repeatedly re-open the collapsing news item menu each turn.When you press the turn button you loose the ability now to scroll around and zoom in and out while stuff is happening. You can't move the UI at all. (Seriously??)-My favorite Anubis Great Mage character seems to be gone. This is the guy I played every game... Why was he removed?In my opinion, dont bother. This one is a miss. Hopefully Warlock 3 will be better.			"

												The problem with Warlock 2 is not that it's a bad game; rather, it doesn't add enough to justify the 'sequel' tag and $30 price point.  Exiled mode is merely a focused string of 'pocket dimensions' (that already existed in the first game) in a campaign format -- no more innovation than the Armageddon mode for Warlock 1.  The other improvements and additions are arguably ones that should have been included in a patch or, at most, a $10 DLC.  Unrest is the only truly new mechanic and its implementation is primarily intended to cap the number of cities you can build.  This ultimately has little bearing on the game as you can win on even the hardest difficulty with a few lords and a couple of complimentary units.The Great Mage edition for $50 is particularly laughable as it merely adds a few lords I've never even seen in 30+ hours of play, a few spells I've never bothered to cast, and a dragon mage hero that doubles as a capital -- the latter being the only one I'd recommend buying separately for a couple of bucks.  The other extras are a bunch of out-of-game materials most people won't listen to/read.Edited: And now in the recent patch they've added an in-game store selling things like the privilege of starting on a certain plane/shard for $3.  Warlock 1's Armageddon DLC cost the same and added a new mode.  The Elf DLC added a new race for the same price.  Paradox is definitely on the decline with all these cash grabs.			"

I enjoy the upgrading of the units and managing your cities and where to place defensive and worshiping cities. The best way to describe the game is like this .. Civ 5 and Civ BE both have a kind of cool cinical feel., Warlock 2 is more rustic it has charm and most of all it is fun. That is why I love games so much to be entertaining and fun :)The original is good also but to all those who say its not better, well who said a sequel had to be better?

If you don't have Part 1 get this one, if you do, then you don't really need to buy the almost same game again.Also comes with hefty overpriced in-game shop that sells mostly pay2win stuff that should have been unlocked in the game anyway, all day-1-mikro-DLC-crap at 2 (TWO) CREDITS each, for things like: 1 more player character or 1 more hero character.

												Game is fun but has a lot of fricken issues. All bugs that were in Warlock 1 are still present here. Nothing was fixed, not even with the Nagas DLC. The game will occasionally crash while trying to exit or play. Sometimes the mods work and sometimes they don't and will crash the game.There are pop-up menus on top of pop-up menus on top of popup menus. WTF!I often found myself moving the wrong unit to the wrong spot. When the game goes to next unit available, it'll center on a unit but it's not the unit selected, this happens often, so you have to make sure it's the unit that you're giving orders to (or leveling). Also you have to reissue all your orders if a unit moves onto a spot where other units have assigned orders to move to, over and over and over. The game will also at turn's end, ask orders for movement from units that have no movement left, unless they're on sentry.In campaign mode, I've lost lots of hours because of poor world seeding. Example: the second world I go to, the gate is on an sky island and I have no flying units, so therefore I can't explore it or settle it. At this point I just have to start a new game since I can't progress any further and hitting enter until I research any kind of flying spell is completely idiotic.I also find it annoying that I can't reorganize my spell book the way I want it, so my most used spells are at the front, instead you're left with constantly flipping pages to find the spell you need, since spells are auto sorted by alpha order (always defaulted). You can sort them by mana cost or time, but the next time you go cast a spell, it's back to alpha order. I've also noticed that sometimes a spell will disappear and then next turn reappear in your spell book. ""Oh! you wanted to heal that unit, too bad, the healing spell is not there this turn"" WTF! Sometimes you click on a spot to move or attack, and nothing happens. So you have to click over and cver until the unit does what you want it to do.This game is fun but it friggen♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off due to all the BUGS the devs never bothered to fix.I found thru experimentation that certain mods will crash your game to desktop with an error, if you even get an error that is. Any mod that changes mage improvements, shrines, temples or adds spells that are not normally found in the game will crash it. Which is stupid, since the editor allows you to change these.Some spells simply don't work. Like meta-teleport, you're supposed to be able to teleport your units between worlds, but you can only teleport them on the same world. Or Clean Lands, it doesn't work half the time on the Dremer world, but it sure uses the mana.Seems to me the Naga expansion wasn't really well thought out, just sorta thrown in for a cash grab. No monster lairs spawn in the water. Every Naga city you make creates water spaces around that city. The AI players don't quite know how to handle this. They never research terramorphing spells. So they send out their units in ships to be easily sunk.After a lot of playing, I come to find out the AI is a very terrible opponent. I just always declare war on them.If you change the game to unlimited cities, the AI does not follow this rule and will only create 3 - 5 cities. So it comes down to your 20+ cities vs their 3 cities. I'm also finding that unhappiness doesn't do anything. I've had max unhappiness and it didn't affect me one bit.I like the game and I like playing it. But it's so easy to get frustrated from all the bugs in it. I really wish I could give this game a neutral review.If you liked Master of Magic, you might like this game (same game pretty much, different graphics), but watch out for the barrage of constant bugs from a game that's been abandoned will never be fixed.I heavily debated what rating to give it.  It has good and bad point. But I like it, so i guess the good outweight the bad.			"

Exile mode is the big thing compared to Warlock 1, but it's just all about getting 3-4 heroes and maybe some high tier units, and buffing them with everything. The Exile mode maps are tiny, and the map generator sucks big time. There seems to be no way to actually lose in Exile mode either.On the positive side, patches/mods may fix this.

												Just like the original:This is a really fun 4X game that feels a bit like the Heroes of Might and Magic games with exploring of different planes, dungeons and worlds, as well as magic and spells being thrown around and researched.Instead of nukes and missiles you got fireballs and world changing spells/events. But it have more of mostly everything.			"

												This is a fun game to a shortened extend. At first it seems really neat to play a civilization styled game with fantasy elements such as having hero units with great power, gearing them with artifact gear, and even casting spells as a great mage. However, as a game progresses there are a few definite faults. The most prominent of such is having an ""optimum city limit"". A mage can start out with a max of 5 cities (7 with perk) to be able to occupy and retain good benefits. Unfortunately as the game progresses many cities are captured and not nearly as productive. In one of my games i have about 22 cities and only 8 or so optimal max. Now a solution could be just to raze everything and then use a settler to place a stronghold on said area for defense against ever occuring moster spawns, it is at the same time somewhat redundant since in order to defend against these attacks, one needs troops. The other main annoyance is having only 6 available opponents. I always play in the biggest setting possible, so when i chose a huge game universe and could only face 6 other mages i was dissapointed. Part of what makes these games fun is forming alliances in order to conquer enemies, but I was able to obliterate my opponents before even making contact with the others. In summation i would say its worth maybe 20$ and as for the great mage pack, the contents arent nearly as neat as it may sound. Considering that 3 of the 7 perks are lords that can be hired in the beggining, but fairly soon through playing the game you cant either use the call of suzerain or just find better lords to hire. Well if you could have more then 4 lords total at once it would be better i suppose, but, you cant.			"

												As a big fan of Warlock: Masters of the Arcane, I was hoping for some more of the same with variation on a theme.  However I didn't get that far.  The game is listed as Linux compatible, which is only barely true. Withing three hours I met 2 gamestopping bugs.The first was a game crashing on every load as the quest dialouges renewed.  So I ditched that save and opted into the beta hoping for a better experience, Nope, the world-portal of everlasting troll got in my way, no matter how many times I killed to troll the quest failed and another troll would take it's place.  Other misc quests also failed to work.I know linux is a second-class OS in the gaming world, but I expect games to at least be playable BEFORE being listed as compatible.  "

												Really fun and polished 4X game with tons of spells and great unit and faction variety. Ino-Co were making tactical hex games way before Civ V adopted the model. I recommend playing on a regular map rather than ""The Exiled"" game mode.Once you master the base game, check out the mods!			"

												While the new game features, art, races and concepts are a great improvement to Warlock 1, the game engine is as buggy and as laggy as before:AI takes 5+ minutes to calculate a turnCrashes to desktop at certain turns that make it impossible to continue to next turn (only fixable if you go like 20 turns back).This is pretty much game breaking for me and as it stands right now, I do not recommend the game and I will not buy warlock 3, if it ever comes out. I'm greatly disappointed.			"

												I am a huge fan of the first Warlock and I am LOVING the sequel.  Paradox has pulled out all the stops in The Exiled.   If you like 4X turn based strategy games then I highly recommend you check out Warlock 2: the Exiled.   There are a few people that are upset about the pricing of the Lord and Great Mage editions but there is nothing game breaking that you will miss out on if you can only afford the standard edition.  That said personally I love Paradox and I love the Warlock series and was more than happy to support them by purchasing the Great Mage edition.   For those concerned the Developers have already said that there isn't anything in the Great Mage edition that is going to over power those who play multiplayer with the standard.  This is a concern in the Steam forums but there is no reason to be upset.  If you have the money and want to support Paradox go with the Great Mage edition, however if you don't have the money but want the game pick up the standard and you will still have all the great game play.  The game runs super smooth and I haven't ran into any bugs or real balance issues yet.  One other thing that might keep some people from picking up the game is the timing with AoW3 coming out.  I say get both of them if you can.   Both are very different games from each other but are bound to be classic turn based games.			"

												Do not buy this game!On paper this is pretty much Warlock 1 with a few additions which mostly amounts to 2 extra races (which feel samey), a few extra spells (along with a new research system), as well as a new playing mode where you start of in other planes of existance. In fact those are where the game shines the most as the plane to plane gameplay is actually quite interesting and some of the random events really shake up the gameplay and can make even raising your army interesting as the conditions of the universe change on you.The issue though is that all the problems with the first game rather persist. The game has the same glitches including a crash bug that still goes unfixed from Warlock 1, the same imbalances, an unbalanced mage creation system, poor braindead AI, Overpowered heros, useless ordinary units (with exceptions).Then there are the problems unique to this game. The planes never feel fully fleshed out with their own resources, the races barely take advantage of the planes, the quest system will constantly bar you from progress and ask you to either defeat an excessively tough enemy that can span you hundreds of turns to defeat or require you to pony up resources obscene to collect. Then there are some planes that are neigh on impossible to explore. As well while the events are quite interesting a lot of them only serve to harass you, don't be surprised if the game just decides a volcano would look rather nice next to your capital.Finally these features don't mesh well with eachother, for example the mage creation system doesn't take into account the new research tree.Ultimately this is a stand alone expansion of Warlock 1. Which would be fine but they just didn't care to put the time and attention that this game needed to shine. It needed to be balanced better, with more features to fill out those planes, A good AI, As well as an overhaul to the random events and quests. In spite of all the effort they clearly put into this game, it still somehow feels like a cheap cash in.			"

												In general, I think it is a good game with great over-arching strategic decisions and gameplay.  The AI could certainly do with some improvements, but they're somewhat tough at high difficulty.  However, as a player of the original Warlock, I can't help but notice that this is almost the same game with a new campaign, a couple of new races, and some stragegy tweaks.  Would be better suited to be called a standalone expansion rather than a sequel.  So it is up to you if you think the price is worth it,The good:- Plenty of room for strategic mastery.  An example is: which cities to have included in the main cities (the one with the gold and iron resources, or the one with 2 pigs and a donkey? Or do I just keep both and just deal with the riots that arise?)- Somewhat interesting storyline with some good challenges that hit you throughout the campaign- ""Just one more turn..."" addictiveness that I haven't seen since Civ 3.  You always seem to be on the brink of achieving something.The bad:- Looooong drawn out campaign.  By the time I had reached Ardania, I was already sick and tired of the grinding.  And that was only on Medium size.  It needs a bit more depth to keep things interesting.- Predictable AI.  Oh, you're amassing your troops near my city?  You must be declaring war in 3 turns.The other:- ""Campaign"" option in the menu (currently empty, but being pre-sale I can't complain, but I'm hopeful this will give some good replayability to the game)- Spawns, spawns, and more spawns.  Just when you think you're done with those giants, the game decides to spawn 2 red dragon nests on the other side of the map so you basically lose the city before your troops can cross.  Good income, but very tedious after a while.  Also - why do so damn many of the spawns fly?  My patrolling army was made up entirely of archers/wizards since the soldiers were just completely useless.			"

												This game is probably good. The 15 minutes I played were good anyway. Then the game crashed and every time I tried to load it again, it crashed, no matter what my settings were. So I started a new game. and played another 15 minutes. And it crashed. Every time I loaded that save it crashed. After scrolling through the forums for 10 seconds I realized many others reported this issue a year ago and no one bothered fixing it. The devs apparently released broken crap, dumped some dlc on us, and dropped support. To be fair, this is an issue with the Linux port (many Mac users report the same bug as well). Maybe on Windows everything is better? I never really got to see the game, so I can't tell you how the gameplay or balance is, but based on the quality of the Linux/Mac port, I would venture to guess that the devs cut more than just a few corners with the Windows version too.The 6 hours I 'played' was just idling the game so I could at least get my cards. Shame to see a game with such a great first 15 minutes fail so hard.			"

												Not terribly impressed with this title.Plays like civ with magic. I was hoping to get a tast of old-school Master of Mgic, and this was a temporary fix. It's different enough from Civ to be fun and refreshing, but the game mechanics made it tedious in mid to late game.Pros:- Challenging - The wrong move could easily cost you a veteran hero. You learn to wander off into new worlds only with expendible troops, etc. You will lose troops. You will lose cities. The rise and fall is exciting.- Different - Tile types and heros were different - you can build mana farms instead of farms. Perks provided by certain improvements were really interesting and fun.- Variety - The tech trees for different civilizations were well-thought out and different enough to force you into a different strategy for each.Cons:- Very few options with excess mana. Can't increase your casting power, so you just accumulate excess mana if your economy is mana-focused. It's frustrating.- Excess food means NOTHING. You have a minimum food for population and troops eat (a little) food, but towns increase in size at a fixed rate, so unless your people are starving, there's no benefit to extra food. Yes, excess is converted to cash, but if I needed cash, I'd build cash buildings.- The economy revolves around money. There's a cap on how much mana you can realistically spend, and excess food is converted to cash, so you quickly learn that building cash is the only really valuable resource. This removes a lot of strategy and the benefits of any variety in the different races.- Random events are devasating and often change the landscape, affecting the bonuses of carefully placed town improvements. They sometimes take out town population, which might have taken 30 turns to increase by 1 (at a fixed rate), leaving your economy in shambles with no way to recover for another 30+ turns: enough to cost you the game.This game seemed promising, but in the end was just annoying. This game is being uninstalled.			"

												There are some serious balancing issues with this game. Most maps are nothing but bottleneck tactics. Terrain changes faster than it can be used. Monsters that spawn have a stupidly high chance of being stronger than all players combined. I've had a ""Nightmare"" monster completely dominate an entire land to a point where I will be remaking the game AGAIN.The first warlock is way better but has some of the same issues, however this game is just bottle-neck nightmares. Stupidly imbalanced terrain, stupidly imbalanced monsters and quests that give good rewards but takes a single event to set you back 20 turns. I'm only playing on normal and me and all the bots are getting annihilated. It is unwise to even bother leaving the starting land because as soon as you do, your home is invaded by stupidly strong monsters that will kill all of your units if you leave them there.I'm glad I waited for this game to be on sale, because it's not worth buying in its current state. And here I was so looking forward to this game... I'm not asking for the devs to nerf across the board, but to please god nerf the mega-monsters!!!			"

												My favorite 4X.  I like that the different campaigns are very different.  You can play a conquer your neighbors game like any other, on either a series of worlds or on a large world with the other worlds attached as possible, though not necessary places to explore; or you can compete to be the first to finish a series of increasingly difficult quests in what maybe shouldn't be the default game mode;  or if you have the expansion you can play against a single strong opponent who appears in the middle of your civilization, nagas this time rather than dremers as in the first game.  I like that this final mode encourages you to work together with your opponents whether they are computer players or human players, and I like that computer allies really will help you.  This is something very lacking in really all the other 4X games, where it is just a fight for supremacy.The other thing that sets this game appart is the focus on tactical combat and exploration rather than civilization building or roleplaying (as in the Age of Wonders or HOMM series).  I like this. You start off right away with an army and your army grows just as much as you want it to, as you can build units at the same time as buildings in your cities.  (a bizarre restriction in the Civ games and in the Endless games)  There are so many different types of neutral units that hide great rewards in their spawn points.  Much of the early game is just plain survival, and it's a lot of fun.  It never seems like you've explored everything.  Even after 100s of hours that I've spent in both Warlock 1 and 2 combined.  In multiplayer turns are turn-based rather than simultaneous, but as everything happens on the main map, and you can watch your allies, things don't seem as boring as HOMM (which I would never play multiplayer).I really am liking Endless Space and Endless Legend as well, those really have a lot to discover, but this has a pick up and play quality and a, I must play just a few more turns, quality that keeps me playing this even when those are available.  I suppose I would play those when I want something more serious, and this when I want something fun, while the old standards of Civ and HOMM are really starting to feel more OLD than standard in their current iterations.

												This is one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played and I've played a lot. What I like about the game is that the action is immediate and continuous;  it constantly surprises you with it's depth and new features and because of the complex spell system it gives you a ridiculous number of strategic options during any given turn.The basic combat system is similar to Civilization,  but really more like Heroes of Might and Magic,  although it does not have separate explore modes to combat modes.Resources are critical in this game.  It is expensive to research and use spells and to hire heroes and combat units.  The number of towns you can build is normally limited so it's quality not quantity that's important.  Placing your town near critical rare resource items is a must.Similarly it is quality not quantity in your choice of units to recruit or build.  Experience upgrades, equipment upgrades and other perks are the key to victory.  Again that creates a lot of strategic use of your resources and upgrades.By contrast I find the more highly rated age of wonders 3 plodding and just plain boring. This game can be chaotic.  It keeps you on your edge.  Age of wonders 3 is about spamming units towns and sucking resources.  It's just flat, not sure why.It's just unfortunate that this game was not promoted very well.  The sales were too low and the series is now dead.  Paradox has abandoned it.			"

												It was on sale for $5, and it was $5 worth of entertainment.  It's not terribly different than the original (Warlock: Master of the Arcane), but they cleaned up some of the problems (namely the ability to minimize the random creature spawns which get annoying late game).  I don't think it has much replayability; since there's not much character customization to experiment with like in the old Master of Magic.  It can be a good strategic challenge early and mid game, but starting positions and spawns are too random.  I had to quit and reload several times due to getting crushed within the first few turns.  One thing I hope they do in the next sequel is to have automated defenses (rechearchable?) late game to deal with wondering creatures that pose no real threat.  ..Or make them way less frequent and way more powerful.  BTW- if you get this game, you'll want to go into settings and max the animation speed!			"

But on discount it's great.Most of the problems of the first have been ironed out. The world shards (which I loved,but to be honest you had already won by the time you used one in the first game) now have real tactical purpose and value. There are different challenges at early, middle and late game.AI could still be improved, but so could the AI in Civ 5. If you don't own the first I would definitely buy this. If you do own the first I would buy this when it is discounted.			"

												I liked the original Warlock.  I  played it and had my fun until I got bored of it.Unfortuanlty this game should have been a cheap DLC for Warlock 1.  It really is the same game.  I tried playing it, but got bored of it very quickly.  I do not reccomend spending any money on this game.  It does have some improvements over the first game, but they are minor and not worth very much money, let alone even an on sale, asking price.  Perhaps if this game is on sale for $4.99 AND you are not bored of the original, then it might be worth that price.			"

												This is one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played and I've played a lot. What I like about the game is that the action is immediate and continuous;  it constantly surprises you with it's depth and new features and because of the complex spell system it gives you a ridiculous number of strategic options during any given turn.The basic combat system is similar to Civilization,  but really more like Heroes of Might and Magic,  although it does not have separate explore modes to combat modes.Resources are critical in this game.  It is expensive to research and use spells and to hire heroes and combat units.  The number of towns you can build is normally limited so it's quality not quantity that's important.  Placing your town near critical rare resource items is a must.Similarly it is quality not quantity in your choice of units to recruit or build.  Experience upgrades, equipment upgrades and other perks are the key to victory.  Again that creates a lot of strategic use of your resources and upgrades.By contrast I find the more highly rated age of wonders 3 plodding and just plain boring. This game can be chaotic.  It keeps you on your edge.  Age of wonders 3 is about spamming units towns and sucking resources.  It's just flat, not sure why.It's just unfortunate that this game was not promoted very well.  The sales were too low and the series is now dead.  Paradox has abandoned it.			"

												A lot like the first but not awful.As somebody who played the first game I was quite put off by this title. A few weeks ago, I managed to pick it up for $3.50 and, at that price it was absolutely worth it. Much of the DLC doesn't really impact the game, and none of it is worth picking up even on sale (no, not even nagas... especially not nagas,) except for possibly the book if that is what you are into. Anyway, this game really felt like Warlock 1 DLC, especially since all of the problems from Warlock 1 are present in this game. The god system works the same and yes, it still needs a complete rewrite. The game is just as easy, monster camp spawns are still a bigger threat than other civs (though not as much), and you can still accidentally accumulate 100,000 mana, but at least now you have something to spend it on. Also you still have to manage units every round, and watch your allies do the same. And the population system still provides 0 depth.They also added modding support, but it is almost ruined by the complete lack of ability to mod in resources or tiles. And, on that note, why all of the DLC is worthless its because said DLC are just a bunch of mods that don't add any resources or tiles because they can't. ""So this problem ruins DLC, but does it affect mods too?"" I hear you asking. Well of course it does. For example some poor soul made a Dremor mod and put a fair bit of work into it before realizing that they had no way of causing the corrupted tiles that the dremor spawn to do anything but reduce all resource outputs by 50%. This, of course, means that playing the mod the way the designer probably intended in their head would lead to you being at a huge disadvantage from half resources. This is just one example of how this affects mods.But the shards gimmick and better AI and at least some modding support and such make this a tentative recommendation at a very low price because, in summery, it is stand alone DLC for Warlock 1 that is fairly decent. The DLC inside this DLC is terrible but the DLC itself is worthwhile on sale. Don't even consider picking up at full price, though.			"

												Civilization with Fantasy or HoM&M with a grid, however you prefer. Really not much more to say, pretty good game.Most reviews are not recommended but only because it felt more like an update compared to the first one, if you don't and like Fantasy or Strategy games, do yourself a favour and grab it, specially on sales. Personally, while loving strategy games and RTS as a genre, I never grabbed Civilization or ""heavy strategy"" (except HoM&M) because they felt too dense or complex to even start and would rather get invested in ""easier to pick-up"" or less time consuming strategy games, however this one in particular was pretty atractive, tutorial is just right and while UI is not perfect it's intuitive enough so you can start having fun really quick after starting.Game is fun, graphics are nice, plot is pretty good for these kinds of games, sound has nothing to complain about, variety is over enough and there's even workshop.... To be honest  I feel this deserves far more than a ""mixed"" rating.A warning: It consumes more resources than it looks like, also options (mainly graphic options) are pretty limited (haven't been able to find windowed mode yet), so that's a downside.I'll admit I have played pretty little for these kinds of games but will update. 8.5/10. Nothing far too original or groundbreaking and options limitations are inconvenient (to say the least), not game year or similar, but it's still pretty solid and most of all, entertaining. Worth giving a try.			"

												I have always wanted to find a game similar to the Master of Magic series from when I was a kid.  This game comes mighty close without the tactical scenarios.  I have played it several times only to get to the 2nd or 3rd shard of land.  It provides a lot of difficulty quickly with a little quirkiness.  To be fair, it does seem like a replica of the previous iteration with slightly better graphics and a new theme.  However, I must say that I do enjoy this game considerably if not for the ability to play for short periods of time and come back only to play it again.  Bottom line:  It needs more customization and roguelike randomness but it gets the job done.			"

												I have played a bit so far and I have to say Warlock II is really entertaining! I like the quick pase combat as compared to the long tactical battles. The spell count is great, lots of good spells to make use of in the game. Another great feature is the random map generator, it is a must have in these kinds of games. The graphics are perfect for the setting. There seems to be a great variety of units with their own unique qualities. You can customize your wizard with a variety of different perks to help during the game. Units and heroes level up and gain perks. One of the most important factors about the game is that it will be moddable! I haven't had the chance to play Warlock Master of the Arcane but I would definitely recommend Warlock II! Great stuff 9/10!			"

												First I thought it is just another Master of the Broken World...but with Warlock background. The graphics is ok, but not state of the art. While starting to play it showed up more interesting. Not much unlike in Civilization you build up your empire by cities anyhow it's more cutted off the micromanagement. You could clearly concentrate on building up your army out of different races-buildtree. Besides you are a Wizard and could research spells to upgrade your economy, power or arms. All in all it shows up with kind of long-term-motivation to do one-more-turn. Those splitted grounds offer different enviroments and options for different settlement. Game is focused on warfare and tactical combat, but you could reach your goals by (limited) diplomacy too. Only thing I do not like is, the current Overlord is spreading spells to ruin landscapes so the more power you gain, the more often your cities are harmed by and there is no way to intercept this, except to kill the Overlord in endgame. Yeah, you could repair landscape with your own spells...but it shouldn't be the main duty every other turn in my eyes. If you could find game on sale...grab it, as it is a nice alternative roundbased fantasy game.			"

												Warlock 2 is a confused 4x game which has broken the playfield up into a series of small maps connected via portals which you must cross to defeat the final opponent.  Nearing the portals with a unit triggers random events for activating the portal and other allies of the end boss will create random events of their own to trip you up.Resource management is very strict.  It may be difficult at first to balance your cities so that they are able to grow and remain happy.  The number of cities you are able to control at a time is also kept very low (5-11 as the game progresses).  Although this can be changed with an option in the game settings it is marked 'Not Recommended'.  Developing advanced units can also be challenging as each is produced by a specific building which has other buildings as a pre-requisite and each building must be placed within a limited area in which other structures for wealth and food must also exist.  This forces the player along rather narrow paths which greatly limit the viable choices that can be made.This is my main complaint about the game.  It feels too rigid.  The player is locked into a very limited set of choices while forced to face randomly appearing enemies and AI opponents which greatly outmatch you at every step.  This creates gameplay in which there is perhaps only one narrow path to victory and only by discovering that single formula can the player succeed.  This is in opposition to the general appeal of a 4x game which to me is that you can discover many paths to victory.			"

												I decided to finally boot this game up and give it a spin after buying it on sale earlier this year. The game concept is good enough for my tastes, tough I did not notice very huge differences from Warlock 1 - Master of the Arcane.However .... Tough I'd like to play it for a few hours and really get into the right mood this game prevents me from that. First time starting it up I experienced great graphic glitches. the menu was fine but in game you would notice the graphic not beeing stable. Apparently the game had set high or highest as default graphics so I tried tuning it down, but the only thing that happened was worse graphics, same glitches. Someone suggested turning of Anti-Aliasing so I quit the game as it had to be done at the menu, and suddenly the entire menu graphics glitched. Got out of the game by remembering the button position. Still didn't give up ....After setting all the graphic settings to low\medium the glitches seemed to have left ... however now I started experiencing what others seem to have been complaining about ... game crashes.It could have been a nice game for some time, but honestly ... if the game doesn't work, it's not worth it.Buy it, try it, and get your money back from steam if you're experiencing any issues at all. And don't wait to try it after buying it. It will probably land you in a bad place. If your unsure, just stay away and try something else.			"

It seems that the main difference between the original and the sequel is that the former works, while the latter does NOT. Crash, crash, crashes and crashes. Searched throught forums and the only common feeling is that the developers just abandoned it. Tried 4 maps with different settings, and the outcome is always the same: some quests do not complete (when you perform it's requirements). Once you click them the game crashes. If you try to load the game, all ""open"" quests pop up, and then again the game crashes. You can't load any games because you'll always have a crashed quest.

												Fun game. Essentially Warlock 2 is Civilization V with a fantasy twist, and the twist makes all the difference. Never enjoyed Civ 5, but I am liking Warlock a lot. Warlock 2 does a great job at making you feel like a badass mage, packing some powerful spells like the ability to warp the landscape and erect a volcano, or call in a lightning storm, and grant your troops the ability of flight. There's also a fun quest system, and NPC mages that will harass you until you complete certain quests.If you never played the first one, then this is a great game to pick up. Most of the negative reviews come from people who felt Warlock 2 didn't add enough to Warlock 1 to justify the ""2,"" but it's nevertheless a good game.Contrasting to AoW3, then I find that AoW3 does everything better than Warlock. More customization, more detailed battles, more maps, two length single player campaigns (Warlock has none), and a better selection of avatars. However, you might still prefer Warlock over AoW because Warlock is more streamlined for quicker turns and games. It's probably, therefore, a better choice for multiplayer, unless you want long drawn out games amongst close friends with AoW3. All in all, if you're an impatient player, you might prefer Warlock, but either way you can't go wrong.			"

Gameplay is terrible and there are now city statistics which are impossible to correct.  I'm a die-hard fan of the original with 1140 hours played. Now with Warlock 2 have played 3 campaigns with a total of 41 hours.  Because I love the original I kept giving Warlock 2 a chance, thinking it would somehow get better with different races and\or perks.  I was wrong!  Its fairly cheap to purchase now even with the expansios so you can try it for yourself.My suggestions is to continue playing the original Warlock Master of the Arcane, this is a poor excuse for a sequel.

There are a few user interface bugs that are annoying, but I'm willing to work around those in order to play the game. The graphics are very colorful and detailed, the sounds are nice too. The game can be humerous at times. For instance, there is a moment in the game where a bridge is blocked bya  troll that wants you to answer three questions before letting you pass. Those familiar with Monte Python's Holy Grail will know the correct answers immediately. Speaking of the tutorial, it is a bit scant on important information, but not too terrible. It did kind of feel like I was thrown into the deep end without lots of training though. I'm looking forward to spending many hours exploring this fun game			"

												Great game but far from perfect. The AI is still terribly weak after all these years. Graphics and sound effects are almost entirely unchanged from first game. Just a few new music additions. New races are not all that exciting. New game mode is not that exciting and more suitable for multiplayer.That said the new city system greatly reduces micro management and lets you focus on the action. The new research system is far less annoying as you can now plan your strategies rather than having to deal with randomness.So if youre looking for a more refined version of Warlock 1, this is it. If youre looking for something substantially new, this is not it.			"

												I liked the Warlock 1 and this game is a worthy continuation.It improves balance; makes game play more complex, and with all DLCs gives a lot of interesting game modes.I recommend it as a best contender for modern remake of Master of Magic, without flaws of the original.The elegant design beats my other favourites - Endless Legend, while preserving magic-centred mechanics that makes it interesting each time I play.Let's hope that Warlock 3 will have even more interesting quests, and improved AI, even though current AI is already challenging to beat on even footing.

												I haven't had any of the bugs other reviews mentioned. The UI seems fine to me. Supposedly the developers are unhelpful but I've never had any reason to need them. Good support for mods. It's not perfect, mind you, but then it's not $60 either. It's very fun once you get the right mindset; this isn't a vast Civ-type game, it's much smaller scale. You have 5-10 cities, ~5 powerful units that you fawn over, and ~5 supporting units at any given time. It's almost closer to a party-based RPG.Note: I have not played Warlock 1.			"

												Fun game good upgrade from 1st , however the new play style exiled is dumb, you have to fester forever to get to final worlds , and have little to no chance of defeating the final ""bosses"" unless you have researched all spells and have every resource avalible to mod your units , to many ""spawns"" of enemies throughout your empire to clean up , you must strike right to heart of enemy and pray you built enough units to take them down or you fail and cannot repair your empire in a timely fashion. IMO this game mode is fail since you have no choice but to fester for hundreds of turns (my 2 tries were 200 and 400 turns respectively both failed ) first try i had 20 units in my main army all dead in 3-4 turns , second try was 50ish units about 10-12 turns until i realized i had failed to bring enough units. most of the units i used in both attempts were upgraded elite units , regular units could not even fight through to final zone. The sandbox version of game however is very fun and not nearly as frustrating , however it is just a more polished version of first game, and i did not see some of the resources found in exiled version ( only 2 games yet ) hope they are there to enjoy.  Also found many bugs in the game , like the fog of war is not always active , some games have it some don't. sometimes random units just disappear from game for no reason. when ressurecting units that had buffs from structures you can go negative on those counts as unit comes back with them on wwhen you could have placed on new unit. when paging through units you cannot center on unit , same for castles with enemy at gates , forcing you to manually search for correct castle to use the defenses. over all fun game but needs quite a bit of work to be worth the price			"

												Warlock 2 is basically the samge game Warlock 1 was. A very good fantasy CIV-like game. The other good one is Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes, but although the games cover same niche, they are drastically different from each other.In here most things are similiar to CIV5, besides maybe magic system. Also units level ups and upgrades seem more important here. Beyond that, it is all about building more and more towns, units and reasearch (which kind of limits the growth here, unlike Warlock 1).It is pleasing to expand using specialized cities, gain resources and improve your several units, but it is tedious even on medium maps and with just 2 enemies, when they start to spam units and towns on every possible hex of land. Despite being speed up, enemy turns take long (many weak units) and I decided on war with them even if they want to ally, just so I don't have to watch all their units move.The shard-like lands, which are connected with gates seem to contain the above problem a little bit (the idea of shards with teleporters itself is ripped of from Allods/Rage of Mages :P). This makes it easier to for the player to just block off the enemy waves and slowly rip them apart.The addition of (heavily overpriced?) Lords that you can recruit adds a bit to the game as well. Although the game is a definite improvement and it really plays nice, sometimes it just feels like a big (but not huge) DLC to the core game. Is it worth it? Depends:If you never played any Warlock games but like strategy games and fantasy settings: YES!If you loved Warlock 1 game and are in love with it: YES!If you tried Warlock 1 and did not like it too much: NO!(since it is mainly the same game)			"

												I am a big fan of Warlock: Master of the Arcane and I had great expectations for The Exiled. I can`t deny I am frustrated by some of the changes they made to this sequel. My biggest complaint goes to the addition of city unrest, which could be an attempt to add some more strategy depth by slowing down the conquest pace and forcing you to balance city specialization. You are now limited to a set number of cities until you research spells that increase the cap or transform conquered cities in Fortresses or Free Towns, which don`t add up to the limit, but also prevent you from constructing buildings and units. In my oppinion, this is a huge step back, for one of the features I liked most in Warlock was its total focus on war. No meddling with happiness or similar things. Conquer the nearest city and go on to the next. If I wanted a Civ-like game, I'd play Civ V.The graphics didn't change much, although you can perceive some minor improvements. There are new units, spells and a campaign mode that gives you  chance to play the game in a different scenario-based way.All in all, Warlock 2 is a good game, bringing you more of the same you love, but fans of the original might not like the change in pace. If you are new to the series and want a fast and furious game, focusing on battles with fantasy units and monsters, try Warlock: Master of the Arcane first. If you've played the first and is looking for the same gameplay experience, think again if you can cope with the lash on your warmongering appetite.			"

												An honest turn-based game offering a decent challenge and lots of research and exploration. Development worked on variation on terrain, army, magic and research, but none of them makes a real difference. Maybe less varitions on the same theme and a stronger AI would have made a better game. The worlds are so rich they had to add a city limity to keep balance against the AI. Combat becomes repetitive after a while.It is still a good enough experience, if you are not a fan of the first game. I own both and while the basic game is exactly the same, there are so many improvements and new things that calling it tome 2 was only logical.A solid 7/10.			"

												This is a good game, but it is sad how few things would have had to be changed in order to make it ACE.I like the game's clear focus on warfare. This is a streamlined, military themed game where conflict is inevitable. This makes it way faster to kick off than most 4X games. There are also interesting game modes apart from the standard sandbox. Conquering the planes is fun, their themes are well-implemented, and I like how you have to adapt to the challenges each type of world poses.The Renaissance mod gives a huge boost to the game, making it actually challenging and the AI difficult to tackle.This is all well and great, but I just can't get over the overall WACKYNESS of it. I mean I get it, let's make fun of the fantasy tropes everyone knows, ha-ha. But it's just too blatant, too intent on making itself a parody. I had the same problem with the Age of Wonders series transition from serious-style Tolkienesque high fantasy to ""oh-look-at-me-I-dare-make-fun-of-myself"" fantasy. Humour has its place but there is ""funny"" and there is ""too much"". If I play a 4X wargame, I want its atmosphere to be epic instead of watching Monty Python's blood rabbit fight donkey riding knights.But if you don't mind the wackyness of the style, this is a very good strategy game (when modded with Renaissance).

												Definitely a case of if you liked the first Warlock you will like this. Same but with a couple new races, land tiles and ways to play through the game. If however you are new to the series then its your typical hex-based strategy game with magic. You're a big lord  with an army and your job is beat up all the other big lords. Although in this game there is a mode where you are a big lord and instead of beating up the other big lords you join your forces and just a few worlds away is an utterly massive lord for you to beat up. You could also beat up all the big lords then the massive lord too if that's what you'd like. The game does have a few flaws though. The ai is a bit dumb and the world you start  out on a bit small. Also there is a limit to how many towns you can build before you start to run into problems. This presumably was introduced to counteract the always useful plan in the first game of building as many towns as possible very quickly and steamrolling the other side but the starting limit is 5 which is defintely too low if you don't get the spells to increase it. Thankfully you can turn towns you capture or build that aren't doing much for you into shrines to a god, forts or freetowns which don't count towards your town limit. All in all I found it a very enjoyable game to while away a few hours especially if you like to listen to podcasts while gaming but have run out of games. B+			"

The strategy involved with the spell tree's to get to the various tiers is absolutely fantastic. The attention to detail is spot on and the overall time the developers put into this game is truly evident. I just purchased it today because I'm a big strategy fan but I like it better then the recent Civilization games! Once this game goes completely live its going to be rock solid.

												If you like civilization. Then, you will like thins game. Perhaps more than civilization, perhaps less.Heck, with history. I want to form an army of flying werewolf's.Pros vs Civ:-Strong limitations on city force your cities to be truly diverse.-Setting is almost comical, yet does not seem to lack seriousness either.-The magic still gives players cool boon for researching, but doesn't destroy those who fall behind in technology.-AI that doesn't fight to the death. (the AI actually negotiates for survival)-Love art of floating island-Exiled mode is unique take on 4x.Cons vs Civ:-No historical flavor-Civ has more options. But, not necessarily more plausible options.-Players finally cities are not worth destroying in Warlock-Warlock uses unusually interface for giving orders to units.-Civs tech tree is much longer.While I never owned warlock 1, I know that not alot has changed between the two games. If you never played warlock 1 this is definitely worth it. If you own warlock 1, warlock 2 is not much of an upgrade. "

												Well, it is more of the same, a rather punishing strategy game of resources and small diplomatics.The game as such is nice, but at current state - I would suggest to hold off a bit for them to polish all the minor but plenty bugs! They riddle the game constantly with small menu pop-up hangups, the game doesn't close properly, wants to reset the colour of my desktop once it does close or just hangs itself.The game as I mentioned is a bit tough, even on normal it can be quite punishing with throwing a really tough opponant that constantly battles your first city - I had the ice queen outside my door taking me forever to get anywhere and noce I did all these weird effects happened without telling me what it weas or what it did. I lack information on what is going on - this is a step back since the first game.			"

												There are definitely still some balance problems and bugs in the pre-release, but the overall quality is good and I expect the final release to have entirely satisfactory quality.I played the original Warlock: Master of the Arcane for a decent number of hours but found that it didn't have a lot of replay staying power. The randomized worlds and larger assortment of things to encounter seem to be helping that a lot.While many games have tried (and mostly failed) to replace the classic Master of Magic, this is the first one I'm finding myself willing to recommend as credible along those lines.

												Quite simply ... the Editor that comes with this game is the only reason in my opinion to buy this game. Other than that it is essentially the same game as Warlock was with a few new frustrating features (like the city cap).  They added Unrest (of the population) into the game which was my least favorite thing about Civ 5 (Unhappiness) and I escaped to Warlock to get away from it only to have them add it into Warlock 2. So the only reason I play Warlock 2 now is because they released the editor and allowed us to shut down the city cap at least. I was still playing Warlock after buying WL 2 because I was so unhappy with city caps and unrest. They did add a few new resources to build on and a couple new races but this game w/o the editor would be a waste of money to be honest.			"

Multiplayer wasn't populated. End-game was becoming boring though. Now comps can't even spam units anymore. The city limit was supposed to be a balance but acts against veterans.Remains still a good ""one more turn"" for casual players.EDIT: Waaaait a second. i just lost in turn 118 to a Unity Spell on impossible vs 7 comps. this is getting interestiiing. I guess I let the comps get bored with too little aggression. I can't help observe that units are way more balanced and weak all arround.

In short: The game was abandoned and left in a poor state. It may work fine for some people, but for many, myself included, it's broken.First of all, the things I liked about the gameA simplified version of Civilizations. Not overly complicated but still fun.The combat takes place on the world map.A large variaty of attack, defense, buff, and debuff spells.Your units and heroes level up, become stronger, and gain new buffs.With the right hero, the right perks, upgrades, artifacts and buffs, you can make a really unstopable force.Simply put, if you like turn-based strategy games, you will like this one. It adds a few new things and does a few things differently.Now the important part, why this game is badThe game is no longer supported. Found a buy? Having problems? ...nobody is going to fix it.The game is unfinished. Exactly like the first game, it was left in a buggy and unoptimised state.If you are using Windows10, a Mac, or Linux, the game has an even higher chance of not working for you.Game freezes your PC or at least crashes if you are lucky.As much as I enjoyed the game, I did not enjoy having t force-shutdown my new and very expensive gamer PC because of some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game that kept freezing my system. At least half of the time the game was only crashing, which I can live with, but it got to a point where it would keep crashing and I could no longer continue my game.Don't make the mistake I made and hope that this game might work better for you than it did for everybody else.

The only one the items you make for your hero's is VERY limited. While there is no true limit to the spells, factions, units and leaders you can conjure in your mind. The Weapons for the heros you recurit is Severly lacking when compared to rest of the game.  Example I made a unit Balrog which was death moving and couldnt make better than a mildly magic sword.The only thing about this game i would change is the gear/items for heros. Fix that and this game is perfect.			"

												Warlock 2 has everything you loved about the first Warlock. Literally. It's like they took the first game and added a few new factions, monsters, resources etc. There are even some mistakes in the first game that make it to the new one (it still bugs me that Court Werewolves' acid explosion does Elemental Damage when the decription says Spirit Damage). So really, this game feels like a hefty expansion pack rather than a whole new title.The new races are neat, but I feel that they don't ""fit"" as well as the old triumverate of Human, Monster, Undead. Svarts seem like humans with a higher-tech focus; really, I don't know why they didn't go with dwarves instead, since they seem just like the classic representation. Some aspects of the Svart tech tree seem distinctly out of place for a fantasy game, such as the hovering pods with what I swear are laser rifles. Planeswalkers have a nifty mix of unit origins and thus a lot of options, but seem to suffer more than they benefit from their diversity; They lack second-tier healers and their magic casters are pretty weak. They have an excellent selection of Elite units from Temples, but those are obviously very challenging to get with a sub-standard army. The Alrethi elves just seem to do everything better than the other races. Ostensibly this is offset by their more costly units, but it feels a bit unbalanced to me.If you were hoping for new units and buildings for the old races, you're out of luck. The new races are it. And any new buildings come from new resources.HOWEVER, one of the most absurd and annoying changes from the first game involves resources and unit perks. Units no longer automatically gain applicable perks from the cities where they're built (such as drilled, fine armor, etc). This is a poor change, as it eliminates some degree of planning if you're not trying to cram as many upgrade buildings as possible around your unit-producing cities. What's absurd, however, is that the uses of these perks are now limited in number; five is the most common, but some resources offer even fewer. While this arguably makes sense in the case of physical resources like iron or adamantium, why the blazes should a barracks only be able to give five units the ""drilled"" perk? Do they run out of instructors or something? And what are we supposed to do with a building after it's dispensed all its upgrades? Demolish it, I suppose. Anyway, the first thing I did with the Mod system included in the game is set all the resources much higher, but that was a distinctly irritating change to the gameplay.The other changes to the general gameplay would be the city limit and unrest meter. The unrest meter was never a problem for me; if it's not hard to manage, then it's not a problem. The city limit (and the prospect of ""Special Cities"") was intriguing, but after trying it out I turned it off for future games. I like my big armies, thanks, and you just can't do that with tightly limited upgrade resources and a handful of cities to make and support your units.			"

												I never played the original Warlock, so I can't make the comparison that many reviewers are making. As someone new to the franchise, I enjoyed this quite a bit. If you're in to 4X games, then this might be for you, though it doesn't come close to being the new Master of Magic that I've been longing for for 20 years.I see that the monster spawn rate is adjustable now, which is great. That was one of the things that bugged me at launch. The only other drawback I can think of is that the game feels a bit slow at times. If you think games like Civilization 5 are slow, then this is sloooooow. (I love Civ 5 btw)Anyway, all in all it's a thumbs up for me. Especially if you get it at a discount.			"

												This game is awesome. It's like Civ in many ways but there are drastic differences in that there's loads of races of creatures and spells that can drastically alter the game. If you like Civ, but wish it had more to do, you'll love Warlock 2!Pros over similar games (Such as Fallen Enchantress):- Great Multiplayer- Compelling modes (doesn't have to be kill all other players)- Huge variety of units- LORD units are very cool- Lots of cool spellsCons:- Shards, shard based game worlds are, to me, less immersive than contiguous ones. But the shards are at least cool and distinct.I see lots of reports of bugs, but in my experience there have not been any. YMMV			"

												Well It's Warlock 1 with some changes, it has more bugs and some really game-breaking bugs (mostly for people who plays on Mac and Linux versions).If you didn't play Warlock 1 then your missing a great 4X fantasy game (with one of the greatness DLCs I have ever seen, *wink* Dremers *wink*) and it's worth playing if you enjoy Civ 5 but you want something more then history. Warlock 2 seems to be in the middle when people talk about it as It's a great game but has massive flaws, I recommend you to grab the first game over this however if you like the first game alot (and you're not using a Mac or Linux) then you should grab this as well. If you're not sure then just wait for the sale, It's a great 4X game but it doesn't compare to the first game. Also the DLCs are mostly just extra (besides the Naga one), there is a great mod on the workshop called Renaissance Mod what needs the DLCs (this mod adds alot to the game and fixes couple of stuff).

												TL;DR:  warlock 2 is a great game, and IMO improves upon Warlock 1 and is worth the $30 price.i understand the criticism that this game seems more like an expansion than a sequel.  IMO, whichever side of the fence you are on.. its a subjective opinion... and honestly, if you feel that way, i totally get it.here's how i look at it though.. one:  you are paying the same price you would for most stand alone expansions.  for $30 you get the standard edition, and you get everything you need minus the bonus content, which is bonus content if you want it.  i dont consider anything in the Great Mage edition a must have.  thus, you are essentially getting the full game for $30.  the price seems pretty reasonable to me - even if we are saying this is just an expansion.two - Exiled Mode:first, its unique.  instead of one large map where you go out adventuring, collecting stuff, building your empire, conquering other civilizations,  all on a single plane..  you have a ton of smaller maps which you access by opening portals.. each with their own unique flavor to them, and you STILL have the adventuring, loot finding, conquering, etc.   and what makes things even more unique is that each of the maps have a different element effect.  one will be undead, one will be lava lands, one will be winter/frost based, etc.  ive started a few games and i can say from experience that you dont start on the same environment every time so you have to modify your strategy a little each time you play.. there are some scripted moments that dont change.. but beyond that you can have a different experience each time you play the game.the above mode, along with all the improvements like tech/spell trees, etc is enough for me to recommend Warlock II.a few criticisms:the units seem kind of useless for the most part.  you have many summoning spells available to you, and what you get can be quite powerful.  especially the dragons and spirit wolves.  also, you will get 4 heroes as you progress through exiled mode which can also become quite deadly.  you use those 4 heroes, a high level summoned dragon and maybe a unit or two for good measure and you are pretty much set.  yes, you need to defend your cities as you play.. but honestly, once you reach the optimal city limit, which you can usually manage on two continents.. the cities can become expendable. also, sometimes the random monster encounters you get can become frustrating.  they always seem to happen right around the time you are fighting a rival great mage.  some may consider this a positive.  myself, i just find it tedious.one final minor criticism.. the diplomacy mechanic.  there really isnt one.  lets say you declare a seize fire on a rival so you can clear out some monsters.  its almost a guarantee that the AI will attack again real soon, sometimes even on the very next turn.  basically diplomacy comes down to  accepting the seize fire to get a spell, gold, and mana and thats about it.conclusion:IMO, the amount of content in the game is enough to consider it worth the price - whether you consider it an expansion or not.. ask yourself, in the end, is it worth $30.  me.  i say DEFINITELY.

												Have you played Civilization and mostly enjoyed the experience?  Did you ever want something that was a less involved in juggling the requirements of building a long term successful civilization and at the same time gave you the feeling of building an expanding empire?  Oh, and did you ever ponder what Civilization 5 would be like if it didn't take itself so serious?  Well, that pretty much sums up Warlock 2.  The comparison is unavoidable between the two since much of the interface is similar.  Much of what you do in the game will be familiar to Civ 5 players, just less involved and deep in its potential.  Diplomacy - check.  City building and development - check. Resource management - check.  Build troops to decimate the enemy - check.  Now, with all that said, the one area where Warlock 2 is possibly ahead of Civ 5 is the actual combat game.  Between the variety of combat types, upgrades, and magic types vs melee and ranged troops Warlock 5 shows itself to be more designed to be a pure combat empire builder than Civ 5.  Sure there are other types of victory conditions, but in the end most will play to dominate the enemy on the field of battle since the other types of victory are not nearly as deep and satisfying.  At times there is even an RPG component to Warlock 2 that some may find appealing.  The joy in Warlock is that it presents a fun and playable game that doesn't take itself too serious and at times even manages to laugh at itself.  For those that prefer there is a campaign game that unfold a story along with a more scripted gameplay, but for myself it is best as a sandbox where you can dapple in all the absurdity of a fantasy world inhabited with giant rats, vampires, and creatures normally found in mythology.

												Great 4x fantasy strategy game! Turn based like the original Warlock game but with just enough changes and updates to make it a really nice stand alone expansion. The addition of the shattered world is a neat idea and battling for the separete shards of that world through the maze of teleporters  to your final destination makes quite the exceptional campaign of battles! A nice mix of mages, leaders and races to manage and play too. All in all, I'd say it's right up there with the Heroes of Might and Magic series. I would reccomend it. 4 out of 5 stars.			"

												Warlock 2 and Its predesesor, Warlock Master of the Arcane, are among the best games that I have played on any platform. Having logged inumerabe hours in Civilization, the granddaddy of turn based strategy games, I actualy tjhink I prefer Warlock. Perhaps it is because the units in Warlock have more personality, thus I feel more emotionally invested in them. A couple things  that I love about Warlock...1. The controls are silky smooth and emipire management is simple and easy to deal wiith compared to any other TBS game I think of. Each turn icons representing different types of actions cascade down the right side of your screen- at least that is what they did in Master of the Arcane. In Warlolck 2 you have to expand a single action button to see the colulmn of icons- I prefer the icons in the previous game. In any event, management of your cities and units is quick and efficient- you are prompted to make decisions so there is no reason you will forget something important, allowing  to concentrate on strategy. Battles are on the campaign hex map and not on a separate battle screen.2. The random map generator does a great job of changing things up. As in CIV you set the parameters, and the random geography created will have a huge impact on gameplay. Thus each camapign feels unique and replayability is thru the roof.Comparing Warlork 2 to Warlock Master of the Arcane, they are virtually the same game with a couple races added, some new rules and options. They also added a spell tech tree which is an improvement. Master of the Arcane DLC was inexpensive and greatly enhanced the Warlock experience- the Dremor DLC was mind blowingly challenging, but I was up for the challenge- so I will expect the same from Warlock 2. Yes! Warlock 2 is worth the $30 price tag. How could I think not since it is one of my favorite games ever?  "

												This is an excellent game for the beginner gamer interested in turn based strategy also known as 4X.  Everybody has to start somewhere and this game will help you understand the basics before jumping into something more complicated.  Warlock 2 could have been a much better game but even after several AI patches, enemies still lack an interest in hunting for you and will placidly wait for you to come to them.  I still enjoy playing it though.			"

												This game is great. There is plenty to grasp your attention in this game, tons of resources, tons of monsters, and tons of enemies. With randomly generated campaigns one never knows what to expect so you have to rethink your opening strategy each game based upon the terrain (each terrain offer certain resource production bonus's while ihnibiting the growth of another) That being said. I wish they would make the Ai even more ruthless. This does not mean that the Ai is easy to defeat or without some great strategies. One game in fact my first play through. One of the enemy great mages Vied for peace. I accepted, so that i could scout his territory. Within two turns he had sent his units to surround my lands, and then proceeded to demand huge sums of resources from me. I refused and he declared war. it was AWESOME. I mean i lost a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of units from that play and nearly a whole world. The ai needs more tactics like this one to really make em something difficult. I highly recomend this game if you enjoy a long term strategy game. its great. Oh and to any who play this game I challenge you to a match. I've never lost, maybe you have what it takes to defeat me.			"

												This game is incredibly buggy on OS X (El Capitan). Quests constantly break - especially 'Witch Hunt'. Checking quest statuses crashes the game and loading saved games crashes the game as well.Tried installing updates and DLC, but nothing has fixed. Have only been able to finish one game because of all these bugs.			"

												If you haven't played Warlock before, it's a Civilizations-style 4X strategy game set in a fantasy world, streamlined to require less micromanagement than Civ, but with a healthy dose of wild, interesting monsters and extra worlds in each game to place emphasis on exploration and colonization over internal economic management.  In my opinion, it plays faster than Civ at the expense of some depth, but makes up for that depth with rich, large worlds and a wide range of gameplay options on the combat level.If you have played Warlock before, then Warlock 2 is pretty much exactly what you want in a sequel.  The Exile campaign mode sets players on exterior shards in a labyrinthine web of interesting miniature worlds to fight your way to the central hub world and beat the AI-controlled boss for control - which is interesting and compelling, if surprisingly difficult.  The new worlds add a wide variety of resources, monsters, and terrain to the game, which was not lacking in the first game but is a welcome addition.  Furthermore, the number of playable races has practically doubled, offering a great deal of replay value and a ton of new options for tech trees and internal management as you expand your empire to include a wider variety of creatures and troops.On the downside, the game discourages vast empires with a city limit - which does prevent turns from going too long - but that option can be turned off on the menu.  Resources for creature upgrades are now limited to a set number of uses per resource, but that works as an incentive to do more exploration and expansion.  On the truly minor gripe level, the achievements are a bit glitchy at time of writing, but I suspect they'll be repaired in due time.In short, Warlock 2 is a solid improvement on the already-solid Warlock formula.  If you're a Warlock fan, you should absolutely make the investment; if you're a Civilizations fan or a strategy fan, you should definitely try it out.			"

												Warlock II: The Exiled is the kind of game that I should have written a review for a while ago, but because of the size of the game, and the VERY slow pace the game takes, I am now finally able to write up a review. First off this is a fantasy turn based adventure game where you are going to play the part of a powerful warlock who saved all the realms, but in his absence from the main realm became exiled. You will now have to gather troops, heroes, knowledge, and more if you are going to be able to retake what is rightfully your's. There will be many portals you will have to transverse, but if you can make it out to the other side you might just find your chance to exact your revenge. Graphically this game is not going to blow you away, but at the same time it looks well done. I do like the concept that every realm is a floating island, and that there is a wide variety of lands that you will have to deal with. You might be dealing with snowy lands, deserts, lava, cursed lands, and water. You never know what the next world will bring. There's also a very wide variety of enemies to face off against, you will get the chance to battle sea serpents, minotaurs, elementals, dragons, bats, and more. The one thing that I wish had a little bit more TLC to it was the city screens. I understand that there was definitely a minimal approach to it, but it doesn't feel as polished.The music does a great job of blending into the game to the point that you don't really notice it after a while.The controls are pretty straight forward, you are going to be using the mouse almost exclusively, with the exception of WASD when you are playing on dual monitors. If you don't you will notice that you are constantly clicking out of the game when trying to scroll across the map.Even though there is a story to follow, most of the game is randomly generated and is customized to the experience you want to have. You can choose the size of the land masses, the number of warlocks you will have to deal with, and of course the difficulty. Now I will say this, no matter what you are going to have to deal with micro-managing of resources until you can't take it any more. This game hinges on the fact that it plods along slowly so if there were issues you wouldn't see them. There's also a large amount of randomly generated neutral enemies that will pop back up after a while to keep you on your toes in areas that you have removed all your troops from. Speaking of troops, it is damn near impossible to be able to successfully sustain more than a handful of troops. The cost of gold, food, and mana per turn for each unit, hero, building, it will drive you made. There were only a very few times in the game where I was actually gaining on all 3 and that was when I didn't do anything on those turns. The one thing that did completely drive me up the wall was the fact that you have a limited amount of towns that you are allowed to have, and out of those you can only change the ones that you personally settled to specialty towns to help with your micro-managing and decrease your town count. Here's the problem, I'm a conquerer, I never built a second town, I've capture all the cities I've found, and yet I get penalized for it.At the end of the day the thing about this game that you are going to NEED to have is the editor. This is probably one of the best and most in-depth editors I've seen in a long time. You can build an entire game out of it utilizing Warlock II as a backbone. If you are willing to put in the time you can EASILY make something light years better than what comes out of the box. So with that I have to give a grade on the game, as is, and not what the game can potentially have with user contributions. This game gets a 6.5 out of 10.			"

												I like the simple gameplay.  It's almost like playing Civilization......except that it is buggy.  I've had my game crash on almost every occasion I played it.  The game was supposed to autosave after each turn, but when I tried to continue from where it crashed, it took me back to an earlier game that I saved. It just wasted my time.  I'm sorry, but this game is not worth the money I paid for it.  :( "

												it was ok, but the ""strategy"" is superficial. Either you need to give us more information on stuff, or have less parameters. -There are certain monsters that you won't know how to fight until you've wasted troops dying to them.-AI is a mess. Monster spawning is a chore to deal with too.-The game, like Civ has you going in turns, UNLIKE Civ though you have to sit through animations for each unit of each other player and NPC... that gets time consuming and annoying.-not intuitive how to sustain and grow your settlements. It'd be nice if it told you when or where the next tile would expand on a city, but its really not intuitive if that info is present...-bugs... oh god, so many weird bugs in a 3hr spanoverall it was a decent waste of $20, I got 3hr of entertainment before getting bored, I honestly wish I would have realized before I'd played past the point of no return(literally), because I'm 100% confident I will never play this again			"

												My hopes were quite high because I enjoyed the first part of Warlock - MotA quite much but I have to say that this game just plays worse as its predecessor so I can’t recommend it and rather suggest to buy the first part or my favorite game of that sorts: Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes.My main problem is the “small worlds” concept and the balancing and randomness of the game. Also some dialogues/story elements feel like they have a target group of 12 years old – but perhaps it is just not my type of humor. Also there are many smaller bugs that could be fixed in no time but it looks like the devs don’t care.As for the game, you start with one city on a random world (from death to elven, everything seems to be possible but has a great impact on how it plays). So usually you start exploring it and searching for other suitable places to build more cities and get access to important special resources. But this world is so small that it doesn’t make sense to build a second city on it – at least you won’t find a perfect place and you most likely will interfere with your first city or build on the edge of the world and won’t have many tiles to your disposal. When I continued playing I saw that the AI is placing like 5 cities on such a plane which feels just wrong but seems to be necessary in that game. I love creating a network of megacities in such games and this is simply not possible here due to the small land sizes. There is a setting for world size but I already chose the 2nd highest and I’m not sure if this means more small worlds or bigger worlds. I saw like 7 worlds in my plays and only 1 of them was quite large and could host 3 cities easily so I don’t know how (un-)lucky I was.In order to progress you have to use a “bridge” to the next world of comparable size. But those bridges are usually not free of charge. You have to spend some money or mana on being able to pass through or simple have to rely on luck (the conditions you have to fulfill to be able to use it seem to be random). Furthermore there are monster lairs everywhere (like every 2-3 tiles). They are good to get some combat training for your units and get gold, mana or even unique bonuses or spells from looting them, but sometimes there are overpowered enemies in those lairs which you either have to move around or join all your forces to be able to kill them. So this either needs some turns/time or it blocks your progress all together. In Warlock 1 you had enough space to ignore those monsters for now but here you might just not be able to play on.Well the good thing about that worlds and bridges concept could be that you have some kind of progress and frontline you can push. But in reality it is just a huge pain in the… because of random monster spawns. So what is happening is that you are trying to loot/conquer the next world with your army and then some ridiculous strong monster just spawns close to one of your important cities and you need like at least 5 turns to push your army back to defeat that monster, probably even after it took your city. So you can either lose countless turns in just moving your units back and forward or you can reload a save game 10 turns earlier and not even start to move away and rather secure the area. Both just feels bad and after it happened the 3rd time in my ~6 hours game I stopped playing. There are really games that are just more fun than having to cope with random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you can’t predict and throw your progress back for half an hour or so…Some examples of annoyances:Whenever you load a game you have to click through all active quests and confirm them again (most can’t be denied anyway)You still can build harbors and ships but there are no oceans in the game, only small ponds, making them totally useless. Really devs?? How lazy are you?There are many small graphic glitches like small lines in the hud (probably bad cut out graphics), flickering textures (rarely) or a just strange looking background layer of the worlds…When you have a unit selected and want to switch planes you send the unit to that plane (I guess it is a feature but when you have to reload because you just wasted your move it can be annoying)What some might like is that the game sets more focus on terraforming. Due to the small worlds this is more important than before and there are random terraforming events you might have to react to. The whole spell research is better and more important now. You could fully ignore magic in the first part of the game and now you also can learn global benefits like higher production or less unrest by learning certain spells. But I think that is the only improvement to the first game…So this not necessarily a bad game and I rarely don’t recommend a game but I got the feeling that they only switched to the “small worlds concept” because marketing needed something to distinguish it from the first part. The rest of the changes could have been an update or dlc for part 1…			"

												A competent enough 4x lacking something special which would've elevated it above mediocrity.In this iteration they went for a fragmented world setup and you progress through the worlds one at a time by using portals that link two worlds. It is also interesting how the town number limit is setup, there is an optimal number of towns you have, however once you are past that number you don't have to destroy the town. You can convert it into a specialized town which still gives you some bonuses, but doesn't count towards the town limit anymore.Everything else is stuck in a limbo of mediocrity, which makes the game tedious to play after a while. And that is something you absolutely do not want in a genre that is tailored towards long play periods.6 / 10			"

I have seldomly seen a game with very well thought out hero perks (some of them hilarious) and the heroes = a paladin with no pants - priceless!  A couple of bugs here and there but that's minor.  Continuing to hope for some mp action with 3+ friends on a consistent basis, look me up let's play!Lots of different play modes to choose from, high replayability, steam mods, create your own leader, a very fun, pleasant game experience, this game led me to buy the warlock games of the past, they deserve my business.  I pickup copies for friends from time to time on the 75% off sales to share this gem, it's too good not to have in your gaming repitoire if you like fantasy turn based games.			"

If you're clever enough to be on PC/windows  (i will not write here what i think of both others héhé) buy the game now, it really worth it !   :)2.         You will have  fun trying different races/creatures in the same game, after the capture of different cities. At normal difficulty, you will just have to face IA monsters, the other IA players will not challenge you. 3.          Your heroes will be strenghened with different carfted items and different perks your cities will produce, from building or exploited ressources. Try to get a famous hero as to be able to destroy the monsters in the last world.			"

												This is only a single player review, but:- Fans of Civilization will feel right at home with the UI. And if you feeel that combat is too limited by city management in civ, this is definitely worth playing.- Graphics requirements are minimal; I currently run Win 8.1 on an i5, 8GB ram and a GTX 760 with 2GB @ 1920x1080. It is very smooth and responsive, and would probably be fine on a much more basic setup. - The way you use terrain and resources, as well as building selection and city growth, are a whole different twist. the learning curve start shallow but ramps up early, which makes you experiment. The emphasis is more on your army than on city management, and cities buff your armies. - Has that wonderful alternate plane mapping that civ tried and gave up on in civ 2. If you miss that well here it is, and well done. - in SP at least, no bugs have appeared. I consider this decently polished and not some beta passed off as a finished product. MP, I can't comment and will defer to other reviews. 5/5 in my book guys, especially for the sale price. I don't say that often.  "

												Warlock 2 is one of those games where I want to like it, and every time I play it I wish it was better. While this game has many qualities that I like, there are many things about it I do not. I will skip the nonsense and go straight to the pros and cons.Pros:*There are many game settings you can choose from in the sandbox mode, which is great for giving you just the right amount of a challenge.*The game has a nice selection of characters to choose from. Each one very customizable, and many different races to choose as a starting city.*The variety of units and enemies are very expansive. I never felt like every other race was just a clone of another.*The game has a large amount of replayability. The above mentioned items, as well as completely random worlds and situations make each session unique.Cons:*For many users, this game encounters random crashes with no warnings or crash screen to explain what happened.*The AI is extremely annoying. Almost every single game I play, the opponents constantly bug me for non-aggression pacts and alliances every 2 or 3 turns. I got to one point in a game where I met all 8 of them, and every 2 or 3 turns, all 8 of them asked for an alliance. You almost have to declare war on them just to make them shut up. But then they just ask for peace every few turns. This does not change based on difficulty.*It is too easy to steamroll enemies. Honestly the most challenging parts of the game I have found to be exploring the other worlds with extremely hard wild monsters. Even on the max difficulty though, once you build up to it, you can just mow through every faction with little to no resistance. Their combat AI is no better than their diplomacy AI.Other than that though, the game really has some potential. If someone out there was good with code, and could mod it to have a decent AI, I would recommend this game in a heartbeat. Or if the developer ever desires to finish what could have been an amazing game. As it stands though, I do not recommend it. At least not at full price. Wait for a Steam sale, and if you are dying for some new 4x, give it a shot.			"

												This is basically Warlock 1, with new units and spells added and with the planes system vastly improved. I loved both Warlock 1 and this game, but if you didn't like warlock 1 I doubt this game will change your mind at all.			"

												One of the greatest turn based strategy game ever.  You have to build and upgrade your cities and manage resources but you will spent nearly 100% of your time warring not managing.  The game/map builder makes this game playable for ever.  It is exactly like Warlock 1 but they fixed all the little annoyancies.			"

												Paid £4 for this and I still feel like I was cheated. There are some nice features in this game such as some of the voice acting for monsters, and I like the ability to cast spells, which generally cannot be done in other 4X's, but overall it doesn't feel like a good 4X game.  Graphics are unappealing and units are quite dull. You would have to have a strong interest in the series to buy this, and I did not.The floating worlds are a nice feature added to Warlock 2 that separate the land and allow you to explore many different terrains. It's a shame that I didn't get far enough in to engage with them properly.While I didn't mind the UI, it was again unappealing.Overall this game is really not worth getting. Even on sale. While I haven't played many 4X games, this game was the worst out of the few that I have played.			"

												To be honest, I got this game on sale for $5. I dont know how differently I'd feel about it, had I payed full price. Also, I haven't played the previous game, so I cant make a comparison between the two.The mechanics of this game, along with the fairly intuitive interface,  make it easy to get the hang of quickly. There are lots  of interesting units in each faction, each with tons of available upgrades that reward you for keeping your units alive. Hero units are powerful and valuable, but not so much as to make your line troops irrelevant.Each game plays out on several maps, each map offering bonuses and penalties to different faction troops. Keeping access to a diverse array of troop types is important. The units that perform great on one map can be almost useless on the next. Terrain matters, both for fighting and building.Spell casting is lots of fun, especially wreaking havoc on enemy cities by flooding farms, sprouting volcanoes, and calling down firestorms. Most spells in the game are actually useful.Unfortunately, the AI holds this game back quite a bit. Enemy units seem to wander aimlessly around the map, never really making a coordinated effort to retake areas once you have control. It can be fun slogging across each map, but the outcome never seems to really seems to be in question. The game suffers from a lack of nail biting moments.			"

												Used to be a somewhat fun (due to various novelties) though flawed game. I had fun with it, but I kind of like mindless easy expansion games. Probably would have been only worth the price now for a dedicated hex strategy gamer looking for something totally new (DLC wildly overpriced). But that was before ""patches"" (I assume) made it unplayable. I fired it up for the first time in a while, and it just does not work. E.g., triggers necessary to allow you to keep playing fail to activate much of the time.			"

												Warlock 2 is essentially the first Warlock game but with improved graphics.  There are some minor game changes but overall it's the same game as the first.  There are some minor bugs and I do mean minor.  Essentially if you enjoyed and are a massive fan of the first Warlock game then you might as well give this one a go.  If you are a fan of these types of games but generally not a massive fan of this peticular series then you're probably better off just sticking with the first Warlock.			"

												I bought both Warlock games at the same time, and played them both in order.  The first is a really decent game, I'd say 8/10, but this second game isn't as good.  Both are basically glorified Civ5 mods with some better features thrown in, though - which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but if you didn't like Civ5, you probably won't enjoy this.The reason I like the first game better is the first game is much cleaner.  The UI really takes a hit in this second game, especially in the city interface. They went from simple icons of food-money-specialized military buildings to individual icons that you can't tell what they are most of the time.  The main screen UI is much smaller and hard to read, and even the diplomacy window is muddier.  UI is also pretty buggy, tooltips getting stuck etc.There's some good features added, a clearer ""tech"" tree for your spellls, more of a campaign, and the new races are pretty cool, but now that the maps are a series of shards, it's pretty easy to control the choke points and just keep pushing forward - no real challenge of full open world combat or watch-your-back element (worth noting that there are other options of map to play on).  Combat is much faster now, which is good except that it's almost too fast - you can't tell sometimes that an NPC has declared war on you, there's no notifications like in the first game, so you constantly have to check in the diplomacy screen for the tiny war icon.Good:- clearer spell tree- new races- kept most of the old elements without breaking too much- something of a story/campaign mode now- more modding available- movement costs and build bonuses now able to viewBad:- UI very small and doesn't give as much information, notification system is much worse, can't choose from a list- doesn't center on the unit properly when starting unit turns- tool tips are buggy, get stuck during mouseover- Less notifications, can't tell if war is declared- much less challenging than the firstI recommend it, I mean it's still better than a lot of TBS games out there, but it's definitely not as good as the first.6/10			"

												My hopes were quite high because I enjoyed the first part of Warlock - MotA quite much but I have to say that this game just plays worse as its predecessor so I can’t recommend it and rather suggest to buy the first part or my favorite game of that sorts: Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes.My main problem is the “small worlds” concept and the balancing and randomness of the game. Also some dialogues/story elements feel like they have a target group of 12 years old – but perhaps it is just not my type of humor. Also there are many smaller bugs that could be fixed in no time but it looks like the devs don’t care.As for the game, you start with one city on a random world (from death to elven, everything seems to be possible but has a great impact on how it plays). So usually you start exploring it and searching for other suitable places to build more cities and get access to important special resources. But this world is so small that it doesn’t make sense to build a second city on it – at least you won’t find a perfect place and you most likely will interfere with your first city or build on the edge of the world and won’t have many tiles to your disposal. When I continued playing I saw that the AI is placing like 5 cities on such a plane which feels just wrong but seems to be necessary in that game. I love creating a network of megacities in such games and this is simply not possible here due to the small land sizes. There is a setting for world size but I already chose the 2nd highest and I’m not sure if this means more small worlds or bigger worlds. I saw like 7 worlds in my plays and only 1 of them was quite large and could host 3 cities easily so I don’t know how (un-)lucky I was.In order to progress you have to use a “bridge” to the next world of comparable size. But those bridges are usually not free of charge. You have to spend some money or mana on being able to pass through or simple have to rely on luck (the conditions you have to fulfill to be able to use it seem to be random). Furthermore there are monster lairs everywhere (like every 2-3 tiles). They are good to get some combat training for your units and get gold, mana or even unique bonuses or spells from looting them, but sometimes there are overpowered enemies in those lairs which you either have to move around or join all your forces to be able to kill them. So this either needs some turns/time or it blocks your progress all together. In Warlock 1 you had enough space to ignore those monsters for now but here you might just not be able to play on.Well the good thing about that worlds and bridges concept could be that you have some kind of progress and frontline you can push. But in reality it is just a huge pain in the… because of random monster spawns. So what is happening is that you are trying to loot/conquer the next world with your army and then some ridiculous strong monster just spawns close to one of your important cities and you need like at least 5 turns to push your army back to defeat that monster, probably even after it took your city. So you can either lose countless turns in just moving your units back and forward or you can reload a save game 10 turns earlier and not even start to move away and rather secure the area. Both just feels bad and after it happened the 3rd time in my ~6 hours game I stopped playing. There are really games that are just more fun than having to cope with random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you can’t predict and throw your progress back for half an hour or so…Some examples of annoyances:Whenever you load a game you have to click through all active quests and confirm them again (most can’t be denied anyway)You still can build harbors and ships but there are no oceans in the game, only small ponds, making them totally useless. Really devs?? How lazy are you?There are many small graphic glitches like small lines in the hud (probably bad cut out graphics), flickering textures (rarely) or a just strange looking background layer of the worlds…When you have a unit selected and want to switch planes you send the unit to that plane (I guess it is a feature but when you have to reload because you just wasted your move it can be annoying)What some might like is that the game sets more focus on terraforming. Due to the small worlds this is more important than before and there are random terraforming events you might have to react to. The whole spell research is better and more important now. You could fully ignore magic in the first part of the game and now you also can learn global benefits like higher production or less unrest by learning certain spells. But I think that is the only improvement to the first game…So this not necessarily a bad game and I rarely don’t recommend a game but I got the feeling that they only switched to the “small worlds concept” because marketing needed something to distinguish it from the first part. The rest of the changes could have been an update or dlc for part 1…			"

												If you have played the original Warlock, consider this a sort-of expansion pack. It changes a few core mechanics (one of them being the city construction), but it plays largely the same, with a few new units, a new faction and more story-driven campaign option.If you haven't played the original, let's get to it!Warlock 2 is aturn-based strategy game where you build up your whimsical magical empire, build yourself some gentleman werewolves and go on to crush the opposition! It shares quite a few design elements with Civilisation V, though it differs in several points.Firstly, your research does not help you progress through eras, rather, it lets you unlock new spells! What is a great mage without a fireball, after all? You even get to worship gods and learn some of their spells, as well.Advanced units are unlocked through city improvements and have many varied abilities and attributes. Truly, the faction differences are the main strength of the game, each having its own distinct style and slightly different approach to gameplay.With loads of colour and dozens of different units, each with its own set of defining attributes, you've got a nice blend of tools to work with. IF you are a warmonger.That may be construed as the game's biggest flaw, as diplomacy has little place in the world of Warlock. The AI is bad at it and even with human players, you're quite incentivized to be at each other's throats constantly. After all, why be one of the greatest mages, when you could be the Greatest Mage?If you don't mind blasting the enemy with fireballs, though, and you don't fear bears (the neutral armies in the game are rather terrifying at times), Warlock II has all the enjoyment you need!

												TLDR: If you liked #1, this is an even better game. :-)After finishing my first campaign, I found it to be quite a bit of fun.My campaign of conquest was to return and overthrow the united one.What I'd expected before I got there, was a huge map at the end, much like the starting map in Warlock 1, through which I'd have to fight a campaign of attrition against a heavily entrenched enemy, with many cities.Imagine my surprise when I pop in and it's just another small world, with a few great mages now acting as just a few high level heros.Because of this, the ending was rather short and anti-climactic.Overall I found the spellbook to be a nice improvement over the previous, completely random one.I like being able to see what is available and go for a specific thing in the long run.This both reduced the time before I got useful spells and gave me a better feel of control of my guys magic.I was happy to see my favorite area of Summoning to be expanded both in basic spells and in divine ones.I was surprised you could now get dragon & elementals both as summons and city build units.The game was stable throughout and did not crash or freeze once, unlike Warlock 1, which would randomly just sort of get stuck during a great mage turn... which happened every fifth game, it seemed.The only bad thing about this which I can think of is that shadow bats are half of what pops up in the randomly generated lairs, which are generated at regular intervals; These units are WAY to powerful to be frequent popup units!

No pressure, just play.Cons:-	Bugs… Did not let me play after turn such and such…-	No story line… Sorry, the “story line” is introduced in Warlock 2 (Which is basically Warlock 1 with story line and extra race) - wait I just realized this is Warlock 2... Well, no difference.-	Optimization is just awful – game seems not finished. -	All the game is like some beta access game not a finished product-	Music, was there any music?-	Bad graphics-	Gets boring really fast… because there is no reason to play it really. Except for multiplayer with is full of glitches as well.-       Devs do not give a toss about this game... No support. no bugs fixesConclusion: That could have been a really nice game but it is just unfinished. It feels like only half of it was made and only half of this half was tested.My rating 3.50/10			"

												Just finished this game on Casual level and thought to write a review.  The simple way to review this game is to say that that if you liked Warlock: Master of the Arcane, you will like this game as well.  If you didn't like the first part or haven't played it, but are looking for a turn-based strategy with lots of variety, challenging AI and reward for your strategic decisions, then this is not a game for you. As someone who really enjoyed the first game, I liked this one very much.I thought to go further and write the differences between this and original game, but other people already covered that and you can read it on internet.  I'll just add a few things that I thought were the worse than in the original, for those people that expect everything to be same or better.1. Even more than in the original game, the location of your initial capital can make big difference, from a very easy ride, to an impossible to finish.  Don't be shy restarting the game a few times until your capital is in good location.2. You can safely only control a certain number of cities (starts with 5, but increases as you research some traits to maximum of eleven - yes, like with spells, you can choose to research traits that help you manage your realm).  If you go over this number, people get unhappy which gives penalties and I believe can lead into some sort of riot - I've never got that far.  You can have unlimited number of specialist cities (those that only make gold, or are like a fortress, or temple cities to a deity that improve relations with that deity and produce some mana).  This is really a shame when you conquer some good cities (but still not better than those you already have) - you just have to destroy them, or wait for 10 turns for ""plundered"" status to disappear before you can convert them to a specialist city.3. When a building give you perks to use, it's only a limited number of uses.  For example, a smithy will give you only 5 armours, which means you can only give the perk to 5 units.  This is applicable to each smithy, so if you have 2 smithies, that's 10 units to give the perk to.  But with the limited number of cities, you don't want to build smithy in each one.  Not to mention buildings that require a few other buildings to be built before you can have them, like University, or buildings that need a resource tile to be built.  You will never be able to control all resources.  So you have to choose carefully which unit you will give a perk to.  Heroes are the obvious choice, but even with them, a healer lord that stays out of fights may not necessarily need all the armour upgrades.For the end, there are a few bugs (for example, mass heal spell doesn't heal all the units in the range), but not enough to make the game too frustrating.  I didn't have a single time that the game crushed during the play, so that's obviously a good thing. "

												The game scales poorly, you can run into things in the beginning of the game that can kill you, if you survive long enough you can have an easy time in the midgame, but, at least in Exiled mode, you get to the end game and the power scaling goes completely off the rails. Can't recommend this.			"

												Warlock 2 is one of those games where I want to like it, and every time I play it I wish it was better. While this game has many qualities that I like, there are many things about it I do not. I will skip the nonsense and go straight to the pros and cons.Pros:*There are many game settings you can choose from in the sandbox mode, which is great for giving you just the right amount of a challenge.*The game has a nice selection of characters to choose from. Each one very customizable, and many different races to choose as a starting city.*The variety of units and enemies are very expansive. I never felt like every other race was just a clone of another.*The game has a large amount of replayability. The above mentioned items, as well as completely random worlds and situations make each session unique.Cons:*For many users, this game encounters random crashes with no warnings or crash screen to explain what happened.*The AI is extremely annoying. Almost every single game I play, the opponents constantly bug me for non-aggression pacts and alliances every 2 or 3 turns. I got to one point in a game where I met all 8 of them, and every 2 or 3 turns, all 8 of them asked for an alliance. You almost have to declare war on them just to make them shut up. But then they just ask for peace every few turns. This does not change based on difficulty.*It is too easy to steamroll enemies. Honestly the most challenging parts of the game I have found to be exploring the other worlds with extremely hard wild monsters. Even on the max difficulty though, once you build up to it, you can just mow through every faction with little to no resistance. Their combat AI is no better than their diplomacy AI.Other than that though, the game really has some potential. If someone out there was good with code, and could mod it to have a decent AI, I would recommend this game in a heartbeat. Or if the developer ever desires to finish what could have been an amazing game. As it stands though, I do not recommend it. At least not at full price. Wait for a Steam sale, and if you are dying for some new 4x, give it a shot.			"

												TLDR: If you liked #1, this is an even better game. :-)After finishing my first campaign, I found it to be quite a bit of fun.My campaign of conquest was to return and overthrow the united one.What I'd expected before I got there, was a huge map at the end, much like the starting map in Warlock 1, through which I'd have to fight a campaign of attrition against a heavily entrenched enemy, with many cities.Imagine my surprise when I pop in and it's just another small world, with a few great mages now acting as just a few high level heros.Because of this, the ending was rather short and anti-climactic.Overall I found the spellbook to be a nice improvement over the previous, completely random one.I like being able to see what is available and go for a specific thing in the long run.This both reduced the time before I got useful spells and gave me a better feel of control of my guys magic.I was happy to see my favorite area of Summoning to be expanded both in basic spells and in divine ones.I was surprised you could now get dragon & elementals both as summons and city build units.The game was stable throughout and did not crash or freeze once, unlike Warlock 1, which would randomly just sort of get stuck during a great mage turn... which happened every fifth game, it seemed.The only bad thing about this which I can think of is that shadow bats are half of what pops up in the randomly generated lairs, which are generated at regular intervals; These units are WAY to powerful to be frequent popup units!

												Relatively enjoyable game.  Similar to other 4X games, with it's main outstanding quality being it's spell-casting system.  I found it lacked the replayability that many other 4X games have, and the AI is foolish at best.  I give it a good 6/10, reccomending it be bought only at a highly discounted price, as $20 is hardly worth it, not including the extra $5-$10 for the DLCs.			"

												Okay, here is the good one :) I enjoyed this game, but unfortunately cannot recommend it for several reasons:Pros:-	Nice fantasy-CIV mod :)-	So funny narrator voice-	Heroes, items and spells-	Nice races-	Big maps with portals and different worlds-	Ehh these quests in the windows and the choice in there – so funny-	This game is cool. No pressure, just play.Cons:-	Bugs… Did not let me play after turn such and such…-	No story line… Sorry, the “story line” is introduced in Warlock 2 (Which is basically Warlock 1 with story line and extra race) - wait I just realized this is Warlock 2... Well, no difference.-	Optimization is just awful – game seems not finished. -	All the game is like some beta access game not a finished product-	Music, was there any music?-	Bad graphics-	Gets boring really fast… because there is no reason to play it really. Except for multiplayer with is full of glitches as well.-       Devs do not give a toss about this game... No support. no bugs fixesConclusion: That could have been a really nice game but it is just unfinished. It feels like only half of it was made and only half of this half was tested.My rating 3.50/10			"

												This game is superb. I feel as though it is an improvement ovr part I of the series, with one tiny gripe which is that I miss being able to spam armor and blessings of Hill O'Win. The change is understandable, however. 8/10 will play more.			"

												At Release, I gave Warlock 2 a positive review. As a huge fan of the first Warlock, I loved the notion of a sequel, and the content additions and new campaign were very enjoyable. I do, however, have to take into consideration the mismanagement of the game after release. At launch, there were bugs. Some were fixed, but many still remain 18 months after release. Many of the bugs in this final build are still very game-breaking. While some of the modders in the community have addressed some of these, and in fact still push out content even to this day, the fact that developers could not be bothered to fix the game, while instead pushing new DLC, is troubling. If you come across this review and are on the fence about buying it, I have to recommend that you pass...			"

												This game has a bug for mac and linux users that has been around for almost a year that the develepers are unable or unwilling to fix.  Furthermore since this bug happens a little over 2 hours into gameplay, granted a slow gameplay were I read everything, You can't return it once you realize it is compleately broken.  I have actually stopped buying games on steam because of this policy.  If a game is broken you should be able to return it.  The gameplay and world is actually quite appealing, but if you can't get past the first world it is basically a bunch of teases showing you what you can't have.  If you are using a mac or linux computer do not buy this game.			"
