Early Access Review
								Okay so, I'm not exactly sure if i should upvote or downvote it, because both would be true.First of all the good part. The first 10 hours of the game or so, maybe a little bit less, 8 hours - seem magical, astounding and absolutely amazing. It reminds you of old masterpieces - dungeon keeper, Knights and Merchants, even survival games. It's all great - I mean you can dig, create stuff, decorate it, smash monsters, level gnomes up, craft, you can craft a lot. More advanced crafting requires gnomes with specific skills. So the idea's great, you unlock more and more recipes by crafting newly unlocked stuff, the world seems a better place with this game around.And then you get to midgame.You start lacking resourses, especially the most important resourse ingame - iron, which is non-renewable. You start going to edges of the map, which takes gnomes forever to just reach, not to mention they prefer spending their time doing something you didn't really even ask them to do. Even with teleportation to the right place, you just no longer control them, the AI gets dumber the more you build and explore, while gnomes never get faster, nor you get a huge army of them. By midgame you require at least 5 times the amount of gnomes you have!The crafting turns into hell, because you need to unlock 5-10-15 more levels to reach a needed crafting level by crafting stuff you clearly do not need need in huge amounts: like 50 book cases, or 15 stone statues. You exhaust your resourses on trash, just to get over it. You also got to build that trash, which requires you to use pretty inconvinient system of placing the newly crafted item into one of 20 fast access slots, which in midgame are already filled out with important things like spells, food, walls, bridges etc. And then restore the previous one the same way.By that time you get the feeling that you'd rather stare at the wall doing nothing, than play on.Awful late game balance and AI management completely kills the game.But at least you can enjoy first 8-12 hours.

												This is a nice 2d dwarf management game, kind of like a mix between Dwarf Fortress, Terraria and Minecraft. I've enjoyed the time I've spent playing it and I recommend it. However, it does have a few problems.I wish levels didn't take so long to complete: I've played this game for 60 hours and I've only completed 2&1/2 levels. There's no real reason for the game to be so slow, there's just not much to do on a map after you've secured your fort except more of the same stuff you've been doing from the beginning.There's a research tree, but it sucks. New techs have too many prerequisites. You need all of the prerequisites and most of them don't make any sense. Resetting the tech tree each level is also pointless and just makes levels take longer.Dwarfs are also pretty dumb and still get lost while pathfinding. They'll also gather up junk resources like dirt and sand which you simply won't ever need or want again after a certain point.I'm not sure why this game has a Minecraft style crafting grid either. It just means every time I want to make something I need to drag each item onto the grid. There's no need for this, the game gives you the recipe, it could just give you an inventory count for the ingredients on the crafting grid so that you could make stuff and be aware of how many of your raw resources you're using without any dragging.Last but not least I would say the game is very easy. Just kit out all your dwarfs with some good weapons and armor. A few melee dwarfs and the rest with bows or wizard staffs and you're set. You can also just armor your base well and wait out the hourly monster sieges.I guess that's a long list of complaints but I really do enjoy building up my fortress and fending off the monster waves while I gradually expand my mines deeper and further away.

												First 10 hours - AwesomeNext 10 hours - FunNext 10 hours - okNext 10 hours - TediousNext 10 hours - Arrrghhhh!Ok, so why overall positive review? Great value for money! You will get 30 hours of fun out of this game, which makes it money well spent. What happens that makes it a mind numbing tedious grind? Basically there are 3 worlds. You start the first and work your way up in tech to fight the final bosses and move on to the next world.  Now here is the kick to the nuts, every time you start a new world, you start completely over!! I started my third world and couldn't take it anymore. The worlds are a little different so that is kinda fun, but the tech is the same.  Grind fest by gameplay hour 40.  Still, would reccomend you try it. 30 hours of fun! Better bang for your buck than movie or amusement park.			"

Early Access Review
								If you are looking for that next crafter/builder sandbox adventure, then this is the one.  It has the basis to be great as long as you understand that this is an Early Access game meaning there is a lot more to come.  Better graphics than Terraria and does everything different enough to keep it interesting.  Instead of a single hero, you get a team of dwarves to do your bidding.  Tough to rate an Early Access game and would suggest Steam considers against it.  Tough to speak negatively in a review on an Early Access game when I have no idea what will be added until considered released.  So at this point, all I will say is it has the basis to be one of the great ones.Update #1 (3/1/14):   The dev continues to update this game, it continues to get better and I still feel that it has a strong enough foundation to be considered great.  Add mods and this could be legendary.Update #2 (4/14/14):    Same as the last update.  The game is continually being updated with fixes and additions.  A perfect example of what I expect from an Early Access game, and trust me when I say that it's only a small fraction of EA games that get updated this frequently.			"

												Please don't let the Negative review fool you- Craft the World can be a really fun game when it wants to be. I bought this game after Terraria, Gnomoria and Dwarf Fortress were feeling a little stale, and after reading that from the Store Page that it draws so much from similar games, I thought ""Well, this is the game for me!""CtW does a LOT right- it has a great allocation of resources, a Tech Tree that rewards the player (though still in need of a good bit of work on some of the later technologies), graphics that inspire a friendly and positive player experience, and a great base-building simulation.So why is it a Negative review?Because it's a Mobile game. Everything about CtW reeks of ""The App Store is our major goal"". No key bindings, a crafting menu COMPLETELY designed around touchscreens, and even a big Dwarf holding an iPad when you load up the game just ruins the experience for me. Despite it's initial release on Steam, Craft the World makes PC users feel like an afterthought. Everything is dragging, everything is awkward, and you'll need to head to the wiki if you want to figure out any Hotkey shortcuts. However, my overall negative review comes from more than a moral standing-The game fails to deliver on population management completely. If you select an enemy, ALL of yours Dwarves will drop everything they do to fight it. If you mine a tunnel, you're going to have a conga line of Dwarves picking up resources in the LEAST sensible way possible. If you start a task, cancel it, and restart it, you're going to have a Dwarf standing around while another Dwarf, often from the other side of the map, comes to handle the task for some odd reason.The Evil Portal event feels like an artificial restraint on my fun, making me have to pause everything I'm doing for a night while trying to herd my Dwarves into their home quick enough to survive, and the zombie waves are just a lot of ""keep smacking them until they go away(win)/until they break your door down(lose). The Goblin events are frustrating at best; I don't know how the developer thought putting in a random surge of enemies without ANY warning would be a great idea, but it's still more fun than the Evil Portal event.A lot of mechanics are frustrating to deal with and calling them unintuitive would be a major complement. Selecting a single space and having four different options for that space pop up makes me think ""How much better could this have been if they'd put effort into making it better for Mouse/Keyboard users?""All in all, Craft the World is fun. Sometimes. Every time I play this game, it wants me to have all the fun in the world, right up until it trips over its own shoelaces and falls face-first onto the floor. When Dekvoir makes a release better tailored for PC users, I'll gladly change my review. Until then, don't pick the game up until it goes on sale.			"

												After much deliberation, I decided to give the thumbs up to this game - but with a bunch of stuff in mind.First thing's first - the developers made true on their promise, and this game is indeed a mix of Dungeon Keeper (you can control one of your dwarves, which is actually recommended during difficult encounters), Terraria (2D mining, hidden underground rooms and enemies, nighttime attacks) and Dwarf Fortress - well, dwarves and equipment for them.Secondly - this is not a game that will keep you glued to your PC as your dwarves are being killed left and right. Actually, this is a game that doesn't really take itself seriously - you have unlimited freedom over the things your dwarves do - sometimes, it is just as fun to watch them go about their daily stuff (sleep, snore, eat, talk to each other, make funny sounds, etc.). It is a pure sandbox game with some survival factor. Let your creative juices flow, and build yourself a nice fortress or castle. Experiment and take pleasure in it - completing the level isn't really mandatory. Sometimes just making something cool looking just to screenshot it and post it somewhere is just as much fun as completing a level. With that in mind, be aware that your little dwarves will♥♥♥♥♥♥you the hell off quite often.As far as replayability goes, you can expect to be dumping a lot of hours in it. Completing a single level is 12+ hours on a small map.Let's quickly outline what's good and what's bad about this game.The Good:- Sandbox game with huge replayability- Very pleasant graphics and cute dwarves making all kinds of funny sounds- Rewarding exploration of the world above and below- Extensive tech tree- Promotes creativity- Player is actively involved in everything that happens- personally, I haven't played a more relaxing game in a long time, without feeling any constraints or need to finish a levelThe Bad:- Dwarfs AI - the dwarves are plain stupid (look at me using both US and GB plurals in one sentence). Hmm... on a second thought, that is an understatement. They are brain dead and really need you to react to situations or just plain do something before you start... um... how to put it mildly so I don't get banned... Ricking your dipps off.-- And this is a huge gripe. It outweighs everything else. If you do nothing, you will see your dwarves doing the same idiotic thing over and over again, likely resulting in death. Example: in a Boss fight (Big Undead Guys with lots of HP, good armor, using sword attacks and hurling fireballs which you need to kill to advance to the next level) if you lose a dwarf or two before the fight is over, you are in very deep sh... trouble. Unless you explicitely order your dwarves to stay inside the shelter, they will go one by one to pick ther fallen comrades valuable gear, in essence getting slaughtered themselves in the process. You can decimate a whole 10+ dwarven colony like that easily. HOpe you have nerves of steel and don't ragequit.- the pathfinding - oftentimes you will see the dwarves taking weird paths to their goals (can be remedied with portals, thank god)- Techs need grinding - unless you have something specific in mind, expect to be building the same thing over and over to advance to the next tech- Resources are limited - some resources can be recrafted (like coal) but the valuable ores (iron-mithril) can't, so you might face a mineral shortage- Bosses can be cheesed out - if you manage to put the turret just outside their range and you are patient enough, you will have yourself a dead boss.Conclusion: as you see, only the combat part of the game is actually a problem. Everything else promotes casual gameplay, sandbox feeling, relaxation, laughs and smiles all around. I would characterize this game as a builder with softcore survival elements. It is the perfect thing for the casual gamer who likes to throw in an hour or two in it, have some fun and switch it off. If you are a hardcore survival game fan, stay away from it, as you will likely be terribly disappointed.			"

												After 30 hours I am finally on my way to world 2.  Do not let the cute graphics fool you, this is a very challenging game. The more I play the more I want to beat it. If you like crafting, building, fighting, unlocking, gathering, and exploring you will probably love this one. It has an incredible amount of unlocks for you and your dwarves.			"

Early Access Review
								I just broke 100 hours this weekend with this game, so figured it was time for a review. I've been on Steam for years now, and this is the first review I've ever written here. While I've enjoyed other games as much, or more than this one, what made me want to write a review, is how ""quiet"" this game has been. For being so immensely fun, I had never heard of it, quite the sleeper, even more so than Terraria was.I'm a big fan of Minecraft, Terraria, Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, and Don't Starve. This title is definitely as good as those, combining elements of all of them but still delivering a unique gameplay experience. The graphics are superb for what I've come to expect from this genre, and add a lot of character to the game. If it didn't have the ""Early Access"" label I wouldn't have known it was.Do not let the ""Early Access"" label stop you from trying this if you've had bad experiences with them before, so have I (Towns, Castle Story.)  This is not like those and will definitely deliver. The fact that the developers consider this early access makes me really excited to see what else they have in mind for the game, and it gets updated quite frequently.My biggest gripe with the game is the lack of a job priority system like other village management games have, and it can really frustrating here. As of the writing of this review, I frequently have to de-construct/re-construct crafting stations to get my dwarves to craft at all, and their highest priority seems to be hauling right now. Great. -.-I've gotten used to the system now, but it has numerous quirks the player will have to learn and get used to. I could definitely see less patient or experienced gamers quickly getting frustrated with their dwarves and some of the glitchy behavior. That aside, unlike almost every title I mentioned above, the game comes with a built-in tutorial and task-based system to guide you through the game. I really liked this and thought it was really well done. For those who don't like to have their hand held or just want more freedom, there is a custom sandbox style mode that has a few settings to play around with. TL, DR: Great ""Early Access"" game that doesn't play like ""Early Access"" at all! If you enjoy Minecraft, Terraria, Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, Don't Starve or any other game like this, add this title to your collection!			"

												Nope. Not a fan. Looks good from the outset but it's really poorly designed. The biggest and most pervasive issue is it takes way too long to get anything done. I put in at least 15 hours to complete the first world and almost all of that was waiting around while making decisions of very little value.The Dwarf AI is really terrible. Their prioritisation is all over the place. You'll have a dwarf with 90% mining skill and your best pick cutting trees while your brand new dwarf with no skills and no gear will be haplessly hacking away at the toughest rock in the game.  Your cook won't cook. You'll set a job to kill a chicken and find every dwarf you have chasing it around the map. Possibly worst of all - your dwarves regularly refuse to pick up after themselves, rendering all the work you (finally) got them to do moot. What's the point of chopping down trees to collect wood if they never bring the damn wood back to the storehouse? This last complaint is mitigated somewhat by the spells you receive later in the game but they are neither a solution and they invoke the game's fairly terrible magic system (but I won't get into that).The tech tree is really awful. It's mostly linear - if you recognise a tech further down the tree you need you generally have to unlock everything that comes before it, regardless of that tech's use to your or relation to the tech you want. Perhaps this is somewhat permissable as a way of gating your progression through the game, fine (though its a terrible one). But when the tech tree is 50% useless decorative elements it's just infruriating. Decorative stuff does have some use in the game (though its effectiveness is extremely unclear) but generally you'll be forced to produce far more than you'll even have the room to use, let alone the desire. In a game where it can be hugely frustrating to produce the items you  DO need - like a sharper axe - it's just insane to have to sit through the AI's nonsense and the giant travel times to produce items that have both no use and have been forced on you by lazy developers.To add to the nonsense and the endless walking-in-molasses feeling of playing this game, the items that are most useful - extra stockpiles, minecarts and elevators - are all at the very end of the tech tree. After spending the whole game managing dwarf travel times with the portal system (again, utilising the terrible magic system), actually reliable and interesting transport solutions show up at the point in time I didn't need them anymore - I could have just finished the game at the point I was at and was simply closing out the tech tree.There's heaps of other issues I could get into (holy crap the 'Minecraft inspired' craft system is awful) but I'd be here all day.I do not recommend this game.

												This game showed a lot of promise when it was first released. Now, only four levels have been created , it still has annoying errors and they are trying to get customers to pay for extra things that should just be part of the main game, like female characters. Also, once you have done the first level it starts to get boring because the next 3 levels have little difference. It's just the main graphics that change really, but the items collected from the gathered blocks are the same graphics.			"

												I've played Craft The World twice, in two sittings, the two of them equal the playtime you see with this review.What the hell was I doing? Why is this review negative?I got roped in, I got sucker-punched with the all too psychologically powerful allure of mobile-game design.I understand that phrase is considered an ill one in the gaming community, it smacks of tedium, tasks drawn out to the most painful extent possible, and constant, tiny, new goals that move you a modicum forward for dozens of minutes of effort.That's really what it is. I mean, what's here is done fairly well. Your dwarves are automated little cretins with terrible AI who go out, collect resources that you assign them to collect, build what you want them to build, and come back to sleep in their shelter when their health is low, or eat food after they've exerted themselves and built up some of them good old munchies. The game works, it's relatively bug free (I had one crash, and sometimes dwarves get stuck trying to get out of water, that's about it), the mechanics are fluid, and the game is generally competent. Whoopee.At first it's impossibly addictive. This game is deceptively simple, and what I mean by that is that there's a great illusion here of this game having a lot to it at first, you look at the fairly large tech tree, the needs and behaviors of your dwarves, the monster waves with the promise of ""tower defense"" style strategy, and mechanics like farms and being able to husband animals in them.It's fairly cool at first look, but everything here is surface level. There's very little automation of tasks, you can't instruct your dwarves to automatically sheer sheep, or plant, harvest, and replant wheat, or automatically build and rebuild structures. I'm kind of stretching here, but with games of this type, I expect a certain amount of ease of use features to make it more fluid to play, but like I said, this is a mobile-style game, meaning they WANT you to perform as many actions as possible to drag out the playtime.That basically means doing every little simple thing takes a very large amount of button presses, if you want to craft something, you first have to manually arrange the recipe yourself, then craft it, then drag it to a hot bar, then place it, then wait for your dwarves to put it down, after they've dropped it off at the stockpile, then picked it up, and finally gotten on their way.It's that kind of maddening tedium that somehow becomes addictive for a brief period of time, and in my tiredness and desire for something completely mindless to distract me it did its job, but when I finally finished the first level, I felt a profound sense of disappointment and a total lack of feeling of accomplishment when the endgame portal appeared with a ludicrous green ""EXIT"" sign above it.There's not much to get out of this game, moment to moment it will suck the minutes away from you as you fiddle away with its time wasting mechanics, but the game isn't difficult, it doesn't require much thought, the combat is mindless and so is defending yourself against the hordes of enemies that appear. I felt tired after playing this game (yes I know I spent an insane amount of time in single sittings on it).Honestly I really don't know what was going through my head, it must have been my profoundly apathetic mood at the time, but somehow I slogged through this game twice a year apart.I'm still completely confounded by it. My soul drifts through the aether looking for answers it will never have.I don't recommend this game. If you want to waste your time go play Skyrim or something, or hell, play Dungeon Keeper or Terreria or anything that has an actual sense of accomplishment.			"

												As with so many games, this has potential of being a decent, even good, little game but there is just too much wrong with it to make it an enjoyable experience. 4/10The game is a interesting mix of 2d resource gathering with minion management and crafting. The store mentions Minecraft, Terraria, Dwarf Fortress, and Dungeon Keeper which really means a whole lot of confusion on what the game is acutally trying to acheive. It really is not any of those other games but tries to be all of them at the same time. Spinkle in a host of not-quite-there development issues and you got the jist of Craft the World. To start off I will list the game development issues, a series of problems aside from any of the game mechanics that make the game tedious. The worst two offenders are the poor CPU AI and the poor sloppy controls. The computer AI gets stuck and confused regularly throughout gameplay. Your minions often have to ""reset"" in their pathing or decision making processes. This shows in game when the dwarves will be pathing to a spacific task and will just stop and idle for a minute, then the AI will reset and they will go about a different task that is easier to compute. This makes for some frusterating issues when trying to work in a certain spot either mining or building and the computer AI just doesn't quite understand whats going on, making you have to repeat you commands a few times before it clicks. Combine this with the poor sloppy controls that often make the game perform unintented actions and the AI just gets even more confused. Each click, anywhere, on the screen will initially flag a block to be mined. No matter what that block is. Most commands in the game use just the left-mouse click to do, so this means often you will be trying to build or simply move around the map and suddenly your minions are mining down their own house because you clicked somewhere in that space. Very frusterating process.Even after you get over those two hurdles the game promises some interesting gameplay. The interface and graphics are nice and over-all while the concept isn't really new, it is one that is not done all that often and a genre that I wouldn't mind seeing more of. Unfortuntely, as mentioned above the game really doesn't know what it wants to be and none of the elements really blend together well or are done well enough on their own to warrant a good experience. Some are even thrown into the game, it seems, simply because the dev liked the mechanic in another game and threw it in without any real thought to how it effects this particular game.By this I mean the crafting system, which I think is my most disliked part of the game. The crafting system utilizes a crafting system where resources have to placed in a crafting window via a very specific pattern, similar to Minecraft. There really is no reason for this other than to make the process tedious and annoying. I honestly have no idea why it is setup in this manner other then to claim the game is more like Minecraft. Riding on its coat-tails of success. It is pretty awful and combined with poor UI controls it makes it even worse.The other aspect of the game that I don't quite understand and that only makes the game drag on way logner then it should is a pointless leveling / research system. To progess through the crafting items and to get better equipment, the game requires you to ""level"" through gaining experience. You gain this experience through crafting a set number of items of lower quality to get access to higher quality items. This means you are forced to waste resources crafting pointless items you dont need just so you can get access to the better items in the game. Take into the fact that gathering of resources takes way too long, and the AI issues mentioned earlier and the game feels more like a pay-per-play free moble game then anything else. Forcefully making the game take longer for no reason just to try and get people to buy the powerups. But this is not that type of game, which means, I have no idea why it was developed in this way. So overall, just a game that seems like a poorly mashed together group of ideas with no real thought process or goal that brings those ideas together. Combined with the poor development issues the game is simply frusterating and boring after the first few hours. I really cannot recommend it, even on sale. There are much better options available, like any of the other games mentioned in this review and even some others that are not.			"

												It looks like a simulation, but don't be fooled. It's an obstacle course. You must build six items from group A to build 8 items from group B to build 10 items from group C to finally build something that you actually want. So you have no meaningful choices. You can run the obstacle course efficiently or inefficiently, based on how well you understand the system. And learning the system is fun for a while. But once you've learned that system, you'll play every map in exactly the same way. There's no room for individual taste or trying out different strategies. To win, you must do exactly what the designers intended for you to do.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought the first day it came EA on steam.  Best purchase I have made in a long time.  I play this over CoD:G and Bf4.  Those games were a release disaster... being a ""finished"" product that was not ""finished"".  This game is EA and is more playable/enjoyable than most retail games.  The devs are a refreshing suprise too, constant feedback and replies on the forum.  A patch has been released each day since launch, most are fixes for what the community has reported/suggested.  The community on the forums are helpful and supporting too.  All around, this is too good to pass up for 14.99$.  Join us and support this game, lets make this a great title!Get it!  That is all...

												BEWARE: This is not real co-op or multiplayer. You cannot play the singleplayer game with another person.The ""co-op"" mode basically involves inviting a friend to a mini-quest in a small arena world from your existing singleplayer game to defeat a boss. You cannot save the game in the ""co-op"" mode, but at the end, you can bring back some of the supplies to your singleplayer world.			"

												There are two main things to like in this game, that is research and base building. Your research progresses proportionally to what you build. What a nice idea. You build some useful things - also many useless things - and after a while you reach the next level. New things to build are always fun. The first time, that is.Base building is agreable, the many decorative blocks available allow to personalize your castle, to set up a workshop, to improve morale, but also to fortify against zombie attacks that happen regularly. Which is one of the mechanics the game uses to slow down your progress.The interface is clear, easy to read, even the tutorial is well done, and the cartoony graphics are nicely drawn.Why the negative review then?Because you lead a band of morons.Most of the game is spent exploring and retrieving resources far away from your base. You select a resource and your dwarves should go and fetch it. You even have a magic portal to travel instantly from your fortress to the resource.Instead of seeing your dwarves do their job, you'll watch them stay idle around the totem chatting - you can see the icons over their heads - and laughing their asses off. One, sometimes two, dwarves come to observe what you asked them to do, then decide that there is no path going to the task (what? it's in front of you! collect this damn rock! I opened a portal so you can do your job!!) and think about the best path to stay where they are. Meanwhile the portal timer goes on and the portal closes before they can go back home. This is the moment they decide to walk back.You'll end up digging straight tunnels to different parts of the map, which puzzles the dwarves considerably, as the icon over their head shows. They must think a straight tunnel is too easy, maybe it is a trap, let consider every single other path for the next five minutes.Attacks happen regularly, a clock tells you how much time is left before the next evil portal opens, spitting out each time more dangerous enemies. Not really a bother, your dwarves can take up a fight, because it is still better to fight than go through a portal to collect the resources needed to build a better fortress or better armour.Iron and coal - main resources to build armour and weapons - are limited. Once finished you will not be able to build more weapons. They are not regenerated. The last resources are so far away, and your dwarves so lazy, that it will take ages to dress them all.The game seems unable to manage more than half a dozen dwarves, the others stand there idle, chatting and eating and laughing at their own jokes. All things considered, this game became tedious before the first planet was even finished. I don't like watching these dwarves idle whatever I do to make them move. I don't like being forced to send the dwarves at the very end of a map to collect three miserable pieces of iron ore, because there is no ore elsewhere. I don't like seeing them thinking about a path for MINUTES (real minutes of sixty seconds). If you ever click on the wrong block, then click on the good block you wanted to dig, the ♥♥♥♥ing dwarf that was just there ready to dig the block stops, thinks for a minute, then wanders away, all the while other four to six dwarves are doing nothing in the middle of your base.The same thing happens during an attack : dwarves with limited life which are ordered to go to sleep don't know where to go (go to bed dummy, this is the order I've given you), they stay there and can eventually be killed, because they can't move.Settlers 3 (1998) had a better characters management than this game, and far more settlers to deal with. You had things to watch, because of the great number of units the game moved, some of them where lost, certainly, but they were so many you could play with the others. Contrary to this game, where the extremely limited number of dwarves means you can identify each one of them, and see that they mostly spend their time doing nothing.So, depending on your ability to resist frustration, this can become a very long and tedious game of watching lazy dwarves chatting.Oh, and do not believe reviews of people that haven't reached and played with at least 12 dwarves. As a matter of facts, the game doesn't allow more than 20 dwarves - sign the AI is not able to compute for ""so many"" dwarves.			"

Early Access Review
								I am going to add a weak ""not recommended"" review, though I should be clear that that applies to the game's current state -- there is a ton of potential here, but due to some questionable design decisions I don't know if that potential will ever be realized. For reference, some of my favorite games are Gnomoria and Dwarf Fortress, though I did enjoy Terraria a lot.First the good:* Cute art and adorable dwarves.* Detailed and interesting world design, though with very limited ecology.* Deep and varied tech tree.* Solid-seeming tech foundation for a builder/sim game.* Ant farm full of dwarves!The bad:* Terrible user interface:  * tons of superfluous click-and-drag for crafting -- it gives you the recipe but you still have to click and drag into a grid. Maybe for the first time but subsequently producing an item should be easy. Few games make me long for DF's UI.  * generally lacking polish -- highlighting items won't tell you what they are, meaning you spend time guessing what an icon/sprite means. You cannot speedup time and the game proceeds at a glacial pace, a 2/4/8x bar would be nice, especially in early game.* obnoxious leveling system -- this is by far the worst part of the game. You don't tech up by building structures, doing research, etc, nor is the entire tech tree available ala Banished -- you tech up in two ways. By crafting 10 ladders you don't need so you can make torches, etc, and by ""unlocking"" recipes that are ""locked"" by earning XP -- yes, a builder game with XP grinding, like some casual Facebook game. this mechanic might be able to be kept in if improved, but as it stands it just makes the early game a boring, frustrating clickfest. And the game pauses while crafting, which compounds the already slow speed.I know these sound like minor complaints, but taken together they really ruin what could be an enjoyable experience. This game has solid technical design and ideas, but I'm not sure where the authors are going with it; the concerns I mention raise alarm bells, for me at least.I still got some enjoyment out of the game (not done playing yet), and it might be worth picking up on sale, but I really can't advise paying $15 in the current state. Maybe once the dev gets further along or the price drops.			"

												STOP! YOU THERE! Did you like Dwarf Fortress? Did you like Dungeon Keeper?Then give CtW a chance even if it may not look like it could be interesting to you!I've playing since release, and knew this cute little bugger will make it to release and now it finally did!And it just got better :-)What it's all about?You control the world like you do in Dungeon keeper. You say dig here, build there, gather this, kill these. And the dwarfs will decide when to do what. Your job is to... keep them alive (craft good and diverse food, watch what you'll attack and so on) upgrade their weapons and armory give them jobs (they level in up to 3 specialisations each like fighter, miller, smith, archer etc.) loot ruins & discover secrets find rare ores build a nice shelter to increase the comfort so everyone is happy and can chill in their luxury bed craft things to be able to craft other things with these things that finally let you craft this one thing to...do...thingsOne example:Need fish for a recipe but there is none? Build a pool with a bridge, gather snow, craft ice, put ice on bridge, watch ice melt, water drops into pool. Rinse, repeat until fish consider your pool frigging awesome and move in. NOW GO FISHING!If things get complicated you could, like in Dungeon Keeper, control one dwarf and do it yourself!So what are the positive aspects? Addictive gameplay In 3 playthroughs (which will take quite a while) i have not discovered a single bug or crash. Looks more done like many major AAA-titles that call themselves ""finals"" The dwarf-AI is considerably clever. They pretty much always do what you want WHEN you want them to. E.g. they're busy crafting 100 ores and you want ONE weapon NOW? They will probably make that ONE weapon and continue back to their original task. Somethings laying around somewhere? They'll get it as soon as time permits and so on. 3 different worlds. Well ok, differences are marginal and mainly only visible on the surface but at least it gives some replayability-value Music and sound effects are pretty fitting and not annoying even after hours Regular updates, the dev seems very commited. While being in EA that is.But there are negative aspects too: The UI could really be optimized in some aspects (like said in most negative reviews). Crafting can become a pretty frustrating finger-click-party Even though the AI is pretty cool, some things suck like building narrow trenches where they start at the beginning not the end and can't continue. You either have to do one block after another or control a dwarf and do it yourself Sandbox-mode can get pretty frustrating if you're needing one special recipe but EVERYTHING ELSE drops first and you're stuck doing nothing (recipes drop randomly while diggin instead of a tech-tree) Most people find the tech-tree stupid. Although it can sometimes be very stupid (craft 10 of this one thing you don't need but would need the resources, just to be able to craft the next tier) it still makes sense and gives a sense of progression and a target to work for. Some people seem to have problems with the AI. Well, *I* never had any and i played through 3 or 4 times yet. Nearing the end of a map, resources can become scarce as they don't respawn/regrow. So if you need ONE stupid Gold-ore to reach the end and you've wasted all gold for cute gold-fishes (bad pun!) and gold-doors and goold-spoons and goldened silver and gold...you get the point? :-)tl;dr:Considering the cheap price, this game is a keeper! It's also now one of the shining examples of Early Access.I *LOVE* Dungeon Keeper and played it a thousand times and this cute fellow comes pretty close (gameplay wise not visually). Although it's still quite different (instead of War For The Overworld) it's more than enough to keep you hooked.More depth? Try Gnomoria!More casual but still quite complex? Buy this one!			"

Early Access Review
								I've played DF, Towns, Gnomoria, AGoD, and other more or less failed attempts at making a Dwarf Fortress for the common man. Craft the World is the first successful attempt at making a playable, entertaining, and aesthetically pleasing version of Dwarf Fortress. It has a somewhat less ambitious scale but that is perfect in that it makes the game accessible and opens up this style of game to a much larger audience of gamers.A lot of people have misconceptions about this game and seem to be comparing it to Terraria or Starbound which is really a faulty comparison. This game is nothing like those. This is more like a strategy/simulation game in which you manage your resources and utilize your dwarf's time wisely. The graphics and music for Craft the World are top notch. The big sprites change appearance to reflect the armor/weapons you give them. The luch color palette is easy on the eyes and makes identifying different types of material easy. For an Early Access game this is in amazing shape. No crashes for me in 20 hours of play and very few bugs. The balance feels good and really it seems the only thing the game needs before going gold is more content (which they are working on, we should have another world soon). If you are on the fence about this game I encourage you to give it a shot. If you are fascinated by the Dwarf Fortress style of game but are daunted by DF itself and found the other DF mass market attempts wanting as I did then have no fear this is not another Towns.This game was one of my big surprises of the year and I believe before all is said and done I'll be putting 100+ hours into it once all of the difficulty levels are implemented.

												Do not buy for Multiplayer. The Multi player setup really sucks. We played for an hour last night trying to get to the point to be able to play together.......No bueno, almost there. Then looked up Gameplay trailers for multiplayer....you aren't even working WITH your buddy, you are on the Opposite side of the map. Yes, you both have to kill the monster in the middle, but by the time you get to him, you've already unlocked and geared and dont need your buddy.  Fun game, Bad multiplayer attempt.Edit - 30 hours later:  We've played all 4 maps. I can send resources to my friend and open up expensive portals to help him out, but that's the extent of it. By the time we get to each other we do in fact have enough gear to complete the level. I still do not recommend this game for multiplayer but for single it's pretty fun.  If  there was a Thumbs sideways option, this game would get it.			"

												This game is fun for some time. The idea behind it is certainly nice: you are building, exploring, and nursing your gnomes. Until you notice how bad the AI is.It is atrocious.Your smith takes a break after every smelted ingot and goes to the other end of a castle for a little chat? That's normal.You mark the ore deposit and some random gnome starts to pick it with the basic tool while your master-miner chills out nearby? That's normal. Your gnome picks the armor piece you just crafted and goes with it through half the map to pick a ball of dirt? That's normal. You click on a snail and gnomes all over the map drop everything to charge for an attack? You see a gnome who picks one piece of ore but not the other because the other is assigned to some other gnome who is currently on the other end of the map? You order the ladder to be build and the gnomes do it by bringing one piece of ladder at a time althoug they can carry 5? This is all very normal.So in the end you have no control over your gnomes. Bunch of them are going through the map looking busy, but you never know who is actually doing what, and when anything will be done. By this point the game stops being fun, and becames frustrating.

								A rather strange, side-scrolling crafting and survival game. I can't quite place my finger on what I like about it, but it is fun. You are limited in what you can make, and many of the things you can make, can be found in underground rooms if you are willing to dig down and explore, but figuring out ways of surviving the waves of enemies who come every 40 or so in game minutes, is fun when you get into the higher levels. If you are looking for a game that lets you sandbox, this isn't for you. On the other hand if you don't mind that and want to have fun trying to survive, maybe you will enjoy it.			"

YouTube™ Video: Craft the World | E18 | Basic Alchemy and Imps! 

			Views: 45,922		

			Let's play Craft the World! In this episode, our dwarves make a basic alchemy lab, brew up some potions, and summon Imps! Please leave a LIKE if you enjoyed the video!		

This video pick might seem strange since it's episode 18, however I felt that it would give you a good idea of what the game is like. If you enjoy exploring a new game for yourself, then you perhaps don't want to watch it!GeneralI bought Craft the World about a year ago during Early Access. This game has been a good experience for me. Although there was a bit of a rollercoaster when it's OS requirements got changed from a minimum of Snow Leopard to Lion. A few of us objected to the basic OS requirements being changed because it meant we could no longer play the game, and the dev did change it back. I was very appreciative that he listened to us and was able to stick to the original game requirements.However, you want to know whether the game is fun, not how honourable the devs might be. It's very fun, although sometimes I question why it is because it can get quite monotonous and I begin asking myself what the point is. And yet I keep playing.GameplayYou control a bunch of dwarves. As you gain exp you gain levels, and with each new level you get another dwarf. Don't panic if a dwarf dies, because after a few minutes (you'll see the timer) he will respawn. You get your dwarves to execute two major actions - dig, and build. They will also gather materials that are on the ground by themselves. It may not sound like much, but now consider the zombie hordes that will spawn as the game progresses. You need to build strong walls and a good defence against them. The ultimate goal of each level is to complete five portal pieces to rebuild the portal and move onto the next world. If you're the sort that likes building games though, you will definitely get distracted along the way as you experiment with building a fortress for your dwarves.ControlsAlthough you can control everything with the mouse alone, it makes life easier to use the keyboard. WASD lets you pan around, and there are various hotkeys for selecting dwarves and telling them to go eat or sleep. StorylineThere isn't really much of one. I'm not sure why I'm controlling these dwarves and sending them through portals. I have no idea why there are dragons. I haven't even grasped why the zombie hordes are attacking me. But considering how many hours of my life I've already had consumed by this game, I guess I don't really care too much either!SoundIt can get a little monotonous, but on the other hand I find the music is quite addicting. I'll find it starts playing in my head when I feel like coming back to Craft the World for another session. The music is informative, telling you whether or not you're under attack, or whether it is night time. Otherwise, there isn't anything phenomenal here, the sound supports the game.GraphicsAn interesting art style that I quite enjoy. The inventory and crafting screens are a bit clunky in their design and functionality, but they get the job done. I enjoy the bright colours and the various monsters. The trees are quite fun to watch grow and get chopped down. An important tip for players concerned with aesthetics - for things like paintings you can right click a painting with a painting and it will change the image that is being displayed.Pros+ addictive and fun to explore the world and build a fort+ digging+ building+ hotkeys+ zombie hordes to destroyCons- bit of a clunky UI- not sure why I'm playing it- dwarves are stupid, and with time they get even dumber (dwarf AI needs work)Help Me Help YouIf you did not find this review helpful, I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn’t helpful for you.

Early Access Review
								This is a fun little, casual, game. Won't satisfy any hardcore gamers' gaming appitite. However, it is a great game to pick up and play for those casual moments.This game is a lot like Terraria meets Dwarves. A bit of a mix and match genre. You have your 'craft the world' genre, allowing you to build anything your imagination allows you to. Combat system for stratagies. Tower defense. Exploration and minning (reminds me of Miner Miner). Instead of playing the whole game as you control the player, you are more the overlord telling your minions what you want done and when.I was dissapointed by the fact this game feels very much like any game you play on a smartphone or tablet (pretty sure it was designed for tablets). It takes too much to click and access certain items. I really think the crafting system needs an overhaul just to be easier to use. If not an overhaul maybe: 'one-click reciepes' instead of constantly having to add the items to the reciepe box. 'Auto craft' items like food, where the dwarfs will automatically craft food and/or fill the table.I would love to see more customizablity to the game, such as making your own dwarves. Assigning jobs or duties. Being able to sell stuff to the shop. I would also love to see more item options in the crafting menu and tech tree!! What this game REALLY needs is more tower defense items to help against the attacking hordes. More traps.If they can step away from generic tablet app design and more cross platform full feature game design, this game has a lot of potential.(sorry for any misspelling)			"

												I absolutely love this game. Been playing it on and off for a fair amount now, maybe a year in total. It's a bit like Sims, you'll go out marathoning it, then maybe put it down for 3 months, but then you find another update and you're right back into it. Though I think this is the longest I've been playing it because of the new Biomes feature. Skip off to another world with/out friends; destroy and strip mine the place- come back and you've got a bounty of goods waiting for you to start your crafting all over. I've built libraries, castles, bridges and countless other things. With the new updates it all gets better. I love this game and honestly have spent WAY longer than I probably should on it hahaha. The time you see there is literally a 6th of my actual game time because I started on my mate's account, loved it so much I bought it myself.			"

												Its Terraria except you issue orders to a small group of dwarves rather than directly controlling a single character. Combat involves just marking targets and watching your dwarves do the work. You can directly control a dwarf but I only found myself doing this in specific building situations where the AI was inefficient.Pros:- Fun and fairly simple building sim with just the right amount of recipes and crafting materials.- Randomly generated worlds with lots of things to discover underground.- Great way to lose track of time.Cons:- Dumb AI, often getting themselves killed- Earning all of the recipes takes longer than I would like- The invasions (large swarms of enemies) come too often- There are only a few options for defending your baseThis game is a fun little time sink that doesn't make you think too hard.

												Ultimately I feel like this game isn't actually finished. It still feels like early access to me. So the fact that they have been working on ios and are now supporting two platforms for the game is a bit annoying.The biggest reasons why the game still feels like it's in early access/ beta are:- The Dwarf AI is still pretty bad. I find myself frustrated by it more often than not- The AI still feels clunky and not very friendly- Lack of control over dwarfs. Seemingly not enough buttons or commands to do some mass orders- Lack of ability to just tell a specific dwarf to go somewhere. Instead I need to manually move him there- Pacing of the game just feels off. Most people seem to be finishing the first level in around 9-11 hours- Game feels too easy but is just a tedius waiting game most of the time. The difficultly is in staying focused for so long to play a level- Tech tree still feels like it needs work to be more fluidTo address some of the comments: If what all of you said is true then they would have addressed the issues more before releasing and before deciding to divert attention to an iOS version.

I've played a jumbo jets worth of Craft The World now and its gotten me through some really tough times where I just needed to 'get lost in a game' until my illness got a bit more bareable.

												Very nice combination of Terraria and Lemmings. I definitely recommend, it's very casual, relaxing and enjoyable game with nice graphics, sounds and music.Cons:- AI need some work, the way how AI select which dwarf do what is crappy, very annoying thing is to order dwarves to attack enemy, seems AI just remember the destination and until dwarves reach it, they ignore anything (aka other enemies on the way, or even that enemy if he moves, dwarves just keep running ><);- Some things are not easy to discover and they definitely needs to be in tutorial with a good explanation: deconstructing, farm + trap, comfort level, professions...- AI basic control of dwarves is not the best one, it would be much better to select dwarf and give him an order (or even set of orders), portal spell is a good way to set priority (because dwarves always choose the job close to stock and portal ""move"" that point to stock in reachability).- Some predefinition are wrong or missing clear hints: level at which tree grows, at which snow falls, at which anything grows in cave. Digging one tile lower and suggenly you have no more resource (as wood or grown food) to replenish. E.g. different earth color placed by player could indicate that.- Grow rate is broken and annoying: tree may keep instantly grow at place where previous one was chopped, preventing that peace from digging, there must be a delay at given tile after removing resource from it, will it be a tree, bush, mushroom, crystal, etc.- Teleport spell should cost 1 mana and last longer, this is the only right way in the game to travel. On large map it become very annoying to move dwarves back/forth (it take too long to travel), elevator is bugged, train is not reliable and required investments (inculuding time), which not worth it.- Even after finishing game I have NO CLUE how many resources can one dwarf pick up or what 100 archery does. Tooltip and ingame help is way too casual.- Balance issue (archery is the only way to go, melee makes health management more intense, while magic is simply not reliable), swarms of enemies required escaping until tesla tech, then BAM, they are not a problem anymore at all suddenly and further gameplay become less intense (and more boring).Pros:- It's simply beauteful game with variaty of activities.- Company, while consists from only 4 maps is in fact quite a long journey: every map is different, brings something new and each map took for me 30+ hours (!) to finish.

The game has been out for years and yet it's very obvious mistakes are still not fixed, addtionally a DLC was released which on the one hand features new content, but on the other hand it contains basic things, which should be included in the game anyway (we all know that kind of DLC).About the game: You order your pack of dwarfes to do various and all kinds of quests, gathering and processing resources mostly. The processing becomes more advanced throughout the game, just as the fighting. The graphics are sweet, the music alright and theme specific. There are different biomes and there is much to explore, although it's kind of all the same, after a while (unlike Terraria). Now the bugs/annoying things:Dwarfes sometimes won't do anything, instead of carrying out pending tasks, which is really annoying.Dwarfes fail to find a way back, even if there is no obstacle hindering them (e.g. a portal is above them, on a block and they won't climb upwards in order to reach it).Dwarfes cannot attack certain foes 1v1, if the enemy is one block above -> the knock back will cancel their attack, thus a Yeti can kill a dwaf with end game armor/weapons.Sometimes Dwarfs stay in/enter a fight with low health, which results in quick death.Not bugs, but just annoying parts of the game:The crafting system: Where to start? You have to follow the technology tree and in order to build the better stuff, you have to go through a lot of redundant bad stuff, every single time you enter a new world. You always have to build a lot of furniture/vanity items, which drains your resources and you don't need that many, not - at - all. You end up with a lot of items, which you have no use for, never had.Furthermore you have to drag and drop the crafting recipes every single time you are on a new map: Once you crafted the item, the pattern is safed, but if you enter a new map, you have to do it all over again.Dwarfes have perks, like miner, cook, fisherman etc. which allows them to fulfill certain tasks faster! But when there are any number of tasks queued, dwarfes fulfil them randomly and then the fisherman ends up mining, while the miner ends up fishing -> the perk system, a core feature of the game = uselessYou cannot prioritize certain tasks, which makes it hard to keep all dwarfes busy, while at the same time have the important tasks done!Often Dwarfes won't pick up goods/resources and instead they will do -> 'nothing' again!(TL,DR)In conclusion I have to say that the game is definitly not worth 20€, though you may buy it if it's on discount. It is playable, but not for too long, it gets repetitive and the bugs will become very apparent and annoying.Highly addictive at first, but that wears off, after a while. Great for Terraria-players!			"

												The Ugly:  UI is extremely clunky where you have to manually drag and drop items to craft objectsThe Bad:  If you're not ready for the long haul, games and progression will take a long time to complete (40 hours on one area) This could be a plus if you're looking for something to really pass the time with. The Good:  Pretty fun and addicting if you are able to look past the 2 above.

								What happens when you cross an RPG, an RTS, Lemmings and Terraria? Fun! That's what happens.Craft the World has you controlling a group of Dwarves, a group that will grow over time. You begin by researching a tech tree and building a home. After that you can keep expanding on the home while exploring the world for valuable resources and treasure. Each dwarf has an inventory where you can place items such as armor, weapons and tools. Each item can be crafted with upgrades available as you progress the tech tree and more resources become available. Each dwarf also has a set of skills which can also be increased by finding skill books throughout the world.While you build, research, craft and explore, the game will send periodic waves of assaults on your new Dwarven home. Each wave is advertised with a countdown timer so you have time to build defenses, set traps and prepare.All in all, Craft the World is a completely unique and thoroughly enjoyable experience. Recommended without hesitation.			"

												Though not a Game of the Year by any means, Craft the World is a fun game that will keep you entertained in short bursts.  It can be best described as Terraria if it were an RTS where you were in charge of a tribe of dwarves instead of just your hero and, of course, there was significantly less content to discover.Your tasks in the game include gathering resources, feeding and caring for your dwarves, researching technologies, building defensive structures, and digging deeper and deeper.  Each and every dwarf is an individual with skills that can be learned and improved and equipment that can be upgraded as you develop the technology and acquire the neccessary resources t ocraft it.  Though it was exciting to acquire new technology, it was often tedious working through the previous tech to fill your research bar as you are required to craft the same three or four items many, many times.Though it is enjoyable and I believe that it is worth it at a sale price under $10, the game does grow old rather quickly and, if you're anything like me, you'll find yourself burning out toward the end of the first of five worlds.  I recommend this for fans of resource gathering and building games (Terraria/Minecraft), though, as stated earlier, it is more of an RTS as you are in charge of several dwarves at a time.			"

												Craft The World is an amazing game. It's challenging, it has depth, and allows the player to just dig in, have fun, and design their little world pretty much how they want it. I've logged 100+ hours already. My only gripe is that in spite of the best efforts of the developers, the little dwaves are frustratingly stupid. However, since the devs are aware of that fact (likely, painfully so), it's something that is very easily overlooked.			"

												Edit: Reviewed for Multiplayer Below.If you love giving orders to minions, watching them build a shelter and defend themselves, and then proceed to build an industry to survive in an unkind world you'll love this game. In all honesty, one of the very few early access games I would rate highly. Its fantastic at what it does, and it gets regular touch ups to fix bugs (at this point). I've played since it was a much earlier beta, and I can safely say the game has definitely improved over time (except maybe the font, which used to be much simpler and more elegant). The developers have also recently added multiplayer to the game, and I'm going to be blunt: its not great. Not to say its not fun, its more like its rather... unusual. Coop is fun especially if you get to spend it with friends. Versues is ... uh... rubbish? It would be fun if it wasn't so mind breakingly boring to watch I guess. Its odd, building up to fight is fun and strategic, actually fighting is a cross between trench warfare patience and looney toons violence. Its not ideal. PVP isn't really worth mentioning to be honest. I just pretend it doesn't exist. Personally would rate 8/10. Its not action packed, but for a lazy building game its ideal. Great singleplayer game, passable multiplayer game (its about average, lets be fair). Would easily bump up with the inclusion of slightly more content (for example: pets/farm animals, real risk attacks, prayer system [to get additional mana, by sending dwarves to pray], higher difficulty, more items, etc.).------------------------Edit: Would honestly rate it closer to 7 out of 10 right now. As the game has developed theres been a few things which have stood out to me as existing problems. These are as follows:1) The largest flaw the tech tree. It is extremely grindy. You essentially are forced to produce garbage that you wouldn't want or need normally, and produce a lot of it. Should be an unlock system where you produce 2 or 3 of the items in that block and it unlocks the next tier. Now not to hammer this point home too hard, but this turns what otherwise would be a fantastic building and survival game into basically a furious grind at time. You grind for resources to proceed through the tech tree. You produce mountains of things you don't want or care about. That is the reality of the tech tree in Craft the World.2) Dwarf AI is better, but still leaves something to desire. This is sorta a nuetral point honestly, I dial up the speed to 2x so I don't have to deal with it normally, and when I do its easy to control one and do it myself. Recently, the focus has been to fix it, and its gotten much better. 3) This might just be me, but the store really needs to be focused on more. Would be nice to have an ability to turn 10 mana into one gold just to get some money to replenish unobtainable materials. Lot of maps where I just simply ran out of coal for cooking or had to resort to waiting on minion waves to get money to buy basic metals because I couldn't find any. For example, the elevator requires a wheel, a bit of gold, and some other things I can't be bothered to remember. And its basically a must buy - no question about it. Building 10 of them though gets to be expensive on rare resources.			"

Early Access Review
								This game deserves to be looked at. Made by a russian developer, this game doesn't fall short.Pro:+ updates, Updates, UPDATES! This developer stands for early access, this game never laggs behind and delivers new content on a very common basis.+ Gameplay: this game is morelike, you give orders, and somedwarf will do it. If you dig for this ""indirect commanding"" this is your thing... if not... take controll of the dwarf and do it yourself.+ Progression: there are many things to achieve, enough to build and enough to kill.+ ""Settler-effect"": you can see those little dwarfs running around your monitor, and watch them doing the housework.Neutral:* Grafics: it's a matter of taste, if you love this tableski style of game, alright, if you want battlefield-4-grafic's engine... well, tough luck* Progression: You can't craft everything ""right away"" you need to, build enough of the previous items in the ""itemlist""... it's not for everyone's taste.* Sound: also matter of taste, I switched off both right away (snoring dwarfs... snoring dwarfs everywhere)Negative:- routing and object-retrieving: it's still not very polished, right now. Still some issues with the ""item-grabbing"" from far away. You can't tell a dwarf to ""pick something"" up.... he has to do it himself.- no defined jobs: While now dwarfs have skills, it's still not save to give a attack order, and believing, just melee dwarfs (or archers), will get to it. No, gueriilia-style. You can loose your best miner/workshoper, when he fails to retrait. - skills are only gained, if they know the basics. They CAN use the item (cooking-base, while no cook is around), but won't gain any skills; while a cook would get some. New skills can only be unlocked with books. There are pretty rare.Overall: Solid game, worth the money and effort. If you are not sure, wait for the next sale to come up. I recomment it fully!			"

Early Access Review
								If you want a short summary, this game isn't anything special, but it IS fun and worthwhile if you're willing to be patient. The main problem is it's relatively slow-paced and all its flaws make it SLOWER.  If you like games like Banished, this might be up your alley.  If you're looking for something where you can get a fully functional base up and running in an hour or two, pass this one up.The good:-The art style and graphics.  You can tell a lot of love and care went into making this both look and sound cute and pretty.-The overall idea.  It really does combine a lot of what made Dungeon Keeper and Terraria good.  A healthy amount of variety in what you can build and encounter, enough differences in the maps to make different environments stick out, etc. The bad:-The AI... has character.  Dwarves are prone to hesitating, double-taking and getting confused on occasion.  It's not nearly bad enough to ruin a game but don't be surprised if one or two of them die simply because they backed into a corner, then just stood there taking a beating.-The dwarves have to actually pick up items and carry them back to your stockpile after harvesting, mining, etc.  They can only carry 3-5 at a time depending on how you equip them.  This isn't a big deal at the beginning of a level, but the further away they need to go the longer it takes.  They walk at a leisurely pace, and while there IS a teleport spell to make things easier, it isn't perfect, and it costs mana, which also regenerates slowly.-The difficulty curve.  It's a halfpipe.  The vast majority of the enemies, while plenty dangerous in the very beginning, can be dispatched by a determined horde with leather armor and maces with relative ease.  What passes for 'mid tier' enemies are generally only found in the most dangerous places on a map, and the one legit endgame monster species can send even the best-prepared army running for their beds, battered and bruised.The downright ugly:-The tech tree.  In the campaign mode, you advance through the tiers and learn new recipes by crafting a set amount of components, tools, etc. in a particular category.  Sometimes it's intuitive, you need to forge iron weapons to get the knowhow for steel.  More often, and especially in the mid-late game, it's ridiculously arbitrary.  For instance, you'll have to make precious vases in order to make stone sculptures to build battlements to weave yarn to build couches to FINALLY get that shiny silver sword you've been eyeballing.  And all that decorative crap you just made?  Well, if you weren't planning on using any of it, you've just spent a ton of resources and hours of time making things that are just gonna sit in your stockpile.  Because of this, worlds that should realstically take 5 or 6 hours to complete take like 10.So would I recommend it?  Well... yes, if you've a lot of free time on your hands and a lot of patience.  I got this half-off, and frankly 8 bucks, even for a deeply flawed gem, ain't bad.			"

Warning: The following was written during Update 0.9.006. [Prior to 12/1/2013]0.9.007 Introduced key updates which show improvement and updates, including a sandbox mode.----Warning: The following was composed while the game was released in Alpha 0.1.0. IntroductionCraft The World, the beta has a great deal of potential; it highly depends how the development of the beta goes to see if I would recommend this game when its finished.There are many features of this game which are interesting; it is just that the methodologies of the features are really monotonous. GraphicsYou’ll notice that most of the games graphics look highly polished in a nice 2Dish format.InterfaceThe interface is highly cumbersome, there is only one direct toolbar to utilize things, place things, and cast spells. Otherwise you are working with a really cumbersome menu system to either equip, craft things, view objectives. With all honestly at the current stages of development it feels like much more time was spent on giving it a glossy look rather then utility of the interface; like this game was made for a tablet, or a touch device. My opinion is it that is lacks greatly in the interface and should utilize an in-game expendable interface, expand the quick slots and expend the use of shortcut keys. This happens to be one of my current gripes with the game, same with the Dwarves AI, Crafting and Materials. Sounds / MusicSound can start to be annoying after a while, which is fine. Music has a problem where it just stops playing until you either exit and resume the game or exit completely and start it again.CraftingAdvancing you have to follow these blueprint tree layouts, which means you have to build useless things a good amount of the time to advance. Within this case it would benefited from a type of freeform of crafting or trees which actually make sense. One of the examples of this is, early game you can gain access to materials for better weapons and armor. However you are unable to actually build them until you craft the other things to build them; which are completely unrelated. It should be noted that many resources are highly used however are rare or hard to get too. Which makes the early stages of the game completely unbalanced, which will be noted below.DwarvesGenerally the Dwarves have their own ideas about things, this concept is generally alright; worst part is the AIs decision making process; it is extremely hard to affect until later in the game. Currently the AI likes to run off and basically die on whims, until you are able to advance up the crafting tree; however that make take 30+ minutes to actually have the Dwarves somewhat manageable. The first 30 minutes or more of the game you should expect to lose Dwarves a good amount since you will not be able to properly equip them, or deal with the feeding system. Path finding for the Dwarves can be problematic also; the portal spell they tend to ignore. You are also able to take control of a dwarf however that does not do you much good and the interface seems to be rather ‘make shift’, at an attempt to fix their path finding from being broken.Also feeding them, you’ll find the AI will refuse to eat the same things over again; this becomes a problem since you have limited resources and must advance up the crafting tree.HousingThe housing system is interesting with the comfort concept, however it is far to easy to create problems with it, or the totems all and all stop function until the game is restarted. For the most part of the game, you will just have a wood house and walls since you have to horde materials to move up the crafting system to actually build anything good, or make it so your dwarves do not up and die. So currently do not expect your house to be really grand until you wasted a good amount of time hording materials. Housing and comfort items needs to be in their own tree of advancementMonstersThe monsters are alright, late game they still cause problems due to general AI decision failures. There is also the problem they can become overwhelmed easily. Monster waves are currently broken to the point that you can make it so your house is level with the rest of the ground with two doors and build everything downwards or upwards. By doing this the wave will either come from the left or right and you can position all your dwarves inside with bows and just fire from the inside. This will disrupt the mob from breaking the door and killing them over time.SpellsThe spells need to be in their own tree and should be completely revamped. It takes far too much time to actually make them useful, beyond the portal spell. The light spell is useless early game until you start abusing it to find materials underground. The growth spell is useless; you can just basically craft a line of flat dirt and have better results and not waste mana. Fireball is received to late in the game due to the crafting system.ConclusionHopefully while the game progresses things change before the end of beta.Work HistoryUpdated: Dec 09, 2015 @2:58pmFormattingAdded Work History.None of the complied review text was changed.

												Why, you might ask, am i not going to recommend a game that i have played for (so far) roughly 150 hours? Well, most of my complaints are similar to others who've reviewed the game, but i'll enumerate them all the same.Firstly, i found the UI to be either merely acceptable at best and cumbersome at worst on the PC. Why make me click and drag to craft things for the first time? It feels like an attempt to copy similar mechanics from similar games, but here it feels much more forced. Secondly, controlling the dwarves is extremely frustrating, as there is no way to assign particular dwarves to particular tasks or particular types of work. Designate an area to get tunneled out and it's anyone's guess which dwarf will actually get started on it. Have an enemy at the door no one's paying attention to? Well, you could click on it to tell your dwarves to attack it, but then everyone nearby will drop whatever they're doing (or carrying) and run over to attack it. Lastly, the portals feel like a failed attempt at applying some pressure to the player. In the beginning they're not bad and maybe even a bit fun in that i get to watch my dwarves beat up some undead, but eventually they're simply something that i have to sit through for several minutes so that i can get back to business. So why have i played it so much? Because i bought it and sometimes it almost scratches a particular itch i have. That and my kids enjoy it.But, overall, whenever i play it i just wish it were better.			"

								Okay! So.This is:Terraria + Dungeon Keeper + Delve Deeper/Dwarfs?! + obviously everyone's favorite Dwarf Fortress all combined in a pretty package, with a CiV-esque tech tree, Minecraft-ish crafting system and a bit of Tower Defense. What you get is the campaign and sandbox modes with adjustable difficulty settings (that includes permadeath and various world types/sizes), so there's a good amount of replayability and whatnot even after you beat the campaign. Fun fun. No story though, but who needs a story in these types of games, right? Go whack a tree. Beat some chickens down with a large stick. Pick up all sorts of useless♥♥♥♥♥♥ WHO KNOWS, YOU MIGHT NEED IT LATER. (Hint: you can disassemble items \o/) It also may look like a mobile/casual game with microtransactions due to the art style but it actually has none of that bull. Dekovir Ent. have apparently only been making Popcap-style games prior to this so it just kinda shows. It's a pretty solid game, especially for something that's still in Early Access. What a shocker, right.It's 50% off at the moment of writing (which is a STEAL), and is about to get out of early access, with new content on the way. Cool! Go get it.			"

Next 20-40 hours as your dwarfs get further away from home and the enemy waves get harder you will be suicidal*some might drop out at this point, ♥♥♥♥♥ about the AI and leave a negative review*3. Next 50-600 hours you learn how to work with dwarf AI while countering all waves If you like base building, colony style, tower defense style games you will get your money's worth out of this game, period (20 hours). If you have the patience and brain power this game could become your ""go to time sink veg out game""  for the next 500+ hours.			"

								This game is good, it feels like ants when you go underground which is awesome. I like the night setting and visbility of the underground caverns needing light. This game is worth getting. At first I was a bit frustrated with the AI and a couple of other things so left for a week, decided to give it another crack and was suprised the developer added such needed and major (imo) changes. The developer does listen and is helpful in getting this game to where it needs to be; polished. Being early access it's just gonna keep getting better. So hang in there if you like it now, I hope this game goes far. It's worth the wait. The changes with the tech tree being able to see and craft specific things more specifically feels like it opens up the game ALOT more, like now I can say this games for me. I'm crafting that because I'm want to not because I have to. I like the new AI it seems alot smoother but will keep an eye on it as it progresses. All in all, if you ever liked the game Sim Ant, or Plants vs Zombies this is for you. Have no regrets with my purchase and glad to see how things become of this already awesome game. Two thumbs up.

												268 hours into this game and I cannot recommend this game to anyone.  I really love the concept of this game and it can be a lot of fun.  Then a laundry list of glaring issues pop-up all over:-  I just noticed my Miner is chopping down trees, My Logger is cooking dinner and my Cook is mining ore.  WHAT!?-  I have to practice building furniture so I can learn to make leather armor.  I have to practice making leather armor so I can learn to make a steel sword.  Is there any rhyme or reason to this tech tree?  Why do I need Expert Cooking to be able to craft Mithril weapons and armor?-  My dwarf just killed a boar and went back home.  An hour later, another dwarf walked 3 miles to pick up the boar's meat and hide.  I also cut down a row of trees and the logs were not collected until a few hours later.  Terrible.-  My dwarf can't get out of the water and will drown if I don't take over manually.- I tried to build a bridge over the water and the dwarves, instead of building it from point A to point B,  put one at A, swam across the water to place one at B, placed a second at A, then swam across the water again to place another at B, etc, etc.-  My archer has been firing arrows into the ground at his feet for five minutes trying to hit a zombie below the archer's perch.  If he took half a step forward he could have a clear shot at the zombie's head, but he just can't seem to figure it out.  So he will just keep shooting arrows into the dirt.  Forever.-  My dwarves will climb down a sheer surface and face possible death instead of using the ladder 5 feet away simply because the perilous cliff is a slightly shorter travel distance.-  There was a zombie banging on my front door, so I wanted to send a dwarf to go dispatch the menance.  Instead, my entire army drops what they are doing and runs back home.  Sorry.  But this game is fun for about half-an-hour at a time.  It's just long enough to remember why I stopped playing it the last time.Score: 40/100Dwarf IQ:  40/100			"

												Surprisingly a very very fun game. Tons (TONS) of crap to craft to fill your settlement, lots of enemies which are just the right difficulty, and a very well thought out variety of stuff to encounter. Love this game, like Dwarf Fortress simplified!			"

												I really wanted to like this game and kept my eye on it for such a long time, but over all, it doesn't quite scratch the building/crafting itch for me. Much too grindy with a very restrictive UI and AI that isn't worth paying attention to. Not a bad game, and definitely has a lot of charm, just falls short of what it could be.			"

												First of all, if you do not enjoy games with levels that take several hours (or days at higher levels) to complete, Craft the World is not for you. However, if you are a patient player enjoying the more long-term building games, then Craft the World is a very fun and addictive game that gets you hooked for hours. You dig your tunnels, collect resources, build your stronghold and fend off attackers. Although the UI could do with some updating for the PC version, having played the game on both PC and tablet, both are very fun and easy to play.			"

												Fun game for a time, eventually I realised that the vast majority of resources in the game are non-renewable, which coupled with the lack of any sort of dismantle/scrap function, ultimately killed the game for me. Also the game seems to lack replayability since the maps are semi-samey and the gameplay doesn't change.Ultimately still enjoyable and you should try it if it's on sale but don't expect to play a single game forever, so if that's what you like to do, try something else first.Edit1: As Corsaer thankfully pointed out in the comments, there is a scrap/dismantle function. However not everything can be dismantled, Edit3: thanks to mad_myke for letting me know that any item crafted in multiples can't be scrapped.Edit2: The ai in it's current state needs work, dwarves often don't listen when ordering them to rest and won't consistently rest on their own. In addition, could use an option to have dwarves drop everything in their pack (Items theyre carrying not the ones they have equipped) when running back home to rest since a full pack slows them down significantly. Extremely frustrating to have your best dwarves die this way.			"

Early Access Review
								At first I thought it was going to be a waste of my time, now all I do is waste my time on this game! There is alot more to it then first meets the eye. Balancing deffensives, food harvesting, general material harvesting (mining and such) and much more, really keeps you busy and wanting more. It IS a slow-ish pace game to start off, and feels like you're going nowhere for the first bit untill you start getting about 10+ Dwarfs, but then it starts kicking in and you're getting things done.A lot more planning and thinking goes in to this then originally thought, take care of your resources, plan around them, or you might just find yourself in a delema and hard pressed to get out of it :)			"

Early Access Review
								Ignore for a moment the fact that this games visual presentation gives the impression of an Iphone app. Once you've set that aside, this game turned out to be a shockingly good building title in which you grow your force of dwarves from obscurity to prominence. The tech tree is enormous, there's loads of gear to craft, furniture to be whittled, and more than enough randomness to keep the gameplay tongue in cheek. I came into it expecting very little, and ended up publishing a full series through my youtube channel on it simply because I felt like Craft the World had snuck under most people's radars. I'm glad I gave it a chance, and would urge others to do so as well. In all respects it's a fun, lightweight civ management title. 8.5 / 10			"

												Appendix, 06.07.16:The new DLC is nice aswell. It delivers a few new items, stats, pets and dwarves. You don't need it but to be honest, the female dwarves are a nice addition.Also, some of the visuals changed. The dwarves were reworked and have a new appearance. Even if not every update brings major changes, you can feel that this game is constantly under construction. You can always feel the progress. I never experienced any crashes or gamebreaking bugs. And I can't wait to see how the multiplayer will evolve. This game would be the greatest fun if two people could actually play one campaign.Original review:Craft The World is what it looks like. Its full of crafting, macro- and micro-management, lovely, survival and progression. At first, the game had some serious issues. Or lets say, the AI had its issues. But its constantly updated and you will feel that it gets better with every update.The visuals look alot like any BigFishGames game. Its plain, but lovely. The gameplay itself can be pretty addicting. Many people are annoyed by the techtree progression system, but if you do not like to use it, you can just play the game in sandbox mode. It will replace the techtree with recipes that you will find throughout the game. If you do not like this either, just open the wiki website, pretty much like in minecraft, and craft anything you want. A pretty neat feature is that you can either give commands to your dwarfs or take over any of them and do the work yourself. That can be really helpful when it comes to crafting complicated structures. Or just sit back, relax and let the dwarfs do all the work.The AI, as mentioned, sometimes struggles from pathfinding problems and such. But there are many ways to get around those problems.(Sidenote: I constantly killed giants in Skyrim by simply running around an obstacle and shooting lightings at them while they were too dumb to figure out how to get to me.) There is NO perfect AI in any game. But at least the devs in CTW always try to improve your precious minions.A few weeks ago, they launched the multiplayer mode. Right now, you have to unlock this mode. You need a certain amount of dwarfs, but thats not bad. It just means, you have to advance a little in singleplayer and than can join multiplayer matches. There are pvp or coop matches. You will join a new biome and have to beat the main boss. But first, you have to dig, collect and craft. Its really nice and the unique rewards will help you improve your main biome. The only sad thing about the multiplayer is that there is no way to start right off with a friend and play on the same map ... yet.I was truly amused when I first found a Jason mask that can be worn by the dwarfs. So, its clearly visible that the devs keep adding fresh content. For an early access game, it is very stable!If you're into management, crafting without being the active part in the game, you should give it a try. And hey: There are no freaking micro-transactions in this game. Only micro-management.			"

												I have almost 500 hours played for this game.  It has some fiddly bits, but I think there is plenty to reccomend this.I'm not sure exactly how I would describe it; ""town builder lite""?  It is an excellent game for wasting a few hours then putting it away until you get the bug again.  It is great comfort food, and if you pick it up on sale price, you're getting a great deal.The main con up front:  Pathfinding can be annoying...especially as you fill the earth with miles of tunnels and shafts.  This can be alleviated by closing off old paths you don't use anymore, and putting thought into just how you develop your ""settlement"" and mining.  It is not game breaking, but it can be annoying when you want one thing done and the dwarves instead run across the map to pick up a loose stone.There is a large tech tree, which you advance by making whatever is cutting edge at the time.  There are multiple tiers of armor, tools, weapons, structural components and acrhitectural items.  Dwarves themselves have up to three skills each, so you should put thought into what skills you give them.  Skills make a big difference and also affect which dwarves get sent to do which tasks.  Between gear and skills you can make dwarves very effective if you plan them out.You can directly control one dwarf at a time, and that is very useful for speed purposes (especially since they don't have to run back to a stockpile to grab items you want them to place on the map), but in general, you set up tasks and the dwarves do for themselves.  You explore, do a LOT of mining, build, cook, fight, and perform other tasks.  Your ""goal"" is to  build a transport gate from one world to the next.  There are multiple worlds, and each provides some interesting twists.  There's a generic world, also an ice, desert, and underdark-type maps.  There are also escalating enemy attacks that portal in every (45 minutes?) that you have to prepare for.Overall, this is a nice addition to your game stable if you would like a break from more complex town sims.  I also like that graphically it is clean and attractive, which many of the popular town sims are not.			"

Every night we were attacked by countless enemies surrounding our home. When will this end? The attacks never stop, but we must continue fighting. I dig deeper seeking precious stones and metals. Everyone is tired and injured and hungry. When will this all end? Our destiny is revealed now, we have found a purpose. We have to decide if we step into the next world or stay and rebuild what has been taken from us.			"

												A game of Dwarfs, huh? Well, let's take a look at.First of all I must point out, that while this game is quite interesting — I had a difficult decision on whether It should be recommend or not. There are good sides to it - it's quite fun, that good ol' fun. Not ever since minecraft had digging into the mother Earth's crust to be such a delightful way to spend some time over a game. It's just like terraria, except that instead of one goof you control a whole bunch of em! And they don't cope with you well! Think of dwarf fortress, indeed like the game states, but increase the IQ of your minions by two handfuls of fairy dust, add a splash of hair balm and there you have it - Dwarf Terrarius! If you're a fan of such games — you should give this one a try.Next stop on our list is — the way you command. Just with one push of a button you send out your minions to chop, dig, fish and slaughter in your Godly appendage! Yeah, there isn't much complexity into it, as far as I got - one click and there ya go, no Blaze blue combo memory required.Step number three — crafting! The tech tree is quite big. It contain plenty of stuff that will help you turn your dwarfs into raging digging machines filled with roasted fish, salads and beer. But like the good sides of this game there are a few bad ones, especially for me, which later from just bad turned out to be extremely frustrated.The tech tree. Yes! I know, I just said that crafting was a good thing. B---u---t.... it also makes it a bad one. From the start you can see the whole tech tree, so you won't get any surprises at all. You can take a peek at what goodies you'll be getting in the end. Not to mention that a lot of tech is just an upgrade of previously used one, as with weapons, cooking or furniture - it just gets improved a bit.  Oh, and to finish the game you pretty much just need to develop all the tech tree to the end. And each time it's just the same - chop, build easy sheit and then build enough of it to get tech to make improved sheit. After one level you can pretty much turn the table and say - I beat Craft the World. Go take a sip of champagne, slice the celebration cake - you are the winner! «Can't you beat the game without improving all the tech to max?» - you'll say? No. No you cannot do that. The problem is that at the end you need mithril bars to make parts of the gate to go to another level. Not to mention that the recopies for those are dropped from an extremely deadly mob that, frankly, goes down fast if you use mithril weapons on him. But they are way back at the end of tech tree. Developing the tech tree is frustrating as well, especially on the first level. The amounts of recourses you're needed to build up the tech tree is just azz. Not sure how others play, but I found myself lacking those a lot. I just had to dig over almost the entire map to get enough to acquire some mithril and then just send out my dwarfs to murder and get murdered by the guardians of the gate recopies. That's how frustrated I was, just rushing, to finish that 12,5 hour long game which was going out at 2x speed most of the time. And I don't have anything about long games. But this game isn't long, it just psz you off by making you have to dig all the map over, chop/rechop thousands of trees to get the tech levels up and gear. And it's not necessary. Not at all. I'm not even kidding, there actually isn't much of ""world crafting"". Not at all. The first level in all its ""glory"" will be your bane. You can't send out dwarfs to ""chop trees"", you need to click every single tree (or right-click swipe em) to get those lumbers down. Then you wait for those to grow back or use magic to grow some at an instant. And then you can sit back to recover your mana for a couple of real life hours.You can't just build fun stuff, you need to develop tech, and you develop it by making useless, not needed, simply wasted items you'll barely use.  At the end my stockpile was filled with loads and loads of sheit like traps, cages, etc... which consumed a ton of resources and didn't do much favor in return, other than increasing the tech-o-meter. The lack of resources is another thing — there are certain resources that are limited on the first level that much, that it will make you pull your hair out of your nostrils due to that. Especially iron and coal... oh God... and trees.... It will make you rage. Oh, and those recourses are required by a lot. A lot of tech uses it and as we all know - you can't win without tech!In the end I decided on placing a ""don't recommend"" on it. The game is hard, but it's that very bad type of hard here. It's not difficult, but it turns the game into a routine. You just do sheit over and over most of the time, thus increasing your playtime by a whole god damn much. And it's not fun. DF was fun, because loosing was fun! In here you just don't get much fun. The game is a jack of all trades but a master of none, it took juicy parts of cult games, mixed it up with their creativity and in the end that sweet, sweet cocktail, that should go layered is just mixed up into brownish liquid. Cheers! SO currently it's not worth it to get the game, maybe later it will work out but now- go download DF and lose fun! "

												Craft the World is a mining/building game.  In it, you play a clan of Dwarves who must brave the elements and the local hostile fauna to find the Great Portal and escape... to a bigger, scarier planet where you do it all again...This is a 2D side-scroller like Terraria. Unlike Terraria, the graphics are designed to be slick and gorgeous, rather than deliberately retro. Your characters are adorbable, grumpy little Dwarves, each with a special name, look, outfit and job. You can have cooks, miners, climbers, swimmers, fishers, mages, lumberjacks, etc. They go about the world collecting resources so you can help them build their fortress/castle/home in the manner you see fit. And yes, you really ""Craft the World."" Crafting is the major goal of this game. You can play in craft-tree mode, adventure mode or sandbox mode, learning each new crafting recipe and building your repetoire of wonderous items you can make, from armor and weapons, decorative building blocks, furniture, foods, potions all the way up to a Tesla device to help fight off hordes of rampaging skeletons (or mummies, or yetis... or goblins...)You can equip each Dwarf with items you have them craft, bettering their skills for their jobs, and protecting them from baddies. You can also take control of an individual Dwarf to speed up the building process if you like. There are also several magic spells you can use to help out your merry band of Dwarves, such as magic portals, fireballs, magic imps who will help them carry resources back to the stockpile, and more. The maps range from small/med/large (sort of like Terraria.)The first time I played the game I said to myself ""this is only in BETA?"" It looked finished to me. Then Dekovir, the creators, kept on adding new content... tweaking AIs, finding and fixing glitches... It's a blast, and I highly recommend it.Gameplay - 7.5/10Visuals - 8/10Sound - 6/10Replay Value - 10/10			"

												Very good game all around & is pretty much what youd expect & hope for from a game like this & is mostly what youd expect from watching the store vids of it.  Wont bother going into great detail on all the pros/cons as many other reviews nail it pretty well.I will say in brief summary that for what this game does & is sposed to be & advertises itself as ( excluding MP ), it does it very well & is one of those very actual few games out of the vast majority that does manage to pull it all together very nicely & makes the single player quite enjoyable & fun to play & gives you that worthwhile feeling.The 2 main cons I can think of that to me are really worth mentioning are that yes; the game does kinda get a bit stale & repetitive after completing one level & then jumping into the next level.  Different environments but basically like 90% the exact same thing as previous levels; really just feels like starting over from scratch & rebuilding & redoing everything all over again, just to complete that level & once again do it all over again on the next level & so on.  Not quite as bland as that may sound, but for me, wasnt enough for me to want to keep progressing through each level.Which brings up the 2nd most prevalent con to this game.  When there was talk about MP being added, myself & many others were very interested & really looking forward to the exciting new life that MP would breath into this already good but somewhat repetitive & eventually boring single player game...but then it happened...this games version of MP was released & ended up disappointing a great many players & causing quite a bit of upset & disappointment.  The MP that was added was not what most of us were waiting for & wanting & expecting & hoping for & instead was made so that you have to play single player a while & then can shortly thereafter join up with another random player from their own single player campaign & then play one of a few random, isolated solo mission maps together, completely outside & separate from your own individual main campaign maps...While this version of MP was definitely somewhat unique & original, it felt like & still feels like, that should have really just been added after, & only after, Real proper online MP coop campaign/sandbox mode was put into place first.  But this is the MP we ended up with & to date, real MP has not been added & may not ever be.  Its understandable that the devs designed this game to be single player focused from the beginning & not coded from the ground up to easily be real MP friendly, but its still a shame & to me will always be a bit of a blemish, on an otherwise pretty solid & well made, fun game to play.  Theres been a few improvements to the originally introduced version of this games version of MP from what Ive read, but to me & a lot of others, just still isnt enough to make me care about it, as it just isnt the MP that many of us really wanted for this game.That all being said, this is still a pretty solid, pretty good game & most people cant go wrong with this game & should still give most people many hours of enjoyment from the single player end of things, for those that like games like this to begin with.  Despite the couple of main flaws, this game still does a lot of other things quite right.........for single player mode anyways...also seems to be quite a few posts about bugs & other related issues from some people, but it seems maybe those are mostly isolated issues for a select few people out of the vast majority.  Out of the 100+ hours, I cant recall a single game breaking issue or even small bug that occurred that even made me think twice about it or ever took away from the gameplay experience.  All important single player gameplay aspects combined scorewise; Good solid 8/10 Id say.			"

Early Access Review
								This game has restored my faith in Early Access / paid beta releases, so Godus, FortressCraft, Space Engineers, Castle Story and Kinetic Void take note: this is how it's done and you are shamed by it - if you are asking for money, try giving people a game like this one, that is actually playable. Although not fully featured yet, Craft the World is highly polished with excellent music, character design and attention to detail. Gameplay is highly addictive - if you like RTS or other micromanagement games but thought Terraria was a steaming pile of pants, you'll find that this game is what you were missing. My only wish is that it were voxel-based. Craft the World 2?			"

												A simple yet fun game, you control a horde of dwarves in a randomly generated world gathering supplies and building stuff.  Unlike games like Terraria and Starbound, you don't gather the supplies or fight yourself.  Instead, you instruct the dwarves to do everything, which they may or may not do at their leisure.  I've often had them gathering something only for them to stop doing so after making their first run back tot he stockpiles only to stand around and wait for you to give them another command when there are still things to be gathered.  Even so, it's not often enough that it's a major issue as much as a minor annoyance.  There's a distinct lack in the game telling you how to accomplish things, however.  In the first mission, the game tells you to make a totem and build a home, but doesn't tell you that you have to reach level 4 first to do so and it will just give you one.			"

												This game is awsome in the first hour than you start to realize the glitches and you get more and more disappointed. After a few hours in the game I became so frustrated I had to quit. Main reason is the AI. Your dwarfs are SOOO F...ING DUMB. If they mine a block usually they don't mine the neighbouring ones just standing there like a huge pile s..t looking their legs or something and waiting for another dwarf to do the job. Can't prioritise job types nor individual works so you just have to wait to the ""important"" stuff to get finished before the job you would like to be completed. I can't stress enough how frustrating it is. It's just needlessly time consuming. The inventory and qiuckbar system is complicated to use, should be a lot more user friendly. And so on so forth...Playing this game is like doing math, you have to be enthusiastic to enjoy it otherwise it's slow and painful.Shame, 'cause it could be a good game.			"

												I picked this up on a huge discount during the summer sale and really got my money's worth. In fact, I find it addictive to the point where I should probably uninstall it and get some stuff done... nah. I've only played one, abortive, multiplayer game-- the other person quit. So this review is based on single player.Long story short? It's a simplified Dwarf Fortress with a big dose of cute. Plus it has a campaign.It's hard to put my finger on why I like Craft the World so much. I guess it's largely because the progression of the tech tree is well balanced so there's always something not far off to work toward, and usually on multiple paths. The tech tree itself is nothing special-- in fact, it's littered with useless items I only craft to level up-- but well balanced so that by the time I need some materials for the next tech, I've either already stocked it or it's near to hand.The campaign is a series of worlds, and so far I've played grass, snow, desert, and ""underground"", although for some reason it gets rain. The successive worlds aren't exactly more challenging in themselves, but the monsters are more deadly. You seek out portal pieces, which are guarded by fairly powerful creatures, and once you go through the portal to the next world, that's that for the one you just played, so far as I can tell, you're on to the next one.The game itself is not challenging, either, following the trend of recent games that have challenging moments but are difficult (or impossible) to actually lose. I'm not even sure if Craft the World has a loss condition. Every so often waves of enemies, individually weak but deadly in a pack, will assault your settlement. While I've seen images of impressive defenses posted by players, it's easier to just build walls several blocks thick and ignore the waves or treat them as a way to gain experience (the dwarves have skills like warrior and archer, among others, that increase through use) by picking off stragglers, aided by the handy Portal spell.I do lose individual dwarves, though. Sometimes I have no clue how difficult a particular monster will be and it can kill with two or three attacks. The dwarves themselves are pretty dumb-- other player reviews deride this as bad AI but I consider it to be flavor-- and will sometimes fall in lava or ignore an order to retreat. A replacement soon appears, though, so all that's really lost is experience and possibly equipment.There's a few things I wish were different about the game, although I wouldn't call them negatives to the game itself exactly. For one thing, the maps could be smaller. I'm pretty methodical, if sloppy, and it takes many hours to clear a map in campaign mode. The community could be stronger, too. For example, the game's wiki is sketchy. Of course, it's a fairly simple game, so you don't need a manual, but the game has hotkeys and so far as I can tell, doesn't bother to tell you about them. It would be nice if the opening quests in a new world in campaign were varied. It's been cut down a tree, dig a tunnel, complete the shelter, etc., same thing each time.I've gone on too long, especially as I rarely bother reading long reviews myself. I just wanted to get my thoughts down about this game. Also, just felt that some reviews harp on bugs an awful lot when I haven't noticed any definite ones. The game is certainly stable.			"

												This is my ""Test of Time"" nominee, when the newest title stops holding my attention or I just want to chill and not spend a lot of time thinkning or reacting I play this.  You tell the dwarves what to do and they do it at their own pace but you can select and dwarf and take direct control when you want something done now or done a certain way.  Every night the zombies attack and every 45 minutes there's a blood moon and LOTS of zombies attack.  During the day you mine and craft and build a bigger shelter and upgrade your wares.  Each time you level up you gain a new dwarf and can customize each build individually to select their crafting skills and combat styles.  It's a really fun game and they update it all the time.			"

												I have sunk Hours into this game and I love it. The Dwarfs do need some tuning and the last level with the big deity is driving me nuts because im spending half of everything to please him and then not much left for me cause having to fight the goblins underground and the ones trying to break in. This is one of my top Favorite games. I have the exp and the Owlcats and Froglisks are adorable. I do like sandbox mode but we do need a bit more of a way to level better after we get a few levels on us. But as for deity i do love the idea that he gives gifts if he is pleased but i just wish there was a list we could  follow or some guidelines on what to give to get what we would like from him. I need iron desperately and it would be nice if i know how to please him enough to get it. I do wish there were more worlds or more to do after you finish the last campaign and everything. I am on the last level and im gonna be sad its over, i really would love to see more from this game. Its great as it is but it has so much potential to be really spectacular. I would get more stuff from the store for this game if there was another expansion or add on. Keep up the great work. I wish more games were like this.			"

												This is a good colony simulation game. It is not the ultimate simulation dream and is far from being flawless in terms of bugs and technical performace but still it is a solid game. My only complain is the amount of grinding getting on the way every time you want to start a new map. I just can't imagine a good reason behind the tech tree design other that forcing the player to see all the content. It is kind of a questionable choice but again every developer does whatever he/she think is best for his/her audience. I do think it was a poor desition to have such a intrincated tech tree but again that's just my opinion. The game is solid give it a try you may have a great time.			"

												I like this game, however, there is only 3 levels to sandbox mode.  After playing 3 levels, I was stunned to find out that I was finished.  The developers need to spend much more time developing the Sandbox mode and worry about ""multiplayer"" later.   Appart from having only 3 levels total, there are pathfinding issues, balance issues, a non-existent story-line, the tech-tree (although kinda cool) doesn't flow well (especially on level 3).   Overall great concept and great graphics, but because the developers have been side tracked, this game is missing it's spot light and will soon be doomed.  People will move on to other games and by the time the developers figure this out, their game will be dated and eclipsed by a smarter one.  So sad.			"

												This game is insanely addictive. So much so it should come with a warning label.It's basically a side-view version of A Game of Dwarves. It's very easy to get into, and once you do your creativity can just run wild as you harvest, craft, dig out or surface build tunnels and rooms at your own pace. What you want to do and how you want to go about things are totally up the player.Lots of different resources, buried treasure and small caverns. Cooking, fishing, mining, logging, farming...pretty much a crafter heaven. It has optional quest-related goals that you'd eventually probably be doing anyway, so you're never really taken out of your comfort zone when it comes to your play style.Four different worlds, involved developers...I could go on....but I want to get back to playing so I'll end it here. Did I mention how addictive it was....?Honestly, if you're into crafting, world-building, exploring, playing at your own pace then you should already be clicking the Buy button on this gem.			"

								Really addicting game where you are tasked with helping (via giving commands, casting spells, etc) dwarves build and maintain a base while mining for minerals, crafting items, exploring the underground, and fighting off the waves of the undead (and goblins, but mostly undead) that lay seige to you every 45 minutes. Nearly everything is done through indirect control. You mark where to dig, and where to place items, tell them what to craft, who to attack - as of now (I should state I'm writing this while the game is still in early access/beta. So things are still being added and tweaked and balanced and etc) there are a few things you are more actively doing - during bigger fights if your dwarves health gets low they'll run away, at a point you'll be able to tell them to craft health potions. Right now, it seems the only way to use them is by you using them on the appropriate dwarf when their health is getting low. You also have a few items you can place and remove without the dwarves doing it for you - the main item that you'll be using in this manner is scaffolding that you can place to help the dwarves climb up something that would be hard to climb on their own and you only need a temporary item for them to use to climb. Portable ladders...) Er, anyway, the description of the game says it's inspired by Dungeon Keeper, Dwarf Fortress, and Terraria. I can see the Terraria inspiration, but the gameplay is not like Terraria at all. I'm pointing that out because Ive seen some comments on this  game lamenting (whining) about another Terraria clone and the ways that Terraria was an inspiration to the developers of this game are not ways that led to a clone. I would say the graphic style and some of the mechanics for what defines a home are the big things that seem Terraria inspired. Anyway, it's really fun and I can't wait to see what each update will bring! So if you like buildy, crafty, strategy, dwarfy, explory, games then I totally recommend this game. And I would even recommend it in general since it feels like it's a game that is not so heavy (*cough Dwarf Fortress cough*) that you have to be hardcore about the style of game to get into it. In short, RECOMMENDED. *imagine a loud kind of stamp hitting a document sound...like ... I don't know, it seems like it's used a lot in crime shows and court shows. USE YOUR IMAGINATION*			"

												Been playing this game for awhile, really enjoyed it at first though there was quite a learning curve figuring out how to get past the first world in campaign mode.  Not a bad thing though, made it feel very rewarding when I did get the hang of things and stopped getting overrun by monsters before getting far enough.But now that I've put some hours into it and gotten to later stages in the game it's quickly becoming less enjoyable as the increase in difficulty reallly brings out some major flaws in the game that have been mentioned before, but I'll say it again.  The UI really needs work.  And the dwarves AI needs major work.  I don't know how many times I've gotten to the point of screaming obscenities at my monitor because no matter what I do the stupid dwarves just act like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and run straight to their death, without even being told to.  Not to mention how often they don't do what you want them to, run around in circles or go way over to the other end of the map for seemingly no reason (path finding is horrendous) and seem to build things in random order, to the point of where you told them to build something important 10 minutes ago but all they want to do is build stupid crap that you end up cancelling because they won't do what you already told them to do previously.  Gets to the point where you feel like you have to only give them one build job at a time if you want them to get done in proper order, which makes the whole process way more tedious and time consuming than it should be. If you want to build a ceiling to a new building or new upper floor of one you literally have to take manual control of a dwarf and build each block yourself or it will never get done.  They can't seem to figure out how to build one block, and then the next, and then the next in a series.  They instead just build one and then give up because they can't get to the one way out in the middle or somewhere instead of THE ONE RIGHT NEXT TO THEM.  DUH.Extremely frustrating, especially when little things like this really start to make the difference between life and death in later levels.  Really fun game otherwise, but really needs a lot of work on these issues before I'll continue playing it any more.I get that the developers probably want to keep adding more content to the game in order to keep people interested and make it more appealing to new players, but I feel like their priorities are a bit off.  Multiplayer, quite frankly, seems pretty pointless and poorly executed.  You're in the middle of a level, got a bunch of dwarves and everything, then you open a portal... to an entirely different level, where you have different dwarves and start out from scratch again and can't even go back and forth between this entirely new game and the one you were just playing.  At least, not until you finish this entirely new level which takes so long you don't even remember where you left off in the last one, and in the end you're not even left with much to show for it as you can't really take much of the stuff you got back with you. And frankly I think they should be more focused on trying to make the exisiting game better, fix the major AI issues and the like before worrying about adding extraneous features like this ""multiplayer"" which doesn't even seem to have much of a purpose to begin with.

Then you appear in a multiplayer world with your buddy, first off, theses are only underground maps. then you have the vision of your buddy that you have to kill. in between each bases their are some monsters, but there is no monster waves, you cant really play with your mate. The way they created the multiplayer mode turn me off quickly. As i mentionned before, i bought that game to play with my friend.And for a solo game i would highly recommend Gnomoria instead of that game.			"

								I thought it was surprisingly good. at first, I thought ""egh... another one of these huh?"" the good reviews though seemed to work in favor of the game, so seeing as it was on sale I grabbed it. what ensued was four hours of exploring a decent new game and gawking at what looks like some fairly ""bleh"" graphics from a distance, but are actually rather nice graphics when you actually look at them up close. the update log for the game shows updates being a fairly regular thing, meaning fixes for bugs (I only saw one bug and that one crashed the game) and new content could be always just around the corner. the game is also surprisingly well polished for an early release game. in my mind I see the devs saying ""yeah, its good as it is, but it can be better.""

												This game had a lot of potential to be great, but it has way too many shortcomings for its own good and it detracts from the rest of the game.You control dwarves that do everything for you, and all you do is tell them what to do (and craft items for them). The AI for the dwarves are absolutely terrible, the amount of dwarves I've lost because they stood there not attacking an enemy is insane, and I'll tell them to go dig out a hole here or place a wall there and they just stand there doing nothing for an indefinite amount of time.   When the game is organized about having little AI creatures do what you want, the AI needs to be smart enough to perform those tasks. For the tasks, even building a structure is very difficult because of the AI, and even then they only have a small range of placement so you're needing to construct and deconstruct ladders and platforms that they will hopefully place and remove in an orderly fashion so you can actually build something.  The rest of the game is organized around mining and chopping wood for materials, gathering food for your dwarves, and keeping them alive to fight the boss underground and beat the level, unlocking the next world which is bigger and harder.  Managing the dwarves can be a pain and with a clunky and slow crafting system, outfitting your dwarves is an obnoxious task on its own since they have nearly no defining characteristics and only small titles on their character page, and needing to craft more tools for every new dwarf you get just gets tedius after a while due to the need to fight the AI to get more materials (and rarer ones at that as you progress) to properly outfit your tiny army so they can survive their own stupidity, let alone the actual dangers of the world.If they fixed the AI and made it responsive this game could instantly become a game worth your time, but with fighting the AI, relying on random drops for many items, a very odd money system, and just overall clunkyness, you're better off finding another game that plays similar.

												The 2-d world and resource harvesting mechanics are very much like Terraria, but having a colony of dwarves instead of a solo adventurer means it also fills the void left in my gaming life by Towns dying in a fire. Some bits of the tech tree are not terribly intuitive (why do I need to learn weaving before I can make steel armor?) but my guess is they're laid out where they are so that you can't just ignore half the tree until you've built a complete powerhouse dwarf crew who are threatened by nothing, and then finish everything else at your leisure. The rain mechanic is really nicely executed, though you can accidentally drown your entire sheep farm if you lay things out wrong, and the difficulty of the monster waves ramps up at a pretty good pace.It made my old computer (a 2009 MacBook) crash occasionally if I was trying to run other programs simultaneously, but that was definitely a function of hitting obsolete hardware limits. Bought computer made in this decade, no longer have crash issues.48 hours in this game in the last two weeks and I'm jonesing for more. I really like that the campaign mode gives you a series of goals to accomplish (and then re-accomplish in the next world), because completely sandbox games tend to lose me after a while. I get a base built and stable and equip my guys and... then what? Well, start over, I guess. Campaign mode makes starting over into progress. The resource limitations in the ice world are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ but it's livable and gives you all the more motivation to get the portal rebuilt and get the hell out of there.The thing I'd most like to see in future releases is the ability to set standing orders so my dwarves have tasks they will return to any time a condition is (not) met: when food in inventory drops below 10, grill meat. When wool in inventory drops below 5, shear sheep/llama. Lower on my priority list but also good would be an option between the current ""stay in the shelter"" and ""go wherever"" modes for the dwarves' movement range -- either a defined distance they could forage outside or a set of markers you could place to limit how far they explore, so you don't have lone dwarves trudging off to the end of the map and getting lost because there's a ball of dirt to pick up somewhere.Good stuff, though. Totally glad I bought it.			"

								This is a great game! I played this alot and i never get tired of playing it. But everything cannot be perfect... I´ve found to flaws with the game this far. The thing is the AI is not always as you would like it be (it´s a bit stupid) and becouse of that the second flaw comes, the dwarwes die easily of enviromental things when there are other ways...  So lets think that youre favorite dwarf goes to colloct some stone you found in some tunnel you dug. and then u put up a portal and what do he do? He travels over the water instead and drown, so then the resources and next dwarf comes and get it and you have to stop it and use the imp spell or the collect spell that transport the items to your stockpile and you loose a dwarf for nothing. How will you get a new dwarf like that? You wonder later, and the thing is you have to wait until a dwarf with the right skill comes and then you need two new books to give the dwarf the skills you wanted it to have. But that can take a long time. So becouse of the not so smart AI it comes a second flaw. You cannot replace skills. Overall it dont ruin the game experiance that much and i would give it a 8,5/10.

												DLC seems to be this game's answer to endemic issues with the game, such as gameplay that slows down exponentially and resource choking that leaves the player eager to not craft anything other than what is absolutely required for progression. This really feels, in many ways, not least of which its design, like it should have been a 4.99 Tablet Game, not an 18.99 game with 8.98 worth of DLC that adds so much less than 1/4 of the game's original content or functionality let alone half.Avoid this unless you're so into this kind of management/base building game; the kind of person who buys twenty DLCs for Train Simulator kind of dedication.  It's average amongst its peers but its DLCs feel more like the kind of updates that would be sold add-on to a free-to-play game, rather than a Feature Product build for PC.Edit: Oh wait, it IS a 4.99 tablet game!  Right there on the App store! Steer clear of this price gouging.			"

												Good game - some very interesting ideas and combination of gameplay elements - I would describe it as a weird cross of Dungeon Keeper with Settlers and Mincraft. For me the biggest issue was with the controls, those are not very good and it is getting in a way of the experience in the long run - the more items you can craft. I do not understand some limitations that the UI has was the UI designer frozen in time for the last 10 years?Same goes for Dwarf AI, dumber then the Lemmings. They drop everything they carry to go help another one fighting like miles away, no chance to ever reach him before the fight is over. Don't even get me talking about constantly dropping from the ladder why trying to attack monsters. The command queue is also a mystery for me, orders are often not executed in order but more at random.As with some other games it is a shame that you do not have neutral score you can give. I spend 10 exciting hours completely glamored by the game, however, issues with controls and dwarfs AI eventually just overwhelmed the fun after 14th hour of gameplay. I normaly expect more playtime - before the game stops being any fun - from a sandbox type game so I'll be going with the negative review this time around.			"

 Do you want to Craft The World? TOO BAD. Avoid this ""game"" like the plague. From the videos and screenshots it looks like a mix of Terraria and user-friendly Dwarf Fortress. It's not.This is a mobile game masquerading as a desktop game. There is no content here past ""leveling up"" and that feels like a hollow and pointless experience.Probably the worst part of this whole game is the ""Tech Tree"" which seems like it would be a feature. Instead it's your chains. Do you want to craft a single wood helmet? Do you have the wood? yes? TOO BAD. Instead first you have to craft  5 ladders first because.... you wouldn't know how to make a helmet without first making ladders. You want a wooden door? Do you have all the required materials for it? yes? WELL TOO BAD you still have to craft 10 ""Locks"" first. I'm not kidding. This ruins the game as even if I have the materials for things I can't craft them until way later because of the tech tree. The prerequisites for items don't even make sense.The one upside of this game is that it's fairly well polished. It's pretty, has decent music, and runs smoothly. Unfortunately the downside is pretty much everything else. Save yourself the money and more importantly those hours of your life that you cannot get back. Avoid this game.			"

												Oy... This game.  Its something else.  LIke Dungeon Keeper and Terraria had a baby that then had its way with a Lemming, and this game is the result.Then there is that one loading screen, in which one dwarf is staring lovingly at the dwarf in the foreground.  Its like the poster for some Dwarf-centric LGBT Rom-Com.Homoerotic dwarves aside, i love this game.  It has quickly earned a spot next Civilization, Minecraft, and Heroes of Broken Land in my list of games to play when I'm bored or multi-tasking.  I laugh as my wee bearded barbarians go chasing sheep, or like their Lemming forebearers, go plunging heedlessly off of high cliffs because taking the ladder two blocks behind them would have been to easy and not given them a concussion.   And I swear, every Ori i get loves to run the wrong way away from monsters, and ends getting butchered by the swarm of monsters between him and the shelter.Seriously, Ori, stop making eyes at Blayne and get back to work.

												This is a fun and relaxing game.  You guide a small clan of dwarves through a crafting tech tree and you guide their search for all the materials for crafting via mining, hunting, etc.. There is a timer for monster attacks....and their are random monsters.  I'm basing these comments on having played only the first world.  Starting the second world now.  There isn't any real tutorial so I recommend looking a guide briefly to help avoid some of the tediousness ....Some tips....- you can disassemble any item once you have better tech- you can place portals to transport your dwarves directly home- later you can use imps to transport raw materials home- you can SPEED UP THE GAME during slow times, just click on clock in upper right corner of the screen- While holding a block, you can click on an already placed block to change it's orientation- you can craft coal and iron etc..later in the tech tree "

												all in all this game offers a good bit of fun its not without its flaws tho pro's:i find it very relaxing to play this even so much so i am willing to  play this despite its flawsaudial and visualy its pleasinglots of stuff to craft, lots of ways to decorate if thats your thing i am more a mine the world kinda guy myselfi tried terrania and found it very hard to get into this however is easy to get intocon's:the biggest is the iq of your workers this game could use a update on the way your workers operate they are lazy and often dont seam to understand what is expected of them, they often just stand around or walk past a portal they could use to get home fast also now and then the game crashes aldow i never lost any progress this way its just a matter of closing the game (the hard way) and restarting it i give this 7.5/10 (i consider it being a 9.5/10 game if they ever do something about the ai) in its current state its stil very fun and i think i wil play for many more hours but it could be better with some polishing			"

Early Access Review
								My Dwarves are like a second family, an extremely dysfunctional and disobedient family but we still pull together when portals from the underworld open on our front door step and demonic spawn comes to run us all through, then we go back to being dysfunctional.It's a very simple world builder with RPG elements, I really wish though that there was another way to get Dwarves other than levelling up, it feels really really really slow like that.You'll never have enough Dwarves :/			"

								This was my first jump on to an early access game, and it has been well worth the investment. From the get go, it felt more polished and enjoyable than many complete games I've played. To be sure, there are still some rough around the edges, but the devs are actively updating and improving the game. The game is fun NOW, but you also get the sense there is room to grow. I hope the devs can flesh out the games real potential.			"

												OK guys, I have played the first level of this game for 20 hours, now I am through, and I am through with the game.First of all, it is a sandbox game, where you can dig deep in the dungeon, build your cave or castle for the dwarfs and watch them poorly perform and managing themselves. The good things: - nice graphics, cute dwarfs, nice user interfaceThe bad things: - the game machanics suck: you mainly select where to dig, what to build etc. and the dwarfs walk along and do it, very very slowly. I had to play the game at 2x speed, which is available, a 10x speed would be better. - No goal: Maybe I do not get it, but as you dig along, you find resources, you expand the tech tree just to get to the good stuff, and then all the ground is digged up, and that's it. The only thing that you can reach is: - attention spoiler - 5 parts to build the exit portal, so that you can leave the level. Really. Then you can start again to work 20 hours on a new level. - The AI is bad. So you have to do the work: The dwarfs are stupid. If they clear a bridge, they start with the first two elements and fall then to the ground. When they should dig up a place, they start with the lowest blocks and then they cannot climb anymore up to clear the higher blocks. Come on. I have then to micromanage = control a single dwarf to do it properly. Lots of micromanagement needed to make up for the extremely slow speed of the dwarfs.- Whats the point for the enemies? In the night and even during the day, sometimes bad guys visit the dwarfs. They always win, if you did not prepare with either lots of traps, wood cannons and such. Or you just build a 4 stone thick layer  on the ground and keep your dwarfs below that, the bad guys remain above. - No story, no reward for anything you do, a dissapointing end to the level.- Unnecessary tech tree: In order to build complex set of things you have to construct a specific amount of the simpler sets of things. So in order to get to the mithril weapon set, you have to build sufficient wall decorations. Right? Makes sense? No. At the end, I had a pile of crap built that remained in the stash and was never used. If I would have wanted to decorate nice houses I would play with a doll house. The dwarfs might be happy or not, it does not make a difference.So at the end: If you like sloooow games, with sloooow characters acting like idots, this is a game for you. If you like to decorate sweet cute houses, this is a game for you. If you like to micromanage slooow characters without any reward, this is a game for you! I rather play something entertaining.			"

												I've sunk a good amount of time into this so far, since it was in early access. This game tackles many different ideas at once to great effect. It's got the 2D sidescrolling world of Terraria, above ground and below ground, but not as vast in size. It's got the god-game system of Dungeon Keeper, in which you can give orders to your dwarves and have them go about the business of accomplishing it (or take direct control of one of them specifically, also like Dungeon Keeper). And you've got the fortress building aspect of...well...Dwarf Fortress. This is one of those interesting games where starting out can be brutal, especially for a new player, but gets easier as you go, as opposed to other games that start small and scale in difficulty. But that's really one of its strong points, as it has you learning on your toes and makes you think about your next move and how you spend your resources. But that doesn't mean it'll let you off easy, even after you've learned the ropes.Like most sandbox games, CtW gives you time to build up, and time to be wary. Daytime offers a peaceful chance to work and get things done, while night brings the potential of undead raids on your treasured home. Every 50 minutes of real time play, a portal raid will begin to truly test whether you've prepared properly, or not. And they keep getting harder as well, to force you to think faster and beat the level to ultimately survive. The crafting is smooth and easy to manage, the graphics are bright and colorful (never really feeling dull thankfully), and the fighting system isn't complicated while still offering plenty of room for strategy to aid the dwarves. Seriously, you'll think of plenty of tricks and traps to make the deadly portal raids easier as you go along, and coming up with said strategies is a large part of the fun. You'll see some people complain no doubt about resource shortages in the late game, but resource management is important, and it isn't a game problem, it's the players fault for wasting items. This isn't just a sandbox game. It's a multitude of genres at once. It's a sandbox-fort building-management-strategy-survival game with three worlds each between 20-40 hours a piece. It's not about making a beautiful world like Minecraft or Terraria (though you'll love building your fort/home) it's about the brutal survival of moving your dwarves to the next world, towards (what they hope) will be their new home in escaping an undead menace. 10/10 Easily one of the top games of 2014. You'll start playing and look to realize in horror that you've played for hours on end and it's time to sleep. But you won't sleep.			"

												This game is extremely addictive and very good. It's a sandbox game similar to Terraria, yet it certainly remains distinct. The game looks very beautiful. And, it's fun. It's fun to control all of these dwarves, but it can be like trying to herd cats at times. You have the option of controlling one dwarf, while ordering the others about, or you can take an overview of the map, and tell them all what to do. The AI is pretty good, and they usually do a great job going where you tell them to, and taking the best routes. They're very responsive too. There are a ton of things to craft and learn how to build, along with a ton of materials to discover. The enemies can be very dangerous at times ( e.g. during waves). The controls are not very intuitive at first, but once you catch on it's pretty easy.			"

								Hi everyone this is a calm quiet game where you just build stuff and have the time to be creative with castle's and making the dwarf super mine or forteress so the zombies dont get to you . Graphic are good , the game hasnt bug on my computer at all . The only bad part is the dam AI for the dwarf there so stupid that might get to you in the long run but since the game it still being tinkered with maybe one day that make a rally point so they dont just stay where your building and are in your way . And with the hrs you see i have in the game yes yes yes i have to admit i let them die LOLSo i would is a great passtime but not for adrealine junky's or pvp addicts :)			"

Dwarves, check. Fortress, check. Stupidity, check. Deaths and hilarity, check. Nice graphics.. wait what?Craft the World is for want of a better term ""My first Dwarf Fortress"". It's Dwarf Fortress made accessible to the market, and it's about time someone actually got around to -doing- this. Initially released in Early Access, this title has been something of a rough gem that has, over time steadily been sanded and milled into a shining diamond, just waiting to be plucked from the dark underdepths by grubby, stubby hands and long, curly beards.All of the dwarves, none of the terrifying ASCIIDwarf Fortress is a very ""marmite"" game, because in part it's one of those games that requires the kind of in depth understanding of all the systems and sub-systems that go into it that usually come along with multi year degree courses. Not so in Craft the World, no, whilst the Dwarves do exhibit elemental stupidity in buckets, much like their DF cousins, they are quite able to follow simple instructions and they are able to manage their tasks in a vaguely dwarfish manner. Those skilled in their jobs will prioritise things accordingly, and the dwarves with weapons will actually kill things, as opposed to stabbing themselves in the foot. There's none of this ""Fey mood"" malarky either, thank dieties. Instead you'll be dealing with nightfall bringing undead knocking at your door and ghosts who wreak havoc with your stockpiles.A rich and engaging system that will have you whittling away for hoursWhilst the tech tree was ""servicable"" to begin with, now it's a monolithic thing that requires time and effort to unpick, with dwarves being forced to live in fairly basic digs with leafy beds before they are given homes suited to their dwarfly status. The game systems now support farming, fishing, and a full complement of other activities, so provided you can keep your dwarves alive, you can eventually have a busy, thriving little fortress, able to stand up to the worst that the world throws at you. Well, most of the time...Throw in trading with the locals when you acquire precious gold coins, skill books which teach your dwarves such vital skills such as how to climb without plummeting to their doom and a simple RPG-lite system of skill building and you've a recipe for quite entertaining gameplay. It may not have the absolute depth of Dwarf Fortress, but it certainly will slake the thirst of anyone wanting to get -into- the DF genre, and in that, it serves as an excellent introduction.Dawwwwh, they're so cute...The graphical style is well thought out, opting for a very cartoonish and well furnished design that uses sweeping colourful flourishes and a wide palette, ensuring that there's always something interesting going on, and that the dwarven holdings -look- the part. Furniture goes from being something that shames you to being something that shines. Enemies range from comical looking skeletons to nasty beholders and trolls and goblins, all well thought out and whilst not perhaps going to win awards for animation, they -do- look well designed and everything in the world is consistent.The sound? Well. I'll be diplomatic. If I hear dwarves snoring one more time... *eyetwitch*Closing thoughts.It's ""My First Dwarf Fortress"", and it's a very good place to start, there's been other efforts, and those have done pretty badly in comparison, this one however nails the mark, striking a good balance between being accessible to the newcomer yet offering enough of a challenge to keep experienced players at the whetstone long enough that they should feel suitably stretched out enough to consider graduating to the 'real' Dwarf Fortress, if that so pleases them.Verdict : Recommended - Especially to fans of Dwarf Fortress, or to people looking to get into the DF genre.Writer and columnist for Just Reviews, where you can get similar fine reading material.

												I really wanted to like this game , the concept was good . But there are just too many issues that are just irritating about this aswell.  Here are just a few points. #1 COMBAT : Getting knocked around by a starting level zombie every single time it hits a stout heavily armored dwarf in steel/Silver/MITHRIL armor. IS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ . I would understand if this happened without any gear on . But its 100% all the time knock back. #2 The HOARD : The undead zerg that attacks your base every 45 minuts gets out of hand the longer you play a level making it almost impossible to enjoy the game when all you want to do is max a level before moving on . Making the game less about enjoying the core of the game and more about HURRY UP AND GET WHAT YOU NEED TO ESCAPE.#3 Combat AI : They are mentally handicapped . Having one dwarf charge into a group of 12+ mobs just because he is melee only to have him hit one mob and get juggled around due to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ knockback system in the game is just beyond stupid.#4 NO SHIELDS : You can make alllllll this special gear . Auto turrets (that barely work) LIGHTNING TOWERS , TRAPS  but you CAN""T strap some wood together and make a SHIELD....... that logic .#5 Can't SELL : I don't know but the idea that you can only buy stuff from a store ....... kind of stupid also . I guess the devs never heard of a bartering system . Later on you ammount masses of USELESS items ......that just sit there .#6 Crafting Tree : The crafting tree is ok , but it lacks a lot of common sense . As some of the most BASIC ideas such as burning wood to make coal and farming for example are among some of the highest tier crafts .All in all the game needs a decent ammount of work and balancing at this time . So it's not worth the price for the overall aggrivation it causes .			"

												Needs:- Actual sandbox, where you can craft item without scrolls (I do not know whether if it can be done or not if you play it the second time, but certainly need fixing so new players can enjoy the game.)- AI needs to improve, not the sharpest foes and dwarves.- change recipes, eg. expensive coal and cheap bricks (8 woods for 1 coal)- Assigned bed, where bed have dwarf's name on it.- Sheep farm needs to improve, after shear multiple sheep there stuck on the same place, and cannot cut the uncut sheep.Otherwise it's a fairly good game.

Early Access Review
								My main concern with Early Access games is that it's sometimes hard to tell if you're getting something in a close to release quality or if you're going to buy a game that has another 2 years of development before it's close to worthwhile. While there is currently only one level available, with some minor glitches, it is definetely release quality. Beyond just the state of the game, it is pretty addictive. I played until 1 am last night and didn't even realize it was so late. I've played about 13 hours and I'm only about 2/3 done with the tech tree.  The leveling/task system does a good job of guiding you through the tech progression and guiding you on what you should accomplish as far as base building.I'll admit that it did take me a little while to figue out some of the basics. I didn't know that after you placed a backround block of dirt/wood that placing a second one will build a solid wall. I didn't realize right away that when one of my dwarves die, they respawn. Also, I didn't realize that the ""2"" next to the Portal spell ment that it cost 2 Mana not that I only had 2 uses. Admitting this does make me feel like kind of a noob but considering that these weren't readily apparent to someone who has played similar games, such as Terraria, to completion, it would be helpful to have a better indication of this.(Maybe tasks that make you do these things)The AI could use some improvement, the Dwarfs won't automatically use their highest skills when you queue a task, but over the game is well worth its current price and is a lot of fun. I would highly recommend it in it's current state and I'm looking forward to future updates.			"

												Yet another game in the ""Dwarf Fortress did it right so let's see if we can do that as well"" genre. This one, unlike quite a few others I played, is actually fun.The dwarves are as dumb as bricks, for starters. The number of times I've seen one of my foolish bearded minions remove the ground they were standing on only to fall into a gaping, lava and spider filled abyss should probably cause frustration. But it doesn't.Why?Mostly because the game has a surprising amount of charm and complexity, without becoming tedious. You probably shouldn't play it for an entire day, or the invasions will get old quickly. But you will. Craft the World is pretty good at catching your attention, just to mine out another layer of minerals, or to equip another one of your suicidal fools in something that might keep him alive...If you have time to spare, and like dwarven fools blundering around in a landscape you will probably flatten and rebuild entirely, give the game a try. I found it suprisingly amusing.			"

												On the surface, Craft the World seems like a Terraria lite kind of game. I would compare it to a mix of Terraria and Game of Dwarves. On its own Craft the World is a creative digging/crafting game where you encourage your motley group of dwarves to do your bidding as you tend to their needs; things like comfort, food, and guiding them for self-defense.The game is brightly animated with an easy to follow control scheme. The interface alerts you to the vital statistics of your dwarves when they are low health, when they die, and even if they are drowning.The game itself keeps the challenge interesting with a nighttime cycle and then an occasional evil portal that wll open up and spawn groups of enemies. Encouraging a somewhat tactical mindset while playing the game when it comes to where and how you construct the home for your dwarves.Overall I find this game amazingly fun to play and have lost quite a few hours with it since purchasing it. If you're unsure about what the game is like you can also find some Let's Plays by Splattercat, who has done a great job in the past of showcasing the quality and enjoyment of the game.			"

												Its a great game but...100hrs in, had to mod the game (or its awfully ""slow"") but I'm only giving this negative review because the devs keep going in the wrong direction and won't fix problems that the community is screaming for. Dwarfs have horrible AITower Defense style combat that was somewhat lost in translation (you'll see what I mean when the hordes get big)Extremely slow (I mod their movement speed, Devs increased block durability... to slow you down more)The levels are Worlds, which you have to beat to unlock the next, no biggie but if a bug prevents you from proceeding, lol start over. (they took care of most of these) You have to pump in tons of hours to get through these worlds, so getting there and reporting a bug to which no Dev responds in the forums is a waste. MultiplayerJust browse the forums to see how messed up this is. Let's just say less than 1% have the achievement that they played it. The recent DLC release...Playing as a female dwarf costs money... okay, well they also added pets which automatically kills rats (which they introduced in the update with the DLC) but if you don't have the DLC, you have to manually kill rats that pop up in your base.... a lot.... see the forums to know what I mean.Great game but wish they would listen to the community. I'd grab it on sale and you'll enjoy it.  "

												The love-hate relationship with an addictive videogame can be a thing of beauty.Silly dwarves at times can add frustration, but mostly humor in my opinion, and they are improving with time and the more I know what to expect, despite them seeming to have their own agendas occasionally..To me, it is very unusual to actually enjoy an RTS of any kind.  This may not be your standard RTS anyway, if at all, but it can be both challenging and relaxing, with hours disappearing before you realize you are still on the first level.  It doesn't force you to progress any further or faster than you want to, without holding your hand either.  Dwarves will perish, tears will be shed, but you will learn from your mistakes at your own pace.And love every second of it, at least I do.(got for free, as gift from a friend, so I assume that is what the checkbox is for..)

												I've played for 25 hours while writing this review. At this point I just finished setting up a solid basis for level 2 after several attempts. (I don't play a lot of management games, which this is).Level 1 was a lot of fun. You get a dwarf, explore, gather, build. More dwarves, more stuff, more eploration. After a while I found this game to be a lot about improving processes. You start doing something and you see what works and what doesn't so you improve. Exploring how to get the whole show running is a fun process and now at lvl 2 this gets harder, so more learning by doing.I recommend this game because it's fun and you wanna improve on what you are doing. I gotta say that the dwarves sometimes are really stupid, which is annoying. If you wanna mine a 4x4 piece of earth you have to guide them through it. Otherwise they hack away to later find out they can no longer reach the top pieces. Also if you wanna close off a dead end, they sometimes close it off in a way they trap themselves in. Another example is them going kamikaze on bosses. All in all they work well enough and actually guiding them around their stupidity seems like just another challenge.I can easily see myself spending another 25 hours to reach higher levels to see what they have in store. (I haven't done multiplayer yet, but it's there).			"

												It's a game that brings us a certain amount of fun and a little laughs, with easy learning and complexity and medium difficulty. The individual dwarves control of the dwarves gives it an interesting peculiarity, I felt like an improvement over ""Lemmings"", though it's complicated to control them one by one when you have a lot of workers and the game AI kinda force you to do that because it seems to take your pawns to horible places and taking awful paths. Multiplayer mode seems too restricted, looks like an unfinished job... Low replayability, probably only in multiplayer mode for fun with friends (not nearly the appeal of Terraria and similars). It worth the 75% off sale price, not more.			"

												There's a lot to like about Craft the World. The art is good, the music is great, the theme and overall gameplay is pretty good.However, you progress through the game by either chewing through the entire tech tree (Dozens of hours worth of work), or by taking out two preposterously tough creatures which require mid-grade gear to have a prayer, and high end gear to reasonably take on.Once you beat a level, you get to move on to a different biome theme and grind the same tech tree over again until you either research everything or take out a couple preposterously difficult monsters.On top of this, the ""quests"" really don't give an indication of the end game, just that you need to build seventeen flower pots to level up so you can learn the next weapon crafting so you can learn farming.If they revisited victory conditions, and the tech trees, this would be a really pretty cool game.As an example: Forest Biome - Accomplish 3 of the following (Create a lake of X size, Harvest a bajillion wood, Build a keep of X size, Kill supertough badguy, Complete the tech tree, etc). For the tech trees, if they split them out into Military, Resource, and Keep trees with specific recipes requiring levels from other trees (such as traps being in the keep tree, but not being available without iron weapons) it would go miles, as currently it seems like the progression is driven by a pattern rather than a logical progression.There is a lot of good in this game, but progression is stymied by the victory conditions literally being ""grind tech for ten hours to get to the next level to grind tech for ten more hours"". I can't recommend this game as a result.			"

The Dwarf AI is garbage, they constantly will mine blocks they are standing on and fall, block themselves into tunnels, and poor group priority makes them into a digital joke about union workers. I guess it was worth it for $6.74, but the money would have been better spent to Starbound or Terraria.			"

								Yes, it looks and sounds like just another Minecraft/Terraria clone, but it's far from it. Instead of being the lone adventurer out to build a massive sprawling castle or making pretty blocky statues and such, you're the overseer of a group of dwarves. You select where to mine, chop, fight or build and they do their best to fulfill the orders while acting autonomously.Many games let you whip together every item as long as you've memorized the recipe. In this, we see items gatewayed behind a Tech Tree, which requires you to build and equip/use/place each type of item to unlock the next items. The game also presents you with a series of Tasks, mostly boiling down to advancing the Tech Tree, but it helps guide your building and exploring instead of endlessly digging through random terrain. You always have at least one goal to work towards.Your Dwarves will require food and shelter and protection, as the denizens of this world will actively seek to plunder your resources. Build your defenses well and craft new weapons and armour to keep it safe. Each Dwarf can learn up to three skills which help them in combat, crafting or movement; a new Dwarf starts with one random skill, and the second two can be added by you with Skill Books which are found throughout the world.While Craft the World may look like Terraria, it's closer to a 2D Towns or Dwarf Fortress or Dungeon Keeper. For an Early Access game, it's feeling very much like it's close to launch-ready. I'm sure there are more features to add in and refinements and optimizations to go, don't get me wrong, I just mean that it's a very well-done beta; it feels like a full game instead of a skeleton with promise.The initial learning curve is fairly easy as long as you stay focused on building a proper shelter (I recommend underground) ASAP. It can be easy to get distracted by exploration or mining and then night falls and your Dwarves are all tired, hungry and under siege by skeletons or goblins.			"

 Examples of flaws in this game I told my dwarf to fill a tiny gap in the mine but he decided to moonwalk and drop to his death in a pit of lava.(Not going to lie, pretty fancy way to die)Every so often you get a  wave   horde  of enemies that attack you to keep the game a challenge. But if today is not your day, then you can simply place some dirt combined with some ladders (to  really  confuse them)  in their path and you've fixed the problem, they wont be able to pass. SImple as that.  An entire freaking army blocked by DIRT   kinda sad The local wildlife are all phycologically unstable, and thus have come to realise living is not an option. Most animals commit suicide through drowning in tiny puddles across the plains. If it rains you can find corpses of deceased animals littered around.The tech tree is a cool idea, but        I dont want to make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ roof    IM A DWARF FOR THORIN'S SAKE  WHY DO WE NEED FANCY ROOFS TO MAKE WEAPON'S OF WAR. FLOWERS AND STUFF ARE FOR ELVES.This brings me to another problem, RAIN IS LIKE FLOODS. If you decide to burrow underground you will have a free aquarium. But honestly the game is not bad.  The art style is nice, I enjoy the content and the dwarves are all adorable :3. i really wish that the devs could improve on it though. By making the characters more custumizable. If one of my dwarves die, like the one stated above, I didn't feel much 'sadness', just another dwarf that was suicidal. i just wish that each dwarf is more unique to the others, and when he gains skill level he gets power ups or miscelleanious changes, so that he is different to the lot. I enjoy the game but it sometimes becomes boring due to the tech tree which is a forced manufacture of items you will never use and are expensive to make in order to reach the things you acually want, this concept is in its primary stages and has the potential of improving the game, but at it's current state, the tech tree is more like a forced line of actions, not a choice based decision.So please devs, improve the A.I., make each dwarf more unique and special to the player, and make a better tech tree.

												This is a seriously addicting game!  I keep thinking that I've spent enough time playing and I should try one of my other games, but every morning I wake up thinking about what my dwarves need to do today, how to do things a little more efficiently ... and how I am sooo glad that if / when all my dwarves get killed it doesn't make me start all over again.  I knew I loved this type of game (I own / have played a lot of them), but I had NO idea this one would become a Top Favorite for me!  Absolutely recommended.

								UPDATED REVIEW:This is a great game.  It has great art direction, sound, challenge, options, etc.   It is my favorite city builder/simulation style game from a 2D side view perspective.    I actually like the this more than Terraria, Starbound, etc.   However, this is a different type of game.  In those games you control a person.   In this one you designate things you want people to do.  This is like a side view Dwarf Fortress and it is very well made.    It is still early access.   I played it a lot months ago then stopped playing it for awhile.   I revisited it yesterday and have noticed a lot of changes and improvements.MY FIRST REVIEW OF THIS:So far I haven't gone far enough into this game to have an opinion on the difficulty curve, and I am writing this review when it is still in early access.   This addressed the aspect of the Terraria style game that did not appeal to me as much.   This game does not have you as an individual but, rather you designate tasks for dwarves that you accumulate over time so it is a lot like a side scrolling Dwarf Fortress or Gnomoria.   This is very appealing.   Throw on top of that a superb art direction and I think we have a keeper of a game here.  Well done!   This has the best art style of any game in this genre so far in my opinion.   It is great for the base building fans, survival fans, etc.    It is still early access... I am excited to see where they take this.   I also have only played 99 minutes at the time of writing this, but I very much have enjoyed the time I have spent.			"

												A very nice Terraria/Starbound type game, with exploring, gathering resources, building, crafting, monsters, technology, magic, beer and DWARVES. Neat funny graphics, quite big technology tree, numerous resources, mobs and items. I have a lots of fun playing this game. As for the disadvantages, I see three or so:1. Need to start every level of the campaign completely from scratch, with one dwarf, no tech, no home, no items.2. Basically only 2-3 musical themes - menu, nice/day and spooky/night. These become annoying after some 10 hours of playing and you're probaly not far on the first level yet then.3. Artificial Stupidity of the Dwarves and, fortunately, monsters.The gameplay in a world consists of three stages:1. Balancing on the brink of doom.2. Building a vast and well defended keep.3. Sweeping the world in search for THE five secreet rooms to rebuild the portal and advance to the next level.And one piece of advice - do not try to build anything above the ground in the first step - go under.

								First of all, I only have 10 minutes of playtime logged because I played most of it in offline mode. Even though I haven't played much with this game (I have a HUGE Backlog).  I really enjoyed taking a sneak peek into it. The graphics and artwork is cute and beautiful and the game itself is in a more advanced stage so I think you can already have hours of fun with it. (so it's not an ugly looking beta or a tech demo)I'd especially like to praise the UI. It's really polished and streamlined with big, easy to see icons and descriptions. I have difficulty to see (even with eyeglasses) and quite a few times I have to squint when looking at things when playing Terraria for example. Probably the only disadvantage is the lack of a tutorial. The game is updated fairly often, and it seems like the developers really care and they aren't planning on abandoning it. If you like side-scrolling games like Terraria and Starbound with a pinch of Dwarf Fortress but you want to see a different, non-pixel art graphics and a more good looking user interface then I wholeheartedly recommend you this game.

								Wow, I can't believe this game is an alpha!In my opinion Craft the world is a mix between Terraria (the 2D world with the mining and the dungeons), Gnomoria (controlling several gnomes to build your own home) and Minecraft (the crafting system).I really like these kind of games and I am happy to have Craft the world in my collection! It runs really good and without errors, although it is an alpha.The gameplay is really fun. You start in the world with only one dwarf, but with every level up, you get another one and so you can build your own dwarf castle and you have to defend it against several monsters, which are also getting stronger. You can equip them with weapon and armor and you can improve their skills with special skill books.			"

Early Access Review
								READ!!This game has a lot of potential. It's like terraria with minions that do the work unless you take control of them. The building aspect is a lacking and doesnt interact with neighboring blocks really well. For example all the brick blocks have only one texture so they look like checker board when you lay them down like the brick wall. One item takes at least a whole block. If you place a wall block, its limited to what form it can take which could lead to some walls looking sawed off instead of aesthetically pleasing. Theres other pet-peeves here and there. The game currently doesn't feel like they have an end game content since there's no plot, missions, many point of interest or crafting/building is still limited. However in the time I did spend with it, I did enjoy. I'm expecting the devs have a lot of great plans for this game.It's irresponsible for any reviewer to bash this game saying its a Terraria or Minecraft copy. It has some similar traits but the play style and visuals are different. We can say all the platformers are copying Mario or the puzzle games copying Tetris.-= Suggestions for Devs (since I'm lazy to post in their forums) =-- Simplify the crafting. It can get tidious with the whole drag and drop thing.- More variety of items, building synergy and textures- A sense of direction. I feel like I'm just trying to grind my way up the tech tree because i dont want to waste my limited mats on stuff that'll be replaced quickly in the future. - Giving quests, main story and the like gives players a stronger sense of purpose along with/or besides the I just want to build s**t. - Defeat epic enemies to unlock powerful spells, uncraftable items, building technique or technologies? No different than the tech tree style.- They can choose to partake in these quests/story or just explore and build stuff. For the uncraftable stuff. It could be randomly crafted through a machine or craftable in sandbox mode or something. There's more to recommend but these are good starters.It might seem like a negative review but I actually recommend people to give this a try. I'm expecting this game to be great in the future!			"

Early Access Review
								This game has serious potential to be a great game, however, there are several game mechanics that are handled in the wrong way.Firstly, the tech tree. Whilst a great idea, it forces you to build pointless items for which you have no use for, in order to unlock some of the more basic requirements in the early game. In my personal opinion, it would have been better to have several seperate tech trees to allow you to work towards the things you need. For example: A tech tree for weapons, armour, tools, furniture etc.Secondly, you can't control groups of dwarves. You can either select one dwarf and control him manually (or give him an order to sleep/ eat), or select all dwarves to do one task. I was hoping that I would be able to select a few dwarves to cut down trees, some to mine, some to fight etc. You also cannot select a few dwarves and tell them where to move to, unless you are controlling each one individually, or giving them a task to do (e.g Mine that block). This becomes particularly annoying when you are being attacked by monsters in the early game. Your dwarves will just run in and die fighting and there is nothing you can do to stop them unless you purposefully trap them underground before the attacks.Lastly, with all these things in mind, you are attacked by monsters every night. Whilst not as devestating as one of the full waves of monsters that occurs every 45 minutes or so (If I remember the time correctly), there is the occasional monster that is just too strong for your 2-3 dwarves that you would have by that point. Having not being able to unlock some of the better weapons/ armour (because you essentially have to learn how to make a salad before you can construct a furnace, to make steel) and with your dwarves charging in carelessly, you will find yourself losing all your dwarves within the first 20 minutes of the game. That aside, if you lose all dwarves, one will respawn at your stockpile around 2 minutes after everyone else was wiped out.Problems aside, this game looks fantastic, especially for an Early Access game. If you like Terraria, this game is a good choice for you. Just take into account the things I have mentioned before buying. Whilst slightly disappointed, I can see the potential, I will wait before uninstalling it, hoping that some changes will be made for the final release.			"

												If you want a cross between Terraria and a super simple base building game (like say Gnomoria), I recommend this game, although you might want to check out some gameplay vids to see if it matches your preferences. I enjoyed my time with the game a lot.You control a squad of Dwarves, you ""research"" tech by completing earlier tech, and you get spells to cast. Waves of monsters come at night so you have to defend your base. Underground digging can unearth dangerous monsters too.Don't get it for multiplayer. I read about how to get that working a couple months ago, I gave up before even trying. No saves and it requires an advanced single-player game structure or something. High points for me was enjoyable digging/exploring experience, fun managing a group of guys (something I enjoy a lot, as opposed to singular direct control ala Terreria), building infrastructure like elevators and railroads, building up a base structure. Low points include tedious craft UI, fun techs come late in the tech tree (railroads come after you've had to build a ton of infrastructure already), low variety of enemies, night-time enemy waves get annoyingly strong eventually.I'm glad I played it and I do recommend it for fans of the genres mining and base-building.

												I like this game, it is far from perfect, the AI is legally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in so many instances ( no offense to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ people) and it feels grindy at times with the tech tree.. but these kind of 'harvest the resources while you make base' games like this are seriously crack for my brain. Its not even the best example of this kind of genre, but it does it good enough that when I pick it up I am pulled in for several hours at a time. The first time I played I played for something like 8 or 9 hrs straight. I know this game isn't for everyone, but if you can forgive its  minor flaws and enjoy the kinds of games its styled off of, I would say give it a shot, especially if its on a good sale.While there is no native Linux version, I had no problem running it on WINE in Mint 18.1, so bonus points for that.

												Craft the World: 6-7/10.-4 World types to build the ultimate dwarf fortress.-Each world has it's own unique dangers and environmental challenges. -Each time you get a certain amount of experience points, you get 1 more dwarf (up to 13 I believe) and unlock new things to craft.Con: A very poor crafting system. Each recipes has to be hand placed the first time, before you're allowed to mass produce an item. When you have dozen upon dozens of crafting recipes these can be very irriating. Plus the craft tree made you have to craft every recipe to get to the higher ones, with the game progression this often meant having useless gear that just needed to be crafted to get to the next tier of crafting. Mindless grind. Con: Complete lack of a storyline, even though story like elements appear in the game.Con: Each dwarf has three skills that can be leveled up. Although those skills don't seem to actually benefit the dwarf in any noticeable way. Nor are the dwaves drawn to their choosen profession. Just because a dwarf is a logger, doesn't mean they'll be the ones cutting the trees down (and again the skills don't actually add anything).Con: And this is huge. While the game doesn't take up much space, every time they come out with a new DLC, it automatically downloads into your game and needs to be unlocked (purchased) to be used.  And what's more the DLC's all seem to be a feature that should have been part of the initial game. For instances one DLC allows for faster dwarves that look vaguely female. Another allows for multiplayer. If you're going to download it onto my computer, and then require me to buy a feature that should have come out with the normal game, it's going to♥♥♥♥♥♥some people off. Honestly while I'm normally against pirating games these DLC's make me want to break those personal rules. Conclusion: I know I've listed mostly con's, and if you can pickup this game at a large discount I'd recommend buying it to try if you like sandbox games. But overall it's a very shallow game. It has a tablet game type feel that tried to be a real PC game and failed horribly. Overall with the fact it automatically downloads the DLC without purchasing the game and then requires you to unlock it, when the DLC should have been a normal feature of the game instead of a ""we want more money"" DLC; has me thinking I'm going to avoid games coming from this company in the future. A side note to the Dekovir Entertainment. Here's a suggestions for a future game DLC. Call it the ""Options"" DLC. For just 10 bucks you get the ability to adjust sound settings, maybe change screen resolutions.  "

												The game is fun for a little bit but gets really frustrating how slow, dumb, and tedious things get real quickly.Ore is incredibly sparse and will find myself with 300 dirt for a dozen pieces of iron. Sometimes I end up gathering more mythril than anything else because how sparse iron and gold are. You can't sell to the trader which would be great if you could because I have a tremendous amount of worthless dirt I wouldn't mind trading for just a single piece of wool since these dwarves are too dumb to invent shears or produce cotton; Or make rope out of plant fibre would be nice. Why do I have to kill sheep that spawn at the very edges of the map for one piece of wool? Tedious. Another miserable aspect is the stockpile. It just spawns at the beginning of the game wherever it damn well feels like and you can't pick it up or remove it even with stockpiles unlocked in the tech tree. It is always located in a worthless spot and gets dwarves killed because their ai is so bad one or two always end up trying to protect the abondoned stockpile. But don't worry, according to posts back in 2013, the developer is going to get right on that. Yep, riiiiight on that.Ironically, the dwarves just ruin the whole game. You can't manage them in any sane way. They just do what they feel like in the most un organized and inefficient way possible. One dwarf will mine a rock, then go mine a different rock on the complete other side of the map because a dwarf on that side of the map decided to mine the next rock while a third dwarf will decide to pick up the rock mined and then go lumbering back to the other side of the map to pick up a leaf. When giving build orders, dwarves are too stupid to do more than one task at once. So to build a ladder 4 down it would take 4 dwarves instead of the logical idea of having one dwarf just carry 4 damn ladder pieces since they have the inventory for it. On top of that all, dwarves keep having the pathfinding lost bubble over there head because the ai can't remember how to walk down a straight corridor at times so they just sit there, stupidly, several seconds at a time before remembering how feet work. Also, you get skill books you can give to your dwaves but overall they seem like a complete waste of time. You can't control who does what job so the person I used all my smithing books on will still just be chopping trees while the person with the miller stats prioritizes smithing and cooking as much as any other dwarf. Stupid design choice.Overall, go play Dwarf Fortress. It can be hard to start but the wiki is really in depth and contains way more fun frustration than this game ever will and it's free; plus you don't have to pay 5 dollars more for girls to be in the game. Not that they added anything to craft the world so what a waste of $5 that was.In dwarf fortress, dwarves could breed. You know, when one dwarf sticks its pick in another dwarf and a baby is mined out. And then die usually in some horrible way to a forgotten beast made entirely of fire. Then you could setup an orphanage with all of your masterfully crafted wooden tables and chairs. Then flip a switch and flood the orphanage with lava. Orphans live very tragic lives in dwarf fortress.			"

								In the state that I've played the game, Craft The World is far from finished. Bugs are still being ironed out and features are added. Does that mean that the game is un-enjoyable? No, quite the contrary. Even though the game is not a finished product I've enjoyed every single minute of gameplay that I've had the chance to experience so far.The learning curve may be a bit steep (not compared to Dwarf's Fortress of course) and new players may have a hard time getting a proper shelter built before the waves of goblins and hordes of the undead start to harass your poor dwarves. You will however get the hang of it after some time, patience is a virtue after all. A small tip for all the other new players: If you want to get a good first impression of the game, do not make your first map a huge one with sandbox mode and permadeath. It'll drive you insane. Go for the campaign instead.The graphics are similar to games like Terraria and Minecraft but every dwarf still has a nice and personal touch to them and the world is looking lush and fancy in general, do keep in mind that I have yet to try the snow map. Gameplaywise I find it hard to describe what other games this title is similar to, especially since I've only played a few hours of Dwarf's Fortress and I haven't even tried Gnomoria (it seems like CTW is most commonly compared to these two titles). There are some occasional bugs here and there, longer work queues tend to make your small workers utterly confused and the not having the option to move your original stockpile may feel a bit annoying at times but for me that still doesn't prevent me from having a good time. Overall I really enjoy Craft The World and I would recommend it to anyone who's a fan of sandbox-style games, crafting and dwarves.			"

												First time playing, dig, dig, dig, accidentaly find below the dwarfs a giant mob (later found out is called scroll keeper) so I command my dwarfs to mine some blocks above his home, little did I know that his home had a hole at the top and stuff mined by the dwarfs dropped is home at his feet. So my genius dwarfs go inside to pickup the loot and take a f- ton of damage. I opened a portal for them to leave, but they keep coming back to get the loot! Ahhhhh... they all died trying to get the loot.10/10 - Would watch Dwarfs loot again			"

												**WARNING** This review is extremly bias towards the game as I find it amazing and a shame that these awesome devs are not more popular, so here's my extra two cents to try and help the game out.Let me tell you about this beautiful gem of a game. It starts on the outside with very light dwarf fortress gameplay meets gorgeous terraria like art, but that's just what you observe without playing it.First, the community, players are super helpful at answering questions, content sharing is a bit on the low here, the subreddit has more of that http://www.reddit.com/r/CraftTheWorld/. This includes the devs, I've wasted around $30 on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ early access games that take the money and run, the constant news and updates here are looking promising that this is not the case, I see a lot of potential still in this game and hope many updates are to come.Now, actually going into the game, first thing I noticed just looking around, the artwork, again, is amazing and unique. The background, the sky, the underground all beautifully polished. Next is the amount of resources, wool to mythril resources and everything in between are in the game, I'll let you mostly imagine the possibilities this leaves, but I'll name a few: Statues, carpets, walls, bookshelves, ect. Pretty much whatever you want your base to look like, you can, and it will turn out awesome, I'm guessing you can't picture this through my words so I've taken a sample http://imgur.com/F3LYqH8. What was guarding his base you ask? Turrets, definitely something new brought to the genre with this game is wooden and tesla turrets that protect your base from the waves of monsters that come. These turrets are well balanced and on their own don't completely wipe the monster waves, normally that's up to your men while the turrets support, though, as seen here, you cheese base designs to effectively let turrets do all the work if you so choose.Next the monster, anything from your average skeleton and zombies to goblin tribes that set up shop acrossed from you and giant underground demons are in this game, if you've played terraria, the large demons are close in scale to their bosses but changed gameplay wise because of this being a rts.Well, I hope I've done the game some justice, ultimately it's your decision on if you get the game or not but I STRONGLY recommend it. Cheers!			"

												This game is incredibly fun but isn't without it's problems. The AI is often a bit weird and clunky.. I found myself watching my dwarves going about their business and sometimes getting frustrated about their pathing and who does what. Even attempting to manually control them via giving them commands to Eat or Sleep can be weird, sometimes I found myself having to give them the command more than once before they'd actually go and do it. Taking direct control is also clunky and usually not even worth it. Even with their AI and pathing problems it's just easier to let them figure it out themselves than to take control and immediately feel confused about how to do anything and be slower about it. They also aren't 'smart' enough with some commands, like digging.. if you want them to dig in an area you have to be ready to babysit them a bit, because if you mark a bunch of stuff at once the game will sometimes cancel all the options because the blocks behind the first block are not 'reachable'. Still... I did enjoy this game. I would honestly have more hours on it if I didn't keep myself from playing it, because once I start I keep on playing until the afternoon of the following day and I regret it. It's incredibly easy for time to slip away from you as you play this, it's a very 'well one more action here, and oh, i found some new stuff, and I need some wood, so I'll queue these up and then I totally will take the dog for his evening walk oh♥♥♥♥♥♥it's already 4am' sort of game.

Now hope that my review is helpful and that you will buy this awesome game!Have fun gaming!			"

												... This game is an interesting introduction to casual games for me.I chop a tree.  You get an experience.  You kill a skeleton.  You get an experience.You learn how to put a wooden helmet on.  You get a lot experience.You mine rocks?  Oh wow, I must be amazing or the Second Messiah or something!... I think Ive played so many games that actually encourage challenge and immediate death to your vitals that playing a game like this is much like shaking a rattle in front of a baby who is in fact armed with a morninstar and several gallons of Red Bull.      After gaining several levels in the first campaign consecutively for figuring out how I did a Torch, I am so afraid of progressing in this game simply because of the PTSD flashbacks from Dark Souls.  I didnt even know you could get those from a video game.        Regardless, play it.  Have fun.  Because its a casual game..... right?   Just...  Im watchin you game.  Any game that gives you THAT much stuff at the beginning is plotting death at the end.  Im onto you.			"

								I was unsure about this game at first; yet another sandbox one might say! However, Craft the World expertly mixes multiple genres into something interesting to play. While only in 'early access' at this time, it already has more than enough to count as a 'completed game'. It is a nice alternative to more intense games (Dwarf Fortress), that is easier to pick up and play- or return to, after a break. Short bursts are better managed by the slightly more casual style, and the 'tower defence' aspect is well implimented.As an individual who is rather picky about games, and who doesn't often (ever, really) write recommendations, the very fact I am should speak volumes on this game. While Craft the World is not perfect- and could use some better pacing in areas, possibly a refinement to the crafting tree at times- it is better than anything I've played in a while. You are unlikely to be disappointed should you acquire this title.			"

Early Access Review
								I normally do not buy ""early access"" games, simply because I hate paying money for an unfished buggy game that only contains a fraction of the content you have been promised. And I am also too impatient to wait for the game to finish before playing it, so I always end up with a bad experience of the game.After seeing a video of the gameplay for Craft the World, I fell in love with the simple design, yet rather good looking. I have to admit that this is no AAA game with perfect graphics like Crysis, but it is not anything like many of the Indie games you find on greenlight. The artwork is good looking, and the animations are just good.So, what works?Pretty much everything. Although there is currently only 2 levels out of what seems to be 5 when released, each level still offers about 10 hours of gameplay before finished. This does not include the ""endless game"" option you also have, which could have as much as 50 hours of gameplay. Each level can also be continued, as you don't have to go through the portal into the next level until you want to. Nice touch.I'd like to state that this game has a few bugs still, but the devs have been very good at fixing these. I saw 3 patches just before christmas, a week apart, fixing pretty much everything I had to complain about. So, what doesn't work?Well, the pathing of the dwarves (your minions) is sometimes strange. The UI cannot recognize a ladder, and when you take control of the dwarves it gets worse. If he is climbing while you possess him, he will fall down the ladder. Apparently dwarves cannot multitask.Also sometimes when you have possession of a dwarf he will not use the ladder but tries to scale the cliffs himself, but the code does not allow this as there is a ladder. So there are a few annoying bugs, but most can be solved simply by stop possessing him for a second, before regaining control. Annoying, but something that is being worked on right now (read more on the forum for known bugs).Conclusion:I have seen many released games with more bugs (X-rebirth anyone?), even big AAA titles (Yes Rome2, I'm looking at you!). Had this game contained all 5 levels (As it seems they want to include in the final game - I still hope for more levels as DLC), I would not feel this was a bad purchase for 12-15€ or whatever I paid for the game in its current state.With the developers being very good at maintaining a frequent patching frequenzy I am sure this game will soon be without bugs. Then this game is an absolutely must buy!Final verdict:Graphics: 7/10Gameplay: 9/10Replayability: 8/10Value for money: 10/10roughly 10 hours gameplay pr. level time 5 levels = 50 hours of fun gameplay. Add another 50 if you want the endless sandbox mode and want to obtain everything. So 100 hours of gameplay for 1/3 the price of an AAA title? This is a must buy title!!!Oh yeah, and when the Dwarves charge to battle, they scream something incoherent that sounds like ""On to da turd"". For that laugh alone the game is worth it's pricetag.

								This is a great game, somewhat like terraria but in this game you control a tribe instead of one guy.The crafting system is very solid. There is loads of things you can craft. The craft tree unlocks more crafting recipes the more things you craft which makes this game really fun because you discover new ways to protect your base and you do this how you want it to be done.

												As of late i've been pretty picky about what i play and dont get to dedicated for a game for more then a few hours unless its immediatly intrigueing in some way or draws me in.This is one of the special ones for me, I had this sitting in my library and never even touched it for quite a long time, out of boredom i decided to try it and the first hour or so i wasent to impressed felt like something people have already done similarly but as I learnd the game i found out just how great it really was.So the biggest factor about this game for me is probably the versatility in what you can do. you have to have food. you have to get resources to build your structures and better equipment and theres a multitude of ways to go about it all.The dwarfs get bored if you dont feed them a variety of foods. theres constant dangers even after you get pretty well situated theres not really a way around the challenge as i have yet to come across.The replayability is also there. one thing i fear only playing for the 20 or so hours i have. is that once you do it once you did it all but..the cool thing is theres different environments which add unique challenges and makes you think about things a little differently the next time through. and there is definitly a learning curve to efficiency.Another really nice bonus about the game that i really enjoyd and one that i didnt realise was in the game untill i playd it was the fact that each dwarf is unique in himself. you give him the equipment you want, and they all come with a different skill. you can also get them new skills so it's like having a bunch of mini playable character. except you dont play them. although theres that option aswell to a extent.while everything in the game doesent sound all that impressive or new. its the combination of it all. it's got a little bit of everything in it and i think thats what makes this game ultimately great.Another good thing about it is the devs are still working on it and its continually getting updates and they even go the extra mile to add in holiday events and do their best to respond to what the people are interested in most.this game is well worth it as is, and in the future this game could be perfect. i would spend good money on this if i knew what it was before i playd it. and im a bit of a tight wad.This game in its current state though does have a few bugs i dont particularly appreciate but it doesent break the game for me at all its still incredibly enjoyable. just ocassionally frustrating. all games normally have something wrong with them and atleast the ones ive expirienced so far doesent degrade its value its very well built and polished considering the minor issues ive expirienced.With that said i would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a fairly casual sandbox/rts/simulation type game. anyone who likes games like Terraria, 7 days to die, minecraft, city builders, and other types of games like that im sure would enjoy it. it's worth trying out if thats your thing and your looking for a new game to play for awhile.

								Craft The World is a unique game that is fun for everbody. It is great for lovers of Sandboxes and Strategies such as myself . This unique game is easy to learn but really does test your skills. I knew that Craft The World was my sort of game as soon as i saw it on steam and i bought it the very next day. With simple but beautiful graphics CTW works with even the slowest of computers. Over all Craft The World is now one of my favourite games and i enjoy even second of playing it and hopefully you will too !                                                                                                                                                                                                  9.4 out of 10                    The Lord Of Pigeons			"

												Quick review for my Friends list, since this is on sale today. Craft the World is a great little indie game! Elements of Terraria and base-building games like Dungeon Keeper, combined into something new. It's a slower-paced game than Terraria, and rewarding in a different way. A great deal at $5.			"

								In a nutshell the game takes influences from Dungeon Keeper, Dwarf Fortress, Minecraft, and Terraria.You start out with a single dwarf who has to pave the way for a maximum dwarven industrial revolution on a pristine world. Your only hindrance being native goblins, ant nests, and rampant undead trying to make your day worse. The gameplay is rather casual, and involves a lot of waiting, but the presentation is fun, and you end up staring at what your dwarves are doing as they go around their menial labour that you've set out for them. The biggest challenge seems to be the first few days in the game, after which you have probably, and hopefully, unlocked more dwarves, and cleared most of what the game has to offer. Rest is just going down the technology tree towards the final unlockables, which by estimation takes around 10 hours of gameplay, after which you have the chance to start again on a slightly larger map with a little bit more challenge.Sadly, the game gives all the crafting recipes as unlockables, so there is nothing to actually discover, and you end up moving the ingredients one by one into grids. All of which could have been replaced by simply having a craft menu with required ingredients listed. Makes one wonder if the function was added for the sake of copying Minecraft.Many hours of fun if you're into designing your own private haven, sadly the limited resources mean that you have to restart the cycle in order to keep the game fresh. Apart from building, the game has very little to offer, and I would suggest taking any of the games which the game takes influences from. They all do what Craft the World does, except better in their own niché.The game title is misleading, you don't craft the world, you make a base in it and exploit the natural resources. "

												So, I've obviously played enough of this game to judge it. The AI is horrible. It would be laughable if it weren't so mind-numbingly frustrating. The number of times I've watched my dwarfs glitch off of ladders and fall to their death, carry my new bed around for what feels like hours instead of TAKING IT TO THE ♥♥♥♥ING STOCKPILE, stand dumbly right beyond the portal that is closing (costing me another cast to get their dumb asses home)...it's frustrating as f*.The *game*, the fundamental idea of the game, is fun. With some tweaks and patching, it could be really fun.The tech tree is terribly flawed. If it must artificially gate progress, it should be reworked into a more simple tiered setup: wood, farming, stone, iron, steel, silver, gold, mithril. Far too often the game is artifically made difficult and the pace slowed because I have to build 30 lamps before I can make armor. It's nonsensical and clearly artificial.The animation is stiff, the new dwarves *don't* look as good as the old ones, but they're passable.You can control a dwarf directly, can and should. Must, even. The AI is so bad, what you want done will never happen unless you do it yourself. You can easily clear blocks 3-5 times faster manually, since the dwarves will go back to the stockpile after every few chopsI can't speak to multiplayer, that's not my preferred gametype. What it should support is Minecraft/Terraria-style cooperative base building: one base, 2+ players. I do not believe it does, though.If they can fix the AI situation, this game will be a definite ""Recommended."" As it is, though, I just don't think the fun outweighs the frustration. 10 hours of relatively fun base-building *easily* gets wiped out by one glitchy death thanks to autosave.			"

			Join my Steam Group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/GeniusPieTrap Get the game here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/248390/ Craft The World is a unique sandbox strategy game, the mix of Dungeon...		

I really like Craft the World and give it a reccomendation, though I do have some issues with it.Keep in mind that I have never made a game in my life. Well I made some simple ones with the help of programs like RPG maker and the such, but I really can not speak on how difficult it is to make games of this scope. The reason I say this is because all though this game is a lot of fun and totally worth a buy it has some problems that seem like they would be very easy to fix.Why on earth for example do we need to drag and drop every single ingrediant to the crafting table? Or why do the right and left mouse buttons do different things depending on what you are clicking on? Why can we not change the key bindings? Many other examples of minor but annoying design issues exist that seem like they would be a quick fix.Still, nothing that you can't get used to. The annoyances are worth the fun.			"

												This is a really solid little sandbox game. Takes a lot of elements from games like Dwarf Fortress. Add an RTS element and gives you a retro 2D perspective with tons to explore like Terarria. Really solid graphic design also. The learning curve is a bit steep but it's really fun once you get going!			"

												I asked for a refund when I first bought it, I decided to give it a chance again.Now, I'll keep it but I'd like the developer to take those concerns in note, and to fix them.Overall, it's a good game; crafting, survival, building, it's pretty cool.Like it says in the description, it is a mix between Dungeon Keeper, Terraria and Dwarf Fortress.It is not as good as any of those games though.First problem is the AI/pathfinding, it's pathetic how dumb it is, I just can't stand it, that's the reason why I asked a refund the first time, you want them to do something in particular, nope, they'll leave the home to get some items on the floor that could have wait and then, they're dead because they did not listen to you.Yeah sure, you can make them not leave the house but then they don't seems to do anything even if I tell them to.I could seriously go all day long but I'll stop it here about that part, all you need to know is that the AI is horrible, you though that the AI in Battlefield 1942 was bad? Wait before you play this game, you'll discover a totally new stage of AI/pathfinding... It's sad.Second problem, the lack of content, there's barely any of everything (weapons, monsters, maps, it could have more biomes).The random generating isn't so good.Third problem, the ""sandbox"" isn't that great in this game, you can't create new Worlds and play on many at the same time (like in Terraria) so you're stuck with the Story Worlds.I am not sure about that so it may or may not be a fact unlike what I previously have say.It is that you cannot get back to your previous World once you're advancing in the World after having completed the previous one.  Like I say, I am not sure about this part so don't take it for guarantee.Other than that, it is a good game, but it has lot of flaws that makes you wonder if it is really good.So the problems in a few words; AI/pathfinding, not enough content, bad sandboxing.The good; The concept is cool, the graphics are fine.I'm giving it 4.7/10 and a negative feedback so hopefully the developer can see it and fix it, even if I really doubt that they'll do anything unfortunately.

Early Access Review
								Feels Like a Freemium game on IOS/Android.  A lot of this game was designed to waste your time.  I know it's still early access but some stuff just makes no sense as to why the DEVS chose to make those choices.Crafting is a ton of click and drag.  You can't just auto make something if you have resources.  The least they could do is let us drag a stack so we can put the mats in quicker the way minecraft does.  Instead you can only move ONE SINGLE item to its slot.  Dwarves are randomly selected by the game to do a task.  Rather then the dwarf with the cook skill running over to cook.  The dwarf with the carpenter skill runs over to cook instead.  You have to make a TON of useless items BEFORE you even get access to the items you actually NEED.   The crafting tree doesn't let you actually focus on just the tools path.  You have to learn how to make walls, lights, furniture, food, glass, materials, wooden armor all before you can even use the steel ingot that the tree gives you access too.  You'll be mining silver and gold with an iron axe BEFORE you are using a steel pickaxe.  The crafting tree just needs major overhauling.  A SINGLE replacement dwarf takes 5 minutes.  A SINGLE Mana point takes 5 minutes to replinish.  So if you used up all 60 points of mana.  It'll take SIX HOURS real world time to fill back up fully.  The only way to make it go faster is if you level up.  Then it fills completly.  This is a freemium game mechanic.  Designed to make you want to buy mana refills for real world money.  Can't move your starting stockpile.  So its totally exposed and you have no way of really making a shelter before night fall.  Just not happening.  Ghosts will be upon you way before then.  Also you won't be able to make any doors to use for your shelter until you travel the Civilization like crafting tree which limits you heavily in the early game. Your ""inventory"" is horrid cluttered.  You have to sift through tons of useless stuff to find what you are looking for.  Instead of going to the section that only shows the lighting.  You go to the section that has the lights, armor, tools, traps, walls,.  Can't sell your items.  Once you upgrade your gear you end up with all this old gear that you can't do anything with.  Have to cycle through your dwarves in order to find the one you are looking for rather then just pull down a menu that you can look at and quickly find the dwarf you are looking for. Hopefully all this will change.  Spend so much resources collecting.  Some items take a ton of mats to make.  And there are just so many useless items and some items that make no sense.   The game has you have to make a fishing pole to fish.  After you make one then everyone can freely use it.  So why have to craft it at all?  Why not just let them fish automatically.  You don't even need to equip it.  Same with the buckets.  Dwarves move horrid slow.  And they have to travel back and forth.  You can use a portal but for somereason when they use it the timer on it speeds up.  So rather then be actually open for 4 minutes.  It ends up only open for like 2 minutes from the constant use.

								For an early access game, this is quite good, though highly frustrating. At this point the problems are things like the AI being annoying and there not being a stop/cancel action function, really poor pathfinding, enemies spawning too close to your house (including at the door past your defences!), but otherwise it's okay. My biggest problem is that the tech tree is rather boring as you have to progress through every menial object including about 5 types of window to get to the good stuff, lumbering you with heaps of useless items which you don't seem to be able to destroy (and having crafted them, they're permanently marked in your inventory even if you don't have stock).Basically it's very annoying, but addictive...for a while.

								One of the more polished early access games that doesn't really feel like one.It's a mixture of games. Overall it plays like Dwarf Fortress and a bit like Dungeon Keeper in a side-scrolling Terraria setting with Minecraft crafting.The Dwarf Fortress part is obviously not that complex, but you can still feed, name, equip, somewhat skill your dwarfs. Dwarfs get tired, claim beds, need comfort, run to/from fights and complain.The side-scrolling 2D setting feels like the best compromise as of yet to abstract DF interface and the not so great tries of building 3D representations of other games.There is a lot to craft, in the typical Minecraft way, though the crafting process itself is a bit cumbersome.The game isn't easy, at least in the beginning and the pacing of the game can be best described as slow.Graphics are great and polished, the music and sound effects are also nice, though the snoring of the dwarfs can be a bit annoying. The only technical difficulties right now are Dwarfs getting stuck, but you can take control of any of them and fix this.			"

								It's awesome! How the game looks, presents itself, the small things like skeletons making a ladder out of themselves helping other foes get your dwarfs... fantastic. I've played Dwarf Fortress a bit, seen Gnomoria and played Minecraft and Terraria a lot and I'll say that Cratf The World is indeed a combination of those mentioned above but still provides a unique experience.On the other hand, there are some bugs (it's early access game and you really feel it sometimes), the AI acts weird and restarting or replacing dirt helps new trees grow... seriously xD I run out of trees/wood and had to restart the game (not start over from scratch, just turn off and on again) to get some. Despite bugs it's still quite playable and I personally can't wait for the final release. Good job devs! I've been waiting for something like CTW for quite a while. You've got my pickaxe!			"

Early Access Review
								A combination of Dwarf Fortress, terraria, minecraft, mixed in with a little more tower defense game. It's an early release of the game, so there is only one world/level. It's plenty of fun, but it's far from complete, it still feels like an early beta stage testing of the game. The dwarves are dumb (but i'm use to that from dwarf fortress) and there is no tutorial, no website, and no instructions, the guides are almost non-existant and still being worked on.  So I mean there's a list of things wrong with this game, but...The ideas are solid, the gameplay is fun and addicting, it just need to be polished and built up more. I would recommend pirating it first just to test out the very first verison. Of course it's full of bugs and problems, but if you like the game play, buying it on steam will get you all the patches and upgrades, which is worth it if you like the concept.The art is different and refreshing; so many indie games have 8-bit art, seeing something that doesnt' do 8-bit and also uses some more modern graphics is nice. Also about patches, the developer seems way into patches every 2/3 days ( it's been out for 10 days I think and there's already 4-5 patches/fixes). So if you are involved with the forums here they do listen and they do update often. Because this game is so early in the alpha, I look foward to coming back to this game every couple of weeks and seeing what they did.			"

												(PT-BR / English)Você deve dividir seus esforços entre coletar recursos, construir um abrigo, planejar e construir as defesas deste abrigo, essas defesas serão testadas à cada 45 minutos por um ataque massivo de mortos-vivos. Caso você sobreviva e permaneça no jogo, então seu próximo objetivo será pesquisar, fabricar e equipar seus anões com o set mais forte do jogo (armadura e espada de Mithril), explorar as áreas mais profunda do mapa, encontrar e eliminar o boss da fase (são 4 fases).Como ponto negativo eu devo dizer que esse jogo trava às vezes, porém vc não perde o progresso porque ele deve salvar automaticamente à cada 1 minuto, oque me lembra de outro ponto negativo, não existe opção Save / Load, você não pode salvar, tentar algo ousado e se der errado simplesmente dar load. É um dos meus jogos preferidos, recomendo caso você quiser algo pra passar o tempo, ele é divertido e demorado.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------You must divide your efforts between collect resources, build a shelter, plan and build the defenses of this shelter; these defenses will be tested at every 45 minutes by a massive undead attack.

								It's difficult to write a ""review"" after playing a game for less than one hour. However, I do feel like sharing my impressions.I never got into Minecraft, SOE Landmark seemed nice, but got me bored quickly. For some reason I felt like I should try this game. I bought it in Steam summer sale, and... I'm absolutely enchanted. It's a great management game, combined with cool crafting. Yeah - it's 2D, but my imagination is more than enough to see how amazing my dwarven halls are becoming! It's like being the force behind crafting Moria :D.Really cool, interesting, engaging game. It makes you think, plan, and above all else - HAVE FUN!It's hard to imagine that it's still Early Access, as it's already pretty polished!			"

								It's fun, looks good and well put together.  Good value at the price too and very playable in early access; better in early release than some full release.Some pathing issues with dwarfs running into danger rather than out of it (especially archers).  Archers fire into the ground a lot.  Crafting tree is not logical - not sure that's a big issue but it does feel wrong.  It could probably use item tiers and item stats as per WoW and Terraria as well as an item class structure.  I'd suggest some routes of the crafting tree should preclude others, some could also only appear on accessing a new biome - which would give variety and a chance to explore different options later.  Save game at branch points would be good too. For me there's currently not enough gameplay to make subsequent campaign maps compelling.  They essentially just seem to change biome which tweaks a few aspects but not many and you're forced to rebuild & relearn the same crafting tree.  Better off I'd think with one world but multiple biomes (perhaps unlocked at edge of map) and the ability to set-up secondary bases in them.  Given that this is early access and it's quite good now there is plenty of scope for this to become an all time classic.Wish list - add multiplayer and PVP.			"

												Another rehash of Dwarf Fortress (though I feel somewhat more faithful than others), Craft the World follows in a similar vein as Terraria and every other 2D side-on, grid-world game accused of being a Minecraft clone.What appealed to me specifically about this one is the ability to delegate tasks among a team of controllable characters, allowing them to build skills while creating increasingly better gear/environs for them to live in.Unfortunately - again, as is the case with so many Dorf Fawtwess remixes - the actual end product is a lot more stripped-down than I would have liked, with tasks almost arbitrarily assigned and a hell of a lot of struggling on the AI's end of things.Firstly, don't think you can leave your dwarves unattended:  They'll chase a pebble down a cliff into the waiting maw of some hideous monstrosity if you let them.  Alternatively, their AI might just choke, leaving them sitting on the spot until you give them a kicking (taking direct control for a while or recalling everyone to base seems to shake them out of it).  Furthermore, your dwarves are thick as bricks when it comes to combat, so you can expect them to die a lot on the higher difficulties because of their habit of leaving cover to crowdsurd the enemy horde.Secondly, there's no such thing as a quick game.  The fastest you can speed things up is double time and even then, your dwarves walk slower than a funeral procession.  Take into account some of the massive worlds you can generate and getting from one end to the other involves either spamming portal spells until your mana runs out or watching a movie while you wait for your guys to pick up a single log from the edge of the map.The tech tree feels a little restrictive, forcing you to create a certain number of objects before allowing you to progress, which can get super frustrating if your base spawned in an area almost devoid of, say, iron.  I understand that a 'sandbox' tech tree mode is available, I'm just saying that in the campaign, it feels a bit cheap to have to make bucketloads of nails when what my dorfs really need is a good pickaxe.Mind you, I've still managed to pour 65 infuriating hours into this game despite these shortcomings, and I'd say it's almost purely because I've got an unhealthy addiction to delegative fantasy sandbox worldbuilders with rpg elements.  This wasn't a great way to scratch that itch, but I'll recommend it to that very specific audience until I find something better.			"

								It's awesome! How the game looks, presents itself, the small things like skeletons making a ladder out of themselves helping other foes get your dwarfs... fantastic. I've played Dwarf Fortress a bit, seen Gnomoria and played Minecraft and Terraria a lot and I'll say that Cratf The World is indeed a combination of those mentioned above but still provides a unique experience.On the other hand, there are some bugs (it's early access game and you really feel it sometimes), the AI acts weird and restarting or replacing dirt helps new trees grow... seriously xD I run out of trees/wood and had to restart the game (not start over from scratch, just turn off and on again) to get some. Despite bugs it's still quite playable and I personally can't wait for the final release. Good job devs! I've been waiting for something like CTW for quite a while. You've got my pickaxe!			"

								By far one of the most complete and finished early access games I've ever came across. It's well worth the full price in my opinion, if you can get it in a sale, even better. Sure it has bugs, like any other early access, but those bugs are actually attended to and fixed by the dev's.. got to love the regular updates. They also listen to their community when it comes to suggestions.The game itself has a nice feel to it, great graphics (for early access, graphics/animations are still getting updates, like in the last update), easy to learn but challenging, and has lots of replay value.First time I played it I was really surprised by how fun it was, I loaded the game just to see what it was like and just like that, 6 hours were gone. If you are into this type of game, I wouldn't doubt about getting it, buy it and start building your fort today.			"

								I purchased this game after watching videos of it on YouTube. I was intrigued since I'm a big fan of Terraria and sandbox/rpg game's alike. I must say, CtW is serious fun for serious-to-casual gamers. The crafting tree is excellent. I mean, that's one of the best things I liked about Far Cry 3. However, this game does crafting extremely well. The only problem I have is with the pathfinding, which I'm more than sure will get fixed as the game develops. I just don't like building a bridge to get from one side to the other and my crew swims under it; almost drowning in the process. But it's early access so no biggy. If you like 4x sandboxing, you should definitely get this game NOW. It's a ton of fun being a dwarf leader in this game. After two hours I finally got the go-ahead to craft some armor. I mean, it's a HUGE tech tree and the fun's just barely begun.			"

								Craft the World...what can I say except that this is Early Access done right! Now, be mindful, this is a very niche type of game. It's a 2d crafting/strategy/survival type game. You guide your dwarves to victory by showing them where to mine, cut, harvest, and fight. You gather your resources, build yourself a secure base and then seek out the parts of the portal to the next world. Survive, thrive, and build through your technology trees and ultimately build the portal and head to the next world. The pathing is a little goofy at times but in those cases you can take direct control of a dwarf and provide a bit more direct guidance. So far I have been looking for the downside to this game and I really can't find anything that stands out. It's well made, fun (if you like this type of thing) and good for spending lots of casual hours exploring, crafting, and in general just having a good time with your stalwart little fellows. It has a fairly large technology tree and the only one I had a bit of trouble with was the rail line which I am sure was my fault. I look forward to seeing what they come up with next. More tech, more enemies, and more fun? Maybe guns or crossbows? Either way, I am sold on this one and if you like games of this type then pick this one up for sure!			"

								I have really enjoyed this game, I have.  There are a few things I think would make the game more enjoyable, and in some cases less of an aggravation.1) Allow the  sandbox mode to eliminate the regular invasions.  As of now the invasions occur about every 40-45 minutes, and they last quite awhile and often times early on it's just too much to handle without incurring some losses and more importantly the loss of time it takes to recover from said invasion.  If you are like me, and you've played through a campaign or two and you just want to build, the 40-45 minute invasions, while it may seem a long time is much much too regular and completely aggravating when all you want to do is clear out that last tunnel to make room for your long railroad. As of now, Tech mode, Sandbox, and the campaign all allow for these pesky massive invasions.2)More actual useful spells.  Magic light isn't all that helpful, imp spell doesn't help a whole lot and in some cases crashes the game, horn spell can be buggy.3)The AI is a bit odd, it would be nice to be able to assign multiple dwarves to specific tasks rather than have a few dwarves pass up the loot on the ground to go after that one block you qued up a long time ago at the very edge of the map.4)Speed up dwarf movement a bit or increase the carrying capacity.  I know the portal spell is suppose to remedy this situation for large mining excursions but damn they still move slowly when burdened and lug only, what 3 items?5)A second earlier back up save to each game might fix the problem I currently found myself into the game.  30 hours in and I have a critical crash bug at the point where the game decided to save.  So now any time I attempt to load this game it immediately crashes to desktop.  No I did not use imps, just 11 dwarves, massive invasions and way too much loot got to be a bit taxing I suppose.That's all from me I think, As I said before, I've really enjoyed the game and I highly reccomend it.  I really hope some of these issues are addressed in the future, and look forward to what's to come.			"

								Craft The World has its roots visible in such games as Terraria and Dwarf Fortress, taking from both (and several others) and making something thoroughly enjoyable.I was a little skeptical at first, but this is one of those games where you start playing and the next thing you know there are birds chirping and the sun is rising.Campaign mode revolves around building a safe haven for your dwarves to eat and sleep while they search for pieces of a portal to take them to the next world. While that seems to be the extent of the story, it's more than enough to keep you and your dwarves digging deeper, darker tunnels, upgrading equipment and fighting increasingly difficult monsters.Still in development as of writing this, the game is not without its flaws. The tech tree is a little baffling in its design and you'll often find yourself mass-producing items you'll never use, but this is a minor quibble. The dwarves, while entertaining, lack depth in that they literally have no personalies or relationships beyond having a unique appearance and name.The game's shortcomings do nothing to hamper your fun, however, and as mentioned before, you may find yourself losing an evening or two watching these little guys trying to survive.

								Still in Early Access but everything pretty much works.  Addicting gameplay though building my first shelter had quite the learning curve.  Great graphics. Play either in sandbox mode to build your dwarven kingdom to your content or play the campaign for a bit of a challenge. 3 different maps at this time. Highly recommended.			"

								It's difficult to write a ""review"" after playing a game for less than one hour. However, I do feel like sharing my impressions.I never got into Minecraft, SOE Landmark seemed nice, but got me bored quickly. For some reason I felt like I should try this game. I bought it in Steam summer sale, and... I'm absolutely enchanted. It's a great management game, combined with cool crafting. Yeah - it's 2D, but my imagination is more than enough to see how amazing my dwarven halls are becoming! It's like being the force behind crafting Moria :D.Really cool, interesting, engaging game. It makes you think, plan, and above all else - HAVE FUN!It's hard to imagine that it's still Early Access, as it's already pretty polished!			"

								I purchased this game after watching videos of it on YouTube. I was intrigued since I'm a big fan of Terraria and sandbox/rpg game's alike. I must say, CtW is serious fun for serious-to-casual gamers. The crafting tree is excellent. I mean, that's one of the best things I liked about Far Cry 3. However, this game does crafting extremely well. The only problem I have is with the pathfinding, which I'm more than sure will get fixed as the game develops. I just don't like building a bridge to get from one side to the other and my crew swims under it; almost drowning in the process. But it's early access so no biggy. If you like 4x sandboxing, you should definitely get this game NOW. It's a ton of fun being a dwarf leader in this game. After two hours I finally got the go-ahead to craft some armor. I mean, it's a HUGE tech tree and the fun's just barely begun.			"

								Craft the World...what can I say except that this is Early Access done right! Now, be mindful, this is a very niche type of game. It's a 2d crafting/strategy/survival type game. You guide your dwarves to victory by showing them where to mine, cut, harvest, and fight. You gather your resources, build yourself a secure base and then seek out the parts of the portal to the next world. Survive, thrive, and build through your technology trees and ultimately build the portal and head to the next world. The pathing is a little goofy at times but in those cases you can take direct control of a dwarf and provide a bit more direct guidance. So far I have been looking for the downside to this game and I really can't find anything that stands out. It's well made, fun (if you like this type of thing) and good for spending lots of casual hours exploring, crafting, and in general just having a good time with your stalwart little fellows. It has a fairly large technology tree and the only one I had a bit of trouble with was the rail line which I am sure was my fault. I look forward to seeing what they come up with next. More tech, more enemies, and more fun? Maybe guns or crossbows? Either way, I am sold on this one and if you like games of this type then pick this one up for sure!			"

												Impressive game. Right now it has a few bugs mostly with the dwarves AI but the developers are really looking into and releasing new patches weekly. The game itself is a mix of terraria/tower defense but you are not the main character. Instead, you have a few dwarves to play for you and that makes this game unique. Good graphics and sound. Worth a look for anyone who likes building/godlike games.			"

												This is a very enjoyable game.  Perhaps the best short description would be a cross between Dungeon Keeper and Terraria.  It is a 2D side-view game and the sprites and graphics are really quite well done.Unlike Terraria, however, you do not control a character (well, you can opt to temporarily assume control of an individual dwarf).  Instead, you indicate what you want done (mined, built, attacked, etc.) and the dwarves will take care of it according to their AI priorities.  After the last major update I think any remaining AI pathfinding issues have been resolved.  I've played for many hours post-update and I haven't had any problems with dwarves getting stuck or being unable to find their way home.  Due to pathfinding, at least.One minor annoyance concerns filling in tunnels or pits.  If you order a bunch of blocks filled in, the exact order is unlikely to be the order you clicked on them.  As a result, depending on the layout of the tunnel/pit, a dwarf can be stuck at the end/bottom if the other end is sealed while they are busy filling the correct part.  Then you need to micromanage and reopen the area and fill only part at a time.  Fortunately, this particular issue does not occur very often.Even with my extremely positive view of the game, there are a few minor cons: Occasionally, there are some game mechanics which are unknown or confusing to the player (such as what a shelter is supposed to look like, or getting water on world 2).  A quick Google check will fix this, but the info should be in the game. You can't make a shelter without walls, a roof, and doors, but these items lay several layers into the tech tree.  The problem is that your dwarves cannot heal until you have a shelter with beds.Those are my biggest annoyances, but in the grand scheme of things they're rather minor.  A number of other reviewers have complained about the tech tree resetting when you reach a new world (there are a total of three), but I would liken it to starting a new game of Minecraft on a newly generated world - you don't start with anything advanced in that case either.Actually, I happen to like having the tech tree available.  It allows you to do a little bit of planning ahead, and having the recipes in-game means not having to check the Internet.  The first time you craft something you must drag materials onto the crafting grid, which is a bit silly.  Fortunately, after the first time you can simply click on the build button and the grid will be automatically filled for you which saves a lot of time and means there is no need to memorize the patterns (and there are a lot of them).Given the price to hours played ratio, getting this game is a no-brainer.  Even if I had no interest in playing the second or third worlds it would still be completely worth buying.  If you enjoy world building sandbox type games or you enjoy building-by-proxy type games (ala Dungeon Keeper) then you'll certainly enjoy Craft the World.  It's worth buying at full price, and if you see it on sale then you should immediately jump on it.			"

Craft the World ReviewTL;DR - For those of you who don't want to read a ""wall of text"" this is for you. The game can be addicting, there is a lot to do, however, there is a lot of grinding involved and if you do not micromanage your dwarves later in the game you'll often find that they're off dying to something underground, on the surface or at night when you are telling them to go somewhere else to do something just because a ""threat"" is near the base.If you like grinding, repetative cycles of doing the same things over and over or mindless games where you click on things and watch your own personal minions...errr dwarves doing things then this game is for you. However, if ignorant AI killing themselves would seriously frustrate you then I would stay away from this game because later on the dwarves get their brains eaten by zombies.If you can master building a good base, good defenses early on, and get your dwarves with some decent gear on and pets (MUST HAVE SISTER IN ARMS DLC) then it can help a LOT. I highly recommend making everyone but your archers wear solid armor, shields and weapons. Otherwise the beholders and bigger skeletons make mince meat of your dwarves.The Long Rundown of CTWPositive:Immersive gameplay with a lot to do. There is a bit of a grind and it takes HOURS to get to different tech trees (although some of the tech trees make no sense like why do I have to know how to make beds before I can make a spear to have better weapons than a stick to bonk zombies on the head with) The more you unlock the better comfort you can have in your home and the happier your dwarves are in general when they rest, they rest quicker, and plus it does look nicer (who wants to sleep on a wooden shelf of a bed anyways).The graphics for the game are quite nice and it's lovely with soothing music and it flows together quite nicely.Early on when the monsters are NOT overpowered and you have a decent base up on a hill, a tower of stone (2-4 bricks thick) or something of similar nature then you're almost impervious (later on though it's quite awful we'll get to that later on) and you can have fun building, mining and etc without much of an issue. If you can get some walls up blocking the entrance to your base, and then make your base only have one entrance you can avoid some hordes, night raids and put lots of traps down to make the monsters suffer before they try to rush you and kill you. Later on though the monsters can be a bit difficult so learn the tech trees ASAP for better weapons arnd armor.There are a lot of helpful ""guides"" on Youtube and some people that can give tips on the forums/discussions. The player base is usually friendly and willing to help if you ask a question. There is a wiki on the game too that is also helpful.There are a lot of save files and you can do Multiplayer coop maps for more resources and things so you don't run out on your ""base map"" so you can keep going almost indefinately until you ""complete"" all the objectives like killing scroll keepers, finding underground areas to explore and other things. They now have a multiplayer DLC where you can ""survive"" with friends and build a base to defend against the monsters, renewable resource veins and some other things to do so there is more ""replay"" value if you have friends who play CTW.Negative:Dwarves as smart as a box of rocks, and I mean a box of rocks...even the box is made of rocks. Later on in the game you'll have dwarves run into Troll areas, into lava, or into other areas that they shouldn't even be in. Warning signs are your friends and you have to use them liberally otherwise all you hear is the dwarves ""battle cry"" and a message popping up saying "" x Dwarves have died"" and their little Dwarven souls flying away. If there is an area that is ""dangerous"" such as an ant hill, troll area, etc, then it is best to put warning signs on BOTH sides of the area (use portal spell to get the dwarves there) so they don't EVER try to go into that area. If you don't ""block it off"" then they're likely to run in there and try to 1 vs 10 ants just to get eaten.Monster waves becoming increasingly and liberally more overpowered and bigger later on. I mean every game should have a challenge but when you're at level 10, you can't make steel armor yet or anything that's decent comparable to the enemy waves and you have 20 skeletons knocking down your door, some flying gargoyles, giant trolls and beholders coming in to eat your face. You know it's time to pack up shop and use your ""horn spell"" and have your dwarves rally somewhere else (but then you run into problem 1 and they fight stupid stuff on the way and die sometimes).Finding resources underground can be a bit obnoxious at times. Sometimes you'll find BIG clusters of iron, other times you find a few sparse areas here and there and the biggest issue is when you find some but it's the lining around an ant colony. Good luck fighting them any time soon in the game to get resources. You'd best dig elsewhere or you'll be meat for the masses and they'll pick their ant mandibles with your Dwarven bones. To face those foes you need solid armor, weapons, and all your dwarves fighting them at once with your fireball spell to help clear them out (the Horn spell will rally the Dwarves to the area you want just make sure they have no other assignments anywhere before battling ant hills or boss monsters).NOOOOOOO in depth tutorial. There are a few tips here or there about ""use this thing, use this spell and make sure you upgrade Dwarves"" but there is no in depth ""use these weapons against this type of enemy, or use this armor for this type of person, or this Dwarf is best if you use him here, or there and etc. It would be nice to have an in depth tutorial guide (not campaign) that says what you need to know to learn, do better and not be stuck later on going ""how do I decontruct tools, or what's a horn spell do, and etc"" and you are left searching Youtube to find answers to things you don't know or spending a lot of time on the Wiki trying to figure out how to progress when you get stuck or run out of resources on single player only to learn you must make a new portal to go to a ""multiplayer"" world that you can go into alone to gather coins, come back, and purchase what you're missing, rinse and repeat.There is no guide to the icons above Dwarves heads. Sometimes they have no meanings but other times they do have specific meanings. Like a mountain with a blue arrow means they're trying to find a path to what they need to be doing. Sometimes they'll have the same icon over and over and I can only wonder what my tiny little min....errr Dwarves want or need.The ConclusionIt is an aboslutely FUN game, but later on in late games when the Dwarves all lose their brains, die and can't do anything without dying it becomes an ABSOLUTE game KILLER until you learn how to manage them, keep them out of harms way and it's frustrating for new players. Once you understand what to do it's okay. If the AI was a bit smarter, we could get some kind of Workshop mod to fix their pathing, judgements on decisions or an option to ""retreat sooner"" so they don't wait until they have low HP it would be great. For the standard gamer that wants to kick back, relax and have some fun I have to say it can be frustrating. Maybe they'll put in a tutorial, scale down monster waves,  or make tech tree pathing unlockable in different ways so you can get better armor, weapons and other items you NEED sooner.Hope you enjoyed the review and I hope you found it useful. Thanks for your time reading this review and have a great day! :D Edit 1  After purchasing SISTERS IN ARMS DLC the game is easier and more fun to play. I HIGHLY recommend the DLC to enjoy the game, so I am changing it to recommended.			"

												The Video Game equivilant of crack! I've been a big fan of games like Terraria and Minecraft and Craft the World kinda/sorta falls into the same Catagory but actually has direction and in my oppinion a lot more challenge. You will find that after dedicating hours of your precious time (and losing sleep and those you love) the game does start to hit a repetative streak, but you can't help but fall for the same ""Just one more block!!"" feeling that you get in games like Minecraft.A really well made game that can entertain for days/weeks. I found it fairly bug free and the performance was fantastic. I had to turn the music off after a while as hearing the same song over and over as each day passess almost drivesy you to murder.  My only con is that after you've been stripped of your life force to the addictive nature of the game the repetition hits you and you will just suddently stop playing. That being said, you will give it a few weeks and find that you miss those Dwarves and owe it to them to return. :)One of the best and addictive games i've played in a long time.			"

												I *love* this game!  Very fun gameplay and kinda addictive too.  :)   The one thing I want the most in a next improvement would be the ability to rename the gnones.   This would help me to get attached to them more.   It does not really have any documentation on how to play, but this is good in a way because there is a lot of fun in figuring it out and especially satisfaction in learning how to be super efficient in it.  : )    The only problem I had in the game was there is not enough iron ore in the small size map and you need a lot of that over time.  But?  I found that certain colors of earth can give me all I need and more.			"

												Take the simulation, community management, and crafting aspects of games like Towns, Space Base DF9, and Gnomoria and the 2d graphics of terraria and wrap it in a very well designed interface and you have Craft the World. I have very few complaints about this game but here they are:- Gnomes sometimes fall through the floor if you are changing the shape of a wall piece they are standing on and they are unable to path their way out ofthe hole, you have to take control of that dwarfand jump out, quickly fix the hole and hope that another dwarf doesnt find his way in there while you are switching the block (pausing works but takes just as long to pause the game as it does to fix the hole)- Playing without the tech tree can leave you without some of the basic crafted materials until late in the game. I didnt get the recipe for clay untill after my dwarfs were decked out in silver armor and weapons.- There does not seem to be enough ore to go around in the small worlds, I found myself mining huge swaths of the underground to find a few pieces of iron or silver to finish an itemOn the plus side, this game was worth every cent og the $18.99 I paid for it. Craft the world fits every expectation I have for a crafting/simulation game and it stands strong where others have fallen short. - The game play is easy to learn and the in game tutorials hold your hand at the begining but then let you run free when you are ready - The Gnomes do a great job of collecting every single piece of material left behind, sometimes it takes a while if you have dug a huge hole, cut down a bunch of trees, and purchased some stuff from the shop. The dwarf's carrying capacity is very limited and carrying 3 leaves is the same to them as carrying 3 chunks of stone but they get the job done eventually. Sometimes you just have to sit back and watch them scurry around or use one of the magic spells to help them along. The portal and imp spells work great for gathering large amounts of material left in one place.			"

												Terraria style game but with a strategy game control scheme. You build a shelter for a growing number of dwarves as you explore a world by digging down, mining materials and using them to craft a large number of items to better equip your dwarves.Slow paced but highly addictive and hard to put down. The game is relaxing to play but presents a good challenge at times. Has a charming artstyle and seems to run well on a low end laptop too. "

												This is a very enjoyable game.  Perhaps the best short description would be a cross between Dungeon Keeper and Terraria.  It is a 2D side-view game and the sprites and graphics are really quite well done.Unlike Terraria, however, you do not control a character (well, you can opt to temporarily assume control of an individual dwarf).  Instead, you indicate what you want done (mined, built, attacked, etc.) and the dwarves will take care of it according to their AI priorities.  After the last major update I think any remaining AI pathfinding issues have been resolved.  I've played for many hours post-update and I haven't had any problems with dwarves getting stuck or being unable to find their way home.  Due to pathfinding, at least.One minor annoyance concerns filling in tunnels or pits.  If you order a bunch of blocks filled in, the exact order is unlikely to be the order you clicked on them.  As a result, depending on the layout of the tunnel/pit, a dwarf can be stuck at the end/bottom if the other end is sealed while they are busy filling the correct part.  Then you need to micromanage and reopen the area and fill only part at a time.  Fortunately, this particular issue does not occur very often.Even with my extremely positive view of the game, there are a few minor cons: Occasionally, there are some game mechanics which are unknown or confusing to the player (such as what a shelter is supposed to look like, or getting water on world 2).  A quick Google check will fix this, but the info should be in the game. You can't make a shelter without walls, a roof, and doors, but these items lay several layers into the tech tree.  The problem is that your dwarves cannot heal until you have a shelter with beds.Those are my biggest annoyances, but in the grand scheme of things they're rather minor.  A number of other reviewers have complained about the tech tree resetting when you reach a new world (there are a total of three), but I would liken it to starting a new game of Minecraft on a newly generated world - you don't start with anything advanced in that case either.Actually, I happen to like having the tech tree available.  It allows you to do a little bit of planning ahead, and having the recipes in-game means not having to check the Internet.  The first time you craft something you must drag materials onto the crafting grid, which is a bit silly.  Fortunately, after the first time you can simply click on the build button and the grid will be automatically filled for you which saves a lot of time and means there is no need to memorize the patterns (and there are a lot of them).Given the price to hours played ratio, getting this game is a no-brainer.  Even if I had no interest in playing the second or third worlds it would still be completely worth buying.  If you enjoy world building sandbox type games or you enjoy building-by-proxy type games (ala Dungeon Keeper) then you'll certainly enjoy Craft the World.  It's worth buying at full price, and if you see it on sale then you should immediately jump on it.			"

												It's fun for what it is. A simple goal driven game with a random map generator to keep it intersting. I do wish the crafting was actually fun..It's not. it's just the means to get to the next level.   One gathers the required resources each round, craft, and go to the next harder level...with the exact same crafting goals.Even with that said, I do recommend this game, as I have had a lot of fun playing it. I LIKE resource gathering and hunting for that last boss room.			"

												When I first got this game I sat down to play it for about half an hour to try it out with the intent of moving on to other games I bought. Four hours later I was still playing XD It's definitely addictive and for all the right reasons.The game is straightforward in its mechanics and so I didn't have to muddle through a long drawn out tutorial. Just here, have some dwarves, you should build a shelter, and then further prompts were given through the missions/quests. Crafting recipes made sense and nothing was unreasonably expensive. The things that were expensive were either the really strong stuff or the luxury decorative stuff. I also really liked that wood was not slow to get. A lot of games that rely on crafting will have the trees grow unreasonably slow and since wood is a component in just about everything that can really drag you into a waiting game. In Craft the World the trees resprout quickly so it's just a matter of getting your dwarves out to cut them down.A lot of games like this will have you research a new technology and then after doing so give you the option to craft. This game skips that and you fully research a technology by crafting. Given that you don't have a huge number of dwarves to work with (so far I've gotten to 12 dwarves on the second world) this choice makes sense and frees up a dwarf from being stuck on a research table. Like the crafting recipes the tech tree has a reasonably logical progression.Equipping them is also straightforward with your usual grading up from leather and stone to iron and onwards to mithril. There's a good mix of melee, archers, and mages. The difficulty curve on the monsters matches fairly well, you don't see or can avoid the stronger enemies until your dwarves are reasonably outfitted. Once you hit level 4 you do get monster portals which unleash a wave of monsters on you so proper planning and fortification of your dwarves' home is a must, but that's what online tutorials are for XD It does get a little rough after a while when three portals are opening at once, but you can either build a stupidly thick wall with eight doors or go into the game files and tweak the numbers so the waves aren't quite as brutal.That's really the only major sticking point, though, and as I said there's options! It's definitely not enough to bother me for long. There are a few tiny bug issues, like sometimes when you call the dwarves home they'll get stuck, but if you take control of that dwarf for a second they bounce back and are cool, things like that which take a second to fix if that. Honestly the thing that annoys me is that there's no way to delete or possibly break down for resources older gear. My kids are running around with mithril, they don't need ten stone axes cluttering up the inventory XD But again, that's a nitpick and nothing that kills it.What I was pleasantly surprised about was the curve up. In campaign you have four planets that you unlock one by one. I was a little worried that the only difference in the second world was going to be a slightly larger map and maybe a few more monsters. However then out of nowhere the screen shook and my dwarves nearly got eaten and I probably shouldn't be as excited about that as I was XD There's tweaks to things with the second world and I expect the same will be true of the next two worlds to keep things interesting.I've owned this game a very short time and have already logged 50 hours on it. I definitely recommend it, just set an alarm to remind you to go to sleep sooner or later XD			"

DisclaimerAll that's following is an impression of a person who hasn't played MineCraft, Terraria, Starbound or any similar games so far.Addicting, incredibly addicting… Before start please be sure you currently don’t have important things to do.It’s about: helping little dwarfs to survive in dangerous world(s) by exploring it and developing technologies and themselves; crafting, crafting, crafting; “city management”, but in 2D and only on a scale of one house (or shelter); get into troubles.Why you should play this: because it’s good for you to help someone who’s smaller and can’t stand for oneself without getting a hand; you like crafting-oriented games; it’s just adorable to see how your dwarfs go through all troubles and conquering dangerous world; you’ve always wanted to try something like Starbound or Terraria, but they look for you either too big (content-overloaded) or ugly (I’m sorry, but it’s true); unlike Terraria or Starbound it offers indirect control - you just plan and point what to do, no reason to play solo on your keyboard or gamepad; unlike in Terraria, items and menus quite large - no reason to screw up your eyes; May, 21 - 4th world was added: finally, we can have GUNS and different craft tree. Why you may not like it: Terraria and Starbound veterans will be insulted with the amount of content for crafting and lack of opportunities; the craft tree is almost the same in first 3 worlds (there are a few tenuous changes): you develop it to maximum in one world, fix the portal to travel to another world and all that only for starting everything from scratch with the same technologies to explore; in my opinion it would be better to change not only the world's weather conditions but also time and add something truly new into craft tree; now there are 4 worlds available for playing – there’re no hints on any kind of story or campaign: you just have to travel from one world to another and survive walking through the same stages of developing, it makes the game quite monotonous; it doesn’t contain any save option up to your request: your actions are final, all your mistakes stay with you - you can’t replay it, game saves your progress only when you leave it; it’s probably will take over 130 hours to beat 4 worlds (25-35 hours per world plus replays if you want all of the achievements).Despite all flaws it’s fun, it’s entertaining – if you remember yourself playing Tamagotchi (or at least you know what it is), then give it a chance: highly likely you won’t regret.

												Craft the World is fun if a little bit weird. It's a bit like Terraria combined with Gnomoria.You have your dwarves and get more as you unlock recipes or meet other goals. You harvest, craft, dig and fight off timedi nvasions of skeletons and other nasty critters. You don't really directly control your dwarves, you tell them what to do and they SLOWLY do it. Sound simple? Well, it is...sort of. Recipes get more complex. The monsters get tougher and there are more and more of them. You dig down further and further, meaning you need to find ways to get your dwarves back to the surface quickly. You expand your operations, putting greater and greater needs on basic resources like food, ore and wood. There's an element of luck with what you may find, meaning that you face roadblocks that you have to find ways around.The real ""gateway"" in the game are the crafting recipes.You need to create a few of them in any given cateogry to advance to more complicated recipes in that category. Once you're at the end...well, I'm not going to spoil it for you but that's how you need to win. So the race is on between moving quickly enough to get the recipes before being overrun on the timed invasions. The game never felt frantic, but it did feel far more hectic and the end than during the leisurely beginning.The dwarves are cute, the sounds ok and overall it's a nice little package. The crafting interface can get a bit cumbersome but overall it works well enough. And there's enough things to build that you can create some interesting areas. Mind you it's more limited than some games but there's more than enough here. Personally, I only completed the first world. Going to the next one felt redundant. So while I'll ""only"" get 20 hours or so out of this, I got more than my money's worth because I bought it for less than $10 and those 20 hours were quite enjoyable.Looking for a cute Terraria/Gnomoria type of game with a colorful interface and isn't too challenging? Then this is for you. Enjoy.			"

								When I saw this game, I immediately thought that I'd just have to buy it. And I did. But at the moment (early access), this game is annoyingly confusing.There is no tutorial, so unless you went searching for a guide/walkthrough on Steam or Youtube, you'll just have to play guess work.Pros:1. Nice cute graphics.2. Random map/terrain for new game (I think, didn't really finish the two I games I started).3. Tech tree is quite expansive.Cons:1. So hard to build a simple shelter. Need level up techs of several items before you can build a shelter with wooden walls. I would have thought that the shelter would be the easiest to build. At least a basic one that you can upgrade later on.2. Leveling up the tech tree is quite confusing. You need several of the same item before you get to level up.3. Drag-and-drop system in crafting. It should be simple like auto-deducted from inventory.4. No 'rally' system to gather the dwarves at a set point (before shelter). Unless there is one, and I missed it (can't tell since there is no tutorial). Had to resort to controlling them individually to get them underground and close hatch when the monsters arrive.5. No tutorial level I won't give it a down vote since it is still in its early access. I really, really want to enjoy this game; I hope the next updates will make it better. At least have a tutorial where we can get the basics right.			"

												Craft The World is a survival sandbox game.  At the beginning of a level, you are given a single dwarf with no skills to boss around.  After certain milestones, your population increase one by one.  This game is challenging and frustrating at the same time.  I had to fail and retry over and over just to finish the first level.  This game is not really about building but more on survival.  There are some cave explorations and boss fights to do but they aren't the highlight of this game.  Resource balancing is crazy tough and you would really have to be very frugal with how you use each one of your resources.  For instance, not all my dwarves had the best pickaxes but only the professional diggers (even though they all dug at some point) or not all my dwarves had the toughest armors unless they were melee fighters.  Dwarves running out of food or lacking sleep can easily cost you your base that you've worked hard to build up.  There is a goal to this game though: open the portal to the next level.  The parts of the portal are scattered underground and you typically would have to defeat an end-game boss to acquire those parts.  I believe there are 5 levels - all in different setting but the same repetitive task.  Overall, this game was fun because of the challenge behind it but after defeating 1 level, I don't think I'm up to do another one again.  It is much too repetitive and the dwarves move so agonizingly slow.  Getting things done is an epic pain.  While this wasn't entirely boring, I'd recommend anyone who wants to try this to buy it on sale.			"

I need water to build a forge so I can further the tech tree. I buy the water from the shop with a few coins I have because you need to finish the forge before you get the tree that allows you to melt the ice for water.

								This is a beautiful exploring, strategy, and adventure game that is honestly a ton of fun!  It's randomly generated worlds means that no two games will be the same.  You gather resources to try and craft weapons, armor, and a home.  You can build your home above, or below ground.  However, watch out for the night when the baddies come out, and also watch that timer that shows when the most dangerous baddies will invade you and try to destroy everything you've worked so hard to accumulate and build up!Watch my 1 hour+ video as I play and demonstrate this game my first time for a good idea of how it all works...

YouTube™ Video: Craft the World - first impressions gameplay guide DWARVES GET WOOD!!! 

			Views: 205		



I have played this for almost 20 hours now, it took me most of that time just to complete the first world, not sure that I really want to go through the whole process again in another world. There's a lot of really good things about this game which are enough to make it a cool game. But there are also areas which I believe could be improved, changed or added to.The games not 3D but I have no major problem with the graphics.-----But judging by the look of things I couldn’t help but feeling that mobile devices were probably in mind. Because of stuff like the size and simplicity of icons and menu items, and the lack of tool tips, as if it’s meant to be easy to use with a touch pad. My concern with this is that it could detract from having more detailed features in interfaces.-----You can zoom out quite far. This seems to be really well implemented. Although everything becomes much smaller, you can distinguish different tiles very easily and see where monsters and your dwarves are. You can still manage your dwarves well from this perspective. You're not having to switch back and forth to a map where you lose control, which is pretty cool.I really like the idea of the game Dwarf Fortress. I've tried that but I couldn’t get my head around it. This is a lot more accessible albeit much simpler and features less depth.-----I also loved the old Dungeon keeper game and this reminded me of it. You also virtually build a dungeon in this. The Dwarves are a lot like the old Imps in Dungeon Keeper. You give them tasks in just the same way. Casting spells works very similarly too.-----The game has a tech tree. Each time you reach a new tech you are provided with recipes for the new items they unlock. So you don’t have to look up the wiki on an internet browser.-----But I don’t see the need for a minecraft style crafting grid in the first place. It’s not even as well implemented e.g. you have to slowly place the materials one at a time. In addition recipes just seem to be spoon fed to you so there is no difficulty in finding them. It kind of makes sense in a game like minecraft where it’s sort of like a simulation of assembling materials to craft items. But in this case your peasant dwarves should be taking care of these particulars lol (but seriously!)-----Also I don’t think the game should necessarily pause when are you in the inventory or crafting screens. The crafting grid would be more forgivable if your dwarves kept working on tasks you gave them while have to mess around with it.-----This being a side scroller, I sort of feel restricted only being able to move in four directions Sometimes I kind of wish the game had a third dimension. It would give it more depth, get it?! (but no seriously!). Maybe not a whole extra dimension lol. But perhaps mine entrances found on the map which would allow your dwarves to access instances much smaller than the main world where more ore and loot could be found.-----Next, you don’t seem to be able to move your stockpile. This is annoying if you want to build a Dwarf Fortress underground. This is where you would think dwarves would do so, right? Presumably this is to prevent you exploiting enemy A.I. which might have trouble reaching your base underground.-----There needs to be a better way to micromanage your dwarves. The only way I could see to do so was to cycle through them one at a time. A detailed list of your dwarves would be nice so that you could just look over it and quickly see who needs equipment, as well as their health, hunger and tiredness.-----The game has a tutorial system, but I can’t really remember it helping me nearly as much as all the recipes provided by unlocking new tech. As long as you can get your head around a few concepts you shouldn't really have a problem figuring out what to do. It also has ‘notes’ aka an in-game guide which I think should be broken up into dot-points or something so that it’s easier to follow.-----Dwarves must retrieve everything that you instruct them to place from the stockpile. I think that’s a good mechanic. But when you equip them with items such as tools and armour, they don’t need to go and get them from the stockpile. I think it would be cool if the game went one more step and made it so that your dwarves had to collect gear from the stockpile, rather than having it magically appear on them.-----This game has no multiplayer. I would really like to be able enjoy this game with a friend somehow.-----Regular game-speed is like slow motion, I virtually have it at a constant 2 times speed (the maximum). I would like to be able to speed the game up even faster, because I still often found myself doing nothing but waiting for my dwarves.-----I really liked that dwarves' skills progressed. It meant that they weren't expendable and was an incentive to protect them. But there behaviour tended to be counter intuitive e.g. mages blacksmithing instead of your smith. I think you should have more control over your dwarves e.g. be able restrict your smith to the shelter so that their role is limited only to crafting items. -----I think a lot of things on the tech tree should be optional or unlocked coincidentally. I spent way too much time building things that I didn't need or want, in order to progress through the tech tree e.g. decorative items in order to unlock mithril. The tech tree has some small non-linear features but ultimately tech progression is completely linear.-----Higher tier techs can be hard to acquire due to a limited amount of finite resources i.e. you may have trouble finding enough iron to craft items needed to make progress. Once you've crafted an item there is no way to get the resources back and eventually I exhausted every vein of ore and coal. -----The end game (i.e. of a world) wasn't very satisfying. You lose all your progress and begin from scratch in the next world. This is where I've stopped because I don't really want to have to go through the tech tree again.-----The best thing about this game was that your dwarves are basically autonomous. You just say what you want done and they will take care of it. I really like being the one pulling the strings, rather than doing all the labour solo.-----If I find the time I'm going to try out a custom game using different options, this may address some of the issues I had with the tech tree and lack of resources.Click here for my YouTube gaming channel			"

												Not bad if you enjoy side-scrollers.Pro's:It's pretty simple to figure out and hard to really fail.I like enemies and undead coming out at night when you don't really know what it is.Has a new female Dwarven version, though I've not tried it.Easy to build as long as you don't ignore your Dwarves.Cons: SMALL maps. Not a great deal to really build up over time. Out of curiousity, I've even mined down everything available. However, I've not tried to do the multiplayer and zone things yet. Only just got back to it, really, after a few months.AI still needs some work. Dwarves will sometimes idle for no reason or appear to be stuck for no reason. They don't always attack as they should, either.Overall: 7/10-Paladeus			"

												Dwarf colony sim. You start with a few amount of dwarf with no equipment. You have to build/dig a base so the dwarves have somewhere to stay when the monsters come. You will get more dvarves when you level up. You will have to get better gear so the dwarves survive and then you can explore so you can find more stuff.			"

												After playing the starter campaign for several hours, I'm pretty frustrated.Crafting is painful: if you want to create something you first have to manually create all the components.I'm used to Factorio style crafting, where you choose the recipe you want and it automatically makes the components.Combat is painful: I can't seem to issue orders to individual dwarves!When a battle happens, I want to collect everyone into a group, but instead they sort of charge haphazardly into combat as they trickle in to the area. So far I've won, but only because I'm playing on 'easy' difficulty.Equipment is painful too. I can make a fancy smithing apron and put it on a dwarf, but how do I know if that dwarf will assign himself to smithing duties? If I put a smithing apron on a dwarf and that dwarf starts walking halfway across the map to mine a dirt block, I've wasted my time.Keeping everyone healthy is difficult! Left to their own devices, they don't seem to rest. Five minutes before a battle, I have to manually click on everyone and tell them to go take a nap so they'll be ready.Building my fortress is kind of fun, but it would be more fun if the comfort rules worked better. My fortress is an expanse of wide hallways full of chairs, because chairs give +2 comfort and there doesn't seem to be a cap.There's a huge sprawling tech tree ahead of me, and I can kind of envision how the rest of the game will work -- sending dwarves down to mine resources so I can build tech levels, bringing them back up to fight off skeletons. I wonder if there's a way to build an unassailable fortress, either deep underground or up in the sky, so the skeletons can't get to it? But I'm not having enough fun to keep playing.			"

								Wonderful game. Feels polished already.What I would like to see:Dwarf history (how much killed, likes of food, dislikes of food, aspiration of job)Dwarf ranks (dwarfs gain ranks, from beggsr, citizen, baron, lord, king,...)More dwarfs. I feel like it is too difficult to gain a larger band of dwarfs. Too bad.Rail wagon should transport more than one dwarf, or more than one wagon should work on the same railDrawbridge. Most definitely needed!Transparent glass that lets one see the background image throughFemale dwarfsMacromanagement controls - if dwarfs have no oders, they do work according to specified priorities (mining, decorating, gathering, cooking)Less dependency on coal for food.

								Craft The World is one of the best hidden gems in the Steam store that you have never heard of. Fantastic visuals, great gameplay, and highly polished. Gameplay is simplistic, but it suits the game just fine as it's all about letting the dwarves do all the dirty work while you relax.It would be great to have some variation in goals, as currently you just have to keep digging deeper until you find the scrolls for the next world's portal and just get the recipe requirements. But again, the simple formula still works beautifully for this game.Just make sure you don't get confused when you go to the developer's official website, as there are no mentions of the game and instead is filled with Flash games. This is because the devs post all the updates on this game's Steam page.10/10 would recommend!			"

								40+ in the space of a weekend and a few days. I enjoy this game immensly. There are flaws however, trying to capture a crafting grid like Minecraft and then using unfamiliar mouse controls presented a big learning hurdle for myself. Once I got past that, the game opened up and its true potential was there to be seen. It was then I chose to bring my new found joy to video form..

								Craft the World is an almost finished and well polished Early Access game, sounds like not right, right !Visually; graphic design and color palette is to my taste, cute, warm colors and roundy.Sound effects & Music; not too bad but there is still room to developGAMEPLAY; well this is the tricky part.  You should invest sometime to understand how you manage your dwarves as your control over them is mostly not direct (you can control an individual dwarf directly but its not the essence of Craft the World). Understanding management of your dwarves is essential as the pace of the game feels like a bit sluggish at the beginning. After starting to collect vast amount of resources quickly, it becomes easier to devise your subterrenian stronghold (or sky reaching) and it's surroundings. That is where the fun begins for me!Game has crashed a couple of times so far but other than this, not seen any major bugs or issues.My only serious complaint would be pricing; as I am not sure if this is a £12.00'er  game. I would happily pay an 8 or a 9er. Apart from pricing issue, keeping in mind that this is still  a (finished !) Early Access game, I am overall happy with Craft the World!			"

								I can't believe this is an early beta.  Yes, there are a few glitches-- big tip: leave your dwarves multiple exits in case of a pathfinding oops, which is indicated by an icon overlay-- but the amount of polish in this is really surprising.  First of all, the graphics are gorgeous.  There are no-- absolutely no-- graphics options to twiddle.  It starts up in HD (or, presumably, whatever you support) with a beautiful soundtrack and excellent artwork.  The tutorial doesn't ""talk"" you through much of anything, the interface succeeds by following the ""seven plus or minus two rule"", where there are few enough things on the screen at once that you can almost always figure it out.  Crafting has a brilliant layout where you drop the ingredients in the rough shape of the object and the icon appears to double-check; you can look up a recipe, but if you remember what you want (which is easy, for frequently needed items), it's really.  I'm a Terraria nut and wasn't sure how I'd like a cross between Lemmings and Terraria, but honestly, your little guys really are smart enough to be pretty useful.  It's a lot of fun, and definitely worth the money if you like these kind of games.  At the very least, it'll last you until Starbound comes out!			"

								I was somewhat hesitant to purchase this game on early access, but having spent a few hours with it I must say the game is very polished and somewhat addicting.At first blush you may feel like this game belongs on a tablet but after you play for a bit you will quickly realize there is a level of depth in the simulation that makes the game a real challenge at times. The level of detail is outstanding and there is so much to keep you interested and busy in the game I keep coming back for more. It is a great game to have open even if you can't devote 100% attention to it..just set your dwarves to work and you can easily browse the web or talk on the phone. But be careful because once nightfall arrives you may need to turn your focus to fighting off a zerg of enemy mobs.I am especially enjoying the campaign mode as it provides a good introduction to the crafting system and slowly opens up the world allowing you time to build up your resources. I do wish things were explained a bit better but at this stage in the development the game does a great job of walking you through.The developers did a great job with this gem of a game and they are very active with providing updates to the game. I am hopeful the dev's will add a few convenience features and better help text to the game, especially as it relates to building a suitable shelter early on in the game. But overall the game is very enjoyable and playable upon early release. Don't let the tablet style game graphics turn you off to this game. Give it a try and you won't be sorry! "

								I was somewhat hesitant to purchase this game on early access, but having spent a few hours with it I must say the game is very polished and somewhat addicting.At first blush you may feel like this game belongs on a tablet but after you play for a bit you will quickly realize there is a level of depth in the simulation that makes the game a real challenge at times. The level of detail is outstanding and there is so much to keep you interested and busy in the game I keep coming back for more. It is a great game to have open even if you can't devote 100% attention to it..just set your dwarves to work and you can easily browse the web or talk on the phone. But be careful because once nightfall arrives you may need to turn your focus to fighting off a zerg of enemy mobs.I am especially enjoying the campaign mode as it provides a good introduction to the crafting system and slowly opens up the world allowing you time to build up your resources. I do wish things were explained a bit better but at this stage in the development the game does a great job of walking you through.The developers did a great job with this gem of a game and they are very active with providing updates to the game. I am hopeful the dev's will add a few convenience features and better help text to the game, especially as it relates to building a suitable shelter early on in the game. But overall the game is very enjoyable and playable upon early release. Don't let the tablet style game graphics turn you off to this game. Give it a try and you won't be sorry! "

								If dungeon keeper and terraria had a love child it would be this game. My only complaint is the tech tree is sort of annoying. Other wise watching your dwarfs drown cause they couldnt build a roof in time or killed by spiders cause you dug too deep too quick armed only with a stick is absolutly hilarious. Next time this game is on sale you should pick it up if you thought minecraft would be fun if you could control multiple dwarfs.			"

												the AI needs alot of work, you can be tellign your dwarfs what to do and thell ust stand round talking meanwhile one of your dwarfs actually listening to your commends is being bum rushed by 20 zombies and only after hes running back to base screaming cause he almost died they come to fight. not only that they can also kill them selfs by clibiming up walls then falling down on 10% health killing him for no god reason. you can have marks for them to mine stone but they struggle to find a way even tho they are looking at a ladder that clearley allows them to get to where they need to be.apart from these struggles it is a really good game and has potential you can controll the drawfs yourself if it gets too frustrasting and then theyll get the hang of it after 20 or so tries.  overall is it worht £4 yes is it worth £14 no. so untill they fix the AI i doubt the game will get much sales but i can see the game becoming enjoyable for most people that like 2D automation games.

												I've seen a few reviews with just an hour or two of time spent in the game and honestly if that was all the time I had put in, I would probably give the same review.  However, 9 hours in I am finding myself unable to stop playing.  If you enjoy crafting in any other game you will love this.  The game doesn't hand you everything you need to know at the beginning.  I had to google some basic stuff, but it ends up being super fun.  I think the progression tree could be revamped (seriously, no walls until the 3rd tier?) but it's a deceptively in-depth good time.  Picked it up during the winter sale for $5 and would definitely recommend playing even at full price.			"

												I have enjoyed this game very much. For $5 (christmas sale) it is a steal. Sure the dwarfs are stupid but I think that is the point of the game. It adds a bit more difficulty. There is already a lot of items to craft in this game. Like a supidly large amount. The game is also pretty easy to learn. The game plays very close to Terria except you control and army of dwarfs. Haven't tried the new multiplayer yet.			"

												Don't let the negative reviews fool you. Yes the dwarves can be frustrating and what not, but if you want a fun experience of building and surviving with your little dwarves it's worth it. There is always something to do also which is nice and overwhelming at the same time (More so in the start). In the end it's definitely worth the 5 dollar sale it's on right now. I bought the game at 15 dollars and it's been WELL worth that so get it on sale for sure you will be very happy with the time you can easily put into this game.			"

												This is a great game.The best part about this game is that even though there isn't much of a learning curve to get going, it takes a lot of trial and error to do things correctly.  In other words, this is a game you can jump right into, but it has taken several playthroughs for me to really become efficient at levelling.At its heart, this game is a crafting game.  It doesn't suffer from the pitfalls of most other crafting games, either.  The inventory is easy to sort, and the skilltree makes it fun to progress.  There are also battles that require a bit of strategy to overcome.  There is a timer that counts down to the next major attack, and half of the goal is to make sure that the Dwarf's home is prepared to take on the onslaught of demons.  Each onslaught is slightly more difficult than the one before it.   I've found that a dwarf colony with just the right efficiency can stay a step ahead of these onslaughts until the end when it's a race to get as much mythril ore as possible to get every dwarf fully buffed.I've played through this game several times, and I intend to play through it again.  This one was money well spent.			"

												Great Game - If you like RTS games, city building or survival games you will love this game. On a personal note I have become very attached to my very first dwarf Hane he is clearly the leader. An expert archer, cook and climber he has won my heart. He almost died in a goblin raid last I played and I couldn't handle the idea of losing him, so I have started a new game, where I refuse to learn my dwarfs names or anything about them, I get too attached...

												Very fun game, not to hard to learn, simple concept.  Its a nice relaxing game to play.The only ""con"" is the dwarf pathing in game, they get confused, do extra streps to get to other places.  Its more annoying than bothersome to gameplay.   The developer kind of ""fixed"" it by putting ways to bring them to same location, stop them going certain places, etc.    But it should be noted.Other than that minor thing, i've enjoyed the hell out of this game.   I hope developer  puts more stuff into game, or make a 2nd one.			"

												Really good dwarf fortress-y game, very addictive.  The music is nice and context-sensitive in a way I can appreciate.  The graphics are pretty good.  The campaign feels a little repetitive since you wind up crafting mostly the same things each time to progress, but the worlds are different enough that it stays fresh enough to be fun.  Learning how to properly defend your base without outright exploiting enemy AI is fun, even in the world type where a large portion of the incoming enemies ignore doors and fortifications.However, it feels incomplete in some ways.  The tech tree's progression is really weird, like, sometimes you have to grind out decoration objects in order to unlock better equipment, or do some cooking to unlock things unrelated to cooking.  The pathing AI can glitch out when dealing with water, dwarves jump into pits sometimes, mages waste spells on weak or caged enemies, and most noticably, cave goblins will sometimes just freeze in place once they get near your base, not even fighting back.  Cave goblins also get stuck doing tasks they cannot complete, like clearing vegetation too far away from where they are standing.The difficulty curve is really weird as well.  The first few nights are absurdly dangerous as you have ineffective weapons, no armor, limited resources, and few dwarves.  As soon as you get even basic fortifications the difficulty takes a nosedive, and never picks back up.Even so, the game is really fun.			"

												8/10I love this game. Great looking game with a beautiful artstyle and plenty of depth. The different worlds behave differently, have different animals and natural disasters.Some things you need to know and take into consideration, before making a buy:- The game is still being developed - a month ago, we got a new world, that's awesome!- Since I've bought it, I've experienced the game gets better by each update. Learn from my mistakes- You CAN autobuild recipes, but you have to drag'n'drop the first time you craft. Then just choose recipe and hit the green anvil 2 times, to build the recipe. Learned this after 50+ hours of game time and a very sore hand.- You CAN speed up time. Especially useful in the beginning and between raids. Click the ""moon-wheel"" in the top right corner.Things I don't care for- Sound/music, it's just ""meh"" and I ususally turn it of and listen to radio/audiobooks instead. I don't like the dwarf voices at all.- Drag'n'drop equipment to dwarfs get's old quick. Especially when you have 12 dwarfs ind your castle.- Why do we have to build everything to unlock the recipe-tree? I don't need any pottery or flowerpots right now!			"

Early Access Review
								I tend to buy Early Access games and only play them in their current state.  I don't often return to games (mainly due to massive backlog and I don't stick with one game too long).In it's current state as of 2014.06.26, I've spent ~20 hours on this game.  It's at the top of my most played for the current Steam sale, so I think that's saying something positive about the game.I enjoy the ""spells"" - Imps can haul stuff, a rally point can be placed (vital against enemy armies), and most valuable is a portal spell massively cuts downtime, and I feel is a much better replacement for any sort of speed controls (except pause!).  When relying on speed controls, I'm basically sitting there *not* playing the game.  The pace can be a bit slow, especially in the beginning, but as more Dwarves are added, I find it more fun to spend my time micromanaging them.  The ability to play as a Dwarf removes any ""wait"" time, as I can possess a poor soul, and work him to death (it's great that I'm able to plop down anything from inventory while controlling a Dwarf, which removes the need for me to manually walk alllllll the way back to the stockpile, then allllllllll the way back to where I need to place it).  Exploring is fun, even though manually digging through a line of blocks can be tedious.Enemy waves are great - I love ""defend the fort"" games, so applying a bit of pressure from monsters keeps the game alive for me.  The game turns into a tower defense during invasions sometimes.Of course, the main ""feature"" of the game is crafting.  I'm able to get through the current crafting tree at a decent pace, although I question the placement of quite a few technologies.  Why is farming so far into the tree?  Twice now, by the time I've reached the ability to farm, I've had a massive stockpile of food - so when I reach it, I can go through over 400 seeds and set my cook to make food to last the ""rest of the game"" (whenever that is).  I think having separate categories for technologies would be a better approach, and have a more natural feel to tech progression; a ""food"" technology, ""weapons/armor"", ""building construction"", ""decorations"", and maybe one or two more.  I wouldn't mind having to grind more through each tier in this case - it would just mean a larger stock of inventory as I go through it.			"

								Craft The World is one of the best hidden gems in the Steam store that you have never heard of. Fantastic visuals, great gameplay, and highly polished. Gameplay is simplistic, but it suits the game just fine as it's all about letting the dwarves do all the dirty work while you relax.It would be great to have some variation in goals, as currently you just have to keep digging deeper until you find the scrolls for the next world's portal and just get the recipe requirements. But again, the simple formula still works beautifully for this game.Just make sure you don't get confused when you go to the developer's official website, as there are no mentions of the game and instead is filled with Flash games. This is because the devs post all the updates on this game's Steam page.10/10 would recommend!			"

												Craft the world is a charming sandbox game that is similar to games like terraria with a focus on crafting. You control a group of dwarves and explore and survive.

												This game has TONS of stuff that i didn't expect it is so awesome to play this game.You can either build a house on the surface or live like a dwarf and just use the dirt to make a new house. it's so simple and yet so fun to just create stuff when you break dirt, stone, etc... you will learn ALL the recipes in the game but just give it time.I never tried the multiplayer meself cus i don't have friends with the game. But that doesn't bother me.You have spells (the best one is the portal one) which can either support your dwarfs or be agressive on monsters at night. You have a boss in the caves i think he's a boss. it's called Guardian he drops a scroll never knew what was for so. there are some enemies and sometimes during day there will be a goblin invasion where they will set a tent and try and annoy the living hell out of you but they are easy to kill. Gather all the dwarfs and go destroy that tent to get some good stuff.There is a lava level aswell which is at the bottom of the earth. It has a Dragon. but i'm a ♥♥♥♥♥ and don't wanna face the dragonI don't have alot of hours in the game but i haven't got much time to play this game. i would love to have time			"

								For an alpha game this is amazing. Great fun. It is a slow paced game so that means you can take your time and just relax as you go on, however the level constantly gets harder over time. I may have only put 5 hours in, but i have enjoyed 90% of it. the 10% came from learning how to eat and sleep (long story). To sleep, you must build a proper hous (totem, beds, roof, walls, backwalls and a door/wooden Hatch) then they will sleep. To eat, all you need to do is make a table, make the food then place the food on the table. To do that you just add the food to your quick bar and then place them on the table as if you you where adding a wall/backwall.			"

								So far I am very happy with Craft The World.  Graphics, sound and effects are all good/great for this type of game.  If you like god like games and Terraria than I am sure that you will get enjoyment that justifies the cost.  A few things I would like to see:1. I would to see a roadmap for the game2. Less annoying repetitive crafting actions3. The ability to give dwarfs a hierarchy of job priorities (mine than harvest, only cook . . etc)4. More Traps5. The ability to call my dwarfs to a location (example: when I bust open a wall to a bunch of bad guys I would like my army to be there.6. Better AI for fights (archers are a bit dumb on first engagement)A few bugs that I have seen1. When I order a dwarf to rest he will drop what he is carrying and if he is on a ladder he will fall to the bottom2. Dwarfs not taking ordersI look forward to this game growing as it lives up to its potential. "

								this game is a nice take on a sandbox game driven by a tech tree. I like the fact that resources are limited so you need to think about how you develop things or build less of one thing so you can build more of another. Also the game has an actual objective per level also which is a nice change from the do whatever you want for as long as you want gameplay.			"

												It's very simple...you NEED this game in your library.I have absolutely fallen in love with this game. Played around 80 hours at the point of writing this and can easily see myself playing another 80+ hours. It's incredibly addictive.The dwarves, items, weapons, world(s), enemies, everything in my eyes have been crafted with passion, and it shows!One thing I will mention if you were thinking about getting this game is you must have patience. Yes, it can (it did for me) take a long time to accumulate resources/items and build a nice big healthy fortress to keep the evil out, but for me personally, found it enjoyable and to a degree challenging keeping on top of it all. Just don't rush anything, have fun, take your time.If you like building, digging, managing items, fighting enemies, laying traps, crafting items/weapons/armour, cooking, making efficient tunnel networks, decorating your fortress and a whole bunch of other neat stuff...as I said, you need this game.Here is a screenshot of my latest base:

								If you like these kind of dwarf-director games with building and exploring and tech trees, give it a shot. Compared to some of them that I've tried, the pathfinding and AI for the dwarves wasn't total garbage. There were a few times when dwarves were prioritizing resource collecting instead of killing the dragon inside my shelter, but for the most part the tools you are given to direct and navigate them are adequate for these very seldom broken paths. Something that potential players might want to know is how long the game is. It takes a long time to beat a level. I would say somewhere in the 15 hour range for your first play. And the game is pretty addicting so be careful starting it up if you have stuff to do because it takes a long time to finish projects in this game.I would say it was pretty good overall. There wasn't much of a reward for beating the first level. I wish I'd been able to bring my dwarves with me to the next one or something. However it is fun to play though and the tech tree is interesting enough to keep my attention. I liked strategizing for the enemy waves and trying to make my fortress impenetrable with traps and fortifications. I would actually like there to be a bit more variety in the tech tree, as well as maybe the dwarves to be faster. Once you get to about level 10 the game slows down a lot progression-wise. It would be nice if the levels after 10 weren't as much of a grind.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a positive review because I do like this game a lot, but that said, it has some problems. It's sort of like a Dwarf Fortress Lite game, which makes me long for DF and realize how intelligently DF (despite its UI issues) is designed.This review will be updated regularly.Pros:- Nice gameplay graphics.- Most game elements are fairly intuitive. (Though some of the buildings could use a bit more in-game instruction, like the elevator, but that's obviously not a priority in Early Access.)- The spells are a great way to engage the player, and are very useful, though mana recharge takes a while.- Controls are generally intuitive and work well.- Controlling an individual dwarf is generally very effective, though controlling the individual's movement relative the landscape can sometimes be tricky, and it's hard to execute some of the maneuvers dwarves do on their own.Cons:- Crappy UI graphics. The UI could be improved upon design-wise, and made to supply more information (like how long until nightfall, etc.)- UPDATE 5/29: They've updated the UI. It looks much better now, and has more functionality. Will update further when I have a chance to really sit down and play for a few hours to explore the new UI. :)- The drag and drop crafting system is extremely annoying. Make me do it once to start, sure, but offer an autofill option?- Needs recycling or selling items, I have a bunch of goblin crap I don't need.- Dwarves can't handle their own food supplies. When you get a lot of dwarves, they go through that food pretty fast, and you have to manually tell them to cook it, and also manually click a bunch to put it out on the table! Really makes me wish it had a system like DF where you just tell the dwarves what they can eat and cook with, and they'll automatically go get their own food. Maybe what CtW needs is a larder object where food is automatically stored, and dwarves can get it from the larder and bring it to tables themselves?- Enemy raids happen too often. Late in the game, you often have to go very far afield to gather resources, and while elevators and rails are helpful, it's still a lot of travel time. So here I am, working at the edge of the map, and suddenly I have to abandon everything I'm doing and send everyone back to base because a raid is happening. Probably ten minutes out of every hour is spent dealing with stupid raids, and the defensive towers you can build aren't effective enough. Basically your tower has to be so close to the ground to hit an enemy that they can reach it and take it out easily. Towers also aren't very powerful, meaning nearly every assault (even some minor, regular nighttime ones) requires your attention to dispatch dwarves away from whatever more productive thing they could be doing. I am presently trying to figure out a way to just prevent raiders from accessing my base, period, but so far it's been difficult coming up with a way that works. I really want to be able to focus on getting what I need to complete the level rather than dealing with giant assaults every 45 minutes.- The skill tree has some merits, but it's super annoying and frustrating to have to waste precious resources crafting a bunch of items you do not need in your fort. Maybe some form of a research to unlock technology system would be better. An invention workshop that consumes raw materials to develop blueprints/new technology?- The skill tree doesn't have the greatest progression. Some techs you would think are fairly basic, like farming and weaving, are mid-to-late game technologies. Some of the progression (you need alchemy to advance farming?) just seems to be set up to make the game more tedious.- On a related note, some form of animal husbandry, where you can just put sheep or chickens in a pen or some sort of have then generate wool and eggs would be great. Wool is incredibly important, and can be very time-consuming to obtain when you have to wait for sheep to spawn and send dwarves to the edge of the map to kill them.- Dwarves' pathing and job handling is often ridiculously poor. A dwarf carries a torch to the very edge of the map, where you need some light added. It runs into a monster. It drops the torch to fight the monster. It picks the torch back up. Does it resume placing the torch? No, it has to walk all the way back to the main base, because while the dwarf was fighting, the base dispatched a different dwarf to install the torch, and that dwarf has only just started its walk.- Hit a bug where acquiring 999 earth caused all my queued actions on the map to disappear. This happened twice, I ended up crazily just trying to use up earth so it wouldn't hit 999 (wasting a bunch of time by basically having dwarves run around installing earth back walls everywhere) and the bug seems to have gone away, though queued actions are sometimes dropping out, and this may still be to blame. Not certain.- Spawn rates of flora/mushrooms/crystals and stuff are really high, to the point where trying to mine out a block under a tree took forever because before a dwarf could arrive to mine the block after the tree was cut down, a new tree would grow. Sometimes five or six attempts required. Same issue with crystal and mushroom growth while trying to build a railroad underground.- There seems to be a max height for tree growth, so my attempts to create a dome of trees to protect my base were unsuccessful.- It's taking a really long to clear out what seems to be the first ""level"" of the game. 30+ hours.

												Second ReviewFirst review 2014I really liked this game but I wish there was more content.  The depth of the mines are to shallow even in large map.  The battles they have are very short lived.  Most times I end up completing the map before I even get halfway through the crafting chart.  I can look past the various bugs which really arent that bad but can be some what annoying.  All in all its mildly disapointing but still enjoyable up to about 30 or so hours.  I would still recommend it, its fun and I like building games.Second review 2015 (lots of updates)I'm reviewing this again almost a year later and what can i say WOW! The dev listened made improvements constant updates.  I even threw an idea at the dev and they added it.  There's to many good things to say about this game.			"

								Thoroughly recommend, overall.Pros - engaging gameplay, fun, easy to learn, decent depth and replayability.Cons (apart from the bugs that are a part of early access) - the crafting system (long grinds, most repetitive/frustrating part of the game, running out of resources (coal in particular), some AI issues with both enemies and dwarves, and a lack of control over deeper efficiency options (prioritisation of stuff, etc).Most of those cons feel like they'll be addressed at some point - developers are keeping in touch with players constantly and implementing what they can. There's a lot of things that I would have added to the cons list a couple of months ago, but they've been fixed.Well worth your money! Bravo!			"

Early Access Review
								So, I haven't posted much about games lately, because I've been too busy playing Craft The World﻿, ever since Nanimonai﻿ bought me a copy. Still in development, this sandbox strategy game Craft the World described by the developers as a ""mix of Dungeon Keeper﻿, Terreria PC game﻿ and Dwarf Fortress﻿"".What a frustrating game that I have spent dozens of hours playing. Well, not the game, really, but the stupid dwarves. Almost every update includes the line ""Improved dwarves AI"", and with good reason—they never seem to be doing what you want them to be doing! But the game is a lot of fun, stupid dwarf AI aside. Well, except for the game-breaking bug that I encountered, 30+ hours of playtime into one of my worlds, but that kind of hazard is par for the course when playing Alpha/Beta/""Early Access"" games.My biggest complaint would be that you spend a lot of time waiting: waiting for dwarves to get where they're going, to finish what they're doing, to bring stuff back when they're done, etc. After I experienced the aforementioned game-breaking bug, I started again, but I would frequently give my dwarves a bunch of orders, leave (my computer), and then come back later. So I think this game would benefit a great deal from a ""fast-foward"" feature (accelerated in-game time).Anyway, I'm done playing this (for now, at least). I'll keep an eye on its development, but I probably won't pick it up again until it reaches ""full"" release. And even if I never actually return to it, I'd say that I got my ""money's worth"" out of it Well, Nanimonai's money—Thanks, Nani!			"

Early Access Review
								Hello All, This game is a lot of fun, if you don't at least beat the first level then you shouldn't even post a review. 2 thumbs up in its current state, even with the bugs that early access comes with. This game does have an option to speed up play for those who don't know. I typically play at 2x speed. There is a lot to get out of the game if you give it a chance. The artwork is funny the leveling system is the typical exponential XP leveler. So getting over level 13 will be almost impossible. The typical board should last around 20 hrs at 2x speed. Every 45 minutes of game time the game ramps up the difficulty. If you think you found the best defense think again, the AI seems to adapt. The first 3 levels are all different and the map sizes are also customizable if you play custom. So overall for an early access I have enjoyed this game longer than a ton of full releases. I have to admit that I plan on playing this game for way over 200 hours. For $15 that means I paid only 7.5 cents for each hour of fun. For the price of 3 coffees at Starbucks you too can enjoy this game for 200 hours. as well. Thank you all for reading.-Phatty			"

								Craft the World is what you get when Dwarf Fortress and Terraria go to a show, get wicked drunk, and proceed to hook up. The offspring of this demonic pairing is a game in which you work towards a Terraria-like goal (except with a tech tree in the place of bosses), but you ultimately have no direct control of your builders.If you enjoy a crafting/building game with a good amount of challenge, but moves at a relatively slower pace, this is likely for you.

Early Access Review
								Early Access, Massive Fun!After riding the fence for a long time, I finally purchased this game based on the reviews and videos posted. The price seemed high (for me), but the game appeared to be exactly what I was looking for. I have only played a couple of hours so far, so this review is based primarily on first impressions.Pricing - A little high for my taste in games, but VERY much worth the cost. Especially if the developers continue their updates as frequently as they have done in the past. I was hesitant to pay so much for an incomplete game, but the finished portions of the game are well worth the price. And, unlike other Early Access Games I have bought, this game does not suffer from the glitches and crashes that I've experienced with other developers.Graphics - Simplistic, but effective. Everything is clear and runs smoothly. Thus far, I have had no hangups, freezes, or game crashes (playing on a WIn 8 64-bit laptop). My actual gametime is still low, so I may encounter issues further on. But, none of the technical issues that have been detailed in the forum have affected me yet.Sound - I can't really comment because I always turn the music off and lower sound effects in a game before I begin playing. I like the fact the you can adjust the ambient sounds, sound effects, and music separately. I would recommend leaving the sound effects turned on so you can hear the advancing enemies coming towards you (from off-screen).You start with a single dwarf dropped on an island. Immediately, you begin chopping trees and bushes for wood and food. Then digging into the ground to build your fortress. As you gather supplies, you can begin crafting items - better tools, weapons, armor, both decorative and useful items, etc. The list is impressive - hatches, bridges, workbenches, cooked food, furniture. Complete your tasks to advance your tech tree. As you level up, you'll receive additional dwarves to help out. And drops will randomly include textbooks to teach your dwarves new skills (each dwarf is allowed three learned skills, one is already included when they first arrive).The crafting system is very well done. Though I have not attempted the sandbox mode yet, I've read that the requirements and layout of the crafting grid must be memorized. I'm not sure that I'll like that part whenever I try it. You drag the needed materials into a grid to craft an item, but placement of the materials is important. Two crafted items may require the same ingredients placed in different positions on the grid. If you place them wrong, you may craft something other than what you were attempting.Personally, I prefer the exploration, building, and crafting over the fighting and defense aspects of any game. CtW allowed me a few day cycles to grow before throwing the enemy armies at me. There were ghosts and skeletons and zombies early in the game, but they are easily dispatched. Or, you can hide in your fort until morning when they leave. I finally quit my first run in the game when the first enemy portal opened - with armored skeletons, pirate ghosts, giant zombies, and (gasp!) a Beholder! My dwarves survived the night, but barely. I did not have enough beds for all of them (I did not explore enough of the world to find the supplies I needed).That first major wave of enemies was enough for me to exit the game. Not out of frustration, but because I felt that I had learned enough to do better the next run. LOLI can't recommend this game enough. My favorite game has been Lantern Forge, though it has some stability issues that have not been corrected yet (crashing after a short time playing). Craft the World, for an Early Access Game, plays like a final product. I can foresee many hours of my life lost whilst in this game world.A few suggestions for improvements: 1. Allow re-naming the individual dwarves for a more 'personal' experience. Possibly add some limited customization of their appearance & skills.2. Allow a 'roll-around' scrolling through your dwarves. My newest dwarf is always the one that needs the newly created weapon or armor. It would be nice to back-arrow to him rather than scroll through each of my other dwarves.3. Identify when an onscreen item belongs to a specific dwarf. I may have missed something, but I only had four beds for my six dwarves (due to a lack of grass) and the last two dwarves would not use the open beds. Apparently, another dwarf had 'claimed' it first. I have not found a way to determine ownership.4. Definitely open the Store. Even if you can only trade for decorative items or clothing options.			"

								Terraria meets A game of Dwarves, and the result is wonderfull, only 6 hours in, but I love it. So many things to do, to discover, the Talent tree is HUGE, and to think it's only an EAg, the game is very stable and fun to play. Kudos to the Dev for this gem :)			"

								The dwarves are absolutely stupid, and that is the only flaw I can think of. Portal management and the summon spell helps alleviate their stupidity, and the devs have improved the drawves' pathfinding and AI a lot since I first started playing it. Try to think of their stupidity as a challenge. ""Help these stupid dwarves stay alive!""Love the game, and the animations are really cute. Relaxing, and has huge potential. The frequent updates are definitely a plus, too!			"

								ok so i have played tell the last world (note 3 world's forest ice and sand) it was fun up un tell you get to were you need iron but the world only spawns in so much, you can't craft everything because of this. It's mainly a rush to get armor weapons and tools, then go on to the next world (you half to restart btw when you go to a new world) waves of monsters spawn and if you don't have 5 dwarfs with at least wood armor you will lose 1-3 dwarfs. game moves really slowly even with 2x speed (note its f1 f2 and f3 to speed up no idea why no one just asks) biggest thing i hate is, mana regen witch is use for your spells, It takes 5 mins to regen 1 mana of real time not game time. The wiki says that your mana is meant to regen even when your not playing, but gets bugged every update. o and the lovely crafting tree even if you are starting another game or world the crafting tree needs to be reunlock every time and even if you know the recipe it will not let you craft it tell you unlock the category.all and all it was fun while it lasted, but gets boring when you try to reply it, needs to have an unlock for the crafting tree after you finish the last world. 6/10 not worth more then $10 hope to see mod support later on, and more updates to add more worlds and more items and magic. might update review later on.

								I can't believe this is an early beta.  Yes, there are a few glitches-- big tip: leave your dwarves multiple exits in case of a pathfinding oops, which is indicated by an icon overlay-- but the amount of polish in this is really surprising.  First of all, the graphics are gorgeous.  There are no-- absolutely no-- graphics options to twiddle.  It starts up in HD (or, presumably, whatever you support) with a beautiful soundtrack and excellent artwork.  The tutorial doesn't ""talk"" you through much of anything, the interface succeeds by following the ""seven plus or minus two rule"", where there are few enough things on the screen at once that you can almost always figure it out.  Crafting has a brilliant layout where you drop the ingredients in the rough shape of the object and the icon appears to double-check; you can look up a recipe, but if you remember what you want (which is easy, for frequently needed items), it's really.  I'm a Terraria nut and wasn't sure how I'd like a cross between Lemmings and Terraria, but honestly, your little guys really are smart enough to be pretty useful.  It's a lot of fun, and definitely worth the money if you like these kind of games.  At the very least, it'll last you until Starbound comes out!			"

								First off I have had fun playing this. (written while still Early-Access)I don't like the built-in (very obvious) micro-transaction-system, I mean I'm playing it on a PC, so why would I be fronted with that system, I couldn't even pay if I tried?On the other hand, that is not such a big problem after the first ""grind"" of getting things started is taken care of.A few hours in you start noticing it is a game still-in-development, not a lot of game-breaking-errors but a few, some are solved by exiting and reopening your saved-game.Some are graphical (UI 30-50% gone), some are obvious scripting-issues with path-finding and prioritization that is probably not completed or even implemented. Some are objects in the game, that for some reason does not apply yet / at this stage.But it is fun, you don't finish a session in a short time (can go on for a loooong time), and with hard work they will definitely finish a very good game. Adding features and polishing things are the priorities they should maintain, imo.			"

								Considering this is still early access and it does come with a few bugs/issues this game is absolutely a massive hit in my eyes. A fantastic game I highly recommend.If I had to compare it to anything I would say it is Terria cross Gnomoria. You need to build and survive while trying to find the broken portal. In order to complete the level you need to repair it via finding patterns from the boss's scattered across the map.There is currently 3 campaign levels and an open world sandbox mode. The game has tons of potential!  "

								I was somewhat hesitant to purchase this game on early access, but having spent a few hours with it I must say the game is very polished and somewhat addicting.At first blush you may feel like this game belongs on a tablet but after you play for a bit you will quickly realize there is a level of depth in the simulation that makes the game a real challenge at times. The level of detail is outstanding and there is so much to keep you interested and busy in the game I keep coming back for more. It is a great game to have open even if you can't devote 100% attention to it..just set your dwarves to work and you can easily browse the web or talk on the phone. But be careful because once nightfall arrives you may need to turn your focus to fighting off a zerg of enemy mobs.I am especially enjoying the campaign mode as it provides a good introduction to the crafting system and slowly opens up the world allowing you time to build up your resources. I do wish things were explained a bit better but at this stage in the development the game does a great job of walking you through.The developers did a great job with this gem of a game and they are very active with providing updates to the game. I am hopeful the dev's will add a few convenience features and better help text to the game, especially as it relates to building a suitable shelter early on in the game. But overall the game is very enjoyable and playable upon early release. Don't let the tablet style game graphics turn you off to this game. Give it a try and you won't be sorry! "

Early Access Review
								Hello steam community :)I have decided to make my first review and the game is Craft the world. So far I have been playing the game for around 25 hours and it is starting to get boring now. The game is a 2d based survival/crafting game with a daily cycle where monsters spawn during the night. The monsters get a bit tougher the longer you play, but to be hornest it isnt realy a challenge. When not fighting monsters you are collecting materials in order for you to progress through out the techtree. The techtree is very long and even though I have spent many hours playing I have not yet finnished the techtree(mostly because of restarts). When you are collecting resources under the ground you will sometimes find secret caves, one of these caves will hold a damaged portal. To finnish a map you will have to repair the portal by obtaining different artifacts from monsters in other caves. Which you will need  some late game equipment for.All in all it is a good game but mostly because of the prise, I think i got it for 3-4 euro. There seems to be missing a storyline or something that keeps you playing. There is a lot of waiting in the game and sometimes it feels like you are just building stuff you dont need, in order to complete the techtree. I belive this game is still in alpha stage so I guess there will be some fixes in the future.I recommend this game based on the time played vs the money spent on the game. I hope someone can use my review :D "

								Craft the World is what you get when Dwarf Fortress and Terraria go to a show, get wicked drunk, and proceed to hook up. The offspring of this demonic pairing is a game in which you work towards a Terraria-like goal (except with a tech tree in the place of bosses), but you ultimately have no direct control of your builders.If you enjoy a crafting/building game with a good amount of challenge, but moves at a relatively slower pace, this is likely for you.

								Regardless of what you might read on the Steam forum, this game is like Dwarf Fortress and Terraria, with the hintiest hint of TD to keep you on your toes and drive the game a bit. This game is NOT ""roguelike."" That term gets thrown around far too liberally. The only similarity between Craft the World and Rogue is that there are bad guys that try to kill you.All that being said, I'm enjoying this game immensely. It feels a lot like Terraria, but it plays more like Dwarf Fortress. Essentially, this is the game that I wanted Terraria to be. Instead of having direct control over one person, you have indirect control over a bunch of Dwarfs.The crafting is very user-friendly (unlike Minecraft, for example); you don't have to remember anything, and the interface is very intuitive.

You can typically take as long as you want to complete a level. Tech tree progression is a nice touch but doesn't seem like a burden to build things because everything you build, you will need eventually.If you catch it on sale, go ahead and pick up. Now it has multiplay co-op and pvp for those interested in playing with friends.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a positive review because I do like this game a lot, but that said, it has some problems. It's sort of like a Dwarf Fortress Lite game, which makes me long for DF and realize how intelligently DF (despite its UI issues) is designed.This review will be updated regularly.Pros:- Nice gameplay graphics.- Most game elements are fairly intuitive. (Though some of the buildings could use a bit more in-game instruction, like the elevator, but that's obviously not a priority in Early Access.)- The spells are a great way to engage the player, and are very useful, though mana recharge takes a while.- Controls are generally intuitive and work well.- Controlling an individual dwarf is generally very effective, though controlling the individual's movement relative the landscape can sometimes be tricky, and it's hard to execute some of the maneuvers dwarves do on their own.Cons:- Crappy UI graphics. The UI could be improved upon design-wise, and made to supply more information (like how long until nightfall, etc.)- UPDATE 5/29: They've updated the UI. It looks much better now, and has more functionality. Will update further when I have a chance to really sit down and play for a few hours to explore the new UI. :)- The drag and drop crafting system is extremely annoying. Make me do it once to start, sure, but offer an autofill option?- Needs recycling or selling items, I have a bunch of goblin crap I don't need.- Dwarves can't handle their own food supplies. When you get a lot of dwarves, they go through that food pretty fast, and you have to manually tell them to cook it, and also manually click a bunch to put it out on the table! Really makes me wish it had a system like DF where you just tell the dwarves what they can eat and cook with, and they'll automatically go get their own food. Maybe what CtW needs is a larder object where food is automatically stored, and dwarves can get it from the larder and bring it to tables themselves?- Enemy raids happen too often. Late in the game, you often have to go very far afield to gather resources, and while elevators and rails are helpful, it's still a lot of travel time. So here I am, working at the edge of the map, and suddenly I have to abandon everything I'm doing and send everyone back to base because a raid is happening. Probably ten minutes out of every hour is spent dealing with stupid raids, and the defensive towers you can build aren't effective enough. Basically your tower has to be so close to the ground to hit an enemy that they can reach it and take it out easily. Towers also aren't very powerful, meaning nearly every assault (even some minor, regular nighttime ones) requires your attention to dispatch dwarves away from whatever more productive thing they could be doing. I am presently trying to figure out a way to just prevent raiders from accessing my base, period, but so far it's been difficult coming up with a way that works. I really want to be able to focus on getting what I need to complete the level rather than dealing with giant assaults every 45 minutes.- The skill tree has some merits, but it's super annoying and frustrating to have to waste precious resources crafting a bunch of items you do not need in your fort. Maybe some form of a research to unlock technology system would be better. An invention workshop that consumes raw materials to develop blueprints/new technology?- The skill tree doesn't have the greatest progression. Some techs you would think are fairly basic, like farming and weaving, are mid-to-late game technologies. Some of the progression (you need alchemy to advance farming?) just seems to be set up to make the game more tedious.- On a related note, some form of animal husbandry, where you can just put sheep or chickens in a pen or some sort of have then generate wool and eggs would be great. Wool is incredibly important, and can be very time-consuming to obtain when you have to wait for sheep to spawn and send dwarves to the edge of the map to kill them.- Dwarves' pathing and job handling is often ridiculously poor. A dwarf carries a torch to the very edge of the map, where you need some light added. It runs into a monster. It drops the torch to fight the monster. It picks the torch back up. Does it resume placing the torch? No, it has to walk all the way back to the main base, because while the dwarf was fighting, the base dispatched a different dwarf to install the torch, and that dwarf has only just started its walk.- Hit a bug where acquiring 999 earth caused all my queued actions on the map to disappear. This happened twice, I ended up crazily just trying to use up earth so it wouldn't hit 999 (wasting a bunch of time by basically having dwarves run around installing earth back walls everywhere) and the bug seems to have gone away, though queued actions are sometimes dropping out, and this may still be to blame. Not certain.- Spawn rates of flora/mushrooms/crystals and stuff are really high, to the point where trying to mine out a block under a tree took forever because before a dwarf could arrive to mine the block after the tree was cut down, a new tree would grow. Sometimes five or six attempts required. Same issue with crystal and mushroom growth while trying to build a railroad underground.- There seems to be a max height for tree growth, so my attempts to create a dome of trees to protect my base were unsuccessful.- It's taking a really long to clear out what seems to be the first ""level"" of the game. 30+ hours.

												Second ReviewFirst review 2014I really liked this game but I wish there was more content.  The depth of the mines are to shallow even in large map.  The battles they have are very short lived.  Most times I end up completing the map before I even get halfway through the crafting chart.  I can look past the various bugs which really arent that bad but can be some what annoying.  All in all its mildly disapointing but still enjoyable up to about 30 or so hours.  I would still recommend it, its fun and I like building games.Second review 2015 (lots of updates)I'm reviewing this again almost a year later and what can i say WOW! The dev listened made improvements constant updates.  I even threw an idea at the dev and they added it.  There's to many good things to say about this game.			"

Early Access Review
								Dwarf Fortress meets Terraria - and it's glorious. I've had a few crash bugs happen, but due to autosave I've only lost a maximum of 2 minutes of playtime at a time, so it's not so bad. I only have 30 hours in the game yet so I don't know how much replay value the game will have after I've completed the campaign and done all the achievements, but it has been an enjoyable 30 hours (and probably another 30 hours awaiting at least!) - definitely worth it.

								this game is a nice take on a sandbox game driven by a tech tree. I like the fact that resources are limited so you need to think about how you develop things or build less of one thing so you can build more of another. Also the game has an actual objective per level also which is a nice change from the do whatever you want for as long as you want gameplay.			"

Early Access Review
								So far I am very happy with Craft The World.  Graphics, sound and effects are all good/great for this type of game.  If you like god like games and Terraria than I am sure that you will get enjoyment that justifies the cost.  A few things I would like to see:1. I would to see a roadmap for the game2. Less annoying repetitive crafting actions3. The ability to give dwarfs a hierarchy of job priorities (mine than harvest, only cook . . etc)4. More Traps5. The ability to call my dwarfs to a location (example: when I bust open a wall to a bunch of bad guys I would like my army to be there.6. Better AI for fights (archers are a bit dumb on first engagement)A few bugs that I have seen1. When I order a dwarf to rest he will drop what he is carrying and if he is on a ladder he will fall to the bottom2. Dwarfs not taking ordersI look forward to this game growing as it lives up to its potential. "

								This takes all the best of Terraria and removes all the obnoxious micromanagement. You don't have to worry about organizing inventories or running back and forth to your base, let your minions do that for you! This game is still early access, but what is there is well refined and only getting better with every patch. The only gripe I have at this point is simply that it doesn't have quite the depth of content I wish it would have. Hopefully with a few more patches I can scratch even that wish off my list.Still over 80 hours of play time don't lie. This is a fantastic buy.			"

												Craft the world is a charming sandbox game that is similar to games like terraria with a focus on crafting. You control a group of dwarves and explore and survive.

												What happens when you take elements from games like “Dungeon Keeper”, “Terraria”, and “Dwarf Fortress” and roll them into one neat little package?  Why, “Craft The World”, of course!  I discovered this game on Steam’s Early Access and after reading the description, I knew I’d have to give it a whirl.  It’s an interesting mix of different genres, but I found it to be the most reminiscent of “A Game of Dwarves”, even though “Craft The World” has a “Terraria” look and feel about it.  There’s crafting, exploring, minion (Dwarf) management, tower defense, a huge tech tree…for $18.99 (as of 11/24/14), there’s a lot to love.

												This game has TONS of stuff that i didn't expect it is so awesome to play this game.You can either build a house on the surface or live like a dwarf and just use the dirt to make a new house. it's so simple and yet so fun to just create stuff when you break dirt, stone, etc... you will learn ALL the recipes in the game but just give it time.I never tried the multiplayer meself cus i don't have friends with the game. But that doesn't bother me.You have spells (the best one is the portal one) which can either support your dwarfs or be agressive on monsters at night. You have a boss in the caves i think he's a boss. it's called Guardian he drops a scroll never knew what was for so. there are some enemies and sometimes during day there will be a goblin invasion where they will set a tent and try and annoy the living hell out of you but they are easy to kill. Gather all the dwarfs and go destroy that tent to get some good stuff.There is a lava level aswell which is at the bottom of the earth. It has a Dragon. but i'm a ♥♥♥♥♥ and don't wanna face the dragonI don't have alot of hours in the game but i haven't got much time to play this game. i would love to have time			"

												Great Game - If you like RTS games, city building or survival games you will love this game. On a personal note I have become very attached to my very first dwarf Hane he is clearly the leader. An expert archer, cook and climber he has won my heart. He almost died in a goblin raid last I played and I couldn't handle the idea of losing him, so I have started a new game, where I refuse to learn my dwarfs names or anything about them, I get too attached...

												Very fun game, not to hard to learn, simple concept.  Its a nice relaxing game to play.The only ""con"" is the dwarf pathing in game, they get confused, do extra streps to get to other places.  Its more annoying than bothersome to gameplay.   The developer kind of ""fixed"" it by putting ways to bring them to same location, stop them going certain places, etc.    But it should be noted.Other than that minor thing, i've enjoyed the hell out of this game.   I hope developer  puts more stuff into game, or make a 2nd one.			"

												the AI needs alot of work, you can be tellign your dwarfs what to do and thell ust stand round talking meanwhile one of your dwarfs actually listening to your commends is being bum rushed by 20 zombies and only after hes running back to base screaming cause he almost died they come to fight. not only that they can also kill them selfs by clibiming up walls then falling down on 10% health killing him for no god reason. you can have marks for them to mine stone but they struggle to find a way even tho they are looking at a ladder that clearley allows them to get to where they need to be.apart from these struggles it is a really good game and has potential you can controll the drawfs yourself if it gets too frustrasting and then theyll get the hang of it after 20 or so tries.  overall is it worht £4 yes is it worth £14 no. so untill they fix the AI i doubt the game will get much sales but i can see the game becoming enjoyable for most people that like 2D automation games.

												I've seen a few reviews with just an hour or two of time spent in the game and honestly if that was all the time I had put in, I would probably give the same review.  However, 9 hours in I am finding myself unable to stop playing.  If you enjoy crafting in any other game you will love this.  The game doesn't hand you everything you need to know at the beginning.  I had to google some basic stuff, but it ends up being super fun.  I think the progression tree could be revamped (seriously, no walls until the 3rd tier?) but it's a deceptively in-depth good time.  Picked it up during the winter sale for $5 and would definitely recommend playing even at full price.			"

There is already a lot of items to craft in this game. Like a supidly large amount. The game is also pretty easy to learn. The game plays very close to Terria except you control and army of dwarfs.

It has an speed up option but I barely use it since I feel that being aware and attentious to every detail counts to help you grow and makes you plan ahead better.I'm around 75 hours in and sad that I already completed more than half of the game.

												I'm going to say yes on the fact that I bought it on sale for <5$ spent 12 hours playing the first level definately worth the money. The game is not perfect and could use some improvements, but If you can get it on sale buy it before it’s too late. Cons - A bit slow at the start of each level but the end seems to fly by making the middle of the play through the most entertaining. - The tech tree is a bit annoying where you need to waste resources making furniture improvements to craft better armor, a separate tree would be better and streamline the game. - You cannot sell resources to the shop filling your inventory with junk from previous tech levels. - Base game speed is grueling, I play at 2x speed to even stay interested in playing for more than 45 min. - Each level is just a larger harder copy of the previous level, tech does not change the animals and enemies do change with the map but tech progression is non existent. - The music is not constant and i have found times when the game is completely silent.Pros- Beautiful art and sprites.- First playthrough is highly addictive i.e. 7 hours straight without wanting to stop.- Excluding the furniture the tech progression is fairly even step to step.

This style of game is not for everyone, but I found it a relaxing, and in no way boring game. My only complaint is that there are only 3 worlds. I can;t wait for more to be released. I should add that each world is quite a time commitment, so don;t take ""only 3 worlds"" to mean its a game you're going to finish quickly. "

												Honestly, this game is pretty good. It takes some time to figure out, but once you do you will get your moneys worth.I was really impressed with how the AI works. Though it's not flawless, I was impressed, it does take some planning to keep it from breaking/digging into it your stuff.I really wish item progression was not so ""the next stuff is just overall better, so give it to as many dwarves as you can"". It would have been nice you have the option of mage armor for example, that could perhaps raise mage damage but not so great at defense. Perhaps the heaver stuff would slow your dwarves down in combat? Maybe giving you the option of giving the lighter stuff to archers?Overall, it's still a good game. I hope it's supported for many years. It's certainly a game that some DLC would be nice for. "

												Still in early access, but this is a fun(And dangerous) time sink game, managing dwarves and projects with a fair amount of creative freedom to build large fortressess.  It's missing several things and the trap building is wonky and unbalenced, but I still have a lot of fun with it, and hey, early accesss, I see a LOT of potential in this game.			"

												Enjoying this game so far.  I'm almost done with world 3 and the gameplay is simple yet addictive.  The only problem I have is that the dwarves AI isn't great.  Sometimes dwarves will stand right next to what I've clicked on while another one runs halfway across the world to take care of that thing or a dwarf with smithing will go gather wheat instead of make that new mithril pick-axe I've requested.

												I recommend Craft the World to anyone who enjoys popular sandbox and crafting games such as Terraria, Minecraft and Dwarf Fortress. CTW combines elements of these games into one whole game and the creators definitely did that right. There's a lot to CTW. Crafting, construction, tower defense, mining and so on. The idea of having dwarves that carry out tasks; along with the 2D side-scrolling, retro style is brilliant.Overall, I give the game a solid 9/10.Edit: Okay. The AI could do with some fxing. I have two dwarfs, one with a stone axe and one with a stone pickaxe. There are blocks of stone and a tree to mine. Why does the dwarf with a stone axe sometimes mine stone? Why do the dwarves not sometimes mine what is best suited for their tool?			"

Early Access Review
								I found this game to be a large time sink. It took me some time to get some of the basic elements at the start of the game (that you start with a totem you can place instead of having to build one from scratch, for example). The end goal of the first level is also difficult to suss out, and I ended up spending a significant amount of time advancing all the tech trees to their maximum when it wasn't strictly necessary to succeed.Those issues aside, the game is a lot of fun. Whether you treat your dwarves as disposable labourers, or care about them like a family, you'll find things to love about the game. Harvesting resources, building your fortress, and basically showing off your mastery over your environment make this game great fun. The nightly monster raids provide an extra element of danger and amusement, another challenge to overcome.Probably a good idea to check out a gameplay video first, to make sure it's up your alley, but I for one had a lot of fun with the game.

Early Access Review
								This game still has some bugs, but as an early release that is to be expected.  It is a pretty solid game; I have had some glitches but no crashes. The world is well done and game play is fairly intuitive.  The graphics are a step above most of the competition.The dwarves can be somewhat humorous with their gusto to attack even against overwhelming odds. The AI for the dwarves has improved through the updates but still can be frustrating at time as a dwarf will go through the portal and just stand on the other side as it closes when there is no reason for them to be there.I have yet to make it to the second world but would still recommend this game.

												I love this game - But one thing I have wondered is why are there no 'gold axes'. We have leather boos, leather armor, iron axes, stone axes and stone pickaxes. But no gold axes, no gold swords, no gold pick axes its almost as if gold was skipped over a bit.I would like to see gold axes, gold swords and gold pick axes.I would also like see some way to better make Takmak happy. Seems no matter what I offer hes mad, lol.			"

												This game is amazing, from the graphics to the music to the premise.  I really do love this game ever since I bought it in early access. I would recommend buying this game.I was hoping that the problems with the AI were going to be fixed but unfortunately it never happened.  Although new content was added, many of the problems I had with the game were never solved.-	After you get over 6 dwarves and created several routes the dwarves just stand around confused, maybe they are just union workers.-	The dwarves will still jump off of high platforms without a route to get back into base, basically suicide.-	The dwarves do not seem to be individuals when it comes to feeding. For instance I put 3 berries on the table, 1 berry gets eaten; now the dwarves will say they are sick of eating berries.-	The dwarves will sometimes help fight and other times not. They will drop what they are doing to fight a target across the map while others nearby will do nothing.-	The dwarves will stay engaged in combat when they have less then one heart which will likely lead to there death. *Players can now create a building to store dwarf’s spirits and create potions to resurrect them makign this issue less bothersome. -	Portal spell hurts the immersion of the game but the railways are expensive to build and not quick enough to be worth it.-	Sandbox mode requires you to find items rather then use the tech tree which causes excessive clicking and just causes players to have to keep the wiki open. *Multiplayer allows the player to craft anything. I havn't checked but maybe this was applied to sandbox mode.-	Creatures fall from the sky, makes sense in the latest world because they use parachutes but seems much less intuitive on the other worlds.-	Portals will open on top of your base if you expand to far or try to have multiple bases.-	Dragon eggs still seemingly have no purpose after two years of them being in the game. *Dragon eggs are now used in dwarf resurrection. There is allot to do in the game but these issues make it feel incomplete still and lower the experience for me.  This game has not yet met it’s potential and I hope it does.  8/10___________________________________________________________________________________They added in a multiplayer alpha which is a really cool start to multiplayer. You play on a singleplayer world in where you can cast a spell to look for pvp or coop multiplayer game. When you find someone you bring 5 of your dwarves who retain their skills but not their equipment. Allowing you to bring back spoils. If they die in the matrix however they die for real. They added in a revival building that holds your dwarves souls for you on death allowing you to make potions to bring them back to life. Great addition to the game helping permadeath mode, multiplayer mode, and giving use to dragon eggs.			"

												Do you hate all of the following things:- Eating food that cannot be prepared in a microwave- Having meaningful relationships- Being gainfully employed- A clean living space- Going out and doing things- Responsible adultingThen this is the game for you!It may not seem addictive at first, but that is simply a cunning ruse.  I purchased this on a whim during my lunch break.  I fired it up, thinking I would taken about 30min to get it figured out.  That figuring-out process was somewhat frustrating, if truth be told.  The in-game tutorial is both helpful and a bit obtuse, leaving out the tips and tricks that can really make the game flow.  I imagine you're supposed to discover them for yourself, but not knowing some of them can make the gameplay appear more repetitive and aggravating than it needs to be.Thankfully, helpful guides and tutorial videos abound (really... use them!).  After that, I remember nothing beyond Craft The World for a period of approximately 10 hours.  By the same time on the next day (after calling in sick to work), I had amassed 20+ hours of play time.  My husband was not impressed, so I bought him a copy.  Problem solved - haven't seen him in days.Update (12/31/15): After completing the four starting realms and getting all but two of the Achievements, I can still say that I thoroughly enjoy this game.  Looks like the developers have recently added some new content (co-op and pvp, mainly).  I look forward to trying these out!			"

The 'levels' are ridiculously long and as far as I can tell have the same core objectives (craft something, then craft something else so you can build something new...)

												I picked this one up over the weekend just prior to getting out of early access, and ohmygod, its glorious. Never heard of this game before, but its a little gem.Gameplay is pretty much what you see in the video. Its Terraria meets Dwarf Fortress.Its a sidescroller/platformer. You do not directly control your dwarves. Instead you create tasks for them. Mine this chunk of ore, cut down that tree, build a stone wall over here. Your dwarves will seek out and complete these tasks.There's also a bit of Dungeon Keeper-esque upkeep for your dwarves, albeit simplified. They need food to survive and a bed to sleep in. They don't actually eat very often, but when they do, they'll eat an entire table of food. The will retreat to to their beds if injured. If down to 1/3rd health they'll run away from things and try to recover in bed. These are all of the needs your dwarves have.Its a very simple game but it is a highly enjoyable game. Construct a little dwarven fortress as if it were Terraria. Dig deep and greedily. Fend off invasions of zombies or goblin thieves.Maps are randomly generated. You have 3 biomes (forest, desert, snow) and 3 world sizes. You can also adjust a few other options, such as how often you get weather events or the game's dificulty.The crafting system is quite complex. Higher tier items are going to require several steps to construct, as you must first build all primary and intermediary items. Unfortunately the crafting system is also one of the downsides of the game. Crafting must all be done manually and there's no auto-fill button that I'm aware of. I'd prefer to be able to set build orders (construct up to X number of item Y) and let my dwarves automatically fill the quotas. Crafting involves a lot of micromanagement. This is more of a quality of life concern rather than a problem with the gameplay. This is also my sole concern with the game. This is the only negative point I have with the game.Gameplay isn't deep, but it sure is satisfying. This game could very well be a mobile game, but don't let that put you off. If you enjoyed Terraria or Dwarf Fortress I highly recommend it.			"

												I didn't know what to expect of this game. I have always been intrigued by the idea of the legendary dwarf fortress but could never get over the archaic visual look of it (I do love tons of old video games but I find it hard to go back to the 80/90s and be enamored in the same way at that time). The reviews indicated Craft the World was a good mix of the dwarf fortress feel with nice visual aesthetics appended with aspects of dungeon keeper (an old favorite) and minecraft. Overall I’ve had a blast with the game. It is a ton of fun exploring and seeing what lies beneath the next few blocks of mineable ground -- new enemies, new treasures, new hidden rooms, etc. The tech tree is relatively easy to understand and progresses naturally. Sometimes it gets a bit bogged down in forcing you to craft meaningless items to advance a particular branch but I’d still give it a 4/5 overall. The graphics and sound are exactly what I’d expect—charming. The game is challenging but not too difficult if you plan well. If you have any interest in watching a civilization playout ala sim-games/civilization/etc this game is perfect for you. I had flashbacks of SimAnt only with way more control over the fate of my creatures(dwarves). Everything considered, I’d give this game an 8.5/10 and definitely recommend you at least try it (especially considering it can be had for fairly cheap).			"

												Honestly, this game is pretty good. It takes some time to figure out, but once you do you will get your moneys worth.I was really impressed with how the AI works. Though it's not flawless, I was impressed, it does take some planning to keep it from breaking/digging into it your stuff.I really wish item progression was not so ""the next stuff is just overall better, so give it to as many dwarves as you can"". It would have been nice you have the option of mage armor for example, that could perhaps raise mage damage but not so great at defense. Perhaps the heaver stuff would slow your dwarves down in combat? Maybe giving you the option of giving the lighter stuff to archers?Overall, it's still a good game. I hope it's supported for many years. It's certainly a game that some DLC would be nice for. "

Product received for free
												This game is very similar to a game that I love called ""The Diggles"" or Wiggles in the UK. There is a 2d map with limited character development crafting and underground exploration similar to terraria. I really like this game and I am on the second level of the campaign, so I obviously enjoy the game, but I dont see how this game can be replayable. There is a multiplayer component on a minimap but that takes a long time to complete to get your rewards. The population is somewhat customizable as you can teach them up to 3 skills and change their erquipment. So, here are some of the gotchas.  The crafting tree doesn't really make sense. For example, it makes you craft an item that is less effective than an item you can already build. If you dont like your dwarves skills you can create potions later in the tech tree to make them forget them, all of them. Why not just forget one? Also their are equipment slots for accessories like a saw or a shield. This should be balanced better. Skill related items in one slot combat related items in another. All in all its a fun game worth buying on sale.			"

												Fun game to pass some time. So far there seems to be a decent amount of variation in what you can do as you get farther in the tech tree. The main downside is the AI. If you tell the Dwarfs to do a bunch of stuff and their is a way for them to place stuff where it blocks them from doing the other stuff you wanted they will do it that way. Overall I think it's worth dealing with some of the AI problems for how fun the game is in general.			"

I havn't checked but maybe this was applied to sandbox mode.-	Creatures fall from the sky, makes sense in the latest world because they use parachutes but seems much less intuitive on the other worlds.-	Portals will open on top of your base if you expand to far or try to have multiple bases.-	Dragon eggs still seemingly have no purpose after two years of them being in the game. *Dragon eggs are now used in dwarf resurrection. There is allot to do in the game but these issues make it feel incomplete still and lower the experience for me.  This game has not yet met it’s potential and I hope it does.  8/10___________________________________________________________________________________They added in a multiplayer alpha which is a really cool start to multiplayer. You play on a singleplayer world in where you can cast a spell to look for pvp or coop multiplayer game. When you find someone you bring 5 of your dwarves who retain their skills but not their equipment. Allowing you to bring back spoils. If they die in the matrix however they die for real. They added in a revival building that holds your dwarves souls for you on death allowing you to make potions to bring them back to life. Great addition to the game helping permadeath mode, multiplayer mode, and giving use to dragon eggs.			"

												Do you hate all of the following things:- Eating food that cannot be prepared in a microwave- Having meaningful relationships- Being gainfully employed- A clean living space- Going out and doing things- Responsible adultingThen this is the game for you!It may not seem addictive at first, but that is simply a cunning ruse.  I purchased this on a whim during my lunch break.  I fired it up, thinking I would taken about 30min to get it figured out.  That figuring-out process was somewhat frustrating, if truth be told.  The in-game tutorial is both helpful and a bit obtuse, leaving out the tips and tricks that can really make the game flow.  I imagine you're supposed to discover them for yourself, but not knowing some of them can make the gameplay appear more repetitive and aggravating than it needs to be.Thankfully, helpful guides and tutorial videos abound (really... use them!).  After that, I remember nothing beyond Craft The World for a period of approximately 10 hours.  By the same time on the next day (after calling in sick to work), I had amassed 20+ hours of play time.  My husband was not impressed, so I bought him a copy.  Problem solved - haven't seen him in days.Update (12/31/15): After completing the four starting realms and getting all but two of the Achievements, I can still say that I thoroughly enjoy this game.  Looks like the developers have recently added some new content (co-op and pvp, mainly).  I look forward to trying these out!			"

												Craft the World - why did I even buy it? Obviously the cartoony graphics were a huge factor.I don't even play these sort of games.Installed. I load up and start a new game on ""small"" world on easy difficulty. Easy-peasy, lemon-squeeze. Build, mine, kill a few monsters and onto next level right? How hard can this be?40 hours later I am facing a mental battle of wills against the game developers. Like Gandalf said in Lord of Rings, ""You shall not pass!"". This game isn't passing me by. It's not the boss of me.It's more like a strategic game or even a new type of gaming genre called the ENDURANCE GENRE.I started with a single dwarf who can cut down a few trees and play with dirt. He can mine stone and also kill the odd sheep for wool. EVERY resource he produces must be taken back to the central stockpile before it can be used in my megalomania. This is where the problems begin. Soon enough I level up and gain more and more dwarves to play with. I work through the skill tree and move from being able to produce beds made from leaves to the fully emperor size luxurious beds. I move from making simple wood weapons to Iron Axes. I move from being able to craft a mud pile to stone walls.As all this is happening the game goes through a night and day cycle where during the night zombie/ghost/skeleton mobs attack.How do you build a home? I don't know. How do you stop your retard dwarves from travelling half way, ALL THE WAY across the world to gather a single stupid bit of wood, I don't know.How to stop rats from attacking your home? I don't know. (This one is probably the most asked question in Discussions).How do you complete the game? I don't know.Can you sell items? I don't know.How do I make the portal? What bloody portal?Why don't more trees grow on top of my house? I DON'T KNOW.40 hours in I am still on the first ""easy"" level. On my 6th attempt. Each time trying to find perfection. The perfect home. The perfect set of skills for my dwarves. The prefect wave of destruction that consumes the world of all its natural resources ensuring no piece of stone, bit of Earth, bit of coal is not consumed in my inevitable march towards the exit. To the developers, I say resistance is futile. I will beat you.Miles and miles deep into the Earth I come across some sort of giant skeleton creature that wields a huge sword which also erupts waves of fire at my puny dwarves. It can also summon undead. It's dead. I find a portal spell.Many, many, many things wrong with the game. Primary is the Dwarven IQ levels which may cause you to smash your fist into the screen. ""Run you fools"" as Gandalf said. These fools don't run. They often engage in combat at the wrong time and more often end up ignoring your blatant commands. The developers must have realised this as well as a short while into the game you are given the HORN spell that basically forces the dwarves to move their♥♥♥♥♥right now. GO THERE RIGHT NOW. ALL OF YOU. MOVE.It gives me a little pleasure watching my dwarf idiots trying to follow my simple instructions. I give them meat and salad and sometimes they have the cheek to complain about being forced to eat the same food over and over again. I watch them sleep. I direct them to the bowels of hell to find some iron ore.I am not addicted to the game and I am certain my 6th attempt will bring me huge success. Apparently the next world is quite similar. You basically start all over again.So, I am not addicted. JUST. NEED. TO. COMPLETE. THIS. FIRST. LEVEL. TO. PERFECTION. "

												Bargain!  Like gnomoria? give this a whirl. Purchased it, very cheap, 25 hours later I completed the first map (of 3).  I had stayed up till 4am trying to fix something you need to fix before finishing the first level (spoiler protection). No better recommendation. I pulled an all nighter.Some thoughts:Good AI on the dwarfs, 90% did what I expected when I expected it. UI could do with some work.Grindy tech tree.Drags a little near the end of the first map, need virtually EVERY resource available to complete the map.Some resources are finite so dont go crazy making more than you need.Using the healing pots in combat is a pain ( open equip window, scroll thro all dwarfs to see injuries, rclick health pot, use, repeat up to 3 times per dwarf. Repeat every 10-15 seconds depending on armor equipped).Satisfying gaining, building and then using tech. (elevators, mine trucks, lightning towers)Not satisfying realising the tech is pretty obselete with the spells you have... (teleport, fireballs etc)I managed to snag it 50% off, but it would have been a bargain regardless.Happy to recommend.			"

								For a minecraft addict who is just not hardcore enough to get over the learning curve of Dwarf Fortress, Craft the World just seems to hit all the addiction points.  Building the first shelter and surviving the first major waves is surprisingly challenging, but it's great fun delving into the crafting game.  The dwarves sometimes do have spotty AI, and it can be hard and a bit frustrating trying to keep them alive near water or big enemies.  However, the player can directly control a dwarf and play it Terriria-style.  Looking for treasures underground or battle enemies in that mode is a lot more reliable and fun.The game is not without faults, but the charm makes it hard to put down once you start.  Definitely worth picking up.			"

												I think I have played enough of this game to give a good expination on what the game is about what its cons and pros are. so forth. Let me start with the Cons*No multiplayer *Constant Problems (needs, Waves of enimies, Such)*Bad AI (Their ai will tell them to go into a hole. and go back and forth for about an hour then get out saying im hungry)*Difficult to control Dwarfs. (Tell them to go somehwere? they'll go. but in the hardest way possible.)*No fast Foward button (Or i don't see it but while the game is going. the button to make the game go faster is non existant.)Pros * Fun game to get into. *Fun backstory * good time killer (Playing for alittle bit) *Nice Mechanics (Build your own bit) * artistic style is nice So my recomindation towards this game. Is a middle. If they changed some of the things that was listed then maybe the game would be a 100% Thumbs up. But for the mean time. it is a little tedious to play with. If they added their multiplayer then that would be more interesting. while the game is fun in its own way. There are ways that the developers could make it so much better. Personally what they could do for a start. is work on the dwarfs AI. The AI is a little bit a pain to work with. but when they go they will go. While the game is fun. My recomindation towards this game is going to be a Thumbs up, and a Thumbs Down. If the developers could fix the problems. then yes this game would and can be a really good game. but for nowMy rating of this game is a Thumbs up.			"

								Amazing mix between terraria and a strategy game. Unique, addictive and fun.Dig, fight, defend, attack by controlling a small band of dwarves. Gear them, earn skills (in ES spirit (doing same thing over n over)) feed them, build them a shelter and defend it!Graphics are pretty much like Stamworld Dig for those who played it. Interesting.The only downside (which is justified by the early access factor) is the poorly built rarity hierarchy. Meaning that, some items supposed to be rare are more common than meant to be common items...  "

												I really enjoy this game. I bought in during EA on a whim and have been pleasantly surprised by it. Especially the longevity it has in game play. It can be slow at times, and some of the newest features (rats, spiders) can get annoying, but these are minor gripes for an overall outstanding colony builder.You start with 1 dwarf, and grow your colony by crafting, fighting nighttime skeleton and zombie attackers, and then a massive wave of enemies every 45 minutes or so. In the first (easiest) world, you get to about 12 dwarves by the time you find and fix the portal out. Then you go to a new world where resources are harder to find, and the fighting waves of monsters are harder. This is where the game become much more challenging, which keeps it interesting.The dev recently added DLC which brought female dwarves into the game, and a few other changes, but the gameplay itself remains a colony builder at it's core. I do wish they would eliminate the damn rats that show up when your ""home"" is not yet ""comfortable"" as it just becomes an annoyance in the early part of each world, but like I said, it's a minor thing.

												Sort of a mashup between DF (or its clones like Towns, Gnomoria, Rimworld etc) and sidescrolling explorers like Terraria or it's many clones. You start with one dwarf on a random map and progress through multiple technologies all the while collecting resources, delving deeper, fighting off waves of monsters and building an appealing looking fort. Blocks are big so it isn't nearly as spammy as most block games.I've easily forgotten myself and stayed up hours later than I planned just because I wanted to finish up one more ore cluster, finish rearming my dwarves (there are about 6 stages or armor and weapons), or build one mre piece of eyecandy. Hghly recommended.			"

												Controls are a little meh, takes a bit of getting use to figure them out. At first I was anoyed with them but there are a lot of Hotkeys that make up for the lack of displayed controls.Art / Graphics look amazing.The way to unlock new items is cool, its a bit of a grind on some parts but for the most part you are going to be making the items anyways. What gets me the most is that you loss EVERYTHING when progressing through the ""campaign"". There is no reason to play the campaign at all since you can play a custom map and get the same experience without having to unlock the different levels. I understand that each map is a different world but does that mean I have to reinvent the door because I went to a snow biome? The levels have very little difference between them. With maybe 1 or 2 mobs having a Skin Change. The goal is still the same (Find and Open the Portal) with the same resources available(minus the stone world).Overal I really enjoyed my first couple worlds a lot, there was a bit of a learning curve that wasn't to hard to over come but the game got old pretty fast after my first complete world. I wouldn't recommend buying this at the full $20 but if it goes on sale some time it might worth your time.			"

												You start with a stockpile on the surface and one dwarf at your disposal, which you can order around by marking terrain, items or enemies or even selecting them and giving them direct orders (like ""go sleep""). Any and everything you gather is stored in the stockpile, and needs to be defended by your dwarves. Especially at night, when undeads walk the lands. In set intervals a portal will open and release a horde of enemies walking towards your stockpile, much larger than the few undeads during normal nights. As you gather ressources you can build a house around the stockpile with several floors, offensive towers and many, many items to fill it up. Several crafting stations produce different types of items, from food over equipment to more complex devices. Over time you will get more dwarves under control, which do all the work for you: mining, chopping trees, hunting animals, farming, killing monsters and generally keeping your base intact. They will also need to eat and sleep from time to time. Mind you: food has to be placed on a table for the dwarves to access it and sleeping should be manually ordered before entering a cave in the deep or the timed monster invasions. Just to make sure everyone is at maximum health. If one of your dwarves dies he is gone forever. A new dwarf joins you after a few minutes however. The items can be recovered, but his skills are lost.The goal of the game is to progress through the technology tree until you can create a portal which leads you to the next world. Building it will require finding caves in the deep and disposing of its bosses, as well as gathering ressources and finding the original, destroyed portal.The number of items to create is nigh unlimited and serves a huge amount of purposes. Even decoration items increase the comfort of your base and thus let the dwarves regenerate faster while sleeping. The dwarves themselves can pick up to three skill lines at once (warrior, miner, swimmer, logger, ..) which can be improved through skill books. You (the player) learn several spells ranging from a simple (but very useful) town portal to more advanced ones like the fireball spell. You do have limited mana, however, which regenerates at a very slow rate.Finishing the first (easy, small) world took me over 17 hours, but I took my time with it. This should give an estimate of the other worlds, which are all larger and have a more complex topographic.At any rate, if you enjoy more strategical, relaxed sandbox games this is strongly recommended.

												The Good:Time-sink heavy game that feels like a mobile port but manages to dance the line between Terraria, Minecraft, and Dwarf Fortress.  If you like time sink games, this will probably be enjoyable for you.  Tell your dwarves what to do, build a little house, progress through the tech tree, etc.  Not bad.The Bad:It still feels like a mobile game, huge cartoony buttons and facebook and twitter share buttons all over the place.The Ugly:They advertise multiplayer in the title card, but multiplayer is a complete crapshow.  The game itself is a sandbox progressive building and survival game.  The multiplayer game is a drop in random dungeon.  It's also gated by the main game, you can't just join a Multiplayer game, you have to start a regular game and progress until you have 5 dwarves, then create an advanced portal, then cast the Multiplayer Game spell.  On one hand, this is a decent idea because the game isn't the most intuitive, but on the other hand, I'd really just like to play a sandbox game with my friend please.In short, it's not a bad game, the multiplayer is poorly designed though (in my opinion), and I hope the dev eventually adds a proper multiplayer sandbox mode.

												I bought this game years ago, played it on and off, and I actually enjoyed it. I came back to it recently, hoping to make some similarly good memories.Bluntly, I was disappointed.While the crafting is easier than it was, and the dwarves seem slightly smarter, those are the only praises I can sing. The enemies seem stronger AND more numerous than before, and the ore in-world actually seems more sparse, leading me to believe there's been a ramp to push the DLC; one gives you mini-biomes you can get ore and coin from, the other adds female dwarves and pets that can fight for/with you. The end-game bosses (Scroll Keepers) have also been jacked up SIGNIFICANTLY, forcing you, the player, to equip all of your dwarves with end-game gear you'll need to farm coins to buy, or purchase the DLC to visit biomes to make. I'm not against people making money -- I'm an artist, I draw commissions for a living. I've dabbled in game design.What I AM against is people forcing DLC to make a game playable without farming -- it's not quite pay to win, but it's not far off. If Steam had a way to roll back before the updates that were DLC-balanced, I'd definitely recommend this game; but in it's current state, unless you're willing to buy the DLC, and have friends to play with, it's a grinding simulator atop a buggy game.

												For 19 euros you get a lot of hours of content.The game's a bit slow, punishing at times and perhaps repetitive. If you never liked DF's end game, onyl the struggle to it, this game is perfect. There's no end-game economy, just a slow climb to reach the next level.The game is mostly you sending dwarves to harvest resouce X or attack enemy Y. That's all you can do with them, though you can directly control one at a time (this is VERY inefficient). To aid their escapades, you can craft items (or queue them, if they require skilled dwarvish labour) and equip them or place traps and defences. Or use spells, like portals, to speed up their activities.Mining, as with all dwarvish games, is a big part. As you accumulate minerals, food and furniture, you are sometimes assaulted in a heavy siege, or find a loot-riddled dungeon. Ultimately, you wish to gather the plans for a portal and get out of there; it's never safe for long as sieges become stronger and fiercer. Certainly, it's a simple game. It's not DF compelxcity, but if you just want a simple, slow game that goes perfect with a nice podcast or video, this is great for those! For 19 euros, you get a pretty solid game, with plenty of length and exploring to do.			"

												This is basically Dwarf Fortess in two dimensions, with graphics but less complexity for it. That isn't to talk down about the game, I just spent all night playing it. This game is super fun. If you like Dwarf Fortress, you are going to like it.I haven't died yet so no idea if you have to redo all your progression if so. I got down to three dwarves but hid in my fort until things got a bit better. This game is more forgiving than Dwarf Fortress. I would call it graphical dwarf fortress light.As such, I think it could use some sort of Dwarf Therapist addition equivalent. But it's an exceptionally fun game and well worth the cost, though I am a bit irked they made me pay just to get female dwarves, dammit!			"

												While I do like the look of the game, there are things that need work.    Telling your dwarves to kill something, sends them ALL to attack. Leaving your stockpile open to attack by goblins, which I didn't know until it happened. The thing that bugs me most, is the lack of any explanation to do anything.  There is no tutorial to do that. Your given the option of starting a game, but are attacked every night by a number of enemies, while trying to figure out how to build a decent structure, or how to build things that your dwarves will need, like beds, and food. Others have other complaints about the game. But the lack of any helpful information is the biggest problem for me.			"

They also have access to parachutes that allow them to jump from high places without getting hurt.This should have been part of the base game, I like this game but as of the DLC release they are just trying to be greedy and lock basic things that should have been part of the game behind a pay wall due to how crappy the pathing AI is. I bought and played this game since it was first available and while it has improved the developers are now just going down the milk money path rather than implementing the needed items into the base game to deal with issues they won't fix.

												I played this game on a friend's computer earlier in the year and whilst it was ultimately very enjoyable it was also deeply frustrating due to the awful AI. So almost a year later when I found the game on sale I thought it must be worth it now - it must have improved.However it seems like the only real change is the addition of multiplayer which just seems like a way of making the dodgy dwarf AI even more frustrating to deal with. There is nothing more annoying than watching a dwarf repeatedly attempt to climb up a massive wall and repeatedly fall until they gradually kill themselves all for the sake of recovering a leaf that had fallen to the bottom of a long forgotten pit on the other side of the map.In the early stages of the game this problem is hampered by wood shortages so you cannot build ladders to prevent it or food tables, beds and a shelter to even heal them back up after. In the late game this problem results in spending significant amounts of time shoring up the map to stop the little morons killing themselves doing pointless things. Both are annoying.If it was my first playthrough I'd have tolerated it I guess but having already done all of this before and having already gone through all the tedious late game grinding each stage involves I found myself just wanting to give up and refund it after twenty minutes. So not a lot of replay value then...			"

												6.5/10; only buy on sale.Craft the World tries to be a more polished mix of Dungeon Keeper, Terraria, and Dwarf Fortress.  Sounds like an amazing idea, but the reputation and success of those games makes for extremely large shoes to fill.  Now, while CtW is a decently fun game, it's just not deep enough to appeal to fans of the games which it is based upon.  It has the 2d construction and mining that Terraria has, but none of the different worlds are nearly as ""epic"" as the world made in Terraria.  Terrarra had a significant ""Metroidvania"" aspect in its crafting and looting that expanded the player's exploration options once they've found the right materials.  CtW tries to do this in the form of a techtree, but it just feels grindy and arbitrary compared to Terraria's more subtle systems.  The different biomes from Terraria instead exist as separate maps in CtW, making the scope of each world much smaller despite the larger number of builders.   For example, one of the funnest aspects of Terraria was that digging could get you to run into old sunken ships, mushroom worlds, and demonic fortresses.  In CtW, you get more dirt, some insects, and maybe a vampire.  The game's pace is much slower as well, which makes it feel like a slog through a shallow pit compared to Terraria.Few games can match the complexity and deepness of Dwarf Fortress, but CtW doesn't even begin to graze the surface.  Dwarves in CtW are born with innate specializations and can train and equip for more, but they can't ever be assigned specific tasks.  There is a ""trader,"" but he's more like a regular RPG vendor and there is no diplomacy.  The challenge from DF is also unlikely to be found.  The game, with its combined slow pacing and simplicity, just doesn't have the same ""losing is fun!"" appeal that Dwarf Fortress does, and you have to really mess up badly to even begin to replicate experiences from that game.So why the recommendation?  Well, I cannot pretend that any game worse than DF or Terraria is a bad game.  I had some fun playing CtW, thanks to the graphics and polish.  Making my dwarves upgrade to defend against increasingly threatening invasions was fun.  I'm just not sure who to recommend it to; fans of Dwarf Fortress will find it way too simplistic, and fans of Terraria would want a more diverse world to explore.  Maybe to people who've played neither and are interested in this sort of game, but why?  DF is free and Terraria is 1/5 the price.Bottom line: Craft the World is a decently fun game but does not nearly match the epicness and complexity of the games it is based on.  Buy it on sale and don't expect to be blown away.			"

												One of the better games in my Steam library, I've recently started this one again from scratch.  Fun game of crafting/exploring/defending, really nice UI and graphics.  At higher levels, the periodic 'Monster' waves can be pretty overwhelming, but it adds an edge to the game that would be missing without the stress of trying to prepare for the next onslaught.  I've seen some comments about the dumb AI of the dwarves - they're not geniuses, but it's pretty trivial to get them properly marshalled with a little experience.  It's a crafting/exploration game first and foremost - some people will find that tedious, but I enjoyed working through the crafting tree.  The rewards at the higher levels of the tree are pretty substantial.  "

												Wonderful game if your only intentions are to play it alone. If you bought it thinking that co-op would a good time, please do not purchase this game. This isn't multiplayer in the sense that you can start the game from the beginning alongside your friend (in this case, my wife). You have to progress alone until you reach level 5, which then allows you to invite someone to play together. You are then warped to a biome (not the one you played on originally), where you play co-op, or pvp, with the person you invited (or that joined randomally, if that works. Didn't try it myself). In my opinion, having to go through any of the game solo to be able to play co-op is a very odd and misleading co-op functionality. It defats the purpose of what co-op is meant to be in a video game. I don't want to be forced to play alone for however it takes to be able to invite a friend, just to be thrown into a new world for the brief multiplayer fun, then thrown back to own world. With all of that said, if this was listed as a single player game, I would have no issues with purchasing it. Great game, lots of fun, just not true multiplayer.			"

												BUYER BEWARE: If you are purchasing this game for a RTS-style multiplayer experience, you will be disappointed. The multiplayer does not work like normal games (someone hosts, invite, join, voila!), but rather you have to craft a specific portal, which takes a bit of time to get to. Once you craft the portal, you can then invite your friend to something that looks like an instance. It is basically just a dungeon where you defeat a boss with your friend and then go back to your own world. I will be asking for a refund for this game on Steam for this reason. Hopefully I can deter anyone else who thought this was a legitimate multiplayer. If you are looking for singleplayer, have at it. The game is very fun, just not what I was expecting as far as multiplayer!			"

												I bought this game for playing crafting things and the sense of freedom. But I was so disappointed and didn't feel the freedom as I espected. The dwarves are so stupid and the settings of this game is so unfriendly.The settings of the workers AI are terrible. To build a long ladder, I have to watch the little foolish dwarf go and get just one piece of ladder from the base which is so far away and come back to install it ........AND repeat it again and again.Of course I can directly control one of them, but when I intend to build a big house or a huge one, I finally find it very inefficient. That would be a disaster...........Besides, the mechanism is very unfriendly, especially the tech tree which is made so complicated. When I want to make an iron pickaxe, I find that I need a furnace. Then I intend to make the furnace, but I find that I need water. Then I intend to get the water, but I find that I need a barrel. Then barrel, But timber. Then timber, But workbench. Then workbench, but table. WTF!!!Finally I made the workbench, but why it is working so slowly?! Oh! I forgot that you can not make an iron pickaxe when you find iron mine, cause you need to make enough things to unlock the corresponding part of the tech tree. what a rubbish setting. Compare with this, minecraft is much better. After you got a workbench, when you found stones, you can make stone pickaxe; when you found iron mines, you can make iron pickaxe after smelting the iron ores in the furnace which is so easily made; when you found diamonds, you can directly make a diamond pickaxe on the workbench without any other redandunt, boring and unfriendly processes.Oh!! What SHOULD NOT be neglected is that    this game is d*mn buggy!  The bugs just made me want to throw the developers out of the window of a ten-storey building.After finishing this review, I even want to install minecraft right now.......:(So I don't recommend this game.

												Craft the world is a fun game to play you start off with one dwarf and a knife and must build up from there. now to progress from a vietcong like hole in the dirt to a castle you need to advance on the tech tree, to do that you will need to make things belonging to that technology EXE. making basic stone works will advance you to advanced stone work sadly guns are only avablible in the last biome for some stupid reason. the ""story"" is some random a** dwarf saying the evil forces found us again thats it thats pretty much the only expostion you get.that said progressing is satisfying when you go from cowereing from goblins or skeletons to full on slaughtering them, the main threat to you is the monster horde, every Fourty mins or so a portal will open and a huge monster assault will happen i'm talkin' anything from basic zombies to huge or armoured skeletons weird eye monsters they will decimate you at the start crude clubs and wood armour don't really help when a gaint skeleton comes with a massive flail and starts S*** whipping every one... imagine that. though the biome your in also has specific enemies like the forrest world has goblins that look suspiciosly like native americans come to raid you are weird little furry eskimo tribes in the artic know one huge complaint is when dwarves have low health they will flee BUT sometimes they will stop mid flee and make a last stand you then yell at your screen YOU AREN""T A F****** SPARTAN FLEE DUMB*** but thats not the only problem after a while with all the mining building and what not your dwarves will be overwhelmed like one time i had a mine with a split one way went to S*** tons of oron the other a little coal and dirt you can't prioritize ores jobs or anything like that so i spent about 4 hours waiting for the iron to be mined because They went for the coal and dirt that section later gave me mithril but the point is you're dwarves get overwhelmed and might do the less contributing jobs first my last two points are A you need to build a totem to make a shelter so dwarves can sleep you can't just make single houses which if your under 50 percent comfort you constanly get rats  and B the sisters in arms DLC should be FREELC anything it adds would literaly fit right in to any tech tree but then you wouldn't pay 5 dollars for female dwarves and a few pets would you 8/10 would be 9/10 if not for the stupid DLC rip-off			"

												One of the most frustrating games I have ever played.  I can understand a game where your controlable units are meant to be careless and goofy, but this is far beyond that.  The AI is ATROCIOUS.  To the point where crafting even the most simple structures becomes a frustrating time sink of placing ladders, then removing ladders, then one of your dwarves gets attacked so EVERY SINGLE DWARF drops what they're doing to help, then they procede to pick up all the items they dropped and, instead of completing their original task, returning said items to base before having someone else entirely go now pick up the items, then oops one of your dwarves gets attacked...Over it.  Do not recommend.			"

								I absolutely cannot wait for this game to be complete; it's wonderful! A great game for those who love sandbox games such as Minecraft, Terraria, and others, yet would like a break from worrying about falling and breaking your neck, and directly engaging the monsters of the dark -- instead, let your dwarves do it for you! It focuses more on the crafting, exploration, and building aspects, while leaving the work to your dwarves (though, you can take direct control of them as well). I really have no complaints about this game whatsoever, and it is already very polished. While I have no complaints, there are a few features and polish I would like. For starters, a bit of polish could be used for the crafting interface; crafting the same items over and over can be a bit tedious when you have to put the ingredients in the specific slots each time (you can build multiples of the items, but it would be nice once a recipe is discoverd to be able to simply craft it instead of having to plop them all in their locations again. The only other thing I would like, is the ability to control the creation of the world itself a bit more. As it is now, you can select from Forest, Desert, and Snow settings, but it would be nice to have finer control over the creation of the map by increasing or decreasing the different ores found, etc. But this are minor quibbles -- I love this game!

This can make the game feel stagnant and slow at times.- Full screen only, which crashes local video players so you can't watch a video while playing. - No sense of purpose/long term goals, yet there is a second world to unlock so there is indeed a goal.Verdict:If this *looks* like your kind of game, it probably *is* your kind of game, and is worth $15.

												The game was a lot of fun at first, but it has a very grinding feel to it. Also the way the dwarfs move and do things is ridiculous, and incredibly tedious, the dwarfs will run around when you want them to go inside, they will not build blocks in the order you clicked them. Another annoying thing is the game is not very clear on how certain items work, i think it could of benefited with a tutorial at the begining. There is room for improvement.			"

												Craft the World is worth buying if you're looking for a 2D sandbox game that feels like terraria and all the others, but you command a group of dwarves instead of your own character. Three campaign levels lasting 15 hours each, and tons of replayability with randomly generated worlds and settings you can change with custom games. The dwarves may not be the smartest and will probably make you want to yell at them at times, but it is still a nice game.A quick look into the gameplay of Craft the World:

												I've really been enjoying this game a great deal and I wish they got a bit more love from players now. I guess I am two years late to the launch party but I am so glad it went on sale and I was curious enough to try it. I've been recommending it to my friends for a sale purchase. The only reason I say sale purchase is because there just seems to be a few weird AI quirks that make it hard to sell as a GREAT game, but for 5 bucks this has been totally worth it. Some of the quirks that are kind of annoying is that the dwarves seem to have some strange sense of priorities, or they go the totally wrong way, or they do one thing on one side then go all the way to the other side when the previous side had other things they can do. They don't prioritize targets to attack which really gets frustrating when defending turrets. Quirks and little annoyances. I don't have the DLC so maybe the DLC has improved on some of these. I guess I will have to get that at some point to see.But still, this game has been super fun and I've been on it for a week+ straight now....			"

												There are a few things that makes me not recommend this.  The tutorial-system is bad at explaining certain things. For instance, trying to figure out where it is allowed to place a totem for the first time is a pain. It is in no way obvious that dirt/rock walls count as a part of a room (this is not the case in most other games). I had an easier time in both Gnomoria and Dwarf Fortrress. Lack of fast shafting options and progressive mining. You can't order your dwarfs to dig down and also set up a ladder on the way. Having this feature would've been really practical as it would speed up management. It would also be nice to have the opportunity to mine out from the ground layer by layer vertically to avoid having to set up platforms to make it faster. The ""Sisters in Arms""-DLC is sort of a slap in the face. It would be nice to have a game where women can exist without having to pay extra. I get that the devs need some way of supporting themselves, but it would be nice if their additional funding didn't involve them literally selling access to digital women in a game (that also have different stats than their male counterparts!). The crafting system is pretty lame. There's no production line that has to be managed, only potentially creating of tools. To craft things, you open up a Minecraft-like crafting window, drop things in and them you'll be able to skip that process for subsequent crafts by auto-inserting items. This also means that crafts are instant the moment you have the resources in the stockpile. Dwarves falling off platforms for no apparent reason. How food works in this game still eludes me. Do dwarves need to go to the stockpile to eat?Guess I'll go back to Dwarf Fortress or something.			"

								Very addictive micro-management game, reminiscent of Dungeon Keeper in term of control you have over your dwarves.You need to defend your dwarves against waves of enemies, build them a proper shelter and progress technologicaly to better everything. :PThere is much to craft and create, plenty of fun and it seems you never have enough time to play it when you do.For an early access you won't be disapointed in the content, it feels like a complete agame.

												Rant alert:This is one of my favorite games I have bought recently. Hopefully, my 90+ hours of play time will show that! I really enjoy commanding dwarves to carve out through the depths of the underground. After I first bought the game, my first reactions were ""This looks so very nice!"", ""Wait... There are only  three  worlds?"" and ""Holy crap this tech tree!"" After my first 5+ hours I started to understand the games mechanics. Really easy to download and play, plus there is a tutorial, that is skippable when you start a new world. Now the problems I have with the game. Right around the middle of the tech tree, I find myself having to grind along. Most of that is because of a need for wool. The developers remedied this by adding traps and farms to maintain sheep. Unfortunately, both the farm fences and the trap require rope, which is made with wool, to make. Also, the AI for the dwarves still needs a little work. Often they will not pick up the resources I need and instead gather around tables for chats. That being said, the AI is not bad by any means. Recently there was an update that did help fix this. I have had a problems with occasional minor lag spikes and my saves corrupting if my computer bluescreens, which is not the developers fault. The fault lies with GeForce producing terrible cards ( and Nvidia producing updated♥♥♥♥♥♥drivers for older cards. Definitely worth $20. I would buy it again at that price, and an even better value if bought cheaper. Pros:-The games art style-Large tech tree-Large maps-Personally control one dwarf at a time-Wide spectrum of enemiesCons:-Grind, grind, grind-minor lag spikesBottom line:I would definitely buy this again and I would completely recommend this game for any of my friends.

								Megomaniacal Gnomes wanted:    Finally, control ALL the people on your Terraria server.  Why? Because they don't know wtf they're doing.  Build your very own fortress of DOOM.  Prepare to be ravaged by goblins.  Endless value & replay await.  Ever since Dwarf Fortress repeatedly made me it's b!tch, I've been dreaming of a game like this: easy enough to let me progress a bit further, feel somewhat accomplished a little more each time, *THEN* slaughter my gnomes, raid my base, raze my village, & crush my dreams of crafting the world.  TD, Sandbox, RTS, RPG elements - 97/100I love this game for what it is, & embrace the stoogely behavior of the gnomes as hilarious!  Thanks to the ingenious toggle system that allows the player to possess any of their minions, there is no excuse for failure here save your own lack of planning & skill.  Relax & enjoy your series of defeats as you learn the ways of the craft.  Think of each as another defeated exploration party on your way to winning.  There is a restart level button for a reason.  Compared to the impossible difficultly of Dwarf Fortress, this is sheer bliss, a fun game for beginners.   Don't be fooled!  Craft the World becomes fiendish & deceptive.  Enemies are clever...  perhaps too clever.  Most will get through th efirst few waves of the dead just to be smashed by invading gobs.  Fortify yourselves, friends, lest they feast on gnome flesh this night.""Craft the World"" has set a new standard and will inevitably go down in gaming history alongside the other clever hybrids of this neo-2D-Terrarian-sandbox phenomenon.

												I must admit this title probably wouldn't have been one I would have been looking for initially, but after seeing a fellow Twitch streamer playing it I decided to take a chance and purchase it.Strangely, although not my initial type of game I would play I find myself going back to it and even purchasing their recent DLC's because there is something satisfying in its gameplay.I find it very enjoying and relaxing to dig down further and further to the ever increasing depths to find the rarer minerals to gain access to stronger and better equipment for my growing population.This title seems to be on I go back to in order to relax between all the other titles I constantly produce material for via YouTube and Twitch, although that being said I have live streamed it also a few times.

												Really engrossing sandbox game! I can't remember anything I have enjoyed as much in years.At first I was put off by the cartoonish graphics but they are actually better than most of the competition in the same genre.The crafting system is extensive and, I believe, even more extensive than you get to see.Completing the first stage in campaign mode took me 40 hours, though I played it completionistly and could possibly have knocked as much as ten hours off of that.The second stage is markedly more difficult but you do get new recipes that you did not get in stage one.If you like crafting games like Wish, Wurm Online, Minecraft etc, then my bet is you will be loving this as much as I am.Rating?10/10 so far!

								Playing this game makes me feel like I should be poking my screen with my hands. This game was clearly intended to be made for mobile platforms. The line about a mix between DK, Terraria, and Dwarf Fortress hooked me in. Wish there was a 10 minute post-installation refund window.To be fair, it is early access and my complaints are mainly UI/Control/Mechanic based so maybe that will change but I doubt it.Edit: After spending more time with it, I've changed my opinion to ""recommends"". The game UI is still largely inefficient but the game seems to have a decent amount of depth to it. I'd recommend waiting on this game until it becomes more fleshed out, unless there's a sale on it that you just can't pass up.			"

Craft the World is a world building sim and a mix of Dwarf Fortress, Dungeon Keeper and Minecraft. Craft the World is also considerably long, and is undeniably fun.The game is immediately recognizable to anybody who has ever played a crafting game. It starts you off as a single dwarf who must chop, dig, and collect in order to build and fortify a shelter. Things start off very slow with your dwarf because he can only carry a small amount of materials before returning to the base. Thankfully, you quickly gain new dwarves to help out, which speeds things up considerably.Probably the biggest gameplay difference between Craft the World and other games in this genre is that when controlling your dwarves you are not directly responsible for moving them around manually. To direct them, you simply need to select enemies or materials that need to be dealt with. They will use the appropriate tool which they have equipped, which makes for a more casual experience on the surface.Some mechanics are poorly explained mainly what qualifies as a shelter and what doesn’t. The mission objective in early stages of the game is also poorly explain and players can seem lost at times.THE GOOD- Charming art- Progression system- Sandbox modeTHE BAD- Lack of depth- Poor toturialDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

If the game at least would work fine I could live with the dlc multiplayer feature. But the dlc multiplayer doesnt work correctly! So beware. If you play coop and you save, then only the Host dwarfes are getting saved. The other players will have random dwarfes the next start!So NO Recommendation for this game at this state.			"

												What an awesome Game!      I was concerned that Craft the World would be a clone of Minecraft or Terraria.   It's not!     This has quite a bit of replayability, surprisingly!   The campaigne goal of Craft the world is to master the map.   The map does have a completion (you can choose not to complete yet to keep building/mining/exploring) where you can go to the next harder map and try to survive the elements again!    Multiplayer.    The multiplayer is fun.   However...   It's not your traditional coop.  (Mixed Emotions included in this statement)   Instead of working together on your map,   coop involves teleporting to 1 of 4 Biome minimaps with a boss and a much shorter completion time.    You start on opposite sides of the map and work towards a comon goal.   There is also a PVP mode incase you want exploit your friends or a random person....   After the short Coop/Pvp map,  your back to your single player map with a reward from your coop/pvp experience.   It's a great help to the single player experience but not as easy to network with friends.   Did I mention you have to play each single player map a while just to unlock Multiplayer?   Is the game worth it?    Very much so!  Buy it already.   Think of this as a 1 player game with some cool Multiplayer ""features"" that reward your 1 player mode.   Sure you can select a friend from steam friendlist or play a random person so it is infact a Multiplayer game.    Maybe in the future there will be Coop options avaiable?   Either way,  Craft the world is a very solid purchase.			"

								Still in development but has alot of potential. Even in its current state, a pretty awesome game. Craft the World gives you a team of Dwarves, a couple of tools to get started, and unlimited potential. Build a huge castle or dig down as far as you can...  Or do both, all while unlocking increasingly advanced tecnology and defending yourself from huge yetis or devious goblins. Highly reccommended.			"

Early Access Review
								EDIT: August 2014This game is still good and getting better. All three worlds are in and changes are still being made for the better. The graphics are being improved with every patch, and the game feels fulland complete, with each patch just being a cherry on top. With the way the game is now, you can probably get 25 or so hours in a single playthrough, but it is fun to do multiple playthroughs. Worth the money for sure.This game still has a lot of flaws, given that it is in alpha, but it is incredibly fun non the less. If this game or games in this genre interest you, pick it up while it is cheap, because it is worth it, and only going to get better with more patches. This really does feel like a complete game, just with a few problems, so If you are willing to put up with it (or get it cheap now and wait for more patches so you don't have to pay more when the game is fully released) get it. Worth all of the $15, and even more than that.Edit:In the two weeks since I bought this game nearly all of the issues I had with it have been fixed. Dekovir is great about fixing issues soon after they come up, and they are excellent at taking in advice/suggestions from the players. Great company and great game.			"

												The game is like Terraria but instead of doing it yourself you have Dwarven slaves! They can be a little slow but they try, they may be a little dumb at times but they learn. The game itself requires some learning and patience but it's worth the time spent learning. It's really a lot of fun, seriously. Most of the negative reviews are made from not learning the game.			"

								Still in development but has alot of potential. Even in its current state, a pretty awesome game. Craft the World gives you a team of Dwarves, a couple of tools to get started, and unlimited potential. Build a huge castle or dig down as far as you can...  Or do both, all while unlocking increasingly advanced tecnology and defending yourself from huge yetis or devious goblins. Highly reccommended.			"

												I enjoyed this game a lot, but with the recent DLC Dig with Friends, I've noticed completely almost 0 changes, and they're trying to charge 6$ for basic coding that implemented multiplayer, the survival mode, and the creative mode are not even close to 6$, The DLC should of been free. I do not recommend this game because it takes them months, sometimes years to come out with new stuff, and they have little no to impact on the game, and they try to charge you money for it.			"

								After completing the first level, I decided to share my thoughts about the game. Lets start with the good:The world is fun to interact with. Instead of directly modifying it as in other games, you only indicate what needs to be done, and the dwarfs take care of the rest. It is fun to watch the clumsy dwarfs doing their job. Digging underground tunnels, building bridges, houses, and defensive walls. You need to explore the world to find needed resources. You start with cutting trees, but soon create long underground tunnels in search for rare minerals. You can help your dwarfs by equipping them with better tools, weapons and armor. From time to time, you get attacked by an army of skeletons and monsters. It creates the feeling of urgency, keeping you motivated to keep exploring and improving your defenses. One of your first tasks will be to build a shelter, a place where your dwarfs can replenish their energy, and defend against monsters. This 'world' part of the game is fantastic: 10/10.Lets continue with the bad:In order to progress in the game you will need to craft items. This is where the fun gets replaced by boring, and tiresome activity. In order to craft an item, you first have to display the crafting interface. This will show you a 3x3 grid where you have to place the components and click 'Craft' to finish. Each component needs to be individually placed in the grid, by dragging it from its location in the inventory. The inventory has a number of tabs, and an additional click is required to find the component. This tedious process brings absolutely nothing to the game. It is boring, interrupts the game flow (the game stops during crafting), and it feels more like work than play. It is extremely annoying when playing on the laptop with just a touchpad. A click-fest as another reviewer called it. I will call it a carpal-syndrome simulator. For example to craft a Bucket (a rather simple item) you need to click your mouse button 12 times (4 times drag-drop). And you will be doing it a lot. Every item in the game needs to be crafted, and in order to progress through the crafting tree, you will be even crafting items you don't need. The 'crafting' part of the game is simply not fun: 0/10.Unfortunately I can't recommend the game in the current state. Not with the boring drag-drop spreadsheet you will be forced to deal with half the time.  While still in the 'Early Access' state, the game has enormous potential, but I recommend waiting before buying it. Keep it in your wishlist instead.			"

												If you like games that involve crafting, dwarves, RPG, and monster slaying with a tower defence twiest then this game is for you. A large progressive tech tree plus lots of content such as lots of decor, spells, weapons, environment that makes the game very interesting and cool to play. Some management aspects of the game, dwarves do all the leg work and all you do is tell them what to craft, attack, and build. co-op is iffy but do not buy this game for that sole reason. This game is best played solo enjoying the ambience and transforming the environment to your needs and fighting hoards of monsters and completing objectives and building portals.This is a real gem and worthwhile game to sink some time in, I recommend you give it a shot.

												It has potential but still feels unfinished. Normally that wouldn't warrant a bad review but the fact that they are releasing DLC's that should be base game content (i.e. multiplayer and female sprites) is kinda ridiculous.The reasons that the game feels unfinished are that the AI for resource collection makes no sense. Your dwarves will wander to the far end of the map pick up one thing instead of the whole pile then wander halfway across the map to grab the next thing.There's also isues in that the game feels like a massive grind, the the tree is a great feature but needs fine tuning so it feels more intuitive and less of a grind. You end up crafting a bunch of window that you're never going to use just so you can get to the next level. Again, this would be forgivable stuff if they were still working on it not releasing overpriced cosmetic DLC's.It's frutrating because this game feels like it has potential but it still feels like it's early access. You can get Terraria etc. for a fraction of the price and there are so many studios that still release content and updates for free after you've purchased that this just feels like a rip off.			"

												Quick Summary: This game is mildly entertaining for a single level, but doesn't stack up against similiar mining/building games like Terraria, not even worth the $5 sale price I paid for it.Cons:-It seems like it was designed as a free smartphone app with in-app purchases, by which I mean the UI to get things out of your inventory is LITERALLY the worst of any game I have ever played. It makes basic tasks like putting out food for your dwarves (instead of laterns and ladders) a total chore. -There are game breaking bugs (like it not recognizing you set up a house, which is totally required for your dwarves to surivive)-There is almost no guidance, for a game that is trying to be simple I had to google search basic mechanics for the game more times than for any other I've played recently (like setting up house, farming, how to overcome glitches, how to get to the next level, etc)-As other reviewers note, the dwaves don't have amazing logic dictating their actions, so will frequently go about things in the least efficient, or most dangeous way.-Levels past the first one don't offer new technology, just slightly more difficulty and a little variation in the monsters. So if getting new technology for your dwaves is what kept you going, good luck with replayability.-Much of the technology is cool but totally useless. You can ALMOST use minecarts and tracks and elevators to save you time, but because of how quickly the dwaves mine through the dirt, this doesn't seem pratical to spend resources on.			"

												Pros: good atmosphere, a variety of enemies and crafting.Cons: the AI is simply intolerable disgusting, your dwarves will always be blunt, stuck somewhere, die like idiots. During the battle with the most powerful monster in the game, a couple of gnomes just ignored him and started to cut the vines next to it (do it automatically), when you get tired with AI, you will encounter the second problem: what, in fact, to do? And there is nothing. No plot, all you have to do - just move up the scientific tree, then build a portal to a new world and all over again, with the passage of one of the world took me 16 hours, on the second I just got bored.It pains me to play it.

												Buying a game that you have neither seen nor heard of is a lot like gambling. Sometimes it pays off and you get hours of fun out of it, sometimes you are dealt a bad hand. This time was the latter for me. As much as I want to like this game, it suffers from a tremendously bad UI that is clunky and not very intuitive. I had to keep replaying the tutorial because I simply couldn't wrap my head around the UI. I feel like it has a steeper learning curve than the game itself. Browsing the forums, I see others have had the same complaint and have requested everything from minor changes to a complete overhaul of the UI, and the developer's response has basically been “deal with it”. So the only hope would be for a UI mod developed by a third party. Maybe if/when that happens, I will revisit this game, but for now, it has been uninstalled and moved into my “Bad Games” category.

												This game has drag and drop, slow as balls, figgity as hell controls.  As another reviewer said, this screams MOBILE GAME.  But it's on PC.

Early Access Review
								Holy cow this game is addicting. I usually try to stay away from Early Access games but I picked this up when it was on sale and I don't regret it. Once I start, it's hard to stop. Lots of progression and things to do. You command dwarves to cut down trees, dig for minerals, fight monsters, hunt animals, defend off regular waves of enemies, cook food for your army, build armor and weapons, and more.Not everyone's type of game, if you're expecting something like Terraria or Starbound then you're not gonna get it here. This is a different experience for people who like managing multiple individual units and completing a lot of tasks.			"

												This Gnomoria/Terraria hybrid is trying to be good, but has too many problems that can't be overlooked. The positive about this game is the art style. The devs put a lot of time into the graphics.However, despite the good graphics, this game has many issues:1: AI pathfinding is very bad ( both enemy and dwarf ) - I managed to find ways to slow down all the enemies in the raids to the point my dwarfs only have to fight 10% of them ...2: Dwarven logic is bad. I've watched my little guys do a lot of stupid things, such as drowning themselves to pick up a weapon at the bottom of a lake ( can't stop it ), climbing a mountain instead of using the tunnel shortcut, walking right into a clump of enemies, standing in one spot despite having a job right in front of them, hauling one item at a time even though they have capacity for three, ignoring portals and instead walking all the way across the map.3: In sandbox mode, craftable items are given randomly - many necessary things will not drop for a long time. In my case on the last play, I couldn't cook anything because I did not have the recipe for nails, I couldn't make steel items because I did not have the recipe for ingots, and my dwarves almost starved to death thanks to not having the recipe for a table.4: The crafting system is awkward. You first find the item you want to make, than click-drag items from inventory onto your pattern. This actually takes a while to make some things AND if you accidentally click on something without dragging it, the pattern is lost meaning you have to start again. Why couldn't these devs just copy Terraria's crafting system, which is a LOT easier and faster.5: The dwarves won't eat unless YOU put food on a table. This may seem like a minor gripe at first, but this mechanic gets annoying FAST!6: Unable to remap keys. For many folks such as myself, this means we can not zoom since we do NOT have a mouse wheel !!!7: Dwarves are very slow. The devs should have a 4X and 8X game speed option.8: It's very common to have goblin raids at the start of the game that can easily wipe your dwarves out!9: Raids keep getting tougher sandbox mode, despite most armor and weapons being impossible to craft due to the random nature of the recipe drops !10: Flooding is an issue. In a map that has a lot of hills, water collects in the valleys, flooding some areas out over time. A goblin village that spawned at the start of the game ended up three blocks under water ! ( that map ended up about 50% underwater before I dug drainage ditches to the oceans )11: This game becomes very repetitive very fast !			"

												The briefest way I could describe this game is ""simpler Terraria RTS."" The perspective is very similar, what you're doing (gathering resources, crafting, digging deeper, expanding out, making little buildings) is basically the same, etc. However, you have dwarven minions. If you click on a tree, one goes and chops it down. Click on some dirt? He digs, then the dwarves bring the items back to your base. Although their storage capacity can be increased as you go along, sheep are required for this and other desirable items, but they seemed exceptionally rare. It takes a while for the dwarves to get back, but luckily you can open a portal that lasts about 4 minutes to ferry them back and forth for a while, which is nice.You have a technology upgrade screen that shows you how much XP you need from building things in each category to unlock the ability to build things from the next category. At night...you guessed it, enemies spawn and attack. Goblins do show in the daytime, as well, though. Another Minecraft throwback is the need to place crafting supplies on a workshop grid in the shape of what you want to build. The game will let you auto-spawn the items needed from your supplies if you've crafted the item at least once before. I can't say there was any enjoyment or call for that to be required in the first place, though. Unfortunately, much of the time is just spent watching dwarves walk around and hit inanimate objects or the occasional enemy. I built a workbench but couldn't seem to be able to place it anywhere, so my crafting was slowed down by that. An enemy attack wave counter was ticking down at the top of the screen, and it was down to about 20 minutes or so by the time I quit the game. I just found Terrarria far more engaging, as each piece of equipment you get in that gave feels like a treasure, whereas giving EACH dwarf a pickaxe, cutting axe, hat, and club and having to craft many of those just felt like a chore. When I finally did close the game, I just wasn't entertained, and had no initiative to stick around for 20 more minutes to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by skeletons since I lacked a house despite trying to make one.There -is- a note section in the game, and thinking back, maybe it tells you how you can place the work bench. I don't know. There just wasn't anything to make me want to keep playing, though I did like the sound effects, some of the UI, and the character dialog portraits. If very mellow games are your thing, this might be right up your alley, but it was a bit dull for me, leading to feelings of apathy, so I cannot recommend it.			"

												This game is not ready for release.Current issues: * Co-op mode is not available from the start. The game puts you into a lengthy tutorial mode and you won't play with your friends for hours, if ever, before you're done.* UI tries to be user-friendly, with the ghost of dwarf fortress looming overhead. It's trying, it really is. And it fails, and fails hard. I could not figure out how to make a totem for over an hour before I realized that I cannot make one in the tutorial, it just gives you one. The UI for crafting is similar to minecraft misleading you to believe you have to guess the right combination to unlock it. You can't.* Path finding is path failing. A lot. You'll be scratching your head why your guys won't place a bed or a torch or a ladder, or anything, even on flat terrain. It will fail with no explanation, over and over.* To make a valid shelter you need to hit the wiki. You won't figure it out on your own. Without a valid shelter, your dwarves won't sleep in beds you make for them. By the time you get frustrated enough to hit the wiki you may realize that you've ♥♥♥♥ed up so hard you can never make a valid shelter and have to start over the whole thing.I can go on, but I stopped here and so should you.In closing, I applaud the developer for trying to make a user-friendly dwarf fortress, but there is a lot more work to be done here before this can be considered a user-friendly game.

Some levels force you to only go so far due to lack of resources. By learning to be more efficeient you can progress faster and a little further.

												In a voxel-esque survival game where you need to build a shelter to endure the night when creatures run rampant... The most basic walls are not constructable until you reach roughly level 4 on the tech tree... YEAH! You read that correct. You start the game on level one and it tells you to build a shelter to survive... But your dwarves are to stupid to put up some wooden slabs as walls until tech level 4. I found an undead lich-knight (That shouldnt be in the inrtaductory tutorial level in the ♥♥♥♥ing first place!) which slaughtered half my stupid dwarves  (because even though they can climb walls they decided to just fall into the lich chamber and take extra damage and stun themselves) before my idiot dwarf squad could even cunstruct so much as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wooden shack.I came here expecting something like the cult classsic Diggles.

After few hours I thought that I had seen the game and started thinking that the travel distances etc. would start breaking up the experience, but I'm still happily playing :) (Even at that point I felt that I got my moneys worth.)I don't particulary like the way the game forces player to advance through the tech tree and I still don't (after hefty amount of hours) understand how certain things (like the confort level) affects anything. I was also a bit dissappointed when I realized how little meaning there is to expand your structures from caves up from ground level.In the end this is very well rounded up game and I would certainly recommend it!+20 hours laterPlayed through the first world... Game wraps up itself nicely! There are (just) enough objectives beyond the basic resource management and fortress building to keep you interested, although I needed to push myself a tiny bit from the early game to keep playing, it was worth it. Now I'm eager to try more difficult setups.			"

												While the game is pretty and interesting... it fails on some pretty important points.The tech tree is annoying... however, it is the ONLY reason to play the game. There is no story or over-arching goal here. Terraria had a goal and a little bit of a story. This does not.Next, pathing is abyssmal. Dwarves falling all over the place. Combat (dwarves fighting) is also very questionable. Again, however, there is ABSOLUTELY NO POINT.Enjoyable for a few hours of mindless fun. Then delete and install a better rendition.			"

The game has a tech tree where you unlock better items, which is great untill you have to make 40 pots of dye and master paintings to produce better armour. There is also a version where as time goes on you unlock recipes, however I rage quit after all my unarmoured dwarfs died dispite having the knowledge to make silver armour but not the ability as they didn't know how to make the bucket required for the forge.

												It's fun until you get to the second world more or less. By that point the game seems to fall apart.- The monster portal and monster spawn locations are rather erratic, to the point they can spawn somewhere that completely negates your defences, like your roof. The monster portal itself just presents an annoyance that rushes the game.- The absolute worst and most annoying aspect of the game would have to be building and crafting things. It's annoying enough having to drag ingredients to the slots like Minecraft, even more so when starting a new world when you've already done it. Beyond that, it's kind of unbalanced and repetitive because of the linear tech trees required to unlock more stuff to build. In a game like Minecraft or Terraria you can craft anything from the very start of the game as long as you have the resources and facilities to build it.Say you actually have to go down the tech tree if you want to get basic wooden blocks to build with. So when you build your first section of the base early in the game, make sure you do it perfect. Even worse that wooden towers is reasonably far down the tree to a point that by the time you reach it, it can be nearly worthless.			"

												This game is awful. I'm not sure how long it takes to be able to build a door but I wanted to build a shelter that a hatch wouldn't be suited for. And I can't rotate the hatch so I'm left with no shelter until I build a ton of items to unlock the door. I tried playing this game twice and kept getting killed because of bad dwarf AI and a ton of enemies showing up out of nowhere before I could build anything worthwhile. It's a great idea for a game, but it takes too long to setup before waves of enemies attack. Also, I couldn't instruct dwarves to pick up certain items before they ran off to complete another task so I had to cancel all of my tasks so they would go pick up items from the boar they just killed or the tree they just cut down. And there's no option to pick one dwarf for cutting trees or for mining so you're left trying to optimize their equipment based on the task they're doing without getting the ease of giving them general commands.

												Within first week I played 100hours, yes, in 7 days. Dwarfs are stupid, command dwarf to go here, he goes other way. Command dwarf to dig right next to him, no he/she waits another dwarf who's furthest away. Need to pick up the dirt you just mined? Nope, you'll have to wait another dwarf from another side of the map to come pick it up. Craft new table, dwarf is standing next to workbench, nope, wont craft. Someone from other side of the map will come and craft. Dwarf is hungry? You would think he/she would go to eat, nope, command dwarf to eat and... WHEE! IT WILL EAT!If these kinda little things doesnt bug you, this game is amazing. Craft craft, dig tunnels, explore, gather minerals, craft weapons and armors. I absolutely enjoyed this game, still do, you can always start custom map with nightmare difficulty which actually is pretty hard but doable!What this game needs more is new levels and maps!9.5/10!

												I do not understand why the developers have not fixed the fact that the dwarfs seem imcapable of fighting effectively against any enemies. They run around not fighting, they pause and wait, they die when they should not RAGE QUIT is the term that this game brings to mind, fustration at the death of dwarfs who cannot even effectively fight a ants nest as a group. The game should have been fixed quite some time ago, And if the dwarfs run around 'tying to pick up an object on the other side oft he map' one more time! and don't get me started on how they cannot even work out how to do basic tasks such as digging. I love the game until I hate it because of this most basic of problems. PLEASE allow us to resurrect our dwarfs easily when they die because of their own stupidity. !!			"

												*This is a casual game with no loss condition. The only theoretical threat comes from night-time hordes of monsters, but that's a farce. Assuming they successfully breach your defenses, they just stand there in the main hall, waiting for morning to come (at which time they burn to ashes like vampires), while all your critically injured dwarves sleep and heal somewhere else.*The crafting system for Craft The World is a textbook example of a developer ripping a system off from another game without actually understanding its point. In Minecraft, you get a 9 square grid where you can place ingredients because you are meant to actually guess and experiment with recipes. In Craft the World, the recipes are *given to you* as you advance down a tech tree, but the game still expects you to laboriously drag ingredient by ingredient to the grid every time you want to craft something. Why can't I just select the item and quantity I want and be done about it???*Most techs range from mildly useful to entirely cosmetical, but you are still required to craft several items from each to unlock the next, which results in a lumbering grind.*There are no female dwarves and population does not increase the way... one would expect. Instead, new dwarves magically teleport in when you reach tech tree milestones. There's no demographical simulation at all; this ain't no Dwarf Fortress.*You have to manually reposition all traps after every night-time invasion attempt by the undead horde. But as I said, you might not even bother, as nothing of consequence actually happens if they get through.*The sound effects are exaggerated, repetitive and get on your nerves. From non-stop loud snoring to the cheesiest battlecries, your ears don't get 10 seconds of respite.			"

												I would give this game 6 out of 10 points.It is nice if you want a peaceful crafting game.The singleplayer is good. There are different worlds to explore with different animals and hardships. The goal to complete the Portal on the other hand is rather boring. You have to max out the techtree every level if you are not going to play multiplayer games.The multiplayer without friends owning the game is nonsense. You need luck to get a player who is not going to cancel halfway in the game. If there would be a bonus for the remaining player it would not matter. Instead you try to achieve the goal of the multiplayer game, in the worst case sacrifice a dwarf and waste your time without getting an item. "

Early Access Review
								I am so addicted to this game, it's not even funny. I just ""beat"" the game in sandbox mode - assembled the broken portal - and VOILA! There's an update that changes the look and feel of the whole game! BAM! Thank you! I am so excited to play again! And on a different terrain this time! Maybe campaign? Who knows? But I love the look and feel of this game. It's a little slower paced than some of the other dwarf/gnome/halfling/etc. sandbox builder game, but you have less people, too. You need to plan out your building strategy a little - no selecting large areas and sitting back to let them go. You will have quite the wait. And make sure you have a portal spell ready or you will be wondering why your force seems to dwindle as they get stuck down below mining with a huge long trek back. The AI is a little funky, but you can work around it without much difficulty. And the dwarves climb the walls!!! Yay! It can be hazardous if they fall, but it means they get stuck less often due to lack of ladders or scaffolding. I like the animations - the workshops and such when they are being used. All-in-all, I'm looking forward to each update and am very impressed with how well the devs listen to the players. Now, back to the game.... ;-)			"

												I bought this game when it was still in its early stages of development, almost a year ago. The game was fun back then, but it clearly needed a lot more work put into it, so I left it for a while and decided to come back to it once it had been updated a bit.Almost a year on, I decided to give the game another blast and see what had changed. The answer to that was, not a lot!It's a very slow paced game where you need to craft various items from basic house furnishings, to weapons and equipment. The recipes need more and more materials to create them, so you need to venture deep into the earth and explore the wild around you to find them. The problem is, this slow pace is almost halted to a crawl as the AI of the dwarves is absurd!The dwarves often stand there ""path finding"" when they are stood in the middle of an open area, with nothing around them which could be considered an obstacle. Often even a simple jump takes 20 seconds of calculations to work out how to do it.I revealed an area with some pretty tough monsters in it. A guardian whom can summon skeletons and is only vulnerable to mithril (which will take you some time to research due to the afore mentioned problems). After realising he was too tough, I cancelled my command to attack him and wanted my dwarves to go back to what they were doing. The problem was, once I had cancelled the command, this did NOTHING to stop my dwarves repeatedly running and trying to attack the Guardian. Even using the ""call to fortress"" feature was useless as that would cause them to stay in one place and do nothing, then once I cancelled this order, they would run straight back to the Guardian to try and kill him!In the end my dwarf I had skilled up to be my main warrior was killed due to his own (and the games) stupidity. After this, I decided that the time and effort I put into getting to where I did had been wasted.I would not reccommend this game unless the developers revamped the entire AI system and made the game actually playable. Until then, it's not worth £14! I would pay maybe £3 for this game, but would much rather see it offered as a flash game on some website for free!			"

												Very fun for the first world, but you start completely over on the second world with no previous progression held over. Second world could still be fun as you can make a much better base and manage dwarves better with the knowledge you're cementing from the first world. However once you've done that you have no reason to play beyond the second world. Could be much better if the worlds offer vastly different or you retained some levels or recipes from your previous world. Comparisons to Dwarf Fortress don't feel quite right as the Dwarves don't really have personalities or stats, and their power is determined by their gear pretty much and the skill books you give them. Still, I'd recommend it since it's cheap and I was seriously engaged for about a week.			"

Early Access Review
								I was looking for simple crafting games to keep me entertained, and so I decided to check out Craft the World.  I didn't expect much;  A simple 2D scrolling mining game, maybe some tower-defense style challenge, but otherwise a fairly straight forward game that was early in production.  I assumed it was a game that was probably very basic and still quite sketchy.  What I received was a surprisingly well polished game, and for that I am thankful.  So often Early Access games are mere scaffolding with a thin layer of activity -- Just enough content for testing and a lot of blind alleys to stumble into.  But with CtW, you are getting a near-complete game.  On top of that: The art is pleasing, the sound effects are appropriate, and it has catchy music.Almost everything works.  There are some aspects of the game play which do not function (such as comfort-level inducing items), but none of the lacking features cause much hinderance.Of all the ""2d semi-autonomous dwarves running around in procedural random worlds and building stuff"" games, CtW is my favorite.  It's soothing to play; Challenging but not in a nail-biting click-fest manner.  Just what I wanted right now, something to curl up in bed with and play on the laptop.Kudos for Dekovir for EAing such a polished product.			"

												I bought this game when it was still in its early stages of development, almost a year ago. The game was fun back then, but it clearly needed a lot more work put into it, so I left it for a while and decided to come back to it once it had been updated a bit.Almost a year on, I decided to give the game another blast and see what had changed. The answer to that was, not a lot!It's a very slow paced game where you need to craft various items from basic house furnishings, to weapons and equipment. The recipes need more and more materials to create them, so you need to venture deep into the earth and explore the wild around you to find them. The problem is, this slow pace is almost halted to a crawl as the AI of the dwarves is absurd!The dwarves often stand there ""path finding"" when they are stood in the middle of an open area, with nothing around them which could be considered an obstacle. Often even a simple jump takes 20 seconds of calculations to work out how to do it.I revealed an area with some pretty tough monsters in it. A guardian whom can summon skeletons and is only vulnerable to mithril (which will take you some time to research due to the afore mentioned problems). After realising he was too tough, I cancelled my command to attack him and wanted my dwarves to go back to what they were doing. The problem was, once I had cancelled the command, this did NOTHING to stop my dwarves repeatedly running and trying to attack the Guardian. Even using the ""call to fortress"" feature was useless as that would cause them to stay in one place and do nothing, then once I cancelled this order, they would run straight back to the Guardian to try and kill him!In the end my dwarf I had skilled up to be my main warrior was killed due to his own (and the games) stupidity. After this, I decided that the time and effort I put into getting to where I did had been wasted.I would not reccommend this game unless the developers revamped the entire AI system and made the game actually playable. Until then, it's not worth £14! I would pay maybe £3 for this game, but would much rather see it offered as a flash game on some website for free!			"

												Very fun for the first world, but you start completely over on the second world with no previous progression held over. Second world could still be fun as you can make a much better base and manage dwarves better with the knowledge you're cementing from the first world. However once you've done that you have no reason to play beyond the second world. Could be much better if the worlds offer vastly different or you retained some levels or recipes from your previous world.

Early Access Review
								I am so addicted to this game, it's not even funny. I just ""beat"" the game in sandbox mode - assembled the broken portal - and VOILA! There's an update that changes the look and feel of the whole game! BAM! Thank you! I am so excited to play again! And on a different terrain this time! Maybe campaign? Who knows? But I love the look and feel of this game. It's a little slower paced than some of the other dwarf/gnome/halfling/etc. sandbox builder game, but you have less people, too. You need to plan out your building strategy a little - no selecting large areas and sitting back to let them go. You will have quite the wait. And make sure you have a portal spell ready or you will be wondering why your force seems to dwindle as they get stuck down below mining with a huge long trek back. The AI is a little funky, but you can work around it without much difficulty. And the dwarves climb the walls!!! Yay! It can be hazardous if they fall, but it means they get stuck less often due to lack of ladders or scaffolding. I like the animations - the workshops and such when they are being used. All-in-all, I'm looking forward to each update and am very impressed with how well the devs listen to the players. Now, back to the game.... ;-)			"

								I have to say, this is one of my favorite games and one that everybody in my family loves and plays.  The dwarves sometimes do stupid things like attack big bosses with little to no health (then die..) or just not escape through the portal I put RIGHT NEXT TO THEM but is just so many reasons to love it.  Overall, I have VERY little to complain about.  Even as a putz around game to play while doing other things it is great.  Set them to task and go get some stuff done.  Crafting menu is HUGE and VERY easy to use.  Can beef up your dwarves with armor and skills.  This is certainly a game that will last the test of time.			"

												Fun simple little game to relax with. Not sure it's worth the pricetag, but definately worth it at half price. The negative reviews complain about dwarves getting stuck for no reason, etc., but I've found that organising your expeditions into the earth into simple layers allows the dwarves to get around easily and without issues. The crafting is kinda tedious, but it is fairly simple, and it's easy to craft multiple copies of required items. The attacks the monsters make aren't particularly difficult to deal with, but having every dwarf with a combat skill from a book makes it a breeze, but mildly expesive to achieve. Don't expect a complex, in-depth game, and you'll be pleasantly surprised. 8/10			"

Notes: -One world takes a long time; spent 25 hours in all to complete the first world.			"

												First of all That game is about being the ruler of the dwarf you think for them ...you care for them ! about the Ai.... that folks tend to criticise is not true i mean yeah some time you think they are stupid to go straight to one of the Boss down there alone ....... but then you realise that the Dwarf was just going to get some ressource that fell on the floor because some random mob destroyed the block ...... but if you plan your dungeon carefully ..... i got no big issue with that !The only down side is that the Manegement of the dwarf is not good enough no fast Stats on the side of the screen like in WOW when we were 40 in raid ...... Anyhow that game is time killer like crazy for me and still playing and enjoying that good Game for about 150mb that game is awesome !			"

												This is a cute little addictive game. It would be nice to pick what skills they get right off - waiting for books to drop to retrain them is annoying.

Drifting in between games looking for something to do.I am so very glad I got it, though. At first it wasn't what I expected but it has grown on me enough that I almost always keep it installed. The latest addition of multiplayer has been interesting to say the least, though I feel it needs more design time. I really enjoy replaying this one as well, because it always feels like a different experience each time. Don't pass this one up. It's worth it.			"

												when I first launched it I liked it, but I kept re-making levels because it took me some time to find the difficultly I liked. I started from the bottom and worked my way to Hard difficultly, going through a total of 3 difficulties I think. This is a problem because you have to re-make the whole save file to change difficulties. This is more of a problem because it takes some hours until you realize that the difficulty is too easy and the game has become essentially minecraft in creative mode. If I was able to change difficulty within a save without making a new one then I'd probably recommend this game, as I wouldn't now be bored and would be further in the game progression. If this game had multiplayer I'd also probably recommend it, as it would have more re-playability			"

								Craft The World is ownly bound to get better.  There are so many more features in this game than they let me know of!  The game seems to intelligently progress in difficulty and is constantly keeping me on my toes, but not ruining the experience.  This game is like Lemmings and Terraria put together.  I like Dwarf Fortress, but we can't compare apples to oranges, folks.The fun is in the unique management that you have to endure.  There is no number crunching of taxes or balancing of peasant population to that of the warriors...  The management is in the making sure your work gets done before nightfall, keep your dwarves fed, provide a safe work environment (yes, they can slip, trip, drown, and fall to their deaths), provide shelter, and then get to your exploring.To top it off, the game is visually enjoyable.  It is asthetically color balanced and the animations are reminicent of Monty Python's cartoon shorts.I love it!			"

								I have to say, this is one of my favorite games and one that everybody in my family loves and plays.  The dwarves sometimes do stupid things like attack big bosses with little to no health (then die..) or just not escape through the portal I put RIGHT NEXT TO THEM but is just so many reasons to love it.  Overall, I have VERY little to complain about.  Even as a putz around game to play while doing other things it is great.  Set them to task and go get some stuff done.  Crafting menu is HUGE and VERY easy to use.  Can beef up your dwarves with armor and skills.  This is certainly a game that will last the test of time.			"

												I reccomend this game but only in some circumstances.It's a fine game, its well made, the art is nice, graphics are vibrant and the gameplay and crafting systems are pretty in depth. The crafting system is especially well made and is probably the highlight. I've seen some people say its hard to control the Dwarfs and it is and isn't at the same time. Early game its easy to get your dwarfs moving in one direction. Late game once you get vast chasms of mines and tunnels you'll be tearing your hair out when goblins suddenly spawn next to your house while all your dwarfs but 2 or 3 are away in the tunnels. There are some useful presets you can give to your dwarfs to perform certain jobs, the lite RPG elements are neat and give serious benefits to highly leveld dwarfs for their jobs but it becomes damn near impossible to keep track of everything and keep all your dwarfs on the same page after your population hits 20 or 30. The crafting is neat. You start you gathering resources and clearing tunnels and land. You develop a nice plot to place a house on and keep your dwarfs slept and fed and then you go from there progressively upgrading and improving your tools, armor, weapons and workbenches. The crafting system has a fairly deep system but it still didn't seem deep enough to keep me interested late game. After so long it became more of a stalemate and i couldn't keep up nor could i dig far enough and build enough ladders to get to the best ores. At this point i lost interest since i was more or less in a slogging grind and was making little to no progress. To some that may be part of the fun, and it is for me usually, but the crafting system wasn't deep enough to keep me grinding. Since crafting is one of the main, if not the main, selling points of this game that can be a hit or miss depending on who you are or what you like. I'd recommend it to people who can get this game on the cheap and enjoy cartoony games with lots of charm and a neat little twist on the craft/survive genre. Its got a bit of Minecraft, Terraria and a bit of RTS-RPG like Warcraft 3. It has good charm from your dwarfs and some of the enemies you battle. It has vibrant colors with clean, well made graphics that fit the atmosphere and gameplay perfectly. And finally the sound design and quality are pretty top notch for an indie game or Mobile port (not sure if this is a mobile port but it seems like one). Pros -Vibrant Colors and Graphics. Very clean and pretty.-Nice sounds and music. Helps keep the charm of the game up during play.-Charm. This game has a good amount of charm, atleast to me.-RPG elements. It has several layers and types of RPG elements-Crafting system. Its fairly easy to understand, a bit convoluted but has decent depth.-RTS elements with individual characters having their own equipment slots.-Many different jobs and noticable changes to productivity from job skills leveling up.Cons-Turns into a grind late game.-Crafting system wasn't deep enough to keep me interested late game or long term.-Some enemies seem very annoying, the goblins especially.-The game is good in many different facets but doesn't really excell at any one in specific.-Somewhat convoluted design to mages and some crafting recipes.-A slight learning curve, especially for those new to the genre.-Some of the items and furniture seem useless and arbitrary.Thats about it. Its good little game. I feel it was worth the price. I think i payed $7.50 or $10 for it and i got a nice, enjoyable 10 hours out of it. I'll probably come back a few months down the line to give it another play through because the game does have a lot of charm to me despite its flaws. Its a, for the most part, technically solid game that was better than i'd expected. I think it deserves a buy if you're into Terraria/Starcraft, Minecraft and other games of that ilk. I wouldn't reccomend it on its RPG-RTS elements alone but they blend together well with the survival/craft elements to make a rather enjoyable and worthwhile game, even if its worth wasn't that long for this one guy.

Early Access Review
								This will become the next ""Minecraft"" ! Although early access, this is a game like it hasn't been made in a long time !!! Keep an eye for this one because it will be for sure for a long time a HIT ! If this one doesn't get the ""game of the year"" title, I don't know anything anymore about PC games, and I've seen a lot of them since the late 80's ! Addictive and fun !!!! You just want to keep playing.Please keep improving and investing in this game, this one really diserves a big applause !Keep on with the good work !			"

												This is a pretty solid game, with three different worlds, and a strong resource management mechanic. Managing a group of characters is a good break from the crowd of other 2D crafting sims, which helps to make it stand out, with the option of directly controlling those characters for a time if you need to. Each world type has a different underlying mechanic, which again keeps the gameplay fresher. There are different challenges to gathering and maintaining resources.The amount of items you can make is pretty good, with a tech tree in the campaign that can be turned off for custom play. Magic spells and a mana pool add another resource to manage, with a few fun and a few more useful spells and potions. I neglected these in my first games, and my experience was the poorer for it. Mana is useful!Games run pretty long, and my main critique is the pathfinding AI. As you spread out and make tunnels branching off to gather resources, the dwarfs do have a tendency to make illogical decisions such as walking all the way to a task and then simply returning to the home base. This can be fixed by putting down a portal next to the task and bypassing the long walk, but it tends to hog mana, thereby limiting what else you can use it for. As a shortcut it works fine, but it's a shame that sometimes you are forced to rely on it. That said,  have enjoyed the game even taking that into account.			"

												Great game with a fun concept. Similar to games like Terraria but with less direct control but it adds a whole new dynamic by managing a group rather than a single person. You can still take control of a single character or let them run. Occasionally frustrating when they won't follow commands due to fatigue that's vaguely indicated so often you have no idea why they aren't working. But it's something that's quickly overlooked as a flaw. Would be nice if they could speed up a bit, once they get deep underground it takes a very long time to transport supplies and building additional supply points takes a while so once you hit a certain point it gets really mundane for a while until you jump up to the next tech. Otherwise a great game. I would give it a 8/10			"

												This is an OK game. It is not great, but it might amuse you for a little while.  Its probabbly best bought on sale.The Good:It is a crafting / exploration game.  There are far to few of these.  It has a wide tech-tree with lots of objects and stuff to build.  The world generation is decent too although there isn't enough coal in the small worlds.  I had to buy a lot from a vendor.  If you are really into making an asthetically nice dwarf city, you might get more milage out of the decoration options.The bad: The UI can use some work and it is a little annoying.  You can't see recipies in creative mode.  It would be nice to have this option.  Once you complete a world there isn't much point in doing another one.  You will face the exact same challenges all over again.  There is no real difference in gameplay.  This game could certainly use a lot of mods to make it far more interesting.Mana:  You mana refiels 1 point every 3 minutes or fully when you levelup. This is a terrible design.  The most useful spell, one you start with, opens a portal between your stockpile and some other point.  You can easily drain your mana with this and as you get higher level, it takes much longer to levelup and refil the mana.  There are these large invasions that happen every 45 minutes. I think your mana should refil after these instead of the 1 point per 3 minutes.  There are mana potions, but they take a lot of resources to make and give very little mana.The Ugly:The tech tree is horribly laid out.  It forces you to crank out a bunch of useless stuff in order to progress  and there isn't a logical connection between most items.  For example: You need to learn advanced decorating before you can learn advanced armors.  The tree is full of stuff like this.  Just re-arranging the tech tree could go a long way to improving this game.  You know: If it went with Basic wood working -> Adanced Wood working -> Expert wood working, etc... it would make much more sense.Then there are the skills your dwarves can use.  Some skills go up like crazy, such as cooking.  Others, such as magery, I think I gained 3 points in one dwarf the entire game.  Then some things that do not seem to have skills, like alchemy.  Making potions is slow, and a dwarf after making like 80 of them didn't gain any kind of skills and was just as slow as before.Finally, there isn't much of a challenge in this game.  You just fight the occasionaly wave of undead which ceases to be a problem once you get decent armor and weapons.  It seems that spike barraceds are the best answer for defense.  The towers in the game, arrow and tesla, seem very weak.  Twoard the end, it was a dull experience.			"

												First, Craft the World is mostly fun and great game. It has amazing ability to suck you in and ""play just few more minutes"", that become hours. Its very hard to stop playing, much more then most games I saw so far.That said, you have to be ready for some problems you may face - mainly the dwarves' AI is weak and ineffective, they travel much more then needed, pathfinding is spotty and you will soon learn what shape you *can't* make your terrain like or dwarves will be lost and won't be able to find their way out. Quite often your dwarves' AI borders (or cross) suicidal: Running from one enemy into big group of enemies (and away from home, ignoring teleport to safety on the way), happily mining the only piece of rock they are staying on and falling long way down, instead of walking just one block sideways and be safe, mining things in order that prevent them from mining other blocks later. Also, AI sometimes forget to update it's path when circumstances change, and very very often multiple dwarves are sent to retrieve one item on the ground, even if it is almost instantly picked up. They travel all the way to it's location, try to pick it up and only then update their plan. If this game had different AI model, it would be much better. Still, great job and I can recommend it.

												tl;dr Buy it, you'll have fun. But don't expect to love it forever.Let's cut to it - it's not as interactive as it looks. You set commands (""cut down that tree"", ""mine that shaft"", ""place that item"", ""gather water"", ""plant wheat here"", etc) on blocks. The dwarves then decide which tasks they want to do, and when. Each dwarf can only do one task at a time, and you don't get to control the priority of tasks (though combat orders always seem to be the most important). This means that if you wind up setting up orders for a new tunnel, a logging operation, planting a new crop, and building the house, the dwarves will do it in whatever order they want. You can't decide the order. One of your dozen dwarves (it's hard to get more than 12 dwarves) will get around to it eventually.And for much of the game, that's fine, and you won't complain. But as others have noted, endgame it becomes a chore. Dwarves need to input/output items into the central (immovable) stockpile for practically every task, and they wind up traversing huge distances to do so. This becomes a huge bottleneck, and wastes obscene amounts of time. You'd think that one dwarf could cut a tunnel while others removed the stone behind him; but nope. One dwarf cuts as much stone as he can hold, then makes a full trip back to home to drop it off, then comes back. If you order a dwarf to patch a hole in the wall with dirt, dwarves that are currently HOLDING DIRT will just pass right by the wall, and one specific dwarf will grab dirt from the stockpile, then patch the wall with it.This is especially stupid because you can't move stockpiles, nor can you create stockpiles for a *very long time*. If you're playing tech tree mode, it's literally the second-to-last thing you unlock (~12ish hours of gameplay). If you're playing sandbox, it's all luck which things you unlock, but you still won't have the ability to build a stockpile for many hours - if you get it at all.There's the option to use railroads, but they're expensive (they take a lot of iron to traverse a Large map), and like stockpiles, aren't unlocked until late in the game.The fix for this is to use portals. You drop a portal from your stockpile to wherever you want your dwarves to work, it drastically shortens the trip time, and they prefer tasks near the portal. But that's a terrible solution, in my mind. It shortcuts the whole idea of ""building"" and having good task scheduling, and instead makes it so that you micromanage portals instead of dwarves.Ultimately, it's fun for a good amount of hours. But it doesn't increase in depth or complexity, and becomes a grind to unlock things that you don't even want by the time you get them.			"

												I'm usually very iffy when it comes to crafting games but this one blew me away. Instead of being a single person digging holes and exploring, you start out with one dwarf who carries out simple tasks like chopping down trees, collecting food, mining, etc. You get more dwarves as the game progresses and you level up. You gain experience from every little action you take but the majority of it will come from fighting. Every night, monsters come out and will try to kill off your dwarves. It's usually not very threatening but there's a constant countdown for a huge wave of monsters that gets bigger and more dangerous as time progresses so you have to make sure you're working towards better gear and shelter fast enough to survive. This is where the tower defense mechanic comes into play. You can build traps and other obstacles to either thin out the herd or slow them down while your dwarves attack from safety. You win by exploring the depths of the land and fighting the ""bosses"" for portal keys. Once you've collected the portal keys, you can complete the level at your leisure.Other than the story missions, you can also set up custom games and that's pretty much all I do now. You choose the size of the map, the weather frequency, the difficulty, and the biome. You can choose from either a forest, snow, or desert area and each one plays radically different. The forest is the easiest one with lots of trees and other vegetation. The snow area is a bit more difficult because you have to melt ice to gain water and snowfall can make the terrain a bit harder to traverse if you don't clear it out frequently. Finally, the desert is the hardest of them all with less trees and berries than the other maps and the constant threat of sandstorms grabbing dwarves and scattering around items.In short, it's a very fun crafting game that does some things a little differently while still keeping the basic jist of other crafting games.

												Really great game. Reminiscent of other crafting/resource gathering games such as Dwarf Fortress and Terraria. It took me 27 hours to complete the first world of the campaign - maybe I don't dwarf so good. Having a lot of fun. There are some pathing issues, and minor bugs (such as dwarfs getting stuck at the top of a ladder for a few seconds), but nothing game breaking.			"

												First of all That game is about being the ruler of the dwarf you think for them ...you care for them ! about the Ai.... that folks tend to criticise is not true i mean yeah some time you think they are stupid to go straight to one of the Boss down there alone ....... but then you realise that the Dwarf was just going to get some ressource that fell on the floor because some random mob destroyed the block ...... but if you plan your dungeon carefully ..... i got no big issue with that !The only down side is that the Manegement of the dwarf is not good enough no fast Stats on the side of the screen like in WOW when we were 40 in raid ...... Anyhow that game is time killer like crazy for me and still playing and enjoying that good Game for about 150mb that game is awesome !			"

												At the start of this games build it was crazy to get the dwarves to do what you wanted.Now everything is so much better, still feel some thing can be improved.No official mod support, though people have made some.Hope they keep it going and if they are low on funding make some dlc maybe a game asset editor.

												There are some terrible problems but otherwise, a good game.Unfortunately, those problems can irritate some impatient gamers, like very poor AI, pathfinding issues, and lack of job priority decisions. Routine undead invasion and random goblin rampage are not enough for a good game events. There should be more events to entertain players.But still it's quite enjoyable anyway.			"

												This is a cute little addictive game. It would be nice to pick what skills they get right off - waiting for books to drop to retrain them is annoying. I like how they grumble at you and complain about the choice of food you leave for them. When they decide they'd rather stand around and complain instead of do the tasks assigned... not so fun. But it's a cute time-wasting game over all.			"

Posted: December 7, 2014
												This is an OK game. It is not great, but it might amuse you for a little while.  Its probabbly best bought on sale.The Good:It is a crafting / exploration game.  There are far to few of these.  It has a wide tech-tree with lots of objects and stuff to build.  The world generation is decent too although there isn't enough coal in the small worlds.  I had to buy a lot from a vendor.  If you are really into making an asthetically nice dwarf city, you might get more milage out of the decoration options.The bad: The UI can use some work and it is a little annoying.  You can't see recipies in creative mode.  It would be nice to have this option.  Once you complete a world there isn't much point in doing another one.  You will face the exact same challenges all over again.  There is no real difference in gameplay.  This game could certainly use a lot of mods to make it far more interesting.Mana:  You mana refiels 1 point every 3 minutes or fully when you levelup. This is a terrible design.  The most useful spell, one you start with, opens a portal between your stockpile and some other point.  You can easily drain your mana with this and as you get higher level, it takes much longer to levelup and refil the mana.  There are these large invasions that happen every 45 minutes. I think your mana should refil after these instead of the 1 point per 3 minutes.  There are mana potions, but they take a lot of resources to make and give very little mana.The Ugly:The tech tree is horribly laid out.  It forces you to crank out a bunch of useless stuff in order to progress  and there isn't a logical connection between most items.  For example: You need to learn advanced decorating before you can learn advanced armors.  The tree is full of stuff like this.  Just re-arranging the tech tree could go a long way to improving this game.  You know: If it went with Basic wood working -> Adanced Wood working -> Expert wood working, etc... it would make much more sense.Then there are the skills your dwarves can use.  Some skills go up like crazy, such as cooking.  Others, such as magery, I think I gained 3 points in one dwarf the entire game.  Then some things that do not seem to have skills, like alchemy.  Making potions is slow, and a dwarf after making like 80 of them didn't gain any kind of skills and was just as slow as before.Finally, there isn't much of a challenge in this game.  You just fight the occasionaly wave of undead which ceases to be a problem once you get decent armor and weapons.  It seems that spike barraceds are the best answer for defense.  The towers in the game, arrow and tesla, seem very weak.  Twoard the end, it was a dull experience.			"

												First, Craft the World is mostly fun and great game. It has amazing ability to suck you in and ""play just few more minutes"", that become hours. Its very hard to stop playing, much more then most games I saw so far.That said, you have to be ready for some problems you may face - mainly the dwarves' AI is weak and ineffective, they travel much more then needed, pathfinding is spotty and you will soon learn what shape you *can't* make your terrain like or dwarves will be lost and won't be able to find their way out. Quite often your dwarves' AI borders (or cross) suicidal: Running from one enemy into big group of enemies (and away from home, ignoring teleport to safety on the way), happily mining the only piece of rock they are staying on and falling long way down, instead of walking just one block sideways and be safe, mining things in order that prevent them from mining other blocks later. Also, AI sometimes forget to update it's path when circumstances change, and very very often multiple dwarves are sent to retrieve one item on the ground, even if it is almost instantly picked up. They travel all the way to it's location, try to pick it up and only then update their plan. If this game had different AI model, it would be much better. Still, great job and I can recommend it.

Early Access Review
								This is a VERY light Dwarf Fortress-like with some Minecraft elements. It's the kind of game where you can queue a bunch of orders and then walk away for a while, come back and see most of it's done and nothing particularly bad has happened. It takes a while to work through the tech tree, which can be a little bit annoying. The game does drag things out unnecessarily but it's definitely a nice casual experience. If you want a game that requires less constant attention than a Minecraft or a DF but has those sorts of elements (resource gathering, crafting, building, dwarves, etc.) then this is the one to get. It's quite complete and playable.			"

												Not going to play this game until they improve inventory and crafting interface. Currently it has an irretating unnecesary mechanic that makes you fill in slots with resources to craft an item first time is tideous, and completely useless. They need Terraria-style crafting not the freaking Minecraft-style crafting system. Also the interface could be much more informative.Can't say much about the rest of the game since I was not willing to put up with said bad interface design which completely breaks the flow for me!

												I reccomend this game but only in some circumstances.It's a fine game, its well made, the art is nice, graphics are vibrant and the gameplay and crafting systems are pretty in depth. The crafting system is especially well made and is probably the highlight. I've seen some people say its hard to control the Dwarfs and it is and isn't at the same time. Early game its easy to get your dwarfs moving in one direction. Late game once you get vast chasms of mines and tunnels you'll be tearing your hair out when goblins suddenly spawn next to your house while all your dwarfs but 2 or 3 are away in the tunnels. There are some useful presets you can give to your dwarfs to perform certain jobs, the lite RPG elements are neat and give serious benefits to highly leveld dwarfs for their jobs but it becomes damn near impossible to keep track of everything and keep all your dwarfs on the same page after your population hits 20 or 30. The crafting is neat. You start you gathering resources and clearing tunnels and land. You develop a nice plot to place a house on and keep your dwarfs slept and fed and then you go from there progressively upgrading and improving your tools, armor, weapons and workbenches. The crafting system has a fairly deep system but it still didn't seem deep enough to keep me interested late game. After so long it became more of a stalemate and i couldn't keep up nor could i dig far enough and build enough ladders to get to the best ores. At this point i lost interest since i was more or less in a slogging grind and was making little to no progress. To some that may be part of the fun, and it is for me usually, but the crafting system wasn't deep enough to keep me grinding. Since crafting is one of the main, if not the main, selling points of this game that can be a hit or miss depending on who you are or what you like. I'd recommend it to people who can get this game on the cheap and enjoy cartoony games with lots of charm and a neat little twist on the craft/survive genre. Its got a bit of Minecraft, Terraria and a bit of RTS-RPG like Warcraft 3. It has good charm from your dwarfs and some of the enemies you battle. It has vibrant colors with clean, well made graphics that fit the atmosphere and gameplay perfectly. And finally the sound design and quality are pretty top notch for an indie game or Mobile port (not sure if this is a mobile port but it seems like one). Pros -Vibrant Colors and Graphics. Very clean and pretty.-Nice sounds and music. Helps keep the charm of the game up during play.-Charm. This game has a good amount of charm, atleast to me.-RPG elements. It has several layers and types of RPG elements-Crafting system. Its fairly easy to understand, a bit convoluted but has decent depth.-RTS elements with individual characters having their own equipment slots.-Many different jobs and noticable changes to productivity from job skills leveling up.Cons-Turns into a grind late game.-Crafting system wasn't deep enough to keep me interested late game or long term.-Some enemies seem very annoying, the goblins especially.-The game is good in many different facets but doesn't really excell at any one in specific.-Somewhat convoluted design to mages and some crafting recipes.-A slight learning curve, especially for those new to the genre.-Some of the items and furniture seem useless and arbitrary.Thats about it. Its good little game. I feel it was worth the price. I think i payed $7.50 or $10 for it and i got a nice, enjoyable 10 hours out of it. I'll probably come back a few months down the line to give it another play through because the game does have a lot of charm to me despite its flaws. Its a, for the most part, technically solid game that was better than i'd expected. I think it deserves a buy if you're into Terraria/Starcraft, Minecraft and other games of that ilk. I wouldn't reccomend it on its RPG-RTS elements alone but they blend together well with the survival/craft elements to make a rather enjoyable and worthwhile game, even if its worth wasn't that long for this one guy.

												Super fun game with a bit of everything base building, dwarf managment and battles. the game progresses really well and is easy to learn has a great tech tree which keeps you going each level also  has an end game feature.I thought it might get boring repeating the same game but on new harder worlds, but no, new challangers = new fun.I also played the co-op with a friend and that was super fun, you both build up your own base and then go together to attack the enemies.Highly recommend.

												I love this game. I got addicted really quick. I can make the world however I want. It's awesome. The one and only thing I wish they would change is that you can't move your first stockpile. If I could place it where I wanted it would make the game a lot more fun. I keep restarting the level trying to get a better set up because I'm stuck with the stockpile. Please change that! I want to move my first stockpile!			"

								Are you a fan of Dwarf Fortress? Is that why you are here?  Then turn around and head back the way you came.  I have never before missed DF's ability to streamline jobs like I do now.Do you feel like screwing around in a world where you cannot possibly lose or die? (if your Dwarves die they just respawn in a few minutes).  Would you like to be forced into crafting Wooden Bookshelves and Cabinets with Glass in order to unlock your next tier armor (even though you can tech straight to helmets)?Are you more interested in creating a beautiful mansion than the slaughter of your enemies?Then this game is for you!

												This game has a lot of promise, early game is tons of fun, amazing mechanics.... but... and this is a big but...The late game is absolute, complete garbage. You have to spend hours (like 3-6?) winding your way through level after level of ""research"" crafting pointless decorative♥♥♥♥♥♥(gargoyles?, furniture?) to get to the end game useful items (like top armor, weapons and base defenses). I never even made it through the grind it was so painful. And I've even read that depending on the world you spawn in, you can run our of minable resources crafting this useless trash before you get to the end of the crafting research tree.Nothing is more infuriating than a late game, game-ruining bug!

												In a game where you order dwarfs to complete task this game requires too much mico management.  Crafting esp has me frustrated by the dumb interface, dragging components onto a grid over and over and over and over in not much fun but instead very tedious.  Also as this game was really made for smart phones/tablet and so the controls are awful, no right click, no dragging, no tool tips, just bad.  There might be some hidden shortcuts(pressing i at least brings up the crafting screen) but because there is no keybinding menu you'll have to do a google to find them all.It's a shame too because it this is a really colourful game, and it's alot easy to build large structures than in other games(although the dwarfs still don't auto place scaffolding.)  So this could be a fun game for you if you can get past the interface and the micro crafting, but it's not very fun for me.			"

TL;DR: though this game has promise, and a few nice things about it, because of clunky tech trees, no military conrols, an uncompelling storyline, and no challenge to speak of, I'm recommending playing Terraria and Dwarf Fortress over Craft the World.I've logged 44 hours into this game so far, and am about midway through the second world. I've been playing the campaign mode, and haven't tried the sandbox, which means the below feedback is mostly about the campaign mode. From what I've seen, sandbox mode would probably improve the mechanics.ProsAs some of the other reviewers have pointed out, the game has some strong points. To me, these aren't so amazing that they outweigh the cons, but I'll acknowledge them: The graphics are cute, colorful, and cartoony. Tons of fun. The controls are pretty smooth. Keyboard controls are nice, and interacting with the world is pretty intuitive. Music is well done, if a bit repetative.  Crafting recipes are clever - after seeing a few receipes, you start to be able to predict the next level of the tech tree. I'll get back to this in a minute.ConsBecause it's such a mix of game genres - rogue sandbox strategy dungeon defense fortress builder - it's trying to be all things to all these genres and struggling to get close to any.The rogue element would be more interesting if it were easier to fail - one of the reasons Dwarf Fortress is so amazingly fun is that once you learn the horrible UI, you can and will lose the game. The question is: HOW will you lose. Maybe a dwarf will be having a terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad day, and then his kitten will fall off a cliff and die, and suddenly his Bad Day will turn into a Tantrum Spiral and the next thing you know you have a single completely insane 3-year-old dwarf sitting on the floor of the Great Hall amidst the rotting corpses of her family, and the goblins are coming. Craft the World doesn't have any feeling that you're living on the edge, or that you should care about your dwarves' welfare or wants. A dwarf died? So what!? Another one will appear in 4 minutes. Outfit that one with some gear, he's just about as good. Exploring felt too easy - what's the point of railroads that use all my iron and (buggy) elevators to speed transportation when I can just open a portal to where ever I want to go, and I can light the way with light spells that essentially let me explore the entire world without any help from dwarves at all?The sandbox element would be more fun if it felt easier to access - particularly in the first world where the small map means that resources are scarce, I completely strip-mined my entire world of iron and barely had enough to scrape together the resources to finish the tech tree and get those last few portal peices. I had to spend it on 'fancy chandeliers' to level up my tech tree skills. This (admittedly) would work better if I were playing in sandbox mode.Crafting & Tech TreeThe crafting window is frustrating. The UI is clunky - recipes require arranging ingredients in a specific pattern in the grid - and no easy way of doing that except with the mouse, drag and drop, drag and drop the next thing. I desperately want there to be an 'auto-fill' button, especially after you've made a recipe once - no need to drag and drop ingredients every time. The tech tree itself is frustrating - even if you know or can guess the recipe for a 'later' element in the tech tree, you MUST complete the levels below to have access to the upper-tier recipes. There's no strategy to 'leveling up' the tech tree and you can't choose what you're interested in building towards. As you get higher and higher in the tree, the relationships between the teirs makes less and less sense. For example, you have to complete the 'luxury decorating' level in order to have access to the 'master armor' level.Personally, I'm more interested in the strategy aspect of games, and having to build 15 'decorative mirrors' in order to get the best armor makes zero sense to me. The Tech Tree should have 'tracks' - related things that build up - and cross-track requirements (like creating steel from the resources track is required to make steel armor, but not required to see the steel armor recipe).Also, beer is one of the mid/late-game craftable items. Dwarves without beer for most of the game? That is no fun at all.(No) MilitaryNothing pains me more than watching my expert cook throw himself at a Beholder and die a horrible death. There's no clear way to control some Dwarves over others or assign specific dwarves to a military squad. There are essentially 3 settings for fighting:  fight a chicken or sheep: a dwarf may eventually attack it, but the chicken/sheep is too fast and the dwarf gets tired of running after it and gives up fight a boar: attract one or two dwarves to the battle and can be somewhat successful fight a skeleton, zombie, beholder, or some other hostile creature: ALL your dwarves come running at top speed just for the chance at a stab at itThere are no controls in the game to tell a specific group of dwarves to attack while another group stays home, or for one group to attack one creature while another group attack a different creature. You just have to give the order to attack and hope that at least a few dwarves show up.There could be more of an element of tower defense, except your defenses are going to be attacked and maybe destroyed with every enemy wave. There's very little in the way of maze-building, mostly you're just building traps and spikes to slow down attackers - hopefully you have enough guns built up out of reach that they can fend off a wave. Keeping defenses strong for the next wave means conserving resources that you would otherwise spend on leveling up the tech tree. I'd say that this could be a fun element of gameplay - balancing resources so that you can fend off the waves while still progressing in the game - except it's yet another gameplay element that feels extremely arbitrary. If I build bear traps, why do they disappear rather than needing to be reset? Why do cages trap zombies and not skeletons? Game speedYou can either pause the game, or play the game, and you can't interact with dwarves when the game is paused. There is no 'slow' or 'fast' game speed to help in crisis moments or speed up boring things.BugsWhen I started this game (about a week and a half ago), it was technically still in 'alpha', so I'll grant that there will probably be some bugs. I found a few of them.There's an annoying bug where dwarves with nothing to do will stand around underground next to a portal instead of returning to the house, which means they can get stranded in enclosed caves if you're not careful. My dwarves kept on falling down the elevator shaft. Ironically, the 'send feedback' button on the main screen of the game would open one of the game folders in Windows Explorer.""Story"" and BossesThere's no storyline to speak of, and though there are bosses, there isn't really a reason to fight them except to get to the next level (and once you do that, you have to start over with the tech tree, a single dwarf, and no fortress). The bosses are all the same (beholders and ""scroll keepers"") and there's no strategy to beating them besides equipping all your dwarves as best you can and then crossing your fingers.ConclusionIf you want more interesting game progression, crafting depth, or sandbox elements, play Terraria. If you like micromanaging a rogue dungeon, play Dwarf Fortress - or 'easy mode' DF, Gnomoria. I'm probably going to finish the campaign mode, because I'm a glutton for punishment and a completionist.			"

												After playing the starter campaign for several hours, I'm pretty frustrated.Crafting is painful: if you want to create something you first have to manually create all the components.I'm used to Factorio style crafting, where you choose the recipe you want and it automatically makes the components.Combat is painful: I can't seem to issue orders to individual dwarves!When a battle happens, I want to collect everyone into a group, but instead they sort of charge haphazardly into combat as they trickle in to the area.  So far I've won, but only because I'm playing on 'easy' difficulty.Equipment is painful too.  I can make a fancy smithing apron and put it on a dwarf, but how do I know if that dwarf will assign himself to smithing duties?  If I put a smithing apron on a dwarf and that dwarf starts walking halfway across the map to mine a dirt block, I've wasted my time.Keeping everyone healthy is difficult!  Left to their own devices, they don't seem to rest.  Five minutes before a battle, I have to manually click on everyone and tell them to go take a nap so they'll be ready.Building my fortress is kind of fun, but it would be more fun if the comfort rules worked better.  My fortress is an expanse of wide hallways full of chairs, because chairs give +2 comfort and there doesn't seem to be a cap.There's a huge sprawling tech tree ahead of me, and I can kind of envision how the rest of the game will work -- sending dwarves down to mine resources so I can build tech levels, bringing them back up to fight off skeletons.  I wonder if there's a way to build an unassailable fortress, either deep underground or up in the sky, so the skeletons can't get to it?  But I'm not having enough fun to keep playing.			"

												While the concept of this game is cool, the execution is terrible.  For a fortress management game, Craft the World is severely lacking in tools that enable the player to manage their little dwarf colony.Basically the way dwarves are managed is that you assign tasks by clicking on objects/tiles to harvest or creatures to kill, assigning things to be crafted, and for objects to be placed.  Along with these tasks, there is also the generic task of picking up objects that are dropped when resources are harvested.  The dwarves themselves decided which of the above tasks they will do, and in what order.  From what I've seen, unless one of their skills correlates to one of the jobs (more on that later), they will simply do whatever task is quickest to complete.  The only exception to this is when selecting an enemy to attack.  In this pretty much all dwarves will drop what they are doing to attack the enemy.There is no way for the player to prioritize tasks or to restrict dwarves to only do certain tasks.  This means that trying to multitask is pretty much impossible as dwarves focus on tasks closest to the stockpile because they are the quickest to complete, ignoring tasks further away even if the further ones are more important.  As a result things take forever to complete.  This is made even worse when you take the pathfinding into account, expecially when it comes to gathering resources.  When a dwarf is gathering resources it tries to fill its inventory before dropping things off at the stockpile.  This means that if its inventory space is 3, and it is holding 2 objects while next to the stockpile and there is group resource across the map, the dwarf will walk all the way over to the distant pile, pick up one object, then walk all the way back to the stockpile to drop the objects off when clearly it'd be more efficient to drop off what it has, then go pickup 3 objects from the distant pile.The only real management tools the player has is a portal and the mostly worthless skills mechanic.  The portal spell opens a temporary shortcut between a tile on the map and a the stockpile.  These portals are taken into account when calculating the speed at which a task can be completed, artficially giving distant tasks a higher 'priority' in the dwarves todo list.  However, in order to keep the piority of distant tasks high the player must constantly open up new portals near distant tasks as the tasks closest to the old portal gets completed, as the further a task is from a portal, the lower its priority is.Along with the portals, each can also have up to 3 skills that can influence which types of jobs it takes.  For example, a dwarf with the mining skill will try to mine blocks before it tries to cut down trees, even if the trees are a quicker task to complete.  Unfortunately this mechanic is almost completely worthless as each dwarf only starts with one skill, and what that skill they start with is competely worthless.  This means that you'll most likely start with a bunch of dwarves that are skilled in worthless stuff like swimming and milling, when you really need things like mining, logging, carpentry and smithing at the start of the game.  Furthermore, the only way to get new skills for a dwarf is by applying skill books to a dwarf.  These books are rare drops that you get sometimes after harvesting a resource.  Unfortunately what skills these books teach are also completely random, meaning that you might go an hour before a book drops with a skill that you need.Overall the gameplay is excrutatingly slow and tedious.  As far as I can tell the ""Campaign"" of the game is just a sequence of randomly generating maps where in each one you have to build a portal in order to reach the next map.  The portal pieces are hidden in secret rooms underground that you have to find.  As levels progress the maps slowly get bigger and the difficulty gets higher.  There are no special scenarios or win conditions for any of the maps as far as I can tell, making the Campaign feel extremely boring and repetitive after the first level.In short, do not buy this game.

												I supported this game from day one and enjoyed it UNTIL the multiplayer came. I do not mind the multiplayer but now its ALL about the multiplayer. All patches now is just for multiplayer, all new content is just for multiplayer, all multiplayer stuff is just for multiplayer and you cannot even go to any of those places if your in single player.So if your looking for this game for multiplayer, go ahead, but if your looking for it for single player, then you can forget it because the single players are forgotten, everything is just for the multiplayer and nothing anymore for the single players.Also AI still broken (you want something collected, well dwarf standing next to it will just stand there while dwarf on other side of map will come to collect it, i mean really!!!), there is still lots of other bugs in the game, so instead of them fixing this first they decided to bring in multiplayer and concentrate only on multiplayer.Its funny how us single players brought in the money but now we are forgotten.I do not recommend this game for single player because we get nothing now.Edit (2016-11-23) : I like what they did for Haloween but i wish they can get back to new content for the single player.Edit (2017-03-22) : Again a new DLC just for the Multiplayer and no new content for the single players.

												I really wanted this game to work. It looked fun, but playing it was an exercise in frutration. My dwarves ran into constant pathing issues, getting stuck in tunnels and on ladders. Also, everything kept filling with water all the time and it wasn't at all clear how to deal with that issue. When I broke down and watched a video guide, I learned about all kinds of non-obvious rules and features that the game never mentioned or explained. I restarted, thinking that this time I'd do it right.....and then restarted again....and then finally gave up. This game just doesn't work very well. There are far too many obscure rules, buggy behaviors and frustrating limitations. If you want a game kind of like this that actually works, I'd recommend Gnomorria.			"

												I really like strategy games and exploration games. This new sub-genre is interesting, but overall they make poor games. This is probably the best in the sub-genre, but I wish there were more customization. The tech-tree is linear and often just makes you do things that you normally wouldn't want to do. If you perfer 2D exploration games, there are a lot better out there. If you perfer strategy fortress building, there are better out there. The combination just doesn't work because there is not enough to explore and there is not enough customization in defense or building a home.			"

												I really wanted this game to work. It looked fun, but playing it was an exercise in frutration. My dwarves ran into constant pathing issues, getting stuck in tunnels and on ladders. Also, everything kept filling with water all the time and it wasn't at all clear how to deal with that issue. When I broke down and watched a video guide, I learned about all kinds of non-obvious rules and features that the game never mentioned or explained. I restarted, thinking that this time I'd do it right.....and then restarted again....and then finally gave up. This game just doesn't work very well. There are far too many obscure rules, buggy behaviors and frustrating limitations. If you want a game kind of like this that actually works, I'd recommend Gnomorria.			"

												I don't know who the f**k figured out the shelter system but it's damn ridicilious. Once I figured out how to build up a shelter for the dwarves, it got to a point where I couldn't get my dwarves in since dwarves can't get through doors but the shelter comes incomplete once I open the hatch. So now I have a shelter which I can't use.Also the ♥♥♥♥ing AI is horrible. 50% of the time your dwarves just stand around finding a path which haven't changed. Once you order them to attack the skellies, 1 or 2 might act and the rest just keeps gazing the scenery while their friends get slaughtered. And the game looks♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ So does dwarf fortress but atleast it has a solid gameplay. Uninstall this and I hope there would be a way to get my money back. This game isn't worth a penny.			"

												Game would be more fun if the crafting system wasn't so tedious.  Gameplay is similar to that of a mobile game so you can watch a stream or something while you play.  The main reason I don't like it other something like Minecraft or Terraria is because you have to craft things by putting them into a 3x3 like Minecraft, but you have to go back into your inventory for each singular piece.  It is just so tedious, even if it is only for the first time you craft it.			"

												Hard to give this game a thumbs down, it looks visually nice but he game UI and AI is absolutely terrible. The crafting system is tedious and seriously annoying. There is an auto fill option where you double click a resource already been dragged onto the crafting table however is populates in very unconvenient places. With 53 hours in I feel like i can say it has trasformed alot since Early Access, however with the tech tree being nearly 50% of aesthetic junk, the clunking UI and AI I just cant reccomend. I did enjoy moments they just didnt outweigh the frustratingly annoying ones.			"

												After about 40 hours on record all completed within 2 weeks I have to say that this game is an unfinished shell that seems fun at the start and completely pointless at the end .    Dont buy this game . Its  a huge rip off of other sandbox games and its the worst one.   I bought terraria shortly after and its  1/4 the price 100x better and has a ton of replay value.  You dont control any of your dwarves in combat . you only tell them generaly what to do and where to work . its very frustrating and your minor progression is completly unsatisfying.  they added portals to make travel easier but they really just ruin the whole concept.  After beating the first world i completely lost interest.  Actually i lost interest before i beat the world . i just wanted to get it over with.whats the point of an exploration game that lets you stay inside 100% of the time and just portal to where ever you want on the map without having to explore there to get there.......This is a concept that is being sold as a completed game .  Dont spend 20$ on this incomplete alpha of a game .once youve put about 20 hours into your first save file, do everything there is to do .  you will never play this game again and you will regret what you spent on it.  Dont be fooled by the bubbly animation and pictures on steam .this game should be $2.00.GG Portal opening simulator.			"

												i've played quite a few hours of this game while in early access and as such, it is good. but i honestly thought it was still in early, as the interface is still clunky and the AI is buggy. sometimes the dwarfs just stop and tries to figure out what to do next. even if there are plenty of unfinished task close by. the tech tree seems off, with decorative stuff being mandatory to get usefull things. you will end up with enough decorative items to get 100% on several housings before getting to the end of the tech tree.the graphics are nice and the audio compliments the speed of the game. it is a slow pace most of the time, you just mark out what to mine/build/attack and it will be done.as the game is now, i would not recommend it, it needs to be polished more, but if it gets the crafting UI sorted, the tech tree re-designed and the AI improved, this is one of those games where you just relax after a frustrating day, looking at your minions do your bidding.

												I hate and love this game at the same time.  Hate because it has taken too many hours of productivity from other things I have to do.  Love since this is simply a well planned and executed game.  This is a Terraria style game but, even if you do not like Terraria (which I never did), this game serves as a good example of how a 2D style game could be made into a great game that you look forward to play for hours and hours.  Well done, guys.			"

												This game brings together the best parts of Diggles, Dungeon Keeper and Minecraft. There are a lot of items available to craft and different types of materials that can be used to build shelter. You can build traps and automated turrets, equip your dwarves with different weapons and teach them different skills using books. The goal of the game is to kill 5 guardians and rebuild the portal to the next world. There are 3 different worlds available (normal, ice, desert) with different creatures, weathers, resources and a few specific items available only in this world.After 30 hours of gameplay on a larger size map the game becomes a bit boring. Dwarves move slowly, mana regenerates slowly (so you cannot be using portal spell too often), maximum speed of the game is x2 (I play on max speed 95% of time). There are a few minor bugs, but they don't prevent from enjoying the game - sometimes item cannot be removed from a quick access bar or dwarves behave as if their IQ dropped to one digit number. Quick access bar at the beginning seems quite small but you get used to it (and there is another one available by pressing ctrl). There is no loading a save game - game autosaves, so when you exit you come back to what you built, hence it is not possible to undo mistakes (other than to copy save files to another directory and then bring them back).I don't remember a game released in the past few years which would be so cheap and which I would play so long - this game is definitely worth this £14.00.I am looking forward to see some other means of transport like horses, increased maximum game speed to x5 or x10 and normal game save/load system.

												Love the game alot, its fairly casual and laid back (With its own intense moments) But there are some things that I would see changed.First off, I really love the DLC.  The woman-folk are awesome and sound cute.  Much better then the males sounds which sound somewhat...dorky.As for things I would change? The crafting system is the very first thing that comes into mind.  I understand the crafting table recipe thing but it just sorta feels really clunky.  You could have it so individual recipe's can just be made right away without having to put things together first (I think you can do that once you crafted at least once) but being able to do so right away would be better.  For instance, just have a 'materials needed' screen toggle, so that if a person wants to try to blindly make something by putting things in a recipee window, they still can.Next thing, and I would DEARLY love to see this, is a auto-equip feature.  Having your drawfs automatically equip the best armor that is avaliable instead of having to go through each dwarfs inventory would be great.  There could be further toggle abilities to include weapons, and for what type.  For instance, a toggle that lets your dwarf pick up their best fighting based items if they have skill in that type of weapon, so a Mage will automatically pick up mage stuff.   This could include tools as well.  To further complicate the coding, you could even have them auto-equip crafting tools whenever a particular dwarf goes to make something for you, since the ones chosen to craft seem to be fairly random.I would also love to see the ability to place down wall tiles in a large group, with more than one dwarf going for it if you shift-selected or something.All in all, these things do not break or even really hinder the game.  It only slows stuff down a tiny bit, and for some, micromanagement is a big plus, so its not even a negative for those people!I also look forward to the pets.  Hope there is some kind of tutorial for how to get them.			"

												I bought this game a good bit ago before they added multiplayer or any of the other 'new' things they've released. And even after they added these updates it just made the game better. Heres what a typical player would do: Start, skip the tutorial, get the basic tools for your little buds, and go to town mining, chopping trees, fighting enemies, etc etc. I just don't understand how people can complain about such a fantastic game.. There is nothing wrong with the combat, its entirely straight forward and simple, you click and tell your slaves to attack and they attack, most of the time wrecking the ♥♥♥♥ out of anything that attacks them. I started off and got myself 5 dwarves before the first medusa cyclops eye monster came and they all had basic clubs in their hands when they ran to fight it, know what happened? THEY ♥♥♥♥ED IT UP!!!And on to the mining and chopping, its tedious, not gonna lie about that. Your slaves will run around and act all derpy and take 2 hours to go and place a ♥♥♥♥ing torch or put down a ladder, but thats just because they prioritize certain things like fighting or mining something before they prioritize placing a torch or ladder. There is NOTHING wrong with their system of prioritization, its pretty damn good! Over all i'd give this game a very nice 8/10.Why? because its a fun♥♥♥♥♥game and i like to kill zombies with a bunch of slaves! XD			"

												I bought this game a good bit ago before they added multiplayer or any of the other 'new' things they've released. And even after they added these updates it just made the game better. Heres what a typical player would do: Start, skip the tutorial, get the basic tools for your little buds, and go to town mining, chopping trees, fighting enemies, etc etc. I just don't understand how people can complain about such a fantastic game.. There is nothing wrong with the combat, its entirely straight forward and simple, you click and tell your slaves to attack and they attack, most of the time wrecking the ♥♥♥♥ out of anything that attacks them. I started off and got myself 5 dwarves before the first medusa cyclops eye monster came and they all had basic clubs in their hands when they ran to fight it, know what happened? THEY ♥♥♥♥ED IT UP!!!And on to the mining and chopping, its tedious, not gonna lie about that. Your slaves will run around and act all derpy and take 2 hours to go and place a ♥♥♥♥ing torch or put down a ladder, but thats just because they prioritize certain things like fighting or mining something before they prioritize placing a torch or ladder. There is NOTHING wrong with their system of prioritization, its pretty damn good! Over all i'd give this game a very nice 8/10.Why? because its a fun♥♥♥♥♥game and i like to kill zombies with a bunch of slaves! XD			"

												This game is really fun. I enjoy the various amounts of things to do, while defending from monsters and annoying golbins. The craft system is really enjoyable. Good game overall. Just want there to be more and more updates with new enemies and new equipment. Keep up the good work!			"

												A Great fun game of Terraria / Dungeon Keeper / Lemmings. Spent about 14 hours to beat the first of four ""Level"" and had a lot of fun. Thinking I would roll into the second level with increased difficulty and a modest stash from my first world I was left in shock to find out that absolutely nothing carried over. Not feeling on spending another few days trying to do the exact thing over again I tried the ""New"" multiplayer (6 month old at time of writing) with a friend and, again, we had a lot of fun. It was confusing that somehow I had my units and supply from my singleplayer but my partner had a fully unlocked tech tree, eventually the same problem as single player that when we had to call it a night we lost everything and couldn't return to the game we spent 5+ hours in together. TLDR; 3.5 / 5Buy it on sale +Great fun for a single playthrough, 8-12 hours-Minor Bugs-No replayability or proper multiplayer co-op			"

												I just couldn't get into it.  I thought it would be more steamworld dig, and less click, click, click, drag, drag, drag.  I spent an hour playing this game, and didn't move more than 12 squares in any direction.  It's just too doggone slow for me.  I suppose sandbox means this is like minecraft and it's all about exploring the world, but I could use a LITTLE direction as to what to do.  Creating a shelter isn't particularly obvious, though it pesters me to do so for the time I played.  Intro mentions scaffolding to make larger buildings... Not sure where those are. It does look pretty though.  I'm 34 with kids, I just don't have enough time to spend clicking things tediously.			"

												The game is fun, you tell I've enjoyed my time in the game because I have 400hrs of play time.  400hrs+ is no joke.  The problem I have is that the dev. team is non-existent, and the patches they release only seem to break the game further and further.  The game was literally better in the alpha stage early access than it is now.I highly recommend that anyone considering this game, go to the game's forums, and read some of the threads before purchasing this game.Other games have an active dev. team presence, and if there isn't so much of an ""active"" dev. team presence, they at least respond to some issues.  This game has ZERO dev. team presence.  ZERO.Then, after a month of complaining about the latest patch breaking the game, a forum mod suggest :Originally posted by Annieway:Could those of you, who thinks that dwarfs pathing is awful, send this saves to our email support@dekovir.zendesk.com ? And please, write on your mail what exactly is wrong. which means they don't even pay attention to the forum threads, and complaints.			"

												This is what Terraria should have been. It's side-scrolling survival, but with multiple units that turn it into a real-time strategy game. You click around the world telling your units what you want to get done and they will figure out who is the best for the job and who's available at the moment.I can't quite remember having a more pleasurable gaming experience than the 24 hours I've crammed into this game in the last two weeks. I'm not even close to being done with it either. I've barely conquered the first world/map. There is a lot of content here and lots of playtime to experience it.I recommend everyone plays this game at some point in there life.			"

												I am a fan of succinct and to the point reviews. I will do my best to adhere to my own rules with this review.Pros: - Technology tree is awesome- Graphics are extremely well done (specifically the environment/textures/objects). Though I found the character sprites a bit on the cartoonish side (including the enemies - just a minor personal gripe).- Enough going on to keep you busy for several hours.- I loved the idea of an Altar/Shrine!Cons:- Crafting interface is unforgivable. You must drag and drop each instance of the resource required. WHAT? Whose idea was that?- Not enough to work towards (while my own time with this game was brief - I was able to get a good sense of this aspect by watching several in-depth YouTube reviews)- No risk/reward mechanism. You won't really die if a ginormous Zombie smacks you around and falls on you! I prefer challenge and some sense of realism!- The world needs to be much much bigger. Think Terraria sized worlds.- You can't truly take control over the characters. Sorry, I like full control Yes, I am a control freak when it comes to these kind of games.Overall I feel this game needs a lot of improvement to get it to where it needs to be.In the meantime I will get my fix by playing Terraria!

												Very disapointed in this game. If you are interested in multiplayer at all, don't get it. The multiplayer is tacked on as an after thought. The form in which co-op exists is in an instanced seperate world that you cant pause, save, or return to if you need to take a break. So if you want to play 40 min sessions uninterupted to enchance your singleplayer world, then mabey it's for you. If you want to play a game where you can build and cooperate with your friends, this isn't it.			"

												At first there weren't a lot of instructions or tutorial stuff on what to do. It took me a whole hour to figure out how to feed my dwarves (when I have to use a wiki in the first 2 hours of the game it's probably bad game design). Once I fed my dwarves and bought some beer I felt like I reached more than half of the game's potential.I played along but I never really got a good sense of what to do next. I had 8 dwarves, which sometimes felt like too many people but at the same time also felt like too few, I never really got a satisfying feeling of digging out a whole 6x6 section, because I was always using more and more ladders, or put back some materials in order to reach leftovers.you're essentially taking a block (and a backwall) from one spot and put it in another spot to build your shelter. The progression in the game is tracked by some kind of experience based research, in other words craft 20 chairs to reach the next tier, craft 10 beds, ect. It's never a logical progression since 8 of everything (except the 4 tables) requires a LOT of space. Space that you either have to dig out or build on the surface.I wish I could enjoy this game but I probably won't get a lot of satisfaction out of it, not like terraria or dungeon keeper			"

												Summary: Recommended, but with a BIG caveatI love the game, and won't bother extolling its virtues since they are described so thoroughly in many other reviews -- but beware of crashes!  I reached a point in one level where the game inevitably crashes, and there is absolutely nothing I can do to remedy it.  Every time I restart the game, it automatically reloads its auto-save (which it seems to create every 15 seconds or so), so it's always seconds away from blowing up again.  There's no way to go back to an earlier save point because there aren't any -- you can't manually save the game.  My only option is to restart the whole level, which means abandoning about 14 hours of gameplay.  I'm NOT replaying 14 hours of this or any game, so as much as I like it, this game is now effectively dead to me.The point being, unless the game NEVER crashes, you're going to find yourself in this same boat eventually.  If you can stomach that possibility, go ahead and buy this game, it's definitely a lot of fun.			"

Early Access Review
								I can heartily reccomend this game as a bouncy and detailed building/simulation/exploration game. The pace is not very fast, but there's always something to do. This is the sort of game that you'll find yourself playing for another 5 minutes, until that is built. And that area is explored. And those are killed by your screaming little beardies. And so on, for hours... :)There's a nice variation of climatic factors that does have an impact, but not an unbalancing one on the game. The crafting and spellcasting system is intuitive and simple, as is the scaling up of equipment and weaponry. Fighting and hunting and holding off the nicely balanced waves of monsters makes for an additional dimension, although after a time it's possible to have so many traps and Tesla towers (where did they get those?) that the dwarves can just sit on the roof drinking beer while another wave of monsters dies in the traps and cages and lightning. There's quite a lot of surprises hidden around the maps, which are lush with wonderful backgrounds as well. It's a game with a massive amount of replayability, with a lot of things to poke (and some things, crawling in the depths, that don't like being poked). I look forwards to the full version of the game and the rest of the campaign.  "

								It's a great concept, but the AI is often frustrating and the game itself is still riddled with game breaking bugs. Unless you're really keen to try it for yourself, give it a miss.			"

												I really gave this a shot. I restarted more than twice, just trying to get through the tutorial level. And... nevermind that the requirements for a *basic* shelter are really hard to satisfy, I wasn't having any fun. Everything takes forever, and not in a ""I am living in a simulation"" satisfying way.I had dwarves coming out my rear before I could build a shelter - the basic walls of which are apparently advanced technical knowledge; in this universe, iron forging is less complicated than shoving some logs together - and the shelter stopped working if I tried to add new levels or dig underneath or... well, anything that games like Terraria solved literally years ago. I keep seeing people saying they had fun with this, and I'm genuinely at a loss. The tutorial doesn't work right. You can't build basic shelters until after you've discovered the Bessemer process. Just... why?			"

												Really bad game, but you'd be forgiven for thinking that it might be anything decent. The game does have pretty good presentation and art, but the actual gameplay is probably not what you're expecting.Personally I was thinking that this might be like dwarf fortress, but it has nothing to do with management. It's more like a 2D horde survival game where you don't control the characters directly, and you exploit the surrounding countryside for stuff to craft into tools or weapons or even blocks.Every night a horde of undead will try to assault your holdings. It does sound fun maybe, but there's just too many  restrictions put into place. You can't place traps and since you can't control your dwarfs directly you pretty much end up staring at them mucking about trying to exploit or fight for you.The game is very slow paced which might be neither good or bad depending on what type of player you are, but you're probably going to feel that there's just not a lot of interesting things for you to do in the game. It's simply a boring, boring game. If you're a migrating DF player like me - then I definitely don't recommend this game. If you however are looking for a very slow paced 2D shooteresque game with light management elements in it - then this might be for you. Regardless I don't give this my personal recommendation.			"

								Looking at the trailer, which played at ""light speed"" mode, made a good impression on me that the game looks fun.Here is my little tales after picking up the game, played it for an hour.And the first bad thing I notice is the said game speed itself.I don't mind much the dwarfs working so slooowwwwly. But the pacing of their movements leave a bad taste in my mouth. Imagine buying iron ores from the shop, which was 2 screens away, which I didnt expect the bought items to drop on the floor like that. Now I'd have to wait.... for certain worker to decide that ""OH THERE ARE SOMETHING I COULD PICK UP THERE"", then wait for a few more minutes for them to walk, again, slowly. to the shop. pickup items. ""OH, the bag is full, I should go back""...... Then after arriving at the base, it'd have been night, which I'd have to lock the house for the safe of the party.The night was passed by, slowly, something like  5 or more minutes of unable to do anything.... because it was night time, with peril monsters and ghost wondering around. I really wished I could dig down the house to do something below... but it was not possible due to the prohibition during the night. Ah, well, zzzzzzzzzz............the new dawn has come, with the light of the sun, the darkness was gone. The dwarfs went out on their journey. I hoped for them to go and take the ore I had bought yesterday.... but NO. They like the woods and stones dropped nearby, so they all went in another direction, slowly, to get something I dont really need at the time, without a way for me to say ""HEY YOU RED, GO THERE!""And thus I closed the game... hoping the bad cloud in my mind would dissappear when I went back for the game, one more time, some time.Maybe.Hopefully.At the current state, I'd not recommeneded the game to anyonem looking for some Terraia HD. I shall see again after some more updates from devs.....			"

												Craft The World looks very nice, but unfortunately, it wasn't what I was looking for. It possesses the same problem which caused me to abandon attempts to play Terraria: there is simply too little complexity in game's world, so in the end procedural stories do not quite happen.Quite simply, CtW isn't ""simplified Dwarf Fortress"", but rather ""Terraria with Somewhat Indirect Control"". While you (usually) do not take direct control of any single dwarf (although there is such an option, and it's often helpful), your dwarves show very little signs of thinking for themselves. They have no mental model like those of DF, and they certainly seem far more simple than, say, heroes in old Majesty game. Watching them is plainly boring, because they rarely do things for themselves, but only hurry to complete tasks you set for them, idling or sleeping when there is nothing to do.Also, this is a game about DWARVES where said dwarves do not quite care for BEER and only brew it for a very slight food value at high level of technology. WTF?!I guess CtW isn't a BAD game per se. Maybe it suits someone who likes management games, or something else which I don't like. I would refrain from marking my review as positive or negative if I could. Just don't expect it, like I did, to see an independently living world in it.On a positive side, I must remark that this game is REALLY beautiful, and sound of birdsong is very nice too :)			"

YouTube™ Video: Craft The World 5 Minute Review 

			Views: 646		

			Buy it now on Steam! Or don't...		

Tl;dr; Not a bad game, but somewhat slow en tedious on the crafting level. Darf AI isn't too great either with them getting stuck or just left clueless often. Multiplayer is a true grief-fest, but what did you want? Fun to play if you can live with its flaws.----------------So it's all about crafting a world for you dwarves. They have opened a portal which only had the power to transport 1 brave pioneer into your playfield and depend on your guidance to prosper and thrive. That is, if you can hold off the forces of evil that come out every night and every 45 minutes (the Devil sure is punctual).To do so you need to gather resources by clicking on them. After that your eager dwarves will mine or hack away and carry the stuff back to the stockpile where it can be used to craft new items/base decorations/fortifications/food/...Sadly not all dwarves are born with an Einstein level intellect so you will be wondering why 1 of them (let's call him Toby) is always doing the exact opposite of what you want. Be prepared to bail Toby out a lot with portals, scaffolding and ladders.Building the actual shelter is pretty basic and not too refreshing. The only real notable thing is the aura of the ""Totem"". The more comfort you give the dwarves, the larges their base will become. Which in turn gives you more space for more dwarves.You get new darves by leveling up through crafting, completing tasks and combat. It somehow makes it feel too much like a mobile game by doing this, but then again every other comparable game does it... Leveling is pretty fast in the beginning but slows down incredibly after lvl 10, however the monster waves don't.So you day to day management will be:-  gather resources- craft what you need for new technologies- give dwarves new items- expand baseSounds like a lot of fun? Well it is in the beginning... but after a while you need to craft 100 fancy chairs just to be able to pass on to Steel armour. It makes no sense to me, uses up a lot of resources and especially slows things down dramatically. The first ""easy"" world will take quite a while to complete, even with cheats...And then there's multiplayer... for the love of God or Buddha or whoever you wish to believe in, do it with friends or alone. Chances are random players will screw you over beyond belief sending you right back to your tedious crafting without any reward whatsoever.So all in all I want to really like the game for its ideas and just because I love the genre, but I'm stuck just barely liking it because some things can be too frustrating. If you can get it on a decent sale then don't doubt, otherwise there are better alternatives.			"

												Unfortunately this game is too slow to be interesting. It also has a lot of mobile tendencies that do not translate to the PC. My main gripe is that you need to drag recipe ingredients over the first time to craft. It's needlessly slow and once your ingredients list gets a lot larger it's harder to find them.I say skip it entirely as this is probably not the game you're looking for. It has a lot of good ideas that just fall flat.

And that moment where all my dwarves were stuck using an elevator going up and down without going to their destination ( Ive read there is a patch for elevator, might be fixed ). Also that moment where a monster wave wiped my dwarves clean after 15 hours of play in the map... because of a patch to make the waves harder! Woo.Its an addictive innovative game.

												I've played craft the world for quite a bit, it requires a fare understanding of the AI from the user before one can get good at the combat system. Don't expect to be leveling your dwarves right away if you're new, they WILL die sooner or later. I've been playing sandbox mode and the game has somewhat a procedural method of dropping plans, after three tries, it appears that one major flaw of sandbox mode is that it doesn't drop things in order. So I found myself mining forever before I could actually craft some items that really mattered. Overall though, the difficulty is good enough. Not too hard, not too easy. I like the game, but there is a lot of room for improvement.			"

								idk how it will turn out, but currently its definently not worth the money, its lack of total advancement and massive bugginess definently outwiegh the generally good idea, a good free game, definently not a good 15 dollar one. EDIT: @soviet, its linear gameplay in general makes it not really very indie so once its beaten it actually has very small replay chance, the game has a very slow advancement to begin with so its easy to get bored while playing, the lack of complex combat or mining doesnt help. I dont think you understand how buggy this game actually is, half the time your dwarfs totally fail to do the job set out/get stuck in a wall. on the off chance that it doesnt bug out and you actually harvest the item you will 30% of the time fail to pick it up,  the problem isnt so much that the GAME  is just terrible as the fact that you must pay $15 for a game that is totally unfinished, i dont mind beta testing but this game should not be pay-to-play			"

								I want to like this game.  Hell, I want to love it.  I love building games, I love dwarves, but I hate this game.  The AI for the dwarves is AWFUL (they like to walk in circles or just not move at all) which makes every other thing in the game terrible.  Combat, gathering, building...   that aside the ""tutorial"" is insufficient.  ""Build a shelter.""  Easy enough right?  Yeah, YouTube it and see how many people created videos because it's NOT easy enough.  Once the AI issues are resolved I'll play again and try some more and hopefully change this review.Update: 5/1/16Game is still not fun.  Dwarf AI is awful, pathing is no good.  Then once the monster portals start spawning you're screwed.  Don't waste your time.			"

												""Don't judge a game you've never played""  or ""Don't judge a game by photos""I've seen this game surface on steam and never quite saw any interest given by the pictures.  Why I never went to youtube to see what the game was about is beyond me.  Craft The World is by far the most addictive game I've come across since Plants vs Zombies (1), Field Runners and Prison Architect.  I woke up one morning, played all day and night around the clock till 6am.  That's how addictive this game is.  The whole minecraft, side scroller/builder is awesome.  I never thought something like this would be so much fun.  Albeit it needs more updates with bugs and a few new ideas; this game is amazing.  I can't say much about it.  For $10, it's a damn steal.  You must try this game without asking questions.  Remember, Cash shop is not pay to win, to gather water you need buckets in your inventory and just click on the water and choose gather or fish.  Just a couple of stuff I came across I couldn't figure out and felt stupid how much of a common sense it was.5/5			"

								Short verdict: Too slowHonestly, it's not a terrible game. It's just slow and unwieldy, and not terribly friendly to beginners.It features Minecraft-like crafting, with exploration much like Dwarfs!. However, it's a side-scrolling oriented interface, so the initial dwarf settlement on the surface must try not to delve too greedily or too deep - at least not too soon.			"

								Played the games for some hours and had fun playing it. Despite that I would not recommend this game (at this development stage) as the game has a steep learning curve compared to other games. In a regular game nowadays you will get the time to learn step by step what you need, how to get it, etc. In this game it is all trial and error. As the game is still being developed I hope that the developers will choose to make some changes to make it more ""builder"" friendly.The game revolves around getting building materials and getting increasing access to more advanced buildings. Before the first night falls, you will at least need a basic shelter to not get your dwarves killed right away. The way the game incrementially intoduces you to new buildings and craftable objects is good as you will not get overwhelmed by the possibilities (which are huge). With every object built you unlock the next object.Besides the building the game lets you also encounter enemies. As these enemies already come at the first night, there is no opportunity to relax and take your time to build a fort or solid defense. As you play the game more often you will find it easier to know how to quickly get the resources you need. One of the resources I have been lacking quite often is wood.All things considered I'm in the middle of rating it positive or negative. At the current stage it is slightly negative but I'm confident that the developers will sway my vote to positive with some slight changes to game mechanics.			"

												This game is a piece of trash, nothing works. Pathfinding is a joke and your dwarfs are more likely to commit a terrible sucide than anyhing else. You start out the game with nothing and you dont even have the recipes to build a house. But guess what you need a house in order to heal your people and keep them safe. By the time i was level 9 i still did not have the recipes to construct a house(had doors,locks, dec but no walls). Its like playing a RNG or a lottery trying to find the recipes you need. I had recipes for things that required other recipes that i did not have or the workbench to make either of them. In the end all my dwarfs were just about killed because i couldnt buy materials for a house or find the recipes to make one because they were so beaten from monsters to the point that, all they do is run away constantly, ingoring all your commands.Fk this game, save your money for a 2 year old coder trying to print a line statement for your entertainment.

												Have you ever wanted to be suckered into buying a mobile device game on your PC?  Are you tired of the subtle humor and gameplay for all ages in things like Terraria and looking for something that will give you tedium and a complete lack of control?  Craft The World is the game for you!Gone are the days where you have to do all that pesky mining yourself in a matter of seconds!  Gone are the days where your construction is in an open world and the universe is your oyster!  Imagine, for a moment, some of the greatest games in strategy platformer gaming history.  The Lemmings. The Humans.  Now imagine all of the aspects of those games that made you want to pull your hair out, and here we are!I picked this up because Steam recommended it because Terraria.   This has paid off before..Starbound, Edge of Space, etc.  This game plays nothing like those.  Instead, you have command of a dwarf or two and give them commands to build stuff and harvest resources.  What shows that this was originally a mobile game?  You wait.  And wait.  Then there's more waiting.   In 10 minutes I had done 5 things.  3 of those were in another window.  I'm not sure why this was so highly recommended, as my opinion of this game is that it is microtransaction tripe ported to PC with all of the appeal of recycled laxatives.			"

												SEX!Huzah!  Now I have your attention.As far as God-simulators go, this game is pretty awesome.  The game has a surprising amount of depth and a creative sandbox mode once you complete the 3 level campaign which adds to the fun.  The campaign consists of 3 levels: first is a small forest setting, the second is a medium sized snow setting, and the last is a large desert, each getting more difficult to pass.  Don't be fooled by the few levels though, each one has taken me upwards of 10 hours each to finish.Over the course of a game, you have to start with nothing much like other creation games such as Minecraft, and build your way up from nothing by gathering everything from dirty to iron, gold, and eventually Mithril.  Using these gathered resources, you traverse a large tech tree, each category allowing you to build more items ranging from decoration for your home to weapons and armor.The game will pique your interest quick and hold your attention for a long time.  With that said, once you beat the campaign and do a sandbox mode or two, you start to notice and exploit things like how to efficiently mine, find gold or skill books, and how to cheese the invading zombies (I will not reveal that here.)  Once this happens, you (or at least I did) will get bored quickly.  The novelty for me wore off literally halfway through a game one day, and I just quit.The Good:1-Great crafting system2-Challenging combat (not at first, but the longer you stay in game, the more enemies come out to ransack you)3-very fun spellunking system4-hours upon hours of fun per level5-quests give you both direction and rewardThe Bad:1-Once you've discovered combat and mining exploits, the game loses most of its fun and challenge2-Even the largest maps are pretty small, taking maybe only 25% more time to finish than the smallest3-Enemy waves happen only once every 50 minutes (25 minutes if you have the game speed set to 2x)4-weapon and armor improvements are WAY down the tech tree, so you have inferior gear against large waves if you dont move fastAll in all, the game is a great way to burn a lot of hours, especially for how cheap it is.  being under $20 means that as long as you enjoy it for at least 10 hours, it was well worth it, and I promise you will get a lot more than that out of it.

								Really like the game, 220 hours. Nice diversion and building potential. Hope they fix some dwarf issues, such as distance from base, for long paths dwarves will take their building material go part of the way and then turn around back to base. Would also be nice to have the option to turn off hourly monster invasions. Good to spend some time, but not a keeper. Had to stop playing due to these issues.  "

								For the $10 I spent, it was a great buy, however that doesn't explain how sad it was when I crossed the portal to the second world, only to find I was starting over and no new tech tree or anything. I played for a few minutes, saw there were new creatures, end exited out. Unfortunately, new creatures and a larger frozen world, isn't enough to keep my interest. A new tech tree, a continuation of the first part of the game, etc., yes. I didn't even use my books in the first world on the play-through that I ended up completing on, because I thought they might be more useful while building out my second world.			"

												This game is heavy on the negative aspects of the game. Half the dwarves don't do what they are suppose too and it is one buggy mess. I love this style of game, but only when it has rewards for completing steps and not so much negative impact on your game.  The AI is a bit stupid and pathing is wonky. Maybe be worth 5 dollars at best.  I no longer play or care about this game or their developers.			"

								This game needs quite a few more updates before I think it is a playable game. The controls are poorly designed compaired to many other games of this genre, AI has significant issues following orders, very buggy and the general dificulty curve is very lopsided. Will this be a good game? Possibly. Is it a good game now? No. Is it worth the $14.99 pricetag at the current time? Absolutly not. Once this is out of alpha, we will see. until then, I unfortunatly have to say I would not pay a dime or this game. I wish I did not pay a single dime for this game, at least just yet. Maybe if I waited I would be satisfyed with it, but right now, it is more tedious and fustrating then fun and intuitive.			"

								I don't like how much resources it takes to build even a simple shelter, and after a few days of having no shelter, your dwarves are at such low health that you can't do anything thanks to them constantly running away from enemies that don't leave your shelter (And thus, your stockpile, and any beds you may have tried to place but refuse to work, thanks to the aforementioned lack of resources to build a shelter.)This game would be so much better with a pre-made shelter, so that your dwarves have somewhere to get back to every night where they don't have to run from enemies.

												I'd like to recommend this game but the AI is truly broken.  The dwaves will run around in a panic and not rest or eat.  They run into monsters and do nothing.  They stand around doing nothing when there is all kinds of goods to pick up.   Dwarves will walk into enemy camps and do nothing while the enemy beats the stuffing out of them.  I'll open a portal for them to get to safety and they just stand there instead of using the portal and going to safety.  Dwarves will seal themselves into a chamber without figuring the right order to put the blocks down to ensure they can get out.  Dwarves will fall into water and drown unless you can take manual control and get them out.    Loot will just inexplicably disappear from the map.  CRTL R - Supposed to make all dwarves rest that are under 70% health.  They are at their beds standing next to it and momentarily make a snoring sound.  But they are tired and won't lie down.  Same problem if you slect them individually and tell them to go rest so they can heal.  They'll just stand there.CRTL E - all hungry dwarves are supposed to eat.  They don'tYou can select them individually and try and get them to do one of those things when they are getting the crap kicked out of them, or if they are standing around doing nothing.  Not going to work though.Other problems not bugs but just present game features - If you click on attack every dwarf no matter where they are will ALL run to the one enemy.  There's really no way to assign individual dwarves to tasks.  They just do them based on what the AI decides.There's no way to sell or stuff you mine to the merchant for goods, except for gold coins that you randomly find.You'll find yourself constantly running out of resources, so a trade system (even an unbalanced one) would be helpfulKeyboard interaction is limited.  You will find yourself clicking, and double clicking to select a resources.  You want to select a certain dwarf - you must click on the dwarf.On a postive note:Pretty graphics.Developer seems like a nice guy.  He notes the bugs I report but no response on an update or a known issue. So, the game is pretty much unplayable in it's present state unless you just want to manually control each dwarf that has become unresponsive and walk them into a monster and let them die.  Then you'll get another one after a while.  But you will start from scratch and lose the skills the dwarf has aquired.  If you don't do thist, your unresponsive dwarf will either run around amlessly until is gets killed and you will lose the equipment you made for it (about 80% change of that), or it will just stand there and do absolutely nothing (which costs you one dwarf slot).  Hopefully the developer will fix these problems and get the game where it needs to be AI wise. "

Early Access Review
								Look, the premise of this game is great. Wonderful idea, charming music and graphics... but this has to be one of the most frustrating gaming experiences i have ever encountered. DO NOT BUY!! Sure, it is early access... but the game claims to be in phase 0.9. That frightens me.The A.I is ATROCIOUS!! 75% of the time... the dwarfs does absolutely everything else then what you want them to do, and there is no way to manually tell them what to do. There is a ""control"" dwarf command (probably implemented because the developers knew about the broken A.I), but this is just as broken as everything else... all you can do is control the dwarf to the object you want to interact with, and then release control of him and HOPEFULLY he will do what you wanted. Most of the time he will not.The gaming mechanics is ill explained. Want to build a shelter? Sure no problem, you unlock the wooden wall craft pretty early. But how do you build walls? Well, first you build it once... and it becomes a wooden backdrop. Fine.. then you have to figure out that, in order to build a wall you need to build it again on top of the backdrop. But we are not finished yet, no... because that only makes a solid wooden block. The third step is to select the wooden wall craft a third time, and click upon the finished wooden block... which transform it into a proper wall. And NONE OF THIS IS EXPLAINED IN THE GAME!!! Your only hint is ""build a shelter!"".What´s even more agonizing is that me, (and looking at the forums many others) was plagued with the (one of many) bugs... that makes it so, the GAME DOESN´T RECOGNIZE YOUR SHELTER EVEN THOUGH IT´S CORRECTLY BUILT, UNTIL YOU EXIT THE GAME AND RESTARTS IT!! So, you have to build a shelter, with horrible A.I, obstrusive unexplained building mechanics, and when you have finally guessed your way to a solution, the game doesn´t recognise it (even though, it says you completed the ""built"" a shelter mission, the shelter is non existent).What is worse is, that a proper shelter is needed in order for you dwarfs to rest. The resting mechanic is just as ill explained as everything else. So for me, the first two hours of gaming my dwarfs didn´t rest... they had zero HP and ran at the smallest enemy, making game progress horrible slow. I didn´t know why my shelter didn´t work, and oh... such a horrible experience.And there is more. The game crashed several times. Bridges flat out doesn´t work. The dwarfs randomly falls through them and starts to drown. At my final gameplay moment, my entire bridge just dissapeared. I could still ""de construct it"", but it wasn´t there.Uh... such great promise, but such an awful, awful programmed game. DO NOT BUY!!!!!And if this game is in such a state at 0.9? Heck, this feels like a unfinished ALPHA 0.2... i can´t possibly imagine they could fix so many issues for the final build.Stay away!!			"

								Whilst the game looks and sounds like a great concept, I can't in all honesty recommend it because there's a really annoying issue whereby the entire game 'pauses' for a second, every 5-10 seconds. It's so off-putting, I've not been able to play it for more than a few minutes.			"

												No female dwarves? I thought this was 2015, not 1985.Maybe this is a good game (although I found the crafting system to be unecessarily tedious, with having to manually select each individual material each time), but I'll never know because I refuse to play in a world where women are--again--erased from existence. If a patch adds female dwarf models (and not just one or two; 50% of the models should be female) I'll revisit my review, until then I'm sticking with Terraria and Gnomoria. Seriously, the devs should be ashamed of themselves for releasing a game like this with only male characters in this day and age.			"

								When you see the title of the game, ""Craft the World"" - most people will just think that this game is another attempt to perfect the well known game ""Minecraft"" - but it isn't. Craft the world is not for everyone though, if you are not a fan of sandbox survival games - you might as well stop reading this review. This game offers so many opportunities when it comes to decision, from - ""Would my house stop those pesky ghosts?"", ""What weapon should I give my Dwarfs?"" to ""If I don't destroy the goblin encampment now - what's the worst that'll happen?"". Trust me - this game is very enjoyable and i highly recommend it to those survival fans out there. Definitely worth the money! =D			"

								This is a good and engaging game. It has a good overall theme and artwork. The game play is fairly straight-forward as well. Dig, Defend, and build. Rinse and Repeat and the defending gets more difficult the longer the campaign goes on. It's a great in sandbox mode for just building/crafting fun. Campaign mode can be fun and a bit challenging. It's still early access so it's hard to be to critical for a game that hasn't declared itself mostly done.This game suffers a bit of strangeness when it comes to the UI and ease of use when playing on a computer. Though they do make sense if this game ever went to a tablet like an iPad or possibly a console? A few things I do not care for but are not real deal breakers for me* The strength of monsters seems difficult to gauge. Knowing if you can kill a monster is not an easy question to answer. Just hope they don't kill your dwarves* Monster noises particularly the goblins get a bit excessive and repetitive i makes me cringe.* The game also fails to really explain the use of spells and mana usage. * I find it strange when it comes to AI with regards to priorities of tasks. I click on things and getting them to do it seems hard or impossible sometimes* There is a bit of unnecesary crafting of things i never wanted to use but crafted in order to advanced my crafting skills to make the things I really wanted to. For example crafting 20 gargoyle statues that have no effect other than vanity seems silly so i can make something else worthwhile "

This game has by far the best developer of any EA game I have had the pleasure to play. They are attentive and actually listen to the community. The bugs are few, and the only problem I have is the craft tree progression seems a bit off. But other than that, its a fun and challenging game. You really wont realize how much time has passed.

								This game is so much fun, order your minions to dig, fight, construct, etc. If you were / are a fan of Dungeon Keeper you definitely should get this game. Nice graphics and very good gameplay! This game is nothing like Terraria or Star Bound... Only the crafting component / sandboxing is related to it.Some findings:1. Once you have made a receipe you should allow for quick build... No need to constantly drag and drop each single ingredient in there. That is a waste of time and gets annoying really quick.2. The game could use speed settings.3. How do I raise sheep? I need ropes for basic armor crafting but there hardly are any sheep around.			"

								Having played ""Craft the World"" for a mindboggling amount of time for a pre-release game, I feel like I have to add my two cents. Digging, exploring, building, defending and managing are all your responsibility in this (as has been pointed out) Terraria-like indie game. Don't let familiarity with similiar titles sour you to this one. It has its own unique flavor, delightful animations and, most importantly, is utterly addicitive. Patches comes fast and furious so I feel confident this is one title that won't be left to languish.

I really want to like this gameThis type of game is something I enjoy. And this game looks like it will become a great game if the developers keep developing it. However, as it stands right now, it has very limited depth. The tech tree seems out of sorts. It's difficult to survive in the beginning due to being unable to build adequate shelter before the first invasion.Invasions get harder as the game progresses. That's great. Except they only get harder in so far as there are more mobs in each invasion. At some point, you will be unable to complete an invasion before daylight. I have all of my guys with maxed out weapons and high levels of experience with them. I have multiple defenseive structures. I still can't complete an invasion. There are other points of contention: Dwarf AI is lackluster at best. Minerals become very rare. Towards the end of the game, it's nigh impossible to gather enough materials to equip you dwarves, much less build grand castles under the mountains. There is no way to automate anything. This includes things like making sure tables are stocked with food. Transit AI is terrible, and in some situations is so broken that you have to manually remove them and replace them in order to get them to work properly.Perhaps in the future, this game will become a fun game to play. Until then, play the first hour or so, and then go find something better than the tedium that is Craft the World.			"

								Even though this is still early access, it's an awesome game. The graphics are amazing, and controlling your Dwarf army is hilariously fun. But the game does have it's flaws. My biggest issue is with the Dwarves AI, at one point I sat there and watched as my Dwarf tried to kill a Sheep for 10 MINUTES, and he had a Steel Club, so it should have been easy. Another example is that the Dwarves can have 3 specialties each, which sounds cool, but it's practically useless. If I have a Dwarf who had 20 points in Fishing, he should be the one who goes to fish, but instead it automatically sends a Dwarf with ZERO points in fishing to go fish. Another irritating thing is that when you're telling them to mine a bunch of stuff at a time, they will keep stopping to bring the stuff back to base, I would prefer an OPTION for whether or not they bring the stuff back right away, or just keep mining away, that or have the ones that are already mining, keep mining while the other ones gather the stuff. This gave has the potential to be at least a 9/10, and right now I would give it a 7/10.			"

								I have been playing this game for awhile now, and anyone that thinks it is a Minecraft or Terraria clone is wrong on many levels.  Yes you build dwellings and fight off evil nasties, but in this game you are deeling with Drawfs.  The problem being is that at the begining they are really stupid.  Also you have to learn items in your crafting tree one at a time to complete other items.  What I mean is that I had to create several items before I could make a door for my dwelling.  So yes there are plenty of differences.  But even thou it can be fustrating, I am rating this game 8 out of 10.  It is only in Beta form right now and you can really play and enjoy it.  So if your looking for a game you can build, dig and fight, this is your game!			"

								Having never played Terraria or Starbound, I feel this game is pretty fun and really represents what an Early Access game should be in my mind. It has a few bugs and quirks but nothing completely gamebreaking. The graphics are polished and the gameplay is entertaining with a surprising amount of depth in the tech tree.This feels like what I expected (and still haven't seen) from Towns. The devs seem responsive and active too, so I have high hopes this already fun game will become far more fun as they near closer to an initial retail release.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this during one of the flash sales. The moment I eyeballed it, I knew it was a game I wanted to play. I like the concepts (and played) of Minecraft, Terraria, and Dwarf Fortress have, and generally like the game that take these concepts and put it into a gamel ike this. The ability to control a team of dwarves, construct a fortress, and survive in a world is a great thing. Minecraft and Terraria, while fun in their own merits, get stale after a time. Letting your creativity flow to create cool things in those games are pretty sweet, but I need more to it than being able to create things of fancy. That's why I like Dwarf Fortress. You create a fortress for dwarves, make them happy, and create a fort that suits them (though most who play DF consider efficiency high on the list more than aesthetics). And in thae game, you have to deal with all sorts of dangers risking your entire fort. That's what I like. I like the idea of creating this ""fortress"" with all sorts of perils come at you and try to wreck your day. This game is tamer in that resepct, than Dwarf Fortress, but it shows a lot of promise. It has some issues at the moment of this writing, but it was expected for being early access. There are some noticeable bugs, and feels like there's more left to add (obviously). However, I think it's on the right track to its potential. For those who don't buy into ""early access"", I'd say keep an eye on it.			"

								I bought this game about two days after it was released for EA. I purchased it and another game with god-esque simulation. (Godus). The difference in the two developers is astounding. This game has by far the best developer of any EA game I have had the pleasure to play. They are attentive and actually listen to the community. The bugs are few, and the only problem I have is the craft tree progression seems a bit off. But other than that, its a fun and challenging game. You really wont realize how much time has passed. I definately recommand any fan of Dwarf Fortress, Prision Architect, Terraria, or Starbound buy this!			"

Early Access Review
								Incredible game, it is much more Dwarf Fortress and less Terraria/Dungeon Keeper. Overall the game is one of the best ""early access"" games I have ever played on Steam. I highly recommend this game, below is my break down of why I like this game.Graphics: Very well done. When you equip gear on your dwarfs, this is reflected in their in game appearance. Everything fits well and just looks awesome. There are tons of little touches like portraits and ornate beds that look stunning. I love Terraria but this game blows Terraria out of the water in this department.Sound: The music is nice, but the game shines in the ambient sound department: war cries, snoring, mumbling, etc...  Gameplay: There is a lot to this game. I mean lots and LOTS of items to craft and things to do. In 10 hours of gameplay I have completed maybe 2/3rds of the crafting quests. The game has a bit of a tough start, but once you get the hang of defense it is fairly simple to set up your fort. The difficulty increasing smoothly and I never felt that it got ""too easy"" at any point.UI: Pretty simple once you get the hang of it. You have an inventory and a hot key bar. Crafting is done in box type thng like Minecraft/TerreriaFun: Very addicting, there is always more stuff to build, places to explore, hordes to fight off.Bugs: There really aren't many. Occasionally my dwarfs forget what bed they own, but exiting the game seems to fix it. The bad stuff: My only real negative is that I know nothing about the developer, I think they are Russian and they have made an Android app game... but beyond that I really would like to know what their plans are. This game came out of no where, but it is really so well done and refined.That being said this game is a blast. Even in its current state there is a lot of fun to be had. This game has all the potential a blockbuster like Terraria			"

It's relaxing to just see your dwarves dig, until they start ignoring your orders and just run off or don't want to gather the resource you ordered them to. Other then that little issue it's a nice game and definitly recommended if you like survival/building/strategy (kinda?) mixed together.			"

								Firstly i fully disagree with people comparing this game to Terraria, Starbound or even Minecraft. This game is nothing like any of those games. This game is more of a strategy based game you know you are going to be attack so do the best to set up defences while you mine and gather resources. The graphics for this game are amazing for the type of game it is. I specially like the fact that when i change the Dwarfs armour it reflects in the game that they now have different armour.Crafting in this game is amazing the fact this game is still in early access and has this much crafting is really amazing. I can’t wait to see what the developer adds to this game in the next updates (hopefully new larger maps)As for game play i have been playing this game a lot in fact 30 + hours and i still am loving this game completely so much still to do. There are a few things i would like to see fixed like when you click on a mob to kill and accidently remove your dam wall bit of a pain but other than that this game caters for all aspects of gamers from beginner to someone after a challenge If you’re undecided about this game i encourage you to give it a try, hell it’s the price of 3 maybe 4 coffees in most countries Lastly i must admit i purchased this game as a joke game to play when i was really bored, however after playing this game it is currently the game i play the most was completely surprised when i purchased it and that night and 6 hours later looked at the clock and wow 3am had passed.

								""Mix of Dungeon Keeper, Minecraft and Dwarf fortress"" - Ambitious tag line from the early access steam pageas with all such claims, one must remember that EA killed Bullfrog and so we will never get something close to Dungeon Keeper, only pretenders and charlatansthat said, Craft the world is actually pretty good and is a good way to kill a brainless hour or two, once past the initial undead attacks and you establish a good base with dwarfs armed with clubs after that the game doesn't really pose a challenge it's more of a creative endeavor, where your goal is to create a really cool base while progressing through the tech tree and finding the portal underground so that you can progress to the next world.

								If the price vs it being an early release deters you from what looks otherwise like a fabulous game, don't let it.  This gem of a game has drained near a hundred hours of my time and is still growing. The game is so extremely simple to learn and play, but like any ""building"" style game just keeps you going and going. And the best part is, the development team is so responsive being early-access that bugs are getting fixed, features are being added, and feedback is being listened to (in a good way, not in a let's change everything because one guy said so way). New updates seem to come out every week or two just getting the game one step closer to being finished. Other's have compared this game to older games they've loved, but I just can't even compare - this is a unique game, or at the very least the first of it's style to get it right.			"

								I enjoy this game quite a bit.  I find that having the missions and tech tree make it much easier to get into than Terraria.There are a few issues with the current build:1) The difficulty settings don't seem to have any effect.  I tried replaying with higher difficulty and did not notice any change.2) The portal mechanic is pretty abusable in its current form.  Using it there is not really any need to build a transport system.Despite these issues I still recommend the game.  I've played about 50 hours so far, and feel like I have seen and done everything the current build has to offer.  I'll definitely play again when they put out a substantial update.			"

								This game is great! And only in beta. I hope that when it is finished. Dwarfs are a bit smarter, they tend to ignore the tasks I give them when I have to many. Archers not shooting blocks while hunting. And more ""real"" quests not just craft the next thing on the skill tree.But still this game is great, everything I hoped for!			"

								Craft the world is a really fun and relaxing game. think dungeon keeper mixed with terraria with a wave based monster attack. the whole idea of the game is to explore this map, gather resources. build a shelter tech up, equip your dwarfs with better armor and weapons and finally make a portal to complete that map. so far its early access and its a ton of fun.

Early Access Review
								I really like this game! I read the negative reviews first and found one person who was complaining there was not enough fighting. Please do not turn this into another defense game, there are plenty of those in the world. As the name is Craft The World enemy interaction ought to be secondary to crafting. So I bought it and found that crafting/resource collection is the primary focus. I am excited that this is on Mac as well surprising for an early release there are not that many. I started in Sandbox mode and liked that I didn't have to play through craft tree to get that version. I did struggle for a few hours on the Totem and house building, not sure if that was to add to difficulty or if there will be more guidance later on. As far as an early release goes this is quite built out. You will be learning through trial and error to figure the game out but I enjoyed the challenge. One thing I struggled with was the shop. The items pop out and they are small so I didn't see them and thought that part may not be complete yet but they do spawn in front and have to be collected like other resources. I know the shadow is intentional but the light spell dosen't go far enough would be nice to get 5 or so blocks to plan out your dig. However, you can still re-add any of the collected resources back if you want. I am surprised at the graphics, though simple they are much better than many of the crafting games. I think its just right not to much not to little. There are difficulty levels so you can select the level of challenge. I really like that you can craft something without having the pattern yet so the really critical crafts you can remember the sequence to help you at the beginning. I can't wait to see what is still to come!			"

												This is initially a very addictive game but admittedly by the time you progress to additional worlds, you start to feel a little burnt out and having to start from scratch with resources becoming more limited isn't excatly the most motivating game design. It's still fun to pick up and play on occasion but levels take a very long time to beat. You can easily waste an entire day beating just the first world.			"

												I haven't played much but I still can have an early opinion (I will update this later on).So, yes, it's quite the game. It's entertaining and it has the Oxygen Not Included mechanics but less.. hard?You can build, mine, survive, blah blah blah, you know (Read the description of the game instead).I would personally love to play over the 2 hours point but I fear that it wouldn't be focused on much (Maybe no frequent updates?)One thing that is currently bugging me is the damn background, it keeps flashing, if I was epliptic... boy... I would be dead by now..FIX THE BACKGROUND FLASHING, that's pretty much it, I do have a small question for everyone who has a good grasp of this game:Is this game worth to keep forever or should I refund (Does it have lots of things to do or does it get boring quickly?)Answers would be awesome!

												I have enjoyed the game so far. Theres plenty of crafting and the worlds are large enough to explore and gather resources and the tech tree to unlock more options is plenty long enough for me so far. As I read in other reviews it does seem to have that touch screen kinda feel. But I find it playable with a mouse and keyboard after looking up hotkeys on the internet. I found it in a playable state.The night time attacks are not really that big of a deal as Ive never faced to many problems dealing with them, The dark portal event that happens every 45 minutes on the other hand can be a pain. They seem to increase in difficulty with time and if you dont contiuously inplrove your tech and number of dwarves you will find it incresingly difficult. Also losing a large number of dwarves deep in the ground and leaving gear on the gorund in a dangerous location keeps other dwarves wanting to return and collect the items which can be a real pain. Even blocking path ways down there or using danger signs dwarves still want to stand around with the no path indicators showing they want to collect gear. But doing so would only lead to thier own deaths as well. But overall I recommend the game if its on sale, as of now Ive enjoyed the game with its flaws.  "

												This is a great game that I have put lots of time into and that was quite a few updates ago. After seeing all the updates that they had made to it has caused me to sink so many more hours into it. They added new features to it as well as making sure they don't neglect the features that have already been established. Going back and polishing off the previous features have really improved things that were upsetting or just down right annoying. I look forward to what improvements that they make to it in the future!			"

												Welcome to Craft the World: a game that has dozens and dozens of reasons to play it, and one painfully glaring reason to never buy it anyway.  It looks good, it runs smooth, it doesn't crash, and it's a charming combination of Motherload and Dwarf Fortress.  If you haven't played those games, think of it as a Minecraft RTS.  If you don't know what that is... I can't help you.  The monsters are cool, the object interactions are neat, the tech-tree is a bit obnoxious but at least it takes you in the right direction without overwhelming you all at once.  That said, I could not recommend this game under any circumstances because the AI is flat broken.  Your dwarves are beyond mentally handicapped.  Orders given are sometimes ignored, or handed off to the dwarf who is farthest from whatever it is that you're trying to do.  Occasionally your dwarves will just wander off or stand stock still and almost nothing you can do will make them budge.   They'll walk off cliffs given the slightest opportunity, if there's a group of enemies they can wander into 1v7 then they'll find it, and they'll only rarely do the jobs suited to the skills they've got.    Trying to get these little hairballs on legs to mount anything resembling an organized defense is utterly hopeless.  Often they'll ignore the first five enemies, run into the middle of them so they can attack that one zombie at the back, and then pretty much die instantly.   The only way to work around the horrible, horrible AI is to exploit the equally horrible AI of the monsters and use terrain to contain them until day break.  Or play on one of the easier modes.  Both options suck, don't do it, don't buy it, turn and run in the other direction.			"

												This won't be a long review but I need to say that this game is AWESOME.I've played Terraria and a couple games in the samge genre BUT none is like Craft The World.Ok, yes it's kinda the ""same"" since it's all made of cubes, but CtW is the only one that makes you give orders to many characters and play them as well as equiping them. If you like to Craft a World, then try this one! Pretty fun and lots of things to do! From cutting down your first tree and digging your first mine to Bad guys invasions! There is also a Tech tree which helps a lot when you want to know when you will be able to craft something! I also love the way you can control the dwarves, it also makes a lot easier to ""craft"" a house or just craft the world itself! Instead of giving orders to all your dwarves, you can manually do all that on a single one, pretty fun you have to try!If you're the kind of person that likes that kind of games, give it a try! It's worth it :D			"

												Designed for mobile sold for PC. The game has the feel of being made solely for mobile, this is evident in the clunky controls. If you want to place 200 blocks to build a house you will have to click 200 times, there is no key that allows drag-to-build. The only way to findout the shortcut keys is to google it. While this may sound like a list of reasons to not buy the game I think it's an ok buy. With the implimentaion of multiplayer mode I think the devs are working on the game and I have high hopes for the games future playability. Pros: Fantastic animations, great game if you're bored and want to play for about an hour at a time.Cons: Horrible AI, clunky controls, annoying monster portal, mana for portal spell needs to be adjusted.

								This is a good and engaging game. It has a good overall theme and artwork. The game play is fairly straight-forward as well. Dig, Defend, and build. Rinse and Repeat and the defending gets more difficult the longer the campaign goes on. It's a great in sandbox mode for just building/crafting fun. Campaign mode can be fun and a bit challenging. It's still early access so it's hard to be to critical for a game that hasn't declared itself mostly done.This game suffers a bit of strangeness when it comes to the UI and ease of use when playing on a computer. Though they do make sense if this game ever went to a tablet like an iPad or possibly a console? A few things I do not care for but are not real deal breakers for me* The strength of monsters seems difficult to gauge. Knowing if you can kill a monster is not an easy question to answer. Just hope they don't kill your dwarves* Monster noises particularly the goblins get a bit excessive and repetitive i makes me cringe.* The game also fails to really explain the use of spells and mana usage. * I find it strange when it comes to AI with regards to priorities of tasks. I click on things and getting them to do it seems hard or impossible sometimes* There is a bit of unnecesary crafting of things i never wanted to use but crafted in order to advanced my crafting skills to make the things I really wanted to. For example crafting 20 gargoyle statues that have no effect other than vanity seems silly so i can make something else worthwhile "

Heres a quick overview 6 hrs into the game.Recommend for sandbox / management gamers who have a decent tolerance of bugs and need something new.The Good -Art: Very pleasing art style, rather original style overallIntro Screen: When starting up the game the background pans around to your last save with dwarves actively moving around.  Not at all a big game changer but a nice creative touch.The Bad - A.I: Dwarves are dedicated to picking up all bits of garbage no matter how many goblins are in the wayPacing - Not sure if there’s a fast forward button, but I need to find it if there is.The Rest -Tech - Both Verity and pacing seem decent but it feels a bit grueling at times.  You don't research but simply gather mats, craft and place the object before progressing.  This means placing a mishmash of fluff around your house as you progress. "

								Still in alpha but an amazing game.  Like most people have stated it is a combination of terraria, minecraft, and resource management.  I haven't noticed many bugs, a few crashes here and there but it saves automatically so you don't lose anything.  The one downside is there is not a lot of guidance and it will take some time to get used to.  The campaign (at least the first level) consists of challenges trying to unlock more items to create, except for some its very confusing on how to create them (where to get materials) or finish the challenge.  Either way, it is a great game and if you think you will like it, get it.  Help them out and report what needs fixing.  This game has a lot of potential.			"

								I am really enjoying this game. I like the way that the recipes just show up in the crafting boxes when you click on the item that you want to build. I especially like the way you can see at a glance whether you have everything you need to make it or not... however, could you please include an option to just build it once you see you have everything rather than making me grab each ingredient on my own and drag it in there??Just an idea.Thanks			"

Early Access Review
								This game is surprisingly deep (pun semi-intended) and addictive to a fault. The biggest problem with the game is that the tutorial system is nonexistent and one or two aspects of the game are non-intuitive (builiding a shelter) but once you get over the frustration this is an amazingly fun game. I think there's still room to add more depth to the quest system (i.e. the quests basically just ask you to build every item in the tech tree which is something you'd do anyway and not really a separate mission) and the bestiary doesn't seem to work (it's stuck on one page and indicates stats for monsters that seem to become inaccurate over time) but so far this game has a lot going for it.That's the biggest problem I have with this game at its current state, there's no explanation for how the various components actually work and there's a lot of guesswork involved in figuring out how to best use each piece. It would be nice if there was a little explanation, or video of how they all work to clarify things. For example, the cart system isn't totally clear, or how to get mages to use spell potions (they vanish when you try and equip them) or why you can ""construct"" spells, but gain nothing from it.The in-game analogy is that this game is really deep, but the developers have dug themselves in without building ladders to let people climb down. Players have to fall a lot before they understand what's going on well enough to find the best ways to get in and out.In addition it would be nice if there was a way of directly commanding the dwarves in combat other than taking direct control and forcing an individual dwarf's actions. It would be nice if you could select specific dwarves and tell them where to go together to attack a specific target. There is a rally spell but it only forces them to stand in one spot and doesn't allow much beyond that. For combat it would be good to be able to  move in unison and attack together, the current set up doesn't allow for this and makes fighting large numbers of enemies a tricky circumstance. Being able to assign dwarves to guard specific spots would be good also.A quick note for people who may be confused with how to build a shelter:The game world has two layers, foreground and background including for construction. In order to build a proper wall you must build both the background layer and the foreground layer (i.e. build one space twice if it's empty). In order to build a shelter you must fill the shelter with background walls, the perimiter with background and foreground walls, and have doors/hatches (doors are for lateral, hatches are for vertical) at every intended opening, and you must have a totem somewhere within that space.A second note on construction:I realized this after many, many hours of play (after finishing the first world, in fact) but you can construct dirt/stone/sand directly back into the world and even use it as a building material for your structure. This is incredibly useful knowledge and yet the game doesn't teach you this anywhere, you sort of just have to stumble into it, but bear this in mind as dirt is a lot easier to get ahold  of than the other building materials you have to spend ages collecting resources for in order to create. Plus it's a cheap way to fill in inconvenient dig sites, or construct yourself a real dwarf burrow inside the earth.Overall a great game, and mostly inutitive, but seriously needs further development of the quest system and better explanation of how the game works (tutorials, an in game help system, a wiki, anything is better than the short blurbs in there at the moment.).

												Writing this in English so It will reach more ppl - My english s.... though.Read some comments after playing this for a while... and most of them have a point! However! All depends on what you're looking for. Yes, the dwarves are stupid and have sometimes terrible pathfinding but that's part of the game. It's you, the player, who need to correct them to do the right stuff en take the better path (which is not always easy). Portals, manual control en using imps to get those resources on the other side of the map which your dwarves mined already but didn't put in your stockpile yet are part of techniques used. The lack of higher tier resources in the end game can be resolved by salvaging already existing equipment (but in generally you'll have plenty of resources... which you'll have to search in the more difficult places)Basically I like the game for it's casual en relaxing gameplay. I can play it in the couch while the mss watches a movie and afterwarths I still know what the movie was about. But make no mistake. This game has quite some challenges to progress throught the tech tree and get to the next lvl. + Relaxing!!Stupid dwarves... What's more funny!Decent support and dev progress by dev's (a new lvl recently)Plays really s u p e r on a small laptop (eg mac 13)Resource management and basebuilding in one....- I'm not the biggest fan of the manual controlIt consumes my social life			"

												I wanted to like the game.  The interface was too clunky and slow for me.

								I didn't expected this game to be so fun and deep.Now I'm playing it over Starbound. Micro manage your guys when you want it or just click here and there from time to time to relax. There are a few fight tactics to try, and some customisation (skills and gears) for every dwarf of your tribe.There are a few pathfinding/AI issues, but as you can take control of any character from your group, there's always a workaround to issues. Some gameplay parts are also a bit hard to get at first (shelters, elevators, trains) but once you have failed once or googled it, you get the point.The main feature I'd love to see in future patches is an express mode (like time goes x2 or x4 until you get attacked, so the mining/sleeping process is faster).

								This game is a mixture between Terraria, Gnomoria and Stronghold.Build your own fortress, dig for treasures, gather resources, fight off waves of monsters, do research, equip your dwarves.What I enjoyed most is the fact that this game has it's emphasis on defending vs monsters which always keeps you on your toe. Currently as it is, time always plays an important roleThe classic sandbox approach where you just build and mire is better left for Minecraft and maybe even Terraria, despite the graphics being one of the best one's for this genre so far.I recommend reading some guides first before jumping straight into the game since certain mechanics, i.e. how to build a proper shelter or how to use town portals are not necessarily intuitive yet.

								Having played ""Craft the World"" for a mindboggling amount of time for a pre-release game, I feel like I have to add my two cents. Digging, exploring, building, defending and managing are all your responsibility in this (as has been pointed out) Terraria-like indie game. Don't let familiarity with similiar titles sour you to this one. It has its own unique flavor, delightful animations and, most importantly, is utterly addicitive. Patches comes fast and furious so I feel confident this is one title that won't be left to languish. Crucially, I can say that, even were the title to grind to a halt today, I got my monies worth and then some. Even better, I look forward to the finished product and the anticipated improvements to come.			"

I really want to like this gameThis type of game is something I enjoy. And this game looks like it will become a great game if the developers keep developing it. However, as it stands right now, it has very limited depth. The tech tree seems out of sorts. It's difficult to survive in the beginning due to being unable to build adequate shelter before the first invasion.Invasions get harder as the game progresses. That's great. Except they only get harder in so far as there are more mobs in each invasion. At some point, you will be unable to complete an invasion before daylight. I have all of my guys with maxed out weapons and high levels of experience with them. I have multiple defenseive structures. I still can't complete an invasion. There are other points of contention: Dwarf AI is lackluster at best. Minerals become very rare. Towards the end of the game, it's nigh impossible to gather enough materials to equip you dwarves, much less build grand castles under the mountains. There is no way to automate anything. This includes things like making sure tables are stocked with food. Transit AI is terrible, and in some situations is so broken that you have to manually remove them and replace them in order to get them to work properly.Perhaps in the future, this game will become a fun game to play. Until then, play the first hour or so, and then go find something better than the tedium that is Craft the World.			"

								I cannot recommend this game any higher. For a early access game it is very well polished graphics wise and crafting except for gear. AI still needs work ( Dwarfs randomly climbing for no reason, Not doing builds in the order that makes sense, No repathing in water when new path opens.) I have only crashed 3 times in the 40+ hours I have played but auto save system usually saved a few minutes ahead of time. Given time this game could achieve great things. needs balancing for costs of recipies expecially weapons. to craft the best gear you need alot of mythil ore but not alot can be found to gear up all 9 dwarfs( the max I have gotten). If it wasent a finite world I would not complain. But for one sword to cost 8 ore seems a bit steep when one mythril ore pocket is 6-8 and its only in the bottom 10-15 layers . But with over 100 recipies it can be balanced before full release.			"

								Even though CTW is in its Early Access stage, the game is already really enjoyable and fun to play.I even dare to say that it's more polished than a lot of AAA games released in the past few years!I was looking for a sandbox building game, with a focus on building, not on combat. This really qualifies as that.Yes, there is combat and 'army' building present, but that's not the main focus of the game.After a bit of hesitation (mainly because it's still Early Access), I decided to purchase CTW.Not one moment did I feel regret!Considering this is still in the Alpha fase, CTW shows real potential to become even more fun and challenging than it already is!

												Great game. Of course, it reminds of Terraria, but it's more strategy than action. I like how crafting slowly unlocks. Unfortunately, I have to vote NO because I bought the game to play multiplayer and the game the becomes boring/finished by the time multiplayer unlocks. It's really the initial stages of the game that I would like to play with family.			"

												It's basically Terraria/Minecraft except you're working on a macro level, so you spend more time thinking about what to do instead of doing it.The design is pretty great, much like a mobile game so very addictive.It has a few flaws:Its graphics (which goes with the mobile aspect of the game, but it's something I find really tasteless)The way the science tree is made, you end up too often crafting useless things to make other things available to craftThe recurring waves of enemies that become more numerous with time, I wish I could simply explore deep underground without having to worry about them (especially since there doesn't seem to be a reliable way to just protect your shelter from them, they'll always try to destroy everything and I haven't been able to make turrets work yet for some reason)The goblins don't care about doors? I don't know why that is but they just waltz into your shelter like it's nothing.As some others have described it, it's a love/hate relationship, I haven't really been able to stop playing for now. I'll probably come back to that review when I do.			"

However, I feel the game as plenty going for it and has a lot of charm, polish and new features to come. A  more casual version of Dwarf Fortress certainly has merits and will attract a lot of dedicated players.			"

												Fun and addicting little game, you build a base, and manage the dwarfs down a tech tree with the end goal to be strong enough to kill the world bosses, and unlock the gate to a new world.  The game can be a little frustrating on the AI, dwarfs will sometimes atand around and not figure out what they need to do (specially on 3 gate mob waves, they will stand i  the mass of mobs and just die as cant figure a path) this only rarely happens though, or they will stand and fight until they die.. why they dont run and hide like normal i have no idea!but i have played this plenty and enjoyed it, so was worth the money (its also on mobile now and still updated regularly, but i would love a BIG dlc content pack)			"

								This game felt very polished compared to so many other games in 'Early Access'. I am very much looking forward to whatever else they plan on implementing.  The game definitely has that Terreria feel but I very much enjoy the dynamic of controlling multiple dwarfs and being able to mold each of them in to their own specific role.  The game also gives you a similar feel of control to the 'hand of god' games such as Black & White, though when you really need to, you can take direct control of a dwarf.  One other little detail that I appreciated was the fact that the dwarfs can be clumbsy and may fall of planks or off walls and take damage.  This attention to detail made the dwarfs feel much more like a believable character than just one of many bots that will run around and do your bidding with no faulter.I could go on about the features that I enjoy about this game (and at the time of writing this I have only played it for just over 3 hours) but I would highly suggest you play it for yourself.

												I like the idea of the game, and for the first 30 minutes it's fun, but for me the game was bugged, where no matter what I did I couldn't get my dwarves to eat or sleep, and although I never got far enough to see how hunger affects the dwaves, sleeping it what regens health, meaning they would die very easy after a while, especially when the big waves that hit at 45 minutes  came in, with nothing I could do about it. Basiclly I lose after the first portal wave hits. If this bug ever gets fixed, maybe I'll change my opinion, till then, don't buy it.			"

												I have yet to finish it as i got sidetracked by larger RPG games (and other indies) but I will updeate this very short review once i have finished all three major maps, hence the following only is a first impression sort of deal after completing just the first level;This game is what i wanted both Towns and Minecraft to be. Except 2D-ish sidescroller with dwarves fighting off waves upon waves of undead and also veeery limited supply of certain metals meaning you have to be fairly greedy/careful with your metals. For me, in particular, iron, because you have to use it in so many different things including just research to unlock higher tier equiment and building blocks as well as necessary equipment, armour and weapons meaning you have to think while playing, not just breeze through it swiftly without putting any thought or effort into it.Pros:- Very replayable,- Not necessarily difficult but somewhat chance based how challenging the beginning will be depending on how you're placed on the map both strategically and practically considering resources.- Enjoyable graphics and style of animation.- Has to be learned. I had to restart games three times just to work out how to do things. First to learn how to build a house, second to actually build a house and have my dwarves not be miserable and hungry constantly. Third to build a house well and be able to defend it from the hordes. (Fourth: to learn not to attack or release the crystal guardian without a strategic vantage point AND high damage weapons/high defense armour equipped on ALL dwarves of which there should be et least 10. And fifth to actually win the map), Granted this may be considered a bad thing, but I rather enjoy the fact tht a game takes you being able to play the game in order to win it rather than just breezing through without that slight tickle in your belly when you're uncertain whether or not you'll be able to take on those enemies but you're aware you have no choice in the matter.- Although the tutorial doesn't hand you the game when you're fully able to understand what to do you have some idea and learn the rest through the objectives and through crafting so you're never fully alone in the game and left to your own vices althrough you are never told directly what to do next. Hence: the game encourages you to experiment and learn but will hold your hand and guide you a bit should you somehow manage to get stuck. - Mechanics run smoothly. I have not encountered any problems or major bugs this far.- Crafting is nice and smooth as well with a nice increasing level of dedication and involvement to craft higher tier object.Cons:- As in most my reviews, yet again the audio just gets really annoying after a few hours of playing... this far i can't really think of any other cons. As I progress i suspect I will come across more.Summary: Great fun. In fact. All of the fun. Despite the fact that I find myself moaning and ♥♥♥♥♥ing about how much I hate each dwarf in my colony (by name), Possibly also verbally assualting them with graphic curses and promises of torment after a few hours in a map it is still one of the most enjoyable and involved games i've played in a long while.

Nice graphics and very good gameplay! This game is nothing like Terraria or Star Bound... Only the crafting component / sandboxing is related to it.Some findings:1. Once you have made a receipe you should allow for quick build... No need to constantly drag and drop each single ingredient in there. That is a waste of time and gets annoying really quick.2. The game could use speed settings.3. How do I raise sheep? I need ropes for basic armor crafting but there hardly are any sheep around.			"

												I played this game, enjoyed it, and recommend it. However it's not the best game in this genre. Which is unfortunate because this game has so much going for it. My biggest gripe is with the enemy raids. There are two types. The nightly attacks are too common and trivial to defend against. I even found myself ignoring them in favour of mining for ore underground. And the second hourly one starts weak but soon escalates in difficulty until I had to hide underground. And then there's the mining. The worlds are too small and resources too scarce. The AI is alright after you understand it but the crafting menu needs some work. Ironic considering the name.			"

												Most of the time in the game you just do the same thing over and over by clicking your mouse, but somehow I just don't get bored of it. To me the game is extremely addictive, but it might not be for everyone else. Three problems: First of all when you take control of a single Dwarf, the controls aren't that friendly; Second of all, the worlds created are in fact quite small, and after a couple of hours there's really nothing much to do; Third of all, there are some bugs which can be quite annoying, for example one of my Dwarfs walked in the air for one block and then fell to the ground, instead of using the ladders I built. It was a high drop and he very nearly died. Overall I would say the game is fun.			"

												This game needs A LOT more work. Speeding things up would be a huge improvement.In its current state, it is neither likeable or enjoyable. It's slow, the AI pathfinding is hilariously inefficient and this really does feel like a ripoff of Terraria and Minecraft - which are awesome games.The tutorials of this game get in your face but teach you next to nothing. When the need to rely on Youtube videos to help figure out how to play a game that a Terraria and Minecraft fan has been through, it shows how much this game tried to be both but came up short.Not recommended. 5/10			"

												game becomes unreasonably difficult as you have to micromanage many dwarves against goblins who will almost certainly wreck your♥♥♥♥♥♥every 5 minutes.The thing that I hate the absolute most about this game, though, is that you select FROM A MENU an item to craft, and then have to build it on a 3x3 grid like in minecraft; but they show you where to put the items? Why not just have a ""Craft item"" button? Having a menu with every item defeats the point of the crafting grid.			"

												I've barely been able to start. However, I feel this game is excellent. I feel it's a mix between Terarria (Given), however I would also say a small part The Sims and also Lemmings. It combines resource management, tasking your workers, gaining levels, completing levels and graphically I think it's stunning. Well worth the sales price, and I think it's worth the full price as well. Also for anyone with a 5760 x 1080 resolution, it looks fantastic on it, and definitely makes use of the Surround/Eyefinity setups.			"

												Outstanding and adicting game.  After about 6 hours of play I can truely say this is one of the best indy games I have gotten on Steam in a long time.  I'd say it's better then even Shovel Knight simply on sheer replayability.  If you like task oriented games with fun game play and interesting mechanics, get this game; you'll be hooked for more hours then you'll remember.			"

												Am really enjoying Craft The World and there's still loads for me to explore. It's similar to Terraria which is one of my favourites and I'd recommend this to fans. There's a lot of gathering and defending and upgrading, it's a fun survival and the buildings are fun and cute. Pathfinding can occasionally be an issue, as stated in previous reviews, however you can take control of a problem dwarf so it's not a big problem. Simplify your routes and it's easy for them to get around!			"

												This game is quite fun and unfortunately (for my family) i play it a lot. I do have one very big recommendation for the game, make it so you can lose. at the moment there is no real reason to defend yourself. if the monsters get in they just wonder around aimlessly. They don't seek out dwarves generally, they don't anything (except the front door), they don't take anything. Nothing happens. really the easiest thing to do is to lock the dwarves in a room while there is an invasion until they disappear, then just go about your day.Please add a losing condition to add to the excitement of an already awesome game.

												Before I get into it, let me just say that this title is actually fairly fun. It seems like a good time killer and feels like something really appropriate for your smartphone while you're on a train or taking a break at work. That is also why I am giving this a thumbs down. This IS a smart phone game lazily ported to PC. It still FEELS like a mobile game despite being on a much more powerful machine. Gameplay-wise, there is some clumsiness in design that goes beyond the ""its a mobile game on pc"" thing. You upgrade skills and unlock new abilities, but the order in which you unlock them seems to be almost random. You need to build through a few tech trees before you can make basic building components like doors. These are the things you need at the very beginning of the game and by the time you can make them, you've already worked around not having them... thus you don't need them. Also some components like wool to make rope are exceedingly hard to come by and you won't see a sheep until you're further along... thus having recipes at the very start which require rope really sucks. This game doesn't deserve the bad rap I'm giving it. Make no mistake it EARNS a thumbs down, but it really doesn't deserve it. These are things that the developer should have put a little more time and effort into to make a polished game. The graphics are otherwise great. The gameplay is very nonchalant and casual. And over all the game is very relaxing to play. These are great traits that could have made this an amazing game... but in a few key areas it just seems to fall short. Make no mistake, you're buying a mobile game for PC here and it has enough design flaws that you'll lose your love for this game the longer you play. And I say this because this game is definitely a game that should be loved. I feel like maybe another 3-6 months of development could have made a massive difference in this game. Who knows. Sans a major content patch fixing things.. i'd say pass on craft the world unless you see it on a deep sale.			"

It is actuually difficult to get out of the game, as it completly charms you with it's simple but attractive gameplay and atmosphere. It is a sand gox in some way, altough you have a goals. However, even after achieving the goal you can still keep playing if you wish.Also I really liek randomly generated worlds.

												Very nice little game, well made, solid.  Not many people get the AI right like this, where you issue your orders and don't have to worry about idle workers, orders deadlocking, etc.  It just works, it's fun.  Replayability is somewhat limited as you can unlock the full skill tree in your first play and following games are more or less the same gamplay is a larger/harder environment.  But if you are into that kind of games, it'll hold you for 20h at least.			"

												This sort of game never really appealled to me before; however, it a gem of a game that I have thoroughy enjoyed for a very long playtime. Initially there is a steep learning curve for getting started, but the charming and progressive gameplay really draws you in. The premise of the game is simple, build a home for your dwarfs and get them to delve deep into the earth to discover rare materials needed to strengthen the dwarfs home and their own gear. Each world requires you to survive and then  find the portal on to the next world. This can take 10-15 hours of playtime per level and the final world is very challenging, with enough variety to keep the tech tree engaging.  For the price, this game is a bargain, especially if I compare the played time I have on lots of other expensive games that cost far far more. Hopefully the developers will continue to add new worlds and techs to this very charming and addictive game!			"

												Play the first stage - you will see all that there is if you want to. You want the same in different colors many more times? Play the later stages. I played stage one and it was fun. But unfortunately it was all the fun there was.This game is sadly one-dimensional. All the progress in the randomly generated worlds is available from start. Only the smallest changes are there.If you want to play the same slow game over and over again and get only a very petite change with every repetition - buy yourself a miniature Zen box and variate the patterns.Or buy tetris. It is more random and has a higher replay factor - even if you only replay the same level.			"

								Incredible game.  Absolutely incredible.I enjoy this game immensely, and I'm picky when it comes to crafting sandbox games when it comes to holding my attention.  The learning curve is easy, the crafting system is intuitive, the graphics appealing and enjoyable to view for hours on end, and the depth of gameplay is deep.On the surface, it may look like Terraria or Starbound with different graphics.  I can attest to the fact that this is far from the truth.  Craft The World takes the best of multiple games and puts them all into one incredibly fun package, all while adding something new to the genre.  The developers have done a phenomenal job getting this game into great shape, and even though it's still early in development, I had absolutely no issues playing an entire 25 hour campaign mission straight through.  The occasional restart will fix any major game breaking bugs that pop up, and that's about as easy as it comes when you're talking about an early release.While I've got high hopes for some unannounced features, this is and will be a solid game moving into the future.  I'm extra excited for the concept of multiplayer, so fingers crossed we'll see it in the future.			"

								Craft the World is ""Game of Dwarves"" with a lack of depth perception.  Heres a quick overview 6 hrs into the game.Recommend for sandbox / management gamers who have a decent tolerance of bugs and need something new.The Good -Art: Very pleasing art style, rather original style overallIntro Screen: When starting up the game the background pans around to your last save with dwarves actively moving around.  Not at all a big game changer but a nice creative touch.The Bad - A.I: Dwarves are dedicated to picking up all bits of garbage no matter how many goblins are in the wayPacing - Not sure if there’s a fast forward button, but I need to find it if there is.The Rest -Tech - Both Verity and pacing seem decent but it feels a bit grueling at times.  You don't research but simply gather mats, craft and place the object before progressing.  This means placing a mishmash of fluff around your house as you progress. "

								Still in alpha but an amazing game.  Like most people have stated it is a combination of terraria, minecraft, and resource management.  I haven't noticed many bugs, a few crashes here and there but it saves automatically so you don't lose anything.  The one downside is there is not a lot of guidance and it will take some time to get used to.  The campaign (at least the first level) consists of challenges trying to unlock more items to create, except for some its very confusing on how to create them (where to get materials) or finish the challenge.  Either way, it is a great game and if you think you will like it, get it.  Help them out and report what needs fixing.  This game has a lot of potential.			"

												I like the game overall, since I like more crafty type games.  It's a great zone-out game for me, and I have enjoyed it.  I wish things in the crafting menu were a bit easier to create, and the fact you run out of minerals or supplies really is annoying, but overall the graphics and the game-play is so much fun.For me it's like Minecraft, just 2D, but with achievable goals.  Haven't tried any other worlds (Lvl 14 on the 1st world), but I imagine it's more intense and more enemies to contend with.*Honestly, once you start making silver armor you can pretty much kick butt in the fights.  Just wish i had more archers.			"

												It's a funny game that makes a lot of fun. My first Review was positive. I enjoy the graphics very much, and even when the game is still in early access, it is nearly coomplete und absolute playable.So why negative rating?I don't agree with the dev's way of balancing. Especially with the structure of the tech tree. There are many techs where i think: ""Why is it there? And not there?"" for example armor. New armor comes very late, but in late game, they all come nearly at once. Why? Why do i unlock Iron Armor, to unlock Silver Armor as soon as i crafted some Iron Armor? Only to unlock Gold Armor, as soon as i crafted some Silver Armor.Crap.Same with beds. I unlock beds Tier 2, only to unlock allready Tier 3 before i even crafted enough Tier 2 beds for my dwarves. And thats really annoying. When i need stuff, i don't get it. And when i get it, i don't need it anymore because i allready unlock better one before i finish crafting.And the other thing i don't like is the late game of each level. It's dumb digging for Portal parts. And it gets even worse with every level since the map increases in size. It's okay to dig for real progress, to get new and different ores for better equipment. But it's horrible annoying if you need to dig down the whole map only to find those portal parts when you allready have everything you need. (except the portal parts, of course.)So yeah, i like the gameplay, but tech trees and late game content really needs a change.			"
