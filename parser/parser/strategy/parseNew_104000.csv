												A serviceable effort for the consumption of genre fans that are satiated with a competent Tower Defense game. For the rest I suggest you check out Defense Grid, Orcs must Die or another exemplary title in the field since this game doesn't really stray from the tried and true formula.It bored me.			"

												iBomber Defense is a fun game if you really like tower defense games and if you're bored. On the downside is that it is rather bland - I don't really have a problem with the low amount of turrets, enemies and maps (although there are quite a few maps). It's mostly how the two campaigns are very much alike, and how the quickplay is exactly like the part of the campaign you've already played. The enemies come at exact same times and in the same order, making it rather boring, and thus with a low replayability. The music gets annoying after a while, but it's mostly the 'boom'-sounds without any other background sound that make it very obvious that this game could very easily be improved. I would think it's worth buying for a very low price, but don't expect too much of it.			"

												iBomber Defense, yet another IOS game that has somehow made it's way onto the PC and onto Steam with little or no development in between.iBomber Defense is about as simple and generic as a tower defense game can get, no effort has been made towards giving the game any features or gimmicks that might make it stand out from the crowd even a little.You place down your turrets, Machine Gun, Cannon or Anti-Aircraft and fighting off waves of enemies that try to make it to your base, occasionally you might want to repair a turret that has taken too much damage or drop down one of the equally generically named support turrets that slow enemies or increase the range and firepower of turrets in range. There is no abilities to use or interest to earn and the maps are fairly small so the entire game is purely based around optimal placement.The truth is that there is really nothing wrong with iBomber defense, but there isn't anything right about it either. Everything about it just so bland and uninspired, it is like so many tower defense games out if they had everything but the bare essentials stripped from their bones.With the tower defense genre growing in both complexity and polish there really shouldn't be room for a game like this, even on mobile there is better alternatives and on the PC this barely even qualifies as a browser game. It just isn't worth the time or the effort.			"

												This is a well-made tower defense game. It does not add anything new to the genre but it is fun and well balanced. There is no storyline but there is a vague World War 2 theme. There are dozens of levels to play, each with dozens of waves, with each wave taking 1-4 minutes to complete. As you complete levels you earn ugrades to spend on various kinds of turrets. This is casual entertainment at its finest.My main criticism is that some of the levels, particularly the naval levels, take too long to complete. If your turrets just sank the first super-slow but super-tough battleship, then the next dozen such battleships will surely meet the same fate. Yes, you can speed up the action, but there is a problem with repetition.But this is a minor gripe which is fully addressed in the next game of the series, iBomber Defense Pacific. This game is quite inexpensive and definitely worth checking out if you like tower defense games!			"

												Really good & fun Tower Defense game..... Enjoying my time playing this game..... Even more addicted than GTA V for sure.It's been a while since i played this game, recently i just started to play it again and now i remembered why i stopped played it before... how time flies away while play this game.... so much fun to plan your tactics to encounter the incoming enemies. You got to have strategies to deploy your arsenal under budget given at the start of the round, you received money after killing enemy which you can use to buy more arsenal to play with. Every mission contains about 20 or more rounds and every campaign contains multiple missions.			"

												I'm sure most of you guys are familiar with the term 'tower defense'. It's a game where you build and upgrade towers to defeat waves of enemies and, later on, bosses trying to destroy your [insert something random here like a base or village]. If you've seen one of them you've seen pretty much all of them. Somehow I do enjoy playing them, even though most of them are simply clones. This one is ok I guess. Graphics are nothing special and it does what it's supposed to do. However, there are definitely better tower defense games around, so get this one if you've played through all the others.[Rating: 60/100]			"

												Really hard tower defense game.Has two main campaigns, the first is of which is easy enough but the second gets a bit harder.Also ""Quickplay"" levels which are the same as in the campaign but with more limits on what turrets and upgrades are available.It's very easy to pick up and learn, and smashing through the campaigns even on hardest difficulty is not terribly hard if you've played any tower defense games before, but the Quickplay missions for the second camapaign get diabolical, so good luck getting the associated achievements!Nice simple visuals, sound can get a bit annoying because certain things (explosions) are repeated a lot.Overall it's good for a playthrough, and if you're into TD at all then make sure to play this.

A ""rough gem"".The game is ""rough"" in the sense that is definitely unpolished and feels not yet finished in many places.  For example, the only sounds while playing are the sounds of your guns and the many, many explosions.  The enemy doesn't make a sound when they shoot.  And the only music is in the menus.But despite it's many flaws, I found the game entertaining enough that I kept on going through the Allies Campaign  (5.2hrs), and then continued the MUCH harder Axis Campaign (11hrs).  And after losing a mission (on the middle difficulty) that went on for what felt like an hour, I still found myself giving it another attempt because there's just enough about the game that I like that I really wanted to finish it.The Good:+ A bare-bones Tower Defense game.+ Freedom of tower placement.  For the most part you are pretty free to place a tower where you like.  However to get a perfect mission rating and also on the harder levels, particularly on the Axis campaign, optimal tower placement becomes more and more critical.+ Nice variety of maps.  Each campaign is roughly 10 or so maps with a couple missions then being a ""replay"" of the previous level you just finished, but the enemy bombed part of the map, destroying any turrets you had in that part of the map and not allowing them rebuilt there, or a new enemy route is opened up.+ Surprise Attacks.  The ""surprise attacks"" during the middle of missions that change the map, allowing enemy to attack on the subsequent waves from a new path.+ Multiple paths.  The enemy can take a variety of paths to your base.The OK:~ Long Missions.  Some missions have 20 waves, others 30, some even 40, and whoah, even 50!  Get comfortable, because when a single wave can last a couple minutes, you're going to be there for awhile.~ Graphics are OK at best.  Playing a game on static wallpaper of the wrong resolution for the monitor (re: black bars on sides)..~ Both campaigns feel the same.  The Axis Campaign is very similar to the Allied and some of the maps are even the same.  Disappointing.The Bad:- Waves are too long.  Enemies are strung together in a seemingly endless, perfectly spaced line with no variety or change.- Very little variety.  All enemy from whatever path, all start at the same time and are all uniformly spaces...no groups of enemies, just long lines.  Very long lines.  If you can fend off the first 4, 5, 10 enemy in the line, why bother sending the remaining 30 in the line; it turns into just a long string of explosions.- Feels very unfinished.  No sound for the enemy or environment.  No music while playing.  No story.- Some missions, you're just going to lose.  Between the surprise attacks opening up new routes allowing a flood of enemy in RIGHT NOW, or the sudden burst of higher level enemies to open the next wave....until you learn to get ready for them in advance, they're just going to run right through you, and you lose.- No replayability.  There's no variety in enemy behavior, no change in turret selection, no random factor...Overall:  I recommend the game if you go in with low expectations because, in the end, I did enjoy my time playing -- enough to sink (yikes) 15+ hrs into the 2 campaigns.  7 out of 10.

												I very simplistic and generic tower defense with some significant flaws and missing features. There are few towers to choose from, and no choices to make when upgrading them. You cannot adjust which enemies the towers will target, and they are often very inefficient in their targeting. You cannot perform any actions, like ""special attacks"", other than placing towers. Maps are sometimes unclear about where enemies will come from and where they will go. Not a terrible game, but there are much better tower defense games available.			"

												iBomber Defense is about what you'd expect from a WWII themed tower defense game. Basic MG, Artillery, and AA emplacments are each designed to counter the stadard threats by land, air or sea.  The maps can be challenging, particularly in areas where terrain prevents placement along likely paths, unfortunately, this isn't always obvious as occasionally open spaces will not allow placement.  The campain mode is unfortunately linear, however, there will occasionally be ""defense"" bonus levels, where you get to play a previous map with already placed towers and a nice purse to upgrade and expand from the get go.  Although you'll be trying to defend against a more challenging string of attackers, extra ""action"" points (for upgrading and expanding available defense options) will be easier come byAll in all, an easy game to pick up and put down whenever you get bored.  It doesn't really stack up to some of the more dynamic tower defense games, but it gets the job done.			"

												A solid tower defense game. Set in WWII, first as the Allies in the first campaign, then as the Axis during the second campaign. This is a fixed path tower defense game, meaning the enemies will always follow certain roads or channels and you have to place towers along those paths. The land and sea paths use the same towers, with Anti-Air towers specifically for the specific areas that have air raids. The graphics are fine for an iPhone port. The sound is forgettable explosions. The challenge is at about the right level. The early levels will be fairly simple to pass and not too hard to perfect, while the later stages will challenge you to even survive them.			"

												If you have previosly tried this game, but at some point had problems making it start I recomend you read the last paragraph. FIrst of all you should know my review may be kinda biased by something the dev did (altough I will try to my fullest being neutral). But I hope you have the time and will to still read it. When I bought the game it was kinda mediocre. It got few towers indeed. Basically there is on fast hitting mg, A slower but stronger canon, Slowing flamethrower, A basic AA and depending on which faction you have money generating thingie and a mega big a** canon (I believe its main its canongun would be a very nice ploace to camp in). The thing this game has going for it placement, and the order in which you place your turrets and upgrade them. As a result of this it becomes repeat until you have learnt what to do process, but finnaly understanding it is imensily satsifying. I will not lie i used walktoughs to get through some of the levels(there I said it now someoen give me x amount of money as is regarded the right thing to do as punishment, to all politicians or politican like figures who deos something unethical uptil blowing up this planet wiht a press on the wrong BIG red button). True enough the game can be viewed as shallow and its enemies can also be seen as spongebobby (taking so much damage that your weapons/tools lose their awesomeness) but its something imensily satisfying when you manage to complete a map on hard. Or when something about the last enemy in that wave clikcs and you finnaly understand how to repay the poor german tank commander with a family who only fight because he needs medicine for his mother or something for last time he made you lose a base life tenfold (I made four canons shot at him at the same time therefore ensuring that he probably now is going arounf orbit (there you see how the myth about moon nazis  was created)).Bottomlien is that even if it has repeat untill you learn and winn mechanic it doesnt take very long for you to understand it if you pay attention. Now the thing is if you maanage to pay attention. The graphics are a little below mediocre making it in my eyes difficuklt seing the details about for example enemy units and the like. They certainly wont make you goo with big shiny anime eyes either (quick everyone put on your big eyed anime bubblehead mask).One thing should be said about the grapihcs tough. Looking at the games from this coman in this series its easy to see a pattern so they should atleast have a clap for staying put regaridng theses games identity (the ibomber games, 4 in total as I know about). And I certainly dont think they are unpleasant to look like I jsut think they had benefitted form more details.I at the start mentioned soemthing about the dev doing soemthing right?Well it goes like this. I bought this game over two years ago. Immediatly after purchase I became hooked. For a few weeks I played it a good deal, but then suddenly it stopped working. I tried contacting the devs got no response and gave up. recently I tried again for reasons I cant remeber (probaly impulse) and to my suprise they acctually responded after a few weeks. After giving them my specs tehy told me to wait and try it again after the end of the week. Which I did after donwloading it. To my suprsise it worked. So there you have it a happy ending. No brush your teeth little one and sleep tight. -blows out candle-			"

												I like tower defense, but you can find much better than this. Not many towers, and it's of the type where your tower placement can't affect the enemy's path, so by the end of a stage you'll probably always be in a similar position of having all decent spaces filled with the same few towers. When infantry attacks they're so tiny you might not see them.			"

												It's OK. It's a basic Defense Tower game. You place machine guns , AA and cannons and upgrade them as you progress and unlock new weapons but not many. It would be great as a Facebook game but paying more than $3 for it would be kind of a ripoff since it's not very long.  On the Game Scale from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to Yoshi, I give it a Pippa.			"

												Ein nettes klassiches zumeist ""Pfadbasiertes"" Tower-Defense Spiel für zwischendurch.Bietet die übliche Kost mit Updates der Türme etc. Zwischen den Missionen kann man die Türme noch verbessern, ab und zu gibt es auch Bonusmissionen. Zuviel darf man nicht erwarten, aber wer kleine TD-Spiele für zwischendurch mag, kann hier nichts falsch machen. "

												I like TD games, so I picked up this one. Turns out it wasn't the best decision, as I only made it to the 4th level, then got bored. Why?- Very few towers, with no upgradeability in missions, so you basically end up building the same towers over and over again each map.- Upgrades between missions are just boring and laziliy done.- Clunky controls - hitboxes of buttons weren't where they're supposed to be. I actually had to click multiple times press an OK button, increase or lower game speed etc.- Boring waves. I have played other TD titles that appealed to me with the first mission. But here it just feels that you play the same tactics each level, fighting off almost identically looking waves of enemies.Overall the game feels like a first try of an indie studio at tower defense where they lacked the focus to reiterate their game design and do sufficient testing. Or just another lazy mobile port. Whichever is the case, I recommend going for other titles, as there are enough good TDs out there.			"

												If you are thinking about buying this game call me first. I will then mail you a brick which you can break down and consume one painful spoon full at a time only to excrete it, again with pain, which you can rebuild it using your bodily fluids as a bonding agent.After an hour of playing you will wonder why you are playing...Find a game with crystals *hint* if you are into tower defense games.

												Tower Defense, thats literally this game. Nothing more. So if you're not into it, don't bother. It's an iOS port, it's a simple game with simple controls. It's both good and bad in that aspect, it gets to the point where you just place your turrets and want to walk away, or alt tab (but that game pauses when you do). The music gets annoying after awhile, although i play with really low music anyways I could see that being an issue for many. Biggest problems I have with the game, even though you have different maps and 2 campaigns (Allies and Axis), the maps look different but its just the same each time. The campaign gives you a few missions at a time, kinda cool the way it does it on the gui. Quickplay is stupid unless you're going for achievements, it's litterally the campaign missions, except you have to beat that map in campaign just to play it in quick play. The fast foward button feels like a 20% increase in speed, espeically when dealing with slower units coming at you.5/10 This game is realy only casual at best worth getting on sale for cheap			"

												Very bland and generic tower defense game.The global map offers no strategic depth at all, without any introductory or story-like element, just letting you paint the red zone into blue one by one. The upgrades of your towers is as good as nothing, since you will get them all after the first 5 or 6 missions (less than one half of a full playthrough). So the game became repetitive very fast.Only recommended for hard core tower defense fans when at discount.			"

												Horribly balanced game.  The first several missions were incredibly easy, then suddenly the difficulty jumps to impossible. The second to last mission I tried was so easy that I didn't have to buy/build a single tower for the last 1/3 of the waves. Then I couldn't beat the following mission no matter how many different tactics I tried. At that point I gave up and haven't bothered playing this again. There's too many other good tower defense games out there to bother with this one any more.			"

												A good, if dull, tower defense game. Doesn't really have it's own style, which is where Plants vs Zombies really thrived, and even Defense Grid had a bit with the robot narator, but nothing here. Regardless, good TD game that is only $5, and I have not completed both campaigns yet and have logged on 8+ hours so far. Seems like a good rate to me.			"
