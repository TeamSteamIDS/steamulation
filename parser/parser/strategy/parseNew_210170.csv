												A game in the same vein as Lemmings, Spirits notably has far fewer powers to give your spirits.  This is because, unlike Lemmings, Spirits relies upon a sort of physics engine where windspeed is the most important factor, capable of replacing most of those mobility-boosting skills in Lemmings.  In theory, by using the capacity to shape windspeed by adding new currents to the mix, you can achieve subtle solutions to a wider range of problems with a smaller number of tools.... Too bad it doesn't work out.The main problem is that the game focuses heavily upon ""perfection"" in getting your spirits out, and that means you can't miss.  Unfortunately, the power you have to block wind flows through some areas are a total roll of the dice as to what they will actually do - sometimes, they block a passage you need blocked, other times, they bounce off some miniscule glitch in the geometry, and go flying into some random spot that winds up ruining your whole map, forcing you to reset.  Again.  And Again.  And Again.  Because, through no fault of your own, the game bugs up in specific spots, but you get punished for those things beyond your control.  Then, there are missions where you have to blow spirits up and over spikes on the ground, but where there are also spikes on the ceiling - you need to carefully change the airflow to miss both... but then, there's really no means of judging where a spirit will go in those wind streams but for trial and error.  And if you mess up, start again.Did I mention that some of the later stages are quite long, and restarting restarts the whole level, where you can again be forced to reset due to geography glitches because those are, again, not under your control?  Yeah.Which brings me to what I ultimately have to rate the entire concept behind Spirits upon - Lemmings was a game about precision, which is why having very precise, very predictable effects worked for it.  Spirits adds in this system that demands precision randomness and a cloudiness where there's really no way to foresee what exact positioning of powers will just barely dodge the traps without trial-and-error gameplay.  The original Lemmings was frustrating but fair.  Spirits is just frustrating.			"

 Disclaimer: This review was written thanks to a copy of the game provided by the developer of the game, Spaces of Play. Remember Lemmings, back in '90s? It was a genre-defining game, and one that has spawned countless clones and lookalikes. Now, in the 21st century, Spirits is a promising game that incorporates elements of Lemmings, but in a new and more vibrant way than other earlier games of its genre.Spirits is simple by nature, with an A to B structure. There are no enemies, rather wind, spikes and cliffs will be your obstacles. You control a group of spirits, born from fallen piles of leaves. These spirits must reach the portal at the end of each level, to leave Autumn and find their way home. Each spirit can assist its siblings by digging, creating a breeze or building a new path. These actions all affect the spirits that come after it, and inevitably these abilities are what determines success or failure in each level. The ability to speed up the game often came in handy, especially when you finish sacrificing some of your spirits and wait for the rest of them to find their way to the end.There are always a certain amount of spirits needed to pass the stage, and these can differentiate between a casual player, an a professional. As I strived to get as many spirits as I could into the portal, I saw my global statistics. I was often the world #1 on the easier levels, but that soon changed about halfway through. Plants are also found scattered through the maps, and these are essential to achieving that perfect score after your little floaty friends transport to their next challenge.Spirits' art style is fantastic. Every level you pass has been hand-drawn, and looks akin to landscape scenes in  Anime movies such as Spirited Away or My Neighbour Totoro. The beautiful silhouettes contrast against the vibrant reds, yellows and oranges, creating a warm glow like you're playing the game in front of a woodheater. The wind physics were especially lifelike, with tiny particles rushing past the spirits, glinging off sunbeams and swirling through corners. Everything in Spirits feels alive and realistic, even down to the tiniest things only a handful would notice.The Glow Affect in Spirits was the only thing that turned me away. It is turned on by default, but when I first started up Spirits, the spirits felt blinding and ghostly. I understand that the spirits are meant the be, well, spiritual, but the power of the glow was too strong, so I had that feature turned off. Either way, the spirits looked fuzzy and warm, and their walking and flying animations all seemed carefully thought out.All things considered, Spirits is a wonderful puzzle game, both in mechanics and in aesthetics. It's a mysterious, dreamlike and calming joy to play, and is a great break from the hectic action and fighting found in a lot of other popular games on Steam. I recommend this game to anybody who's up for a challenge, but at the same time wants a deviation from the norms of popular video games.			"

												I wish there was a ""meh"" option because I'm kind of in the middle with this one.On the one hand it's a beautiful game, both in the art and music... very easy to play, quite simple all around, I've seen other people use words like relaxing and calming to describe it and sure, I can see that.On the other hand if you're like me and you're trying to do things perfectly you really have to complete each level in such a painfully specific way it's somewhat ridiculous. I mean kudos to the developers (if this was what they were trying to achieve) because this game seriously grinds your brain and will really test your patience and make you pay some serious attention to detail. I honestly can't tell if it's creative or if it just got lucky with how nit-picky the spirits are on the ground and how randomly they seem to move in the air.If you just want a puzzle game to relax with and casually play and aren't super concerned with perfect completion then sure, I'll recommend this game (do aim for the sale price).PS I am ashamed of how long it took me to realize something useful happens if you click on the spirits while they're in midair.

												Spirits is a short name for little ghosts that pollinate plants in a magic forest.This amazing puzzle game is in lower levels very easy to play and turned out in the last levels as quite challenging. It reminds me mostly of Lemmings. You have either these special abilities like digging through walls (bashing), blowing other spirits over gaps or blocking wind streams as a bloated spirit which you can assign to each of them. Of course then its life is lost. The aim is to bring as much as possible of them to the great magic swirl. Additional the spirits are reacting on windstreams but mostly they must be bewared of walking or floating into dangerous spikes everwhere. Dumb as lemmings ...In a level each plant must be pollinated and a certain number of spirits must survive to solve the map perfectly. Your world rank is even breakdown to each level and will be permanently updated after playing. Not many people have seen the last levels it seems. And also the least achievements to make the last levels all perfect are quite rare. But lots of fun to do them.			"

												Spirits is very reminiscent of Lemmings. The little spirits can be inconsistent in their movement; sometimes one may land in a place that the others weren't able to, or they will walk through a blowing spirit - off a ledge - ruining the perfect score for that level. It's odd. I have to play in windowed mode as the game does not support my common multi-monitor setup; one corner of the game screen is blocking my mouse from accessing it, and one corner is stretched onto my second monitor. There are no graphic options. I just don't have the patience for games like this any more, especially with the little irritating issues that persist throughout the game.			"

												Very similar to the classic 'Lemmings' game series, you guide the spirits through each level, avoiding dangers while collecting plants.I really do like that after completing a level it shows you how you compared. For example: if you started with 8 spirits and managed to get 5 to the end (because you used three of them along the way), the game will let you know if you could have completed the stage while using fewer Spirits.Alas, I'm not so skilled at this sort of game - but if you enjoy this sort of puzzle game, definitely give it a shot. ^_^			"

												A lovely little platformer in many ways. If you prefer a more relaxed style of play, this would be right up your alley. Peaceful colors, peaceful music, cheerful little leaves waking up and walking in a most determined fashion towards certain doom, or possibly just a dead end that will make them knock into each other like they're in a zen mosh pit. Each of the spirits can be used in different ways to assist their fellows in escaping each level, a relatively stressless sacrifice unless you use too many of them and lose. I LIKE.			"

												A pretty simplistic relaxing puzzle game, where you guide a group of ""spirits"" to the objective destination.The main flaw is its lack in story, and its somewhat inconsistant mechanics. Sometimes a few spirits will make it across, while some others will die or get stuck.I don't believe this game has enough going for it to ask $10 retail for.A better price would be more around $1 - $2.50However it is a nice game to pick up on sale, and it's pretty relaxing, and is a complete puzzle experience.

												Fantastic little puzzle game. It's reminiscent of Lemmings, obviously, but has the extra element of wind affecting the spirits movement. At times, getting them to fly where you want them to go can be unintuitively tricky, but on the whole it's a great and addicting experience. Levels 30+ get quite challenging, so don't be scared to check a walkthrough.My only criticism is the soundtrack. It's irritating and doesn't have any decent melody, though that's easily fixed by muting it and substituting your own.			"

												7/10 Not as fun as I thought. Too much ""perfect"" timing and luck involved if you want perfect clearing of levels. The windspeed ability gives a lot less control than you want when placement is crucial. This is especially time consuming when restarting a whole level again for various reasons( missed opportunities, spirit deaths, stuck, etc) even with a speed up button. All this leads to building frustration over a few levels, I could not bear to play more than a few levels in one sitting.Graphics are nice and it's well-made as an indie game with decent gameplay but I wouldn't recommend it.

												Spirits incites feelings of calmness, relaxation and fun as equally as it does frustration. ~  7/10 The beautiful glow effects and music give the game a sense of tranquility. However, you'll find if you don't enjoy trial & error, this sense of tranquility is quickly lost. Knowing the correct solution to a problem isn't always good enough, as the game demands a certain amount of perfection in execution. Despite this, I found myself striving to achieve perfect scores on each stage, motivated to increase my World Rank which is a great feature of this game. The later stages being as difficult and sometimes unforgiving as they are makes completing them all the more satisfying. Overall, I'd recommend this if you enjoy a game that is visually/musically rich and you enjoy problem-solving/trial & error.			"

												   What's Spirits? Spirits is, basically, the Lemmings. It's the same concept. You must guide your spirits to the end of the level.You can ask your spirits to sacrifice themselves to open the way (Growing a tree, making wind, digging the ground...), or just let them walk around to see where they can go. It's a pretty simple concept, but it's still a nice one.   The music is just fantastic. Some sound in the menu are earrapes (buttons), but except those ones, the sound is beautiful during the whole game. Graphics are shiny n' cute, the whole game is played in a Orange-Black-White tone, it's nice and relaxing.   You can buy it via Steam for 8.99€, or via the Humble Bundle store (link : https://www.humblebundle.com/store/p/spirits_storefront) or 7.49€.Conclusion : It's a pretty little game with nice level design, nice graphics, and a nice price.

												It's a Lemmings offshoot, we've all seen one of these. The presentation is painterly, and the soundtrack is heavy on the strings.If you're a completionist, this will probably make you pull your hair out. Tolerances for placing 'winning' specialist spirits are very fine, and it seems that things like air currents have a small degree of variation built in as well.			"

												Edit: I just found out you in fact can assign commands while the game is paused with P key, so have that in mind when reading review. I'm also changing from 'not reccomend' to 'recommend' but leaving the rest of the review untouched.In the beginning it looks promising - nice relaxing graphics and music, lemmings style gameplay, plenty of levels, more variants to get to the finish, etc. And for the first few levels it works really well but later on the game starts to show its flaws. Most of all it's the controls in combination with the level design. The controls works like this - to assign some function to a spirit you have to click on it and then click on a corresponding button. The spirit stops on its place until you assign him his function (which is good) but the other spirits are still walking forward. And because they're all in one dense line you have only few seconds (like two or so) to click on the right button before the second spirit outruns the selected one and jumps to his death (for example). This is not only flaw in the controls by itself, the worst part is that many levels use this as a challenge - the game uses it's own weakness against you. Great example of this is the 30th level where you have to control three different lines of walking spirits at the same time. You have to be not only really fast but also very accurate so you don't choose unwanted function. After a few good levels the game changes from relaxing to this really annoying attention and eye-hand coordination test. It would be much, much better if you could just simply assing functions to the spirits when the game is paused or if the level design wouldn't rely on superhuman reactions. But this is not the case.Pros:-Nice graphics-Relaxing music-Many levels-Some interesting achievementsCons:-Flawed controls / level design			"

												Spirits is a Lemming-style game where you guide spirits home by changing how the wind blows and reshaping the ground. Each spirit can be sacrificed to perform a specific task such as blowing in a particular direction to assist the remaining (providing you strategically positioned it right). It’s a strategy game with a balanced flow of progressive difficulty and replaying levels gives the encouraging feeling of “I know I could do better.”  The hand-drawn art is simply gorgeous and the soundtrack delightful.

												Spirits is alright. It has a nice look and sound design but at it's core it's just Lemmings. if you liked Lemmings, then you'll like this, becasue it's Lemmings. For those of you who don't know what Lemmings is, I'll explain Spirits (and by extention lemmings) gameplay. There is a constant precesion of forward marching forest sprites who will walk straight into certain death if you let them. Your job is to undermind natural selection and save as many sprites as possible. You do this by killing certain sprites at the right time to cercumvent obsticals and create a path.So, yeah, it's alright. I liked it. it's nifty. fun even. There's just not a lot to say about it.

												Cute modern lemmings with the focus on mobile platforms. 4 possible ""jobs"" that are all irreversible and everything is more or less based on spirits flying around on the level (they float quite nicely if they are not walking). The movement of the air in the level is represented by pixely particles.The music is calm and charming, classical/instrumental, i guess. Visuals are enchanting too.Puzzles get quite challenging after time and surprisingly hard not only to perform, but to solve too. There are some, where you need to assign the job at the precise spot, almost to pixel perfection. There is also the quite tedious part of trying to ""perfect"" every level — that is not just bring the required amount to the exit swirl, but also visit ""plants"" (or pollute in a bomb-dropping fasion from a flying spirit). Of course, they are often placed in surprising places. You can get about 10 of 14 achivements with ""above average"" struggles, but the 100%-ing is almost masochistic.			"

												I think this is the first game I decide to quit playing after only one hour of gameplay.I like puzzle and strategy games, and I understand some of them require randomness, but randomness should make a puzzle challenging, not frustrating. And Lemmings is not a game that needs to be non-deterministic at all.Ok, I want to blow spirits to that platform over there. I don't know where exactly to put my blowing spirit, nor what exact path the flying spirits will follow. That's fine with me. Guesscalculating, trial and error. What's not fine with me is that I finally figure it out and manage to send one spirit to that platform, then two... then the third, from exactly the same place and with the same direction, will hit the platform and fall down. Then some will get it, some will fail. Some will start moving in circles, some will break the loop, and so on...If this is already happening in the easy levels, I'm sorry, but I don't even want to try the difficult ones.			"

												Take Lemmings; throw away half of the colours and most of the tools; add wind and some light effects; lose all the charm in the process - and there you have Spirits. Not a bad game overall, but not really a worthy clone. However, if you're not biased, it's still some fun to play.			"

												I'm giving this a 'thumbs up' because I can't give neutral review on Steam.It's a Lemmings-alike.. It seems to be a decent game, but I have some niggling issues that aren't directly related to game design.I'm sick to death of what seems like every 2D indie game looking like Limbo. I don't see anything about this that makes me think ""this needs to be high-contrast, mostly black and gloomy"". Seems a bit forced and mis-matched.Fixed resolution. WHY? It appears to use vector graphics for much of its designs, and even without that it also seems to be GPU-accellerated! It actually makes it hard to play, because since despite requiring the mouse to pan around the environment (because the resolution of the view window is too small), they don't lock the mouse cursor.Oh, and 4:3 only. That's ludicrous in 2014.I can't judge the gameplay (it seems to work fine) because I don't personally enjoy Lemmings-type games. This is why I wish I could give a neutral review.			"

												At first it seemed pretty nice. Good aesthetics, okay'ish animation but after 10 minutes you realise it's pretty much a clone of lemmings(and sadly it isn't as fun).Spirits offers less, you only have  6 choices and to be fair, they aren't all the same. Like for instance, the first choice is blowing which blows your leafs the way you choose.So the pros:Game looks good, has it's own style and moves.The cons:not really that fun, would recommend just playing lemmings. It's mediocre at best with it's level design and originality.			"

												Unfortunately, I cannot give this game a positive review.I love this type of games, but Spirits is really poorly made in my opinion. It offers little to no story, background music is too repetative and becomes annoying really quickly and the controls, whilst being very simple are flawed. You can never predict where will the guy actually go other than setting its general direction which presents a big problem on the more advanced levels I presume.I haven't played the game for a lot but every minute I did was somewhat painful and I only lasted that long because I wanted to give a better and more detailed review.

												This is one supremely well-designed, crafted and conceived update on Lemmings. Spirits pares down your options to 4 abilities--each of which are directional--and adds the element of ambient wind, which you must skillfully fight, stymie or exploit to rescue yr leafy phantasmagoric lil' dudes. Simple idea-->clean, pretty design.And a pretty damned good balance of puzzle solving and route optimization... refining solutions and climbing the global ranks is gratifying (I'm enjoying it anway). Easier to make real headway on the boards than, say, Super Meat Boy (smaller community, natch). The gameplay is quick and seldom tedious, with just enough of the old ""pixel death"" randomness to keep you on yr toes. All in all, an excellent casual puzzler with hxc score ladders for replay value. Spirits is on the short list of Android games that deserve enthusiastic receptions on PC.			"

												Spirits is a relaxing little puzzle game that's essentially a tribute to the old Lemmings games. You have a bunch of Spirits that you need to guide to an exit using wind currents and the Spirits' little abilities. However, using a Spirit's abilities will also consume it, meaning you need to carefully plan your moves so you don't waste them.Compared to Lemmings there aren't as many abilities for you to use, but this has largley been replaced by the wind physics. Your Spirits float on wind currents and are highly susceptible to even the gentlest breeze. This means that the environment plays a large factor into solving the puzzle. The downside to this is that can be tough to predict how the environment might affect the Spirits movements, so restarting frequently will be neccesary past the first few levels.All around, its pretty good if you're looking for a gentle way to kill time. Each level only takes around 5-10 minutes, but there are well over 40 of them, so you do get your moneys worth. After you're finished each level you can also go after the perfect rating, but this seemed tedious and I never went for it.			"

												It is mixed bag on the one hand it have nice art style and not bad music, mystery and all that but on the other hand you have very imperfect system, two spirits on the same road can end up in different place/ situation. There is not much consistency in the way it all works. sometimes when you dig tunnel down one spirit will go down and other will jump over it, or even when wind blows in one direction one spirit can land on ledge other fall into spikes and so on. Considering this is heart of whole game and something you will do almost all the time I can't recommend this game due this reason. It is source of frustration when you do everything well but some spirits drifted away from main path anyway and you fail level, it happen way to often to be remotely acceptable.			"
