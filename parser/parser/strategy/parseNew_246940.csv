												Buyer Beware! I bought the game during early access, participated in the forums and suggested ways to make the game more thematic. The Devs responded with a ""yea...but"" claiming money and etc as a limitation. What they managed to put together is not a finished product and is by all means an early access build. No polish, no depth or immersion and absolutely no support post release. In recent posts, the Devs cited financial difficulties and made empty promises for upcoming updates. There are NO updates for more than a year now and their website is dead...In the meantime, the game is plagued with the same bugs and CTDs that it had in earlier builds. You want to open trade routes? Crush. You want to play a long game? Crush on random turn and crush again later on. Another Early Access scheme: promising the impossible and blaming bad finances for their complete and utter failure to deliver. An almost formulaic approach to risk-free-failure: promise A, receive payment for A, deliver B with promises of A but without the means of delivering A…Classic bait and switch tactics under the grey area of Early Access.

												The game feels very simple and basic. There is nothing to this game that I wouldnt expect from any other x4 game, and this is still on the light side of 4x games. It does not get very in depth with any game mechanic. Combat is mediocre, Diplomacy is mediocre, research is very limited with a relatively small research tree compared to other more recent 4x games. All in all, the game is just bland and sub par. Honestly, it feels like playing a unity based game in a web browser. I would expect to find similar mechanics and gameplay from a free game site.Its also not stable. When creating a game, picking certain map settings could cause a crash. First battle I lost, caused a crash. Within a period of 30 minutes just to check out the full release version, I had 3 crashes.I really love the sci-fi space based 4x genre, and I wanted this game to be good because there are so few games in this genre that can hold a candle to what MoO2 was for its time. This game does not get close. I would not recommend this game to anyone, not even casual players.			"

												God I want to like this game.MoO2 is in my top 2 games of all time.The problem is that this game is ALPHA.  Not Pre-Release, not Released, not Finished / Supported.So many bugs, so many crashes, I can't load from a savegame, so every game is ""rogue-like"".  Seriously! A Rogue-like 4x game.The Devs have all but left this game.  Even at 75% off, it's just not worth it.  Plenty of 4x games on steam and GOG has MoO 1& 2.Steam should be ashamed to have pulled this out of early release and the publisher should be strung up for asking $5 for this game, let alone $20+.1/10 for potential but worth $2 at most.

												Once upon a time, an intergalactic warlord colonized a planet with their species.  This game is the result.It's not often my lead-ins to my reviews are so short, and it's not often that I review a game prior to spending at least 24 hours in-game with it, but this game isn't one I can recommend, for various reasons.First things first - ""Lords of the Black Sun"" is a space-based 4X game, where you attempt to conquer the universe, Cid Meyer's Civilization-style.  You build installations on planets, create colony ships, build pre-defined military vessels, and can even create custom units.  Units stack, and space battles take place in a sort of Final Fantasy Tactics cut-out battle scene.  All of this sounds like a strategy gamer's dream, so why do I sound so against it?First, the interface is horrible, and I'm not merely talking about the presentation, though that's pretty awful.  The UI isn't optimized for a player's experience; it's hard to see even a neophyte developer looking at the UI and thinking, 'the players are going to love this.'  Most of the menuing takes more actions than is really necessary.Second, the game itself feels utterly soulless.  It feels like someone started by taking a look at Cid Meyer's Alpha Centauri, then proceeded to put it further into space, but instead of hiring a writer, gave it to someone's nephew.  The result is an experience that doesn't capture the wonder of interstellar colonization, or galactic politics, but is rather an experience that it's hard to care about for even a single session.Mechanically, the game is sound - as stated above, it's the sort of thing strategy gamers claim to love and want.  The execution is so terrible, especially given the $30 asking price, which is entirely too much for what you're getting.  Firaxis Games, these guys ain't.PROS:Mechanicallly sound gameGreat space visualsInteresting fleet-to-fleet combatGood custom unit creation system.CONS:Uninspired, forgettable writing and scenarioUgly UI that impedes the playerForgettable musicUnstable game - the end of my expeirence came after the game just crashed for no apparent reason.Way too expensive for what you're actually getting.Verdict: Avoid it.  The developers need to do some serious work on this game and lower the price for this game to be worth it.  If they will do this, I will take a second look and re-evaluate my review.			"

												Put simply, Lords of the Black Sun is a mechanically sound game (i.e. all the pieces, although not flashy, work and serve their purpose) that fails to blend together to create a harmonious whole. The game often feels disjointed, lacks real depth or innovation, and is mediocre even in what it tries to do differently from others (i.e. espionage, empire-wide management).While it might be worth a few hours of gameplay, Lords of the Black Sun lacks the fine detail and substance that make players return to games over and over again. This will likely be played once  by most and then gather proverbial dust in the Steam library, especially fans of the genre who have come to expect much more from 4X titles.Lords of the Black Sun has some positives, but they don’t come close to outweighing the negatives. The limited graphics, lack of flavor (races, diplomacy, planets) and unfinished edges make for an experience I have no interest in repeating again. The current price tag is exorbitant for a game that could easily be mistaken for a title designed for a browser or mobile platform.Definitely not the “epic-sized complex and dense 4X strategy game,” promised.Check out my full review on eXplorminate: http://explorminate4x.com/2015/01/13/lords-of-the-black-sun-review/ "

												If I could refund this game, I would. I watched a review of this game from several months ago, and it looked promising. More than promising actually, it looked like it could be an excellent game that combines many of the aspects that I love. Overall, it appears to be something like Sins of a Solar Empire crossed with Civilization crossed with Democracy. The issue was that it was not a finished game.Jump forward to now, and it is on the front page of Steam, announcing that it is a finished game. FAR FROM IT. I should have looked more at the fine text, but the developer says that even though it is moving out of early access, it stills needs patching. This is evident from the start. The intro splash took quite some time to load, even on a fairly powerful computer and locked my screen to the program until it finished. Typos and grammatical errors are common, even on the first few small text boxes of the tutorial. Additionally, the textures are rediculously poor on higher zoom levels, even on max graphical settings. What sealed the deal for me though was the frequent crashing brought about by this game. Again, though this game has promise, it is not yet ready. I feel as though I was tricked into buy an incomplete game. The saddest part of it is that if this game came out in a ready state, I might have loved it. But my initial play has only served to frusturate me.			"

												Under no circumstances should you buy this game. There are plenty of other 4x space games out there that are a) actually finished, and b) a hundred times better than this game.It is a shame because during early access it did show some promise. But then one day the developer decided it was finished and it went from early access to released. ""Abandoned"" version would be a more accurate term for what we got. There have been no updates for months now, and it doesn't look like we'll get any - indeed at the time of writing this review the website for the company behind the game is no longer there.It would be less of a waste to just burn your money rather than buy this game.

												As of 14 Sept 2014 - This game is not terrible - just very very bland.You will not find anything really new in here - all of it exists in other, better made games such as Distant Worlds or GalCiv2.There are still some major bugs that have not been taken out - I can't even open the trade menu without a crash to desktop.Ship design is weak - from the start, you get 4 hulls that go from tiny to small - with only no improvements available to increase what you can fit in them. The techs for ships don't provide any options - the missiles, beams and lasers are essentially the same. There are no fighters or bases.Tactical fights are available but not terribly exciting - nor does it provide any depth as all weapons are in essence identical.Many of the ""management tools"" are absent or in very basic form - you can't rearrange build queues, set up rally points, understand how much science, industry, or trade any particular action is going to generate. It's weird how you have to close an empire menu before opening the next one rather than switching between them.The tech tree is pretty minimal - maybe 50-60 items in total. It gets boring in the 2nd part where you get solid lines of 3-4 consecutive ""industry +1"" or ""research +1"". It rarely opens up new abilities, just improves your starting ones.Minor races have no interaction, except for pirates. You can send a trade ship there, tho with the game maxing out at 4 trade lines, it's not clear why you should bother.What is working in this game is relatively fine. It just seems like they ran out of time to fine-tune and tweak the content in fun and interesting ways. Perhaps updates wil improve this solid, but it is currently an extremely bland X4 experience.Verdict - unless you are scrapping the bottom of the barrel for x4 games, skip until a few updates. "

Early Access Review
								Star Lords Alpha Build - Pre-release ReviewStar Lords, by Arkavi Studios and Iceberg Interactive is a deep and complex turn based 4x sci-fy strategy game. This is about the only informations you get from the get-go once you boot the game for the first time. Once you start a new game, you will be asked to select from a group of 8 original races and customise the ""game board"".Once the game begins, you'll immediately take control of your chosen race and you can start using your scout ship to explore your surroundings. You also get a home planet, which will be  used as a main hub for initial development.The game leaves a pretty good first impression, with very nice and clean graphical information. The UI is functional and simple, but can become a bit overwhelming for starters, but all in all everything is pretty intuitive. But, being this an alpha build, i must stress the importance of the creation of a structured tutorial, so players can learn and try the base mechanics before being sent into the wild.Once the game starts building up pace, you will meet other civilizations, which you will need to either crush with military prowess or outsmart through diplomacy and espionage. Overall, the AI is pretty solid, even though other races can be tad temperamental towards your actions The game map, even though presented in a very simplistic fashion, works very well and offers a ton of graphical variety. Planets look pretty good, and so does spacial debris and other celestial bodies, such as moons and stars.The game still lacks a bit of clear indicative elements, such as an ""it is now your turn"" prompt, or some audio feedback on research completion but, as it is in alpha, hopefully these elements will be added at some point.Veredict: There is room for a lot of improvement, specially in the fine details, but as this is just an alpha build, i will be eagerly expecting the finished product, and i am glad to be supporting it!

Early Access Review
								I have been playing this game for a while now, it has grown into such a great game. The developers really shine in their skill, communication, and direction. Right now it is like an uncut diamond. You can see the potential in the game, but it might not quite be there yet. If you are looking for a finished or mostly finished game, this is not yet for you. Since I bought the game, it has been drastically improved, both functionally and with new content.For your benefit, here is my take on a few features the game offersMultiplayer Sorry charlie, not yet. If you play the game, you will see why its not ready, the engine is not finished and the balance is a bit off.AI, multiple opponentsThe AI saw some improvements after the game launched to Beta. Now, they attack each other and expand more often. Additionally, every race and pirate uses stronger ship designs and upgrades their fleets as they research new tech. The early game is much more brutal, simply building 10 of the default attack design won't cut it it anymore. You'll find the most challenge in this game playing against Very Hard AI, having Total War selected, and selecting a race with a low likeability.ResearchStandard researching. No real thoughts on this, its nothing to scream about, but its not bad either. To summarize.. Three tech trees, military, economy, science. Military has weapons, ship modules, and fleet and ground attack buffs. Economy has money and diplomacy buffs and a few economic buildings. Science allows you to colonize worse conditioned planets, terraform, buff science production, and has a few buildings.Ship DesignIts a rudimentary system currently, but it has already seen some major improvements. Currently there are 4 hull sizes available from Scout up to Capital. Your different ship parts have weights and can only be placed in certain predetermined spots.Ships and space combatUse shipyard planets to build ships. Then conquer the galaxy. Space combat is psuedo turn based. Each player takes a turn with his whole army and attacker goes first. You can move a ship, then move another ship, then come back to your previous ship and attack with it. I like to move all my stuff then attack with it. There is automatic combat resolving, but like most 4X games you can do much better when you control combat manually.Random Events, Minor Races, Pirates, Espionage, DiplomacyThere is a decent amount of variety but like any game if you play enough you will see it repeat a lot. Someday they are going to add in Race specific story line events, the race backgrounds (detailed in the manual) are quite good, but that story is not yet integrated with the game. The game offers espionage and diplomacy. These features are being worked on and have seen some improvements over the last few months.Game graphics and performanceThe graphics are beautiful. The camera angles are not great yet, but you can see that your able to zoom into fine detail and it still looks good. The developers recently said on the forums that their intention is to make combat more cinematic so it feels more exciting, you can see already that they will be able to pull that offGame soundSome of the sound effects are much louder than others, so occasionally you will jump at some sounds (like a missile exploding or when you deliver any of the speeches). The music is deliciously good in this game, I never noticed it until the Beta launch reset my settings to default.			"

Posted: December 7, 2015
												A very disappointing addition to the 4x Space Strategy game genre. I love the genre, and it seemed to look very nice, but the actual product was not as good as expected from the description, screenshots, and video. It seems to lack polish and actually seems somewhat unfinished, with plenty of bugs and lacklustre dev support.On to the one pro I've found so far for the game... the hex-based, turn-based space combat is actually a quite interesting addition to the 4x space genre, and one that I quite like. Admittedly, it can turn into a bit of a chore once the participants have large fleets, if you can get to that stage... but I do like the idea.However... the game is plagued with a multitude of crashes, which makes any sort of progress, especially in multiplayer, very frustrating. Even when you're lucky enough to not encounter a Crash to Desktop, the gameplay itself is not quite up to scratch. The tech tree and units are somewhat disappointing, and there are many better games out there if you want to customise your own space ships as part of your plans for galactic domination - which brings me to my next point - the galactic maps are pretty sub-par. It doesn't look nice, the travel is boring (there are no restrictions or wormholes or gravity wells or any other mechanic) between systems. There is an arbitrary limit on which systems you can travel though, in an expanding circle, but I have not been able to figure out how that works, but apart from that, you can travel to any system without any changes.And the economic and diplomatic options are both also disappointing. This combos with the 8 ""different races"" you can play as or against - they don't look or feel different, and the bonuses and ""unique generals"" aren't very noticeable. In combination with the lack of options, and a lack of descriptions of the various pre-game setup options... it just doesn't make for a compelling experience.Especially for the asking price, you can do so much better if you are after a 4x space strategy game.

												This is no MOO2 Plain and simple. MOO2 was created in 1996 with limited computer graphics and tech and was a huge success. This game LOTBS has no excuse. There exists now all the computing power and tech available to make anything needed and then some!PROS - Has really nice intro (PROMO) graphics found only on the product page thats totally deceiving, making you think your are really going to buy something special.Oh, and nice borrowed game ideas...CONS - The game crashes all the time. The graphics promised are not there. Mostly made up of place holder graphics. The game play 'depth and complexity' is just not there.This game is no where near being complete. If the team just spent half the time they obviously spent making the trailers, they'd actually have a really good game! This is one example of so many that give struggling developers a bad name. I say finish the product first so you have a really good product to offer then ask the price it is worth (wow new concept). I paid $45 for MOO1 (the original) and $65 for MOO2 and would gladly do it again to keep buggy, unfinished stuff like this off the market! The developers have been at this game since at least mid to late 2014, roughly 6-9 months (or longer)... There are really good games fully and completely (Oh, whats the words? Oh yeah, finished!) out there for less money. This game costs way too much for what is actually offered. I am returning this game for a refund and will not endorse this gaming or the firm any further.PS - In my line of work and in most peoples daily jobs (in which you work hard to earn our money) you must deliver, there is no room for 'just getting by'. And yes there is such a thing as 'stand and deliver'...my advice to the makers, try it...			"

												I am a enthusiastic player of all 4X games, sank lots of hours into the Civ Series, into GalCiv2 and also played Master of Orion 2. And if you expect something of similar quality here, I have to disappoint you:-The Mechanics: One of the Game Defining Mechanics is how the production works. It works on a global level. Meaning each planet generates global production. If you colonize a second planet the production from the main planet will therefore sink as it's not the only ""receiver"" anymore. In addition you speed up the production massively with each factory you build. It's almost like reducing the time by half with each factory, which makes no sense. This way you spent a couple of turns building factories, then you design your combat ship, create a couple of them, and kill one ""very hard"" opponent after the other. Your hardest opponent will be pirates. Balance is completely broken and make all mechanics besides of production and military obsolete. The Global mechanics also kill the feeling of having ""special planets"". Each planet is just contributing a bit to the ""geater good"". But that doesn't feel good.While the game features tactical combat it's not planned out well and as the AI does not focus fire on your ships it will always lose when having troops with even strength.-The Interface: It works. But it isn't good. Instead of mouseover tooltips you have to click on stuff to get the information, right mousebutton is closing windows. The production windows are tiny, creating a minimum of overview. You also cannot re-arrange your production queue or edit your ship-designs.-Stability: The game tends to crash after you solved a combat. Within 90 Minutes of the release version the game crashed twice.-The Music: Is really good, but of course doesn't save the gameConsidering that in terms of balancing and game mechanics I didn't see much of a change since I played one of the first alphas I'd say that the chances of getting fixes in the near future is very low. The game has some potential, but in the current state (Release Version / September 2014) I recommend to not buy this game and take a look at the Galactic Civilization 3 Beta instead.			"

												I got this game Late last year.  I love 4x games of all types but scifi space 4x is my fav.  I was disappointed by this one and after 30 mins put it on the back burner in the hopes that it might get better being early access.  Well a couple days ago a friend said he was looking at it and my instant reaction was to tell him it wasnt worth it.  After that i felt bad cuase i had not loaded it back up since last year so I reinstalled it to give it another go.  Even with the time thats past, I my opinion has not changed.  This is a very cut and paste 4X, I can see that have tried to introduce new aspects to the genre, but they all feel less micromanage ( which i dont mind ) and more gimmicky.  The interface and graphics are alot more dated then they should be.  Now take in mind that you have to judge for yourself and all this is just MHO.  I support indie and early access titles to a fault, and in 6 months or so I will give this title another try and will delete this review if need be, but as of right now I cant recommend this title with so many 4x out there that are older, better, and more deserving of your purchase ATM.  Good luck Star Lords team, I really do wish you all well!Sept 15,This game just released, anyone reading this review please note it was posted in March. 6 Months have past and I dont have the time or desire to rereview, which says something in and of itself but all the same.

I have heard that there is still some development and work still being done on the game, wich I truly hope there is because if this is the final product then this is embarassing; as the game is buggy as all hell.Bugs aside, the gameplay itself is boaring and unispired.  Every aspect of gameplay feels like it was half finished and left in it's most basic form.  Nothing about this game felt good, why did I waste my money?			"

												As things currently stand, the game really doesn't work. Not only does it crash all the time but the interface leaves a great deal to be desired. There is no tooltip so it makes it really hard to understand what is what. The lack of standard designs for ship building make it annoying to have to build your own vessels. Not to mention the fact that the ship builder is a joke really. The items cost way to much and doesn't give you much options on the ship. The lack of a proper informational database means that it is hard to decide what to do and when. Basically the game just needs to be developed further because this is the level I would expect to see in an alpha. Combat is also not very interesting. The AI always moves its ships in max distance so if you go first, you can hang back and wait and open up on them and if they go first, they move in to your operational range but out of firing range allowing you to just go in and shoot first either way. Your military strength also makes no difference in their choice to make war with you. I had more than double the enemies worlds, general and fleet and he goes to war with me. My ships outclass his easily and I just faceroll fleet after fleet. As for construction on a planet, I find it rather intersting. Not really complicated, not really easy but without tooltips and having not memorized the look of buildings means it takes ages to figure it out. Also you don't get to know what the benefit of each building is before construction making it a hard choice in the end.If the game actually finishes I think it would be rather fun but as it currently stands, I would prefer my money back over the game on my list.

												*Sigh*I wanted to play a 4X game with a futuristic space-setting so I tried this.  (Also named ""Starlords""?)This seems like an earlier version of Endless Space without the better graphics and user-friendly interface.I found the ship-design and fleet battles much too simplistic.There also seemed to be a few glitches/bugs when many fleets were given orders at once.Still... I played it twice to get all the achievements and to give it a decent chance before I wrote criticism.(That 15 hours I should have been doing something else...)My opinion: get ENDLESS SPACE instead... a much better game that Lords Of The Black Sun seems to be just a rough, early design of.

												I bought the game in it's early access stage. It wasn't that great at the time, but I had hoped that they'd improve the gameplay and graphics. Boy, was I in for a surprise. The game didn't change much since late early access. It still does crash, although not as frequently as it used to. The game interface could be a lot more useful and informative. It could be prettier while retaining it's functuality. It could be easier to use the various functions especially when you look at the menus like research or espionage, it should be possible to actually understand the different ratings the game has ingame or if they actually have any meaning... It could be so much more and even then it would only be a medicore game, being inferior in every aspect to for example - Endless Space -  "

												Well, I looked for something like MoO2 (yeah, yeah, I know) or Endless Space, at least. What I got? Well, I started my game at Normal difficulty with every single race present. I wanted to fool around, to understand how it all works. And after a couple of turns I realized that a technology victory path is SHORT. Like, real short. I won the game and the only fight I had was when a pirate clan attacked my unarmed scout (BTW, no retreat option).So, I won. But that was a very disappointing victory... in one hour. Including reading the tutorials. Which are done badly, because:a) Font is difficult to read in 1920x1080b) Tutorials are plain text. Short and boring.c) This text is divided to pages and they look ridicuosly in HD: a small chunk of text floating in the middle of 22"" display. Hey, guys! Either make font to correspond with screen resolution, or show all the text at once when resolution allows that.Basically, I don't understand why play this game at all. And I can't say much about gameplay because for me it looked like ""click-click-click - secure technological advance (as always in space 4X) - click-click-click - oops, you won"".Yes, the victory screen is ridiculous too. ""You won! Here is logo of your race. Bye.""So far, my most disappointing Steam purchase. Even considering 50% discount.			"

												seriously? i played 9 hours, and in that time i managed to win multiple games, and doing all achievments...this game claims to be a 4x game, and it might well be, but make no mistake of comparing it to any serious veteran of that genre...  if you are used to games like space empires IV, galactic civilisation III or lo and behold, Master of Orion II, then you will find this a heavily diluted 4x experience indeed....  Minimalistic tech tree, ship building that acutally doesn't deserve being called that (all you get are 4 different hulls you know from the start with a fixed tonnage of stuff you can squeeze in, no chance on improving that in any way...), ""tactical"" combat that is too small and too limited in options (the lackluster techtree might play a part in that as well) without much variety and a relly simple interaction with other races really sum up this game perfectly.... Have a smattering of bugs and exploits on top of that (i still find it ridiculous how you can loan any alien race money, even if they are at war with you, and at like 100% interest...)so, all i can say, if you search for a good 4x game..... keep searching, you won't find that with this title...

Either way, my suggestion would be to run, don't walk, as far away from this... I can't even call it a game, as I've never actually ever even gotten it to start up for me.

												This is basically a typical 4x game with any pretenses of originality or individuality stripped out. There are a small handful of different races, all bog standard, and they all play pretty much the same.Did I mention that it crashes frequently? My played time is much lower than it otherwise would be, as a result. I put a few hours into the game, and I've got a pretty good idea of what it has to offer (Hint: it offers crashes)The game has nothing whatsoever to commend it over any other 4x space game. The intro videos are decent, I guess, but not extraordinary. Unless some serious changes are made, skip this title and find any one of dozens of other, better games of its genre.			"

												As I was one of the many people burned by this game's early access promises, I thought I should join the chorus of voices warning you away. This game is one of the main reasons I no longer participate in early access, and I believe it's also one of the main reasons that Steam now includes a disclaimer about how early access games are not guaranteed to ever be finished. I think it might be libelous if I were to assert that this game is a scam, but I can safely say that it has opened my eyes to how easily a developer could use early access to scam consumers.Pros- If Steam approves my refund request, then I can buy Artemis.Cons- The game is half-finished at best.- There is absolutely no character to the game--it is painfully generic.- Steam will probably not approve my refund request, because I waited too long to file it.Bottom LineIf you like 4x games set in space, you'll love Galactic Civilizations III.

Early Access Review
								So this is an Alpha level release, comments should be constructive or aid in correcting issues, so here it goes.  Ok 13 hours in, the AIs need to be a little more active, (like Endless Space - making offers that make no sense, and attack patterns that are identical - same target, same ships, over and over.  Battle computer is way off on AUTO, it always cost me ships, in manual almost never lost one.  Also, had some lock ups that required restart (battle), trade has some mysteries to it, only managed to get one trade route to work, others just sat there.  Some video artifact in all mosts, black trapezoids related to other races ship travels, present in all three resolutions I tried, worse in lower resolutions.  Its a good start, with some tweaking I think it could be on par with Endless Space which I like for the most part.  Sounds are out of place maybe just not finished yet, way too loud and for some things (research, speeches) then nothing at all where you would like it (invading a planet victory, or someone attacking you) I recommend it based on its potential - I hope it achieves that.

Early Access Review
								This game sounds good, but even in the Early Acess and room to grow - I don't see it compare with the scope it wants to attain.-/- the major races are restrictive, and doesn't include any customization option at the start up.-/+ instead there is a slight reimagining of ""Domestic Polocies"" that can further define and charactarize your empire, you can change them during the game and alter some aspects slightly - but there are pros and cons to them and often a particular race will just prefer a certain setup.-/- the universe is limited, with little options outside colonizing a few planets you can take, and attack or occupy others. There isn't much interaction with the universe as a whole outside it being a static generation from the start. Perhaps I was spoiled with Space Empire's abiolities to drastically reform the universe even while in the game, but here its marginal.-/- even with another strike against it is the ""neutral"" races or ""pirates"" which are just a bit more than just target practice and nuciances occupying a planet you want.-/- the diplomacy feels shallow. I am sorry, its just not as in depth as I have seen others - it can be altered to get there sure, but as it stands I don't see it shifting to that. Many of the diplomacy options require facility constructions that will limit your options on the planets you own, and some options won't happen unless you or the other race have room to invest, further limiting who is really benefitting.-/- the tactical turn based combat is restrictive as hell. You only get to do so much per turn, and each ship is further limited by its loadout. Multiple loadout designs with different weapon types or perks limits the ship's ability to function as you can only do one per turn, making the combat really limited in scope to the design and swarming of a few cheap ship creations of a doubled weapon or three.-/- this further falls under the ship construction as there are limited sizes and options for what can be loaded on which ship. It limits design and role choices heavily.+/- the genreals are a cool idea that develop as you use them, but the risk and reward are staggering comparisions. Due to the combat being so restrictive there isn't much for strategic desings possible and the random generation of the generals is flawed at times - they may have an attack power, but without a type given so it doesn't work. The development of them can be cool, and it directly affects their strengths, however the combat risk can easily leave them out on a limb and you'll loose all your progress.-/+ the unrest aspect is interesting, but difficult to cause and easy to avoid, making it a moot issue that rarely surfaces unless you let or make it.-/+ further deplomacy aspects sound cool as well, but the AI is fineky on its choices making its fulfuilment in many regards challenging, or just a question of finaces. A good economy can basically buy allies in most cases wtih a bit of espionage fixing.-/- the AI cheats. I'm sorry, it does. It doesn't do something its not confident it can win, making it more hesitant and dulling the gameplay. Set up safe enough even with cheap ships and you'll never be threatened as you grow until you amass that army to just wipe everything out.Sounds good, can be interesting - but I've seen other 4x games pull off similarities better, so its not really worth it for most.

												It saddens me to see where the space empire genre is headed. Mass-produced♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sorry but it's all i can honestly say about this one. Even compared to Orion from the 90s, this game is sub-par. The graphics are kindof horrible for a 2010+ game. It's lagging like crap after a few hundred turns in a huge galaxy where i havn't even bothered to explore it all yet. The technology system is weird and confusing, not saying it's hard though, it's extremely simple. But it's illogical, can't say exactly what i mean by that but that's how i feel it.""Ship building"" is rediculous. 4 different hulls, wich you start with btw, having different tonnage, wich i havn't seen a tech that enhances either. Each of these hulls have slots for weapons, engines, defences and a slot for ""army"" or ""colony"" and special features. But i havn't found a way where you can actually fill these up in either class. And the new technologies with better weapons are heavier than the originals making it less likely to fill these spots out fourther on.Solar systems can have planets in them that are not recognized as planets. out of 10 solar systems, all had planets but only 4 of the solar systems actually had registered planets that could be colonized, the rest where just dead textures.All in all it feels like this game is hardly Alpha?

												  The game is similar what I can write on the weekends with my father in law. It is a mix of nice solar system view and text screens from 1995.   Recently, the ship design screen is updated but the style is still still far from the the level of 2014. Colony manager is without depth. Research is simple with limited logic. You can research beam weapon 1 then 2 then 3, etc. Space battle screen is a punishment, you have seen much better decade(s) ago...for example in MOO2. All in all, it does not worth the price of a PC game in 2014. If it would be a mobile phone game for $4 it would.			"

Pretty much all aspects of the game are lacking depth further than the basics needed for a working game. There are some crash issues, but not enough to really dwell on.

												Broken. If this was still beta, I would understand, but it's not. I really wanted and even tried to like this game, a lot. But It is infested with weired bugs that haper and at times, kills the joy this game might have. I did buy this durning the beta phase or something and didn't have high hopes when playing then, but since it release 2 days ago and I figured it was a better game then when I got it.  The game still crashes or the star systems turn white or I am unable to scan planets, thats just a few out a crap ton ( I can go on for a while). I even did a fresh install of the game and even went in to the directory and deleted the files and flolders after the second time. Pretty much this was a big let down. The game in a jist is a basic 4x game with nothing special. The research tree is just your avrage research tree. Kinda like all your other 4x games, nothing. Its the same with doplomacy, ( which can bug out an you can randomly have to pay 8000 credits to pirates on the tenth turn or be killed off.), I don't know how good planet managemnt is because it bugs out and I ether can't see my planets int he panel or it bugs out and crashes the game. It's the same with mangaging trade routes. One thing I will say is kind of special is the espionage and ministers. Tho, you can hire spys, you have to wait for ministers to come alone which can take forever. I never got around to the fleet combat part of the game. The game gets to many bugs going at once that it becomes unplayable before I am ready for any kind of war. I wouldn't really waste any money on this. Dispite looking like a unique good looking game. I feel the devs or whatever just gave up and pubished this as is when they got enough money from it.			"

												I really wanted to recommend this game. I love 4X space games and I was hoping that that alone will overcome all the problems this game might throw at me. Sadly I have to agree with other reviews – this game goes out of its way, to frustrate you, ruining any possible fun.I guess I’m lucky in the fact that I got it on a huge discount (the only option I would recommend anyone getting this)I don’t recommend playing this game on bigger size of galaxy when vs AI – the map is big enough anyway and tbh size differences in the galaxy settings are very small increments. The only reason I’d choose the bigger galaxy sizes is if I have all 8 factions in play, and most crucially playing it in multiplayer. The distance between systems vs the speed of the ships is really far and AI has an awful tendency to snatch the best planets from under your nose making all the empire borders look as a checkered patchwork of planets on the bigger maps.Good:+ Has multiplayer (every 4X tbs should imo) including LAN+ You can scan planets to find out their bonuses (but this at times feels like a waste of time)+ During exploration you find special debris that works as a special encounter+ You can give speeches for glory-hole points+ The type of government your empire has depends on your policies+ I like the in-game music+ You can do diplomacy with pirate clans - even use them to harass your enemies (AI factions will make sure they harass you anyway)+ Different factions to play (8 total) – tech tree and buildings seem identical while govt type, faction bonuses, preferred planets and ship models differ+ Trading cards+ Diplomacy+ Trade routes+ Random events+ Turn based battles on hex battlefieldBad:- Multiplayer is human only. The game won’t let you add AI factions to play with you and your friends when you play multiplayer- Only two types (shapes) of galaxy to choose from disc or circle- Four main galaxy ambient backgrounds, nice bluish ones or an ugly muddy mustard ones- Reloading saved games is very bugged often creating weird things and most importantly – loading the next turn instead the one you saved the game at.- No sound in intro movies for me (have to watch them straight from the game folder in explorer to just get the vibe)- Alt-tab doesn’t work- No schematic view for ship designs you’ve already created makes it hard to remember what design had what module- Cycling between planets is bugged, if you go left then right… it will take you to the wrong planet, so basically you can cycle them just one way at a time- Game does feel empty at times, so I recommend you play it with good buddies to actually make up for less actual contentUgly:- AI cheats, especially during colonization phase. AI factions have colony ships spawn out of nowhere right next to the planet you were on the way to colonize flying there over 10 turns. And in fact, if you load a save 3 turns earlier or so, their colony ship might spawn even sooner and it’s kind of like random which AI faction will it be, including those far far away from the colony you’re aiming for- AI cheats and gets at least 8 warships at the start of the game when they couldn’t possibly make them so fast (every AI faction gets it, not just the more industrious ones)- When you load the game your ships will all be crippled to 5AU speed instead of full speed, which further compounds the planet stealing by AI or outmaneuvering you since you won’t even be able to reach the target planet even if you adjust your planning with reloading the save- You can put more than 1 type of weapon on a ship design, but during a battle you can shoot only 1 weapon type at once per ship, while in practice this might make sense for you to say use missiles if enemy is away then beam/plasma when close, in practice you start the battle very close so firing long range loses the benefit and the limited number of hulls available in the game (4) makes it practically pointless to mix weapon types- There’s no experience on the ships, so fighting AI (pirates or other factions) is a chore, even on easy difficulty because they keep getting tons of new ships out of nowhere, while you need to keep sending your own at them over and over eventually running out of cash unless you have a very strong economy already. The good thing is that other than pirates AI factions tend to be rather peaceful so I’m not saying it’s impossible to beat them, it’s just far more frustrating and time consuming experience you would wantThe game also has a “total war” option which puts all AI factions at war with each other since the beginning of the game, which theoretically might be better (haven’t tried it myself) but I worry it might make things worse and with the level of AI cheating they would simply all gang up on you from the start which is not fun at all.I must be the lucky one because so far the game hasn’t crashed for me even once.Bottom line is, it’s an overpriced, often frustrating 4X game with bluntly cheating AI. I still probably recommend it if you want to play it in multiplayer (just remember, no AI factions in multi) but mostly because I love space 4X games so that is my bias.			"

												This game looked very promising and I had my hopes up that it would get to the point of being a true 4x strat game.  Well it never got there, it looks nice but the gameplay is totally bland and has nothing unique about it.  It portrays itself as ""epic, complex, and dense"" but I would have to say its 100% the opposite; mediocre, simple and  shallow.  On a positive note, if you have children that are under 10 and you are trying to teach them about 4x strategy, this game is a very good training game for them...if it can hold there attention.			"

												Guys dont waste your money. The game has so much potential but Devs are not supporting it as they said they facing bankruptcy and have to focus on a new project, which to me is just stupid. They leave all the people who paid for this game in the lurch to start a new game. Whats to say that one wont sell either and the people who buy that one wont be left in the lurch. I for one wont buy any more of their products as they have a bad track record now.The game crashes all the time and I was so looking forward to it when it first came onto steam. What a big dissapointment. If I could get a refund I would.			"

												Another short review to hopefully save a few dollars. This game is really very basic and poorly executed. Many other grand scale space games to be had and this is not one of them. Move along folks. Nothing to see here. When trying to even play the game for achievements I would get random crashes well after release.			"

												UPDATE: Nothing new actually. Just want you all to know that Valve are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥for protecting the developers of this CRAP. Even now they refuse to refund for OBVIOUS reasons. VALVE GLADLY FREAKING PROMOTED THIS GAME ON THE FIRST PAGE 2 YEARS AGO.This game had another name before they changed it, and it sounded good. They promised a lot for a space 4x strategy game. Early access artwork (not gameplay footage) looked promising. They promised a lot of things. For 28€.What you got from it.. A dead piece of *******. The game isn't complete, it's not even beta but they slapped the ""finished"" sticker on it and ran with money from god knows how many people. Steam did nothing, they don't offer refund for the obvious robbery. They won't even punish the developers. Heck, they're probably gonna slapstick their next work on the featured page again, only for us to get same cr*p again.Stay away from this. Stay far away.I want my 28€ back.			"

Posted: September 15, 2014
												This game is not bad, just mediocre. It is unpolished, but not bad looking. It is a 4x space game, but without the depth. I'll break it down.The good: - Loads at the beginning but minimal loading afterwards.- Graphics are crisp but still run on older hardware decently.- Not overly complex (If you're not looking for complex).- Accessible for players newer to 4X games.The bad:- Grammatical errors to the point where I noticed and it bothered me enough to mention.- Underwhelming UI.- Combat is boring.- Research is boring.- Production is boring.- Bland AI and diplomacy.- Economy that lacks balance. (Or I need a better tutorial for it)- Too easy for expereinced players.- Speech system is unbalanced.I might not have played it enough to see the depth here, but the economy seems to be very simple and not very easy to deal with. If you get it going early and get lucky with the random exploration treasures (and not just have your scout destroyed without a fight) then you can be dominant pretty quickly. If you get set back by a random event (which rarely cost less than 1000 BC) or hit up for protection money too often there's not much you can do to come back. If you lose a planet and suddenly have -12 BC per turn and only around 120 BC in the bank you have literally nothing you can do to come back aside from hoping that you have enough Glory to give the +5000 BC speech. Oh and you earn that glory by winning battles, so if you're behind in military now good luck getting there on that one. The speech system overall seems to just be covering for sloppy design OR this game is specifically trying to be a short playing 4X game, which is kind of a weird concept to me. Case in point. In my last game before I wrote this, I was dominating the galaxy for most of the game with diplomacy and science before a few bad events and one AI deciding to finally attack me left me with only 1 planet left (not my homeworld). So I just pulled up the tech tree and selected the ""You win"" tech (which always seemed to take 28 turns to complete no matter how much science I had) and hit the ""Your current research finishes next turn"" speech to instant win even though I was clearly outmatched otherwise. I did not feel like I was snatching victory from the jaws of defeat, I just felt like I cheated better than the dumb AI did. Also, you need to have an ""Army ship"" stationed at a planet in order for it to be defended at all when attacked, otherwise they just stroll in and take the planet without a fight. This is a conscious design decision I'm sure, but it's not one that I find fun.I do not recommend this game over other games in the genre. It's not a strictly bad game, and I'm glad developers and publishers are coming out with more games of this type. This one is just not for me.			"

I've owned this game since before they changed the name from Star Lords, and I have played countless hours of it (My steam history is off because I play in offline mode due to the fact that I have limited bandwidth and try to save it). Sadly, no patch has fixed this problem, but I will change my recommendation if they do, because I really enjoy playing this when it works.			"

												I have tried this game a few times but never get beyong a point when it just closes and crashes. In a way it would be better if this just crashed straight away but annoyingly it crashes just after it has started to get interesting. Normally you have met at least one other civilisation, usually more, and you have colonised a number of planets and it just shuts down for no reason. I have not noticed any particular trigger it just randomly stops. That is a shame as might have been a good game but no game can be good if it does not work properly.			"

Early Access Review
								I dont recomend playing this game unless micro-management of a few dozen things at once sounds like a great time to you. The first time I played I loaded up on as many AI opponents as I could and a huge galaxy. I made one attack on a pirate faction and then every race hated me and started going to war with me. I was also experiencing some learning curve set-backs, so I quit out of that game and started a new one. Round 2 I went with just 2 alien AI opponents, in a small galaxy, and tried just making nice with them. We claimed our planets, established trade routes, built stuff.... 5 hours later nothing had happened. I was basically just making the same colony ships over and over, going to new planets, building the same buildings... My population was happy, my enemies were all happy, I had more money than I knew what to do with. The game kind of just devolved into a management of the empires finances and construction. This game is really lacking from random events that spice up your experience. They attempted by puting in 'disasters' which is basically just a simple: 'pay money and keep people happy' or 'Tell your people you wont help them and♥♥♥♥♥♥everyone off'. Its a pretty shallow wildcard system. The interface is clean, but is also very lacking. For example, when looking at what buildings are on a planet, only the 'build menu' has the names of the buildings and what they do. The buildings you already have in place do not have names, and you cannot click on them to see if they are being effective in any way. So you have to do a cross reference on what the buildings look like to even know what you have built... And on the subject of building, its super boring. I'm sure I would eventually get to more advanced structures down the tech tree, but in the 5-8 hours I played Puting the same combination of 5-10 buildings on 20 different planets was about as much fun as organizing a deck of cards. Also it seems when you do unlock better versions of buildings, you need to go BACK to all of those planets, destroy a building, and put in the upgrade. Its not automatic. So when you are 20 hours down the line in this game and you wonder why every race has a better economy than you, it might be because you forgot to upgrade 5 of your 40 planets to better factories... better go check them all... one... by... one.... While I cant recomend this game I hope that the developers learn from this one and make a sequel with the holes filled in. It's a great idea, It just relies WAY too much on the player to micro manage all of their systems.			"

I think more variety is better, and want to see motivated people succeed.This game, however, is kinda awful. There are a large number of spelling and grammar errors. In the intro movie for humans, I learned that ""Humanity's fate was doomed"". It wasn't that humanity was doomed, but that their *fate* was doomed.The in-game menus are extremely basic. Build queues for planets cannot be reordered. And the game crashes. Often.I *want* to like this game, but it's clearly still an early beta version. $30? Not worth $5.			"

Instead the next unit you select fires their weapons.Just goofy, unrefined and buggy.Cannot bind hotkeys.  Options are extremely limited.Tech Tree is small and somehwat linear.You can design ships that fight, or ships that have utility.  But you can't can design a good ship that has both.  It requires you to design lots of uni-tasker ships.  Repair ship.  Colony ship.  Army ship.Oh and... firing weapons in combat, you can only shoot one type of weapon.  So equiping missiles, laser and plasma weapons all on the same ship is useless.  You can only shoot 1 class of weapons per turn.Just goofy crap.Disappointing.The AI opponents are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  I had one battle with an AI and he offered me a truce with a huge cash bounty. "

The game is still littered with as many bugs as it started out with. The game frequently crashes, freezes, ect, and the combat/invasion system is horribly broken and bugged. The overall gameplay is very enjoyable, until you get screwed over by broken code, crashes, and bugs. I would've thought the bugs would of been sorted out after a year of devolpment. The development team is horrible as well. Last update was July 10th, it is August 31st, game is still littered with bugs. Complete waste of money for 25 dollars. IMO if the devolpers don't update the game in a while it should be removed from the Steam Store, as it is littered with bugs and nearly unbeatable. The devs just are racking up money on their broken, bugged game.			"

La diplomatie est elle aussi très limité tout comme le sont les batailles. C'est dommage parce que j'avais vraiment envie d'aimer ce jeu étant un gros fan de 4x spatiaux mais là rien à faire ça ne prend pas... graphiquement c'est pas dégueulasse, sans toutefois émerveiller la rétine... disons que c'est honnête.En fait on dirait une sorte de 4X allégé, on y trouve en effet tout ce qu'on est en droit d'attendre d'un 4X mais avec un réel manque de profondeur dans tous les domaines. De plus on se lasse très vite, c'est lent, c'est mou... (même pour un jeu en tour par tour)... non vraiment je ne peux pas le conseiller, surtout à ce prix alors que vous pouvez acheter Endless Space pour à peine plus cher ou encore Star Ruler 2 (qui bien qu'encore en Accés anticipé propose largement plus de contenu et d'intérêt) pour un peu moins cher.+: Relativement beau-: Lent-: Ennuyeux-: Manque de profondeur-: Cher pour ce que c'est			"

Early Access Review
								This game was a bit weird when I first started playing it, and there are some issues with overly long build times that break the sense of a dynamic economic structure and civilization. There are also issues with colony building, wherein buildings would take forever to build, due to the planet's low level of development, even given that these were basic structures designed to boost development and production rates, causing a reciporicating cycle of being unable to have more productive planets, but being tied up in the process of making them more productive, whilst trying to build other things, which interrupts development. This said, the game has a lot of depth, even in early access, and seems to have very good custimization options. Also, the research tree looks good, from what little gameplay I've experienced, though it could be expanded, as it is relatively short. All of these flaws are easily fixable in development, and seeing as this is early access, I'm confident the necessary improvements will be made. All in all, it is a promising, if currently immature title which deserves your consideration, especially given the reasonable price.			"

								Total (and poor) rip-off of Galactic Civilizations II.  Almost every aspect of the game is directly lifted out of GCII.  I'm shocked this game was published without a flurry of copyright infringement lawsuits resulting.Also, boring.  GCII is a far superior play experience, and it's very old - this game is still in Alpha/Beta and it's trying to catch up to a game written several years ago.I won't be wasting any more time on this one.

Though still needing a lot of touching up and revision before being released as a full game, Star Lords has definitely made significant improvements from its original alpha version. The frequent crashes and errors that plagued previous games have nearly vanished, and I am finally getting to be able to finish a game without a single crash. With a little improvement, this game could possibly be the next big thing in 4X gaming.			"

												I changed my mind about this game after playing it further.  I do recommend it.  I think it is the best of the ""Conquer the galaxy games"" created in recent years.  I encountered a bug - when you have one fleet over an enemy planet and try to join another fleet to it the game crashes which caused me not to recommend it at first.  I had a few other crashes in combat and once just generating a new turn.  I played it alot of hours over the past few days and found the game very stable. Just save often in case something happens. (Does have an autosave feature).  I love the interface, the simplicity of the game system, and the combat system.  The research tree has many techs to research.  I look forward to many more entertaining hours playing this game.			"

												I have been playing this game alot the last couple of days. It reminds me of the game ""Supremacy"" on the amiga, but is more complicated without being hard to control. There's a deep diplomacy-engine implemented in the game which you can use to control the strong opponements (if you have the cash and a good reputation) like you do in ""Civilization"". Theres allso a research-tree that you can discover to unlock better knowledge of collonization-methods,improvements to your spaceships,trading etc.The combat in the game is challenging and reminds me of Chess and stratego. You can design your own ship types, including tradeships, collonization-ships, armyships to invade other planets, fighterships and capital ships.Unfortunately the game has a tendency to crash, but the developers are dedicated and are releasing patches and are constantly improving on the game.All in all I can recommend the game if you like this genre, just remember to save you game as you progress.

Early Access Review
								This game has a real bright future, for a number of reasons too.When you begin playing the gmae, you are presented with a beatiful represenation of the galaxy you have chosen (You can customize this galaxy in certain ways as well) and as you venture further into creating the strongest galactic empire possible, you begin to see the possibilities that could be implemented, knowing that this is currently early access. The game really draws you in and you start to wonder which way you want your empire to go, and the game gives you many ways to go. It does this through their social policy system, where you are presented with different social policies and how your citizens feel about them.  These attitudes will change over time and you will have to decide whether to legalize slavery or keep it banned (for example). The game also has a unique addition that really allows you to decide the , lets say attitude, of your empire and it is ship design. At the start, you have 3 pre-set ships, scout, colony ship and army ship. The army ship is only transport, so the game urges you to create your own battleship and in the process, you start planning your own ships. For example, after researching intergalactic trade, you will need to create a tradeship, so you would need to add a trading module and an engine, but you then need to decide whether armour or weapons would serve more of a purpose, as the trade modul weighs  a good 30 tonnes. This is just one example of the many aspects that makes Lords of the Black Sun a brilliant game with a bright future. I would strongly recommend this game.			"

								It's very similar to Endless Space, except it has one thing ES doesn't: a good combat game. I got $5 off the game by buying it from Gamefly, and I have to say that it's worth it even if I had to pay $19.99. If you liked Endless Space but hated the combat part of the game (one of the biggest gripes from everyone who loved the game but hated the combat), then you will like this a lot. The over all look and feel of the game has some Star Ruler and StarDrive aspects, but only the good parts. I liked StarDrive, but I didn't care for the RTS (aka its real time and not turned based), I have always prefered turned-based space empire style games. Some prefer RTS-style, which is fine, but if your looking for that, you won't find it here. But if your fine with turned-based, then this is the game for you. This game has a lot of promise, and you can see by my history that I don't post many reviews/thoughts on games unless I am very sure of my opinion.ps, I hope we see a Linux version, I would kill a room full of puppies if we see one :) "

But unlike Endless space the turn based space combat is nice but i think there should be more of a tactical application to increases in speed. perhaps more special abilitys would be good. maybe a particular weapon could hit two or three hexes etc etc. All in all i recommend just to support them so they progress and get this game really off the ground.

								Alpha 18After nearly 5 hours or so in, the game crashed. Turn 550-560 I think. The gameplay is ok, but the AI isn't the most clever opponent I've seen. There is some grammar errors in the game, like minor ones but you'll notice them when you talk out loud. The crash I had was when I tried to move some ships that I sent to attack a planet, after the reload I lost 90% of my solar systems (although save file were 7 minutes before crash), remaining solar systems were the starting spot and last conquered. And no army to fight, no explored regions anymore etc.Other than that, I had over 550 turns of decent fun, battled for my home planet several times - lost it once, but there is room for improvement on the combat side of things. And strangely enough, I got a huge boost in Industry, like +1 industry gave me up to 70+, so either I dont know how the game works, or it's a bug.I do however recommend the game for it's turn-based sci-fi setup.

												This game crashed far too often for me, making completion of a single game impossible.What gameplay I did experience was unpolished and monotenous. The combat is poorly thought out and extremely unbalanced.I can't believe I just paid $30 for this.			"

												This game is for genre fans only. It is not as terrible as it is made out to be. The music is really good and the game is interesting but a little clunky. There are some annoying bugs (Pirates attack you but you can't retaliate it you have a peace / submission treaty with them) but it is stable.I can't see myself spending hundreds of hours in this one. I think this will be a once in a blue moon game to keep things interesting. I got it on sale for £5 quid. It's decent value at that price.			"

												Soooo, Lords of the Black Sun. I was remotely involved with some part of this game (localization) and was somewhat looking forward to it, but I feared the worst. I won't call this game a really bad game, and I have only played about 1 hour, but this is what I think nevertheless:I have played Galactic Civ 2, Endless Space and others. I found none of them extremely satisfying and perfect. Good games in some areas, lacking in others. Lords of the Black Sun I think is not doing anything better than those games and that in my eyes makes it an immediate failure.The empire management is tread of the mill. Manage gold, health, reputation blabla. Low health on a planet? Build a health center, build a police station vs crime. Build a factory to produce faster, build a tech lab to research faster, build colony ships, colonize planets, rinse & repeat the same meaningless ""choices""...You have a few building slots, but if you can only choose between 5 or 6 buildings, all of which fulfill exactly one role, this is pretty boring. Economy: Visit planets and establish trade routes...yea. There are some interesting concepts like immigration and laws you can establish, but again, those seem shallow I'm afraid...90% of the population want free speech, better give it to them before they rebel and take away your planet.The map and moving units is ok I guess, but you get easily lost, because at max zoom icons are no longer displayed. Graphics are neither very pretty nor extremely bad for such a game. Ship models look like♥♥♥♥♥♥on the galaxy map though.Diplomacy? Nothing new here, either. 10 minutes after meeting the first race they already demand a fifth or your total gold in tribute...cmon that is the easy AI. I already loathed that in Civ games.You can also hire ministers and generals...ok. Those cost money and improve your empire in one way or the other...oookShip design...design...yea. You seem to have 4 different hulls at your disposal from the very beginning. The game wouldn't bother telling you that unless you click on the ship design icon (otherwise you only have a scout, an army ship and a colony ship). You can then proceed to build a light, medium, heavy or capital hull. The stronger hulls can of course take more punishment. You can then outfit those hulls with meaningless weapons (beam, plasma and missiles) as well as an engine, some armor and shields and 1 module. Your capital ship has 1 engine, 1 module, 2 armor and 4 weapon slots. No way to customize those slots I think? It does not matter where I would put my weapons, only the range and damage are affected by the weapon type, so generally build lots of ships with rockets and position your heavies with lots of armor and beam or plasma before them...research stronger weapons, replace them...nooooooo cmooooon. That is so boring. ""Oh, I now have plasma weapons II...yay"". Time to replace all my ship designs with the new weapons (I think, otherwise why would there be obsolete designs?). Research is a chore. My 2nd tier research already took 50 months (Maybe I wasn't building enough colony ships and research centers, but on the other hand you are not supposed to colonize at will, because it will stretch your resources and your defensive capabilities thin, and because colonization is boring. The research trees are pretty linear and nothing interesting either. They don't offer much, but every tier takes long to research. You have the usual stuff in there. There are barely any options in the game at all, which is another gripe of mine. Also the fonts are ♥♥♥♥ing small in 1920x1080 and you apparently can't make them bigger.So, you basically build meaningless buildings, meaningless ships and research meaningless things and then you have your scout fly through a meaningless universe that looks all so very tidy and you discover your AI partners and yadda yadda yadda. In the one hour I was able to play this game all I did was basically ""End turn"", because there is just nothing meaningful to do. Maybe later on you will have to micro manage more, but it just all seems so generic and bland.Last bit, combat: Who the ♥♥♥♥ thought of that? It is a hex and turn based combat system with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics and animations and no great depth to it either. It's playing Heroes of Might and Magic in space with only a hand ful of units. And there is just no weight behind the combat. You fire a beam weapon and you barely register it. Missiles have at least a little bit of impact, but with only 3 different weapon types (all available from the beginning), this is bound to get boring after 2-3 battles.I know I should have played longer to offer a good review, so please don't take my word for it, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. It all seemed so pointless :( Endless space (despite the silly auto combat) and Galactic Civ seem way better than this, so why bother? Also, the game has like 15 achievements and I unlocked half of them within 1 hour. Is this maybe indicative of the game content? There is only Single Player and Multi Player, no scenarios, no campaign apparently. I just cannot recommend it.			"

												Lords of the Black Sun is a 4x turn-based strategy game by Arkavi Studios. Originally named Star Lords, the game is based in space, but not in any star system in particular, as they are randomly generated based on options chosen during game setup. The ultimate goal is up to you – you can win through domination, research, or an allied victory (if your ally meets one of the other victory types).If you care to see my opinion check out my full review below. This is a very fun, yet more on the simplistic side, strategy game!http://brutalgamer.com/2014/12/09/lordsoftheblacksun/ "

Game overall was simple, I think that the issue, it was too simple and lacklustre, didn't bring anything new to space 4x genre. Endless Space of last year was far superior with innovative gameplay, storyline and the only thing bad are the combats (which play out like scissor-paper-stone) and the expensive add-on.			"

								This game is awful.  It's a rehash of Starships Unlimited Divided Galaxies by Matrix Games.  That game was produced in 2004 and if anything Star Lords is actually even worse, even when it did work.  It's super slow and has tons of glitches, plus game is very simple (granted original was pretty simple too).  I feel like I was robbed.  Game is really bad, not worth $20 for sure, probably not worth $5 in present condition, if some improvements were made and all glitches fixed it might be worth about $10.  Very annoying, to start a game and have it crash because Windows encounters a problem with it and that happened a lot with this game.  It loads random stuff even if you don't start a new game, just any game... not sure why it does that.  It glitches bad on your economy a lot.  In one game I had saved with an income around 500 BC/month and came back and had -650 BC/month on same game =(.  The premise of the game is kind of fun, albeit it simple, but I recommend not buying or looking for Starships Unlimited (if you can find).  My two cents... about what the game is worth (in present condition)!			"

								I purchased this game a few hours ago and have not been able to even start the game. I have tried everything i can think of to include but not limited to: running in admin mode, running from the root file bypassing the shortcut, checking the file integrity, rebooting pc multiple times, rebooting steam multiple times, and now i still cant play the game. I would say if this is the current build do not waste your money on a game that will not start. Maybe it is just me but i dont see how i blow the specs away tenfold unless there is some secret way to get it to work nobody told me about. And also they have a website with a forum that is down if you try to go to the forum it takes you to the web hosting site, maybe someone forgot to pay the bill?To the makers of Star Lords if you have the brass to respond i would like a reason or explination as to why it wont work. Yet i dont expect one and will promptly be seeking a refund with steam so say goodbye to the money you would have made from me and if steam will not give me back the money i will just cancel my card for fraud. Buyer beware-alpha 14 wow tons of new content and fixed crases and bugs. Well they didnt fix the windows vista bug that has been known about since long before it came to steam. But starlords doesnt mention that on their steam page that this game will not run on vista period. its something that goes way back in their bugs/crashes forum			"

								A year or so ago I bought into the game and was pretty impressed  by it but then there was an issue between the developer and the publisher that seemed to all but kill the game.  Today I get an email with a Steam code and voila, its star lords. Can't wait to start playing it.  And congrats on finally coming to market with it. :D  Full review coming:			"

								Normaly i am a fan of this can of game but this one should be only recommanded for people who like very old fashion game. they alredy do better in my old Amiga in 1995. It is too expensiveand really boring. Interface are are not user friendly and you need to click to many time in end turn to have a action. Last but not least there is no story , the battle are turn by turn .Don't buy for more than 10 euro !!!!!!!!!			"

												Well if I could rebuy this game or pay the machanic to replace my headlight fluid I would probably go with the headlight fluid. The game is as everyone else say bland. The Graphics are unappealing the universe seems to be on this wierd grid like system the music is not enough to keep you into it but it is pretty nice The tech HAHAHA what an excuse it is like they spent no time in it. The game comes off too unappealing for me to even get past 15 turns without forcing myself and then it crashes for some reason. Oh the story they put in for the factions make no sense: The Terrain race was once of earth then becuase of certain events they left and went to a new universe where they buiilt a thriving civilization and then the game starts and your very advance human race that has been on the planet for years now doesn't even have a factory or police station or research lab OR a medical lab all you have is a shipyard WHAT!!! I didn't even bother with the other race backrounds. The ship system is just ew you get this top down look on 2D blueprints. I have to say this game has no direction and that is the problem everything in this game is just as normal as everything in every other space strat game but lacks a strong point like an impressive politcal system or ship system or combat system or some awesome AI but nope they didn't focus on a story or anything special it is a copy paste game in my opinion and I would like my money back. If you are looking for a good Space strat by Iceberg they have Endless space which is way more appealing than this			"

												Everyone has that Early Access game that they purchased that taught them: a) to read the reviews, b) wait a little bit to see how the game progresses before purchasing, and c) that Steam's refund policy for Early Access fraud is terrible. For me, this was that game.This is simply a terrible game. It had promise when it first came up on Steam, which is why I purchased it. However, those of us who purchased it must move on and accept that we have been had. I'm not here to rant and rave and thankfully I bought it on a steep sale (I feel terrible for those who paid full price). However, for those of you who have not made this mistake yet, please do not get this game. Besides the fact there are much better games out there, this one doesn't even work. I have yet to be able to play a game more than an hour in without a CTD. After several attempts, the last being today (after not trying for nearly a year), I can say with certainty I never will.To Arkavari Studios: while I understand making video games is not as cheap as you thought it would be, please do not blame your terrible foresight and budgeting as an act of God or something that wasn't your fault. I won't make petty insults and such, but if you decide to try and make another game, please learn a lesson on how to manage your company. It is quite clear that the issue here was that, while you had a vision for your game, you do not have a vision for business.			"
