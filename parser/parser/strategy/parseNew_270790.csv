												Video Review:


YouTube™ Video: Ehterlords 2 Review 

			Views: 6,435		

			I review the collectible card video game, Etherlords 2 released on Steam on 02/14/14. Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/270790/?snr=1_230_233__201_4 Website:...		

Etherlords 2 is a collectible card game very similar to Magic: The Gathering.  The player collects cards to build a deck of spells and creatures.  When you approach enemies on the world map you have the opportunity to fight them.  This is where the actual card game starts.  The player takes turn with the enemy casting spells and attacking.  Victory is achieved by killing the opponent.  The card game is surprisingly complex and it feels rewarding when your deck works.  In addition your character levels up and can choose perks that will influence your strategy.  If you enjoy these types of table top games you will probably have fun with Etherlords 2.  The problem is...everything else outside the card game. The voice acting is sub par and the movement/animations on the world map are jerky and frustrating.  There is no camera angle that let's you properly see where you're going and there are no resolution options that I could fine.  I rushed thought the poor dialog and map navigation as fast as possible so I could get back to actually playing the card game.    If you like card games then I will grudgingly recommend Etherlords 2 because it can be quite fun, but everything else almost spoils the game.			"

												Unpolished, gritty interface, rigid UI, oldFeels like trying to drive a really old, beaten up hillbilly pick-up truck, with mud perma caked on the sides, half painted, half raw rusted steel, steering from U.K. or america, depending on whatever country you aren't from, with a cracked windshield, and i mean cracked.  No power steering.Funnily enough, extremely fun.  Sadly, far too short.  Something very essential is missing to make this game work, becuase it has soemthing that no other game has out there, a perfect mix of card game, and grid turn based strategy.  so many games out there have tried, and failed.  Simply because they got the basics wrong, this one, I am amazed to say, as bad as it is---got the basics right.Just a shame that's about all it got right, recomended purely for strategy enthusiasts, or developers that want some inspiration.

												Creativity 10Music 8Story 8Graphics 5Mechanics 9Its an amazing story and great mechanics but the thing I loved most was the monsters. There were so many unique monsters in it. Where as so many games apply NO creativity at all and just throw in generic monsters, Like spiders, skeletons, werewolves, zombies, orcs, elves and demons, this game steps away from that. It makes its own unique races, creatures and characters. Also it avoids the classic elements of fire vs water earth vs air and so on. It has good enviroments and music. The game may not have the most current graphics but there is a charm to older figure style games. the mechanics are very intricate too. they arnt built around this race beats this one, or these spells beat this, its all about strategy. One build could get wrecked by a lower level wild monster, but trumph a boss. It even has a button that makes it so the game plays for you so you can take a look at its sweet beastiary and magic. I wish there were more games out there like this. A good game isnt something that blows your mind with its rendering or models, its one that keeps you entertained and interested.			"

For hardcore fans of Magic: The Gathering or similar card games, Etherlords II is a must-play as there are decidedly few original games like it ten years on from its initial release.Etherlords II is a meaty card battling adventure game with five lengthy campaigns to play through, each featuring its own unique mix of cards to collect and enemies to fight.This is a tough game to beat too and the later levels will require you to leverage every advantage you can in order to win. For those that are not so comfortable with excessive terminology and tactics however, the easy mode still makes for a fun experience.Whereas the first Etherlords was an interesting proof of concept only, Etherlords II is the inevitable expansion of that idea and one that works a whole lot better.It’s a solid game, one saved by a remarkably diverse battle system and a dizzying array of fun strategies and deckbuilding potential.

												This is one of my all time favourite card games. Despite its age, it holds up remarkably well thanks to solid gameplay mechanics, and the graphics come from an era of 3D where their aging looks don't count against the game at all. The story and voice acting are fun, with the game giving you access to a bunch of different tactics and gimmicks you can play in your decks. All kinds of synergies and cool strategies for you to discover and come up with. The game is constantly challenging you as well, setting you up against very specifically designed decks, leaving you to figure out how to make decks of your own that counter them. I can easily recommend this game to any fan of card games.			"

												It might look a bit dated, but it's still great fun! Much akin to Magic The Gathering, but with a kinder learning curve, an RPG element and exploration! When you start off you don't have that many spells, but as you progress and defeat more enemies your available spell collection grows. Really great fun! highly recommendedPersonal Rating: Worth the price and a great game to boot!Score Rating: 80% - good fun at a great price!			"

												Do you know anything about Heartstone? Is it that it's kind of a ripoff of Magic The Gathering? Well, Blizzard were not the first ones to rip those damn cards. Etherlords did it first, and I personally think this game still holds up to Heartstone, if what you're looking is a singleplayer experience. As usual I'll start talking about the things the game doesn't do right:The game has a story on it, a story that seems somewhat deep for a card-based game... However, it never got hooked to it. Seriously, it's quite boring. It also doesn't help the story that most characters have less than average voice-acting to them.Another issue I have with it is the difficulty. Most of the enemies in the game are okay, offer a good challenge, and being defeated usually means that you should look at your deck and change your cards, as there's probably a better way to deal with this sh#t. However, one of the races on the game seems to have some balance issues: the Pale race. These guys don't f#ck arround. Some of their monsters are hilariously broken, as they're insultingly hard to kill (they usually just go hollow when you kill them, becoming a ghost but being able to return to life in exchange of mana or other stuff), and some of them deal insane amounts of damage, while also draining your HP. Seriously, build yourself the most broken and lame deck against those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.The last thing is that the multiplayer is long dead. Now there are ways to play with people, even while the servers died years ago by using third-party software... But there's barely anyone who has the game. I HAD IT YEARS AGO WHEN IT RELEASED AND EVEN THEN IT WAS HARD TO PLAY WITH SOMEONE! This game did not get any attention during it's life-time, and it shows.However, is the game good? Holy crap, it is.The gameplay is a real good challenge, an entertaining strategy game were you're always trying to build your deck to get better, but also a game were defeat is usually just the perfect chance to get better. Something like that is hard to pull off.The amount of different cards, races and monsters is also quite great. There are tons of different strategies you can build to yourself, along with the tons of different enchantments, traps, artifacts and other crap you can get your hands on.The level system is also interesting, and I liked it a lot. As you level up, you can select extra passive skills such as regenerating some HP each X turns, getting an extra card each X turns and so on. They really make you feel like your deck and character is unique.Do I recommend this game? Yeah, IF you're a fan of this kind of strategy games. If you like Magic The Gathering, Yu-gi-oh, Heartstone and all of those other weird card based games, you'll like it a lot. If you're not a fan of those but you like strategy games, it might also interest you. If you're neither of those, you should turn arround.Oh, and ♥♥♥♥ Exile. I f#cking hate that spell. It can go f#ck a d#ck sideways on the shadow realm.TL:DR Edition: Old card based game that ripped off Magic The Gathering, mostly singleplayer because of dead multiplayer. If you like Heartstone and other card games, give it a try on a sale.			"

												I got this game due to its price and the many glowing reveiws. They left me a little concerned as they seemed to be mostly based on nostalgia for this game or for the genre/era.It starts off a little rough with few actual tactical (per encounter) or strategic (long ranging) choices. The card management interface is clunky which is exasperated by the constant need to devise specialty decks. Each new non-grind opponent comes with his own specialty battlefield that harmonizes with their decks leaving you to more often than not have to rebuild your deck. About halfway through the first half every fight was pretty trivial using one or two decks, with no way of being able to anticipate which deck was the the good choice for the encounter. As you cannot ascertain what the specialty battlefield will be until you suffer it the first attempt.*Minor Spoiler*About halfway through you switch up your POV taking on a new Protagonist and reseting your deck. At this point the game lost what little enjoyment it had for me. You get zero options as far as deck configuration, so you have to play it as is, and it is not designed to handle the next few opponents. The battles were not complex or interesting, but as the battlefield was designed for them it become a long odds roll of the dice to win.In the end I would say unless this was one of your early fell-in-love with games or you massively love the genre of early card games give this one a pass.

												Etherlords 2 is a card game with 3D Models ,5 unique races and challenging campaign . Gameplay is similar to regular card games with some overtop map exploration like in Heros of Might & Magic. Multiplayer community is very much dead but singleplayer campaign is fun enough by itself . This game is pretty old and does not support high resolution so expect bad texture . However it has very creative artsyle and design overall .Etherlords2 has more depth than most modern games . Aside from basic spells and creatures you also can level up your hero to gain unique abilities and use several different artifacts. There is also some resource management as you will have to buy/sell cards in shops and look for resources around the map . Defense phase is very extensive and many creatures are designed around that extra step that most card games do not have . AI is suprisingly good which is funny because this game is way older than hearthstone . It actually uses synergy combos and saves cards for them . Infact sometimes AI will save he's units if he knows that you have favorable trade.The campaign plays similar to Heroes of might and Magic but with less features ( Etherlords 1 had castles but this game droped that completely ) . Some fights can take you 50+ tries even with the right deck . Its very fun to build specific decks to kill overpowered opponents which is kinda similar to Hearthstone Boss fights .The best way to play this game is HotSeat PVP or over 2 computers with a friend but single player campaign is enjoyable too . You can probably use 3d party software to find oldschool players but at that point it's not worth the hussle for me .Selling Etherlord2 for $1 is insulting because it should be considered PC classic . If you like card games give it a chance .Score : 8/10 Considering the age of this game I think it is amazing for what it is . It is not perfect and the are some design flaws like redundant overtop map exploration . The core of this game is  advance and fun card game and one of the best games at that .			"

One of the best turn-based card games with RPG elementsThis is one OLD game, but it is still a gem every gamer who favours turn-based games should play. Its kinda combination of Heroes, diablo and card game. It all starts when you choose one of four fractions and play the fraction's campaign. As you go through the story, you and your hero gain new cards in form of monsters and spells from which you create your ""deck"" , therefore offense and defense for your actual hero with intention to kill the opponent's hero. There are MANY kinds of those monsters, some got its own spells, and other special abilities so you will surely have good time building the best deck combos :) GOOD things:  You will love customizing the deck It's old game - no need for a good (in this time, not even bad :D ) hardware I imagine it will be nicely playable on tablets Long time to beat all the campaigns Hot-seat, online and training battles modes BAD things:  Graphics on nowadays big displays "

												This game is awsome if you like card games. Magic the Gathering and this one are both classics. Graphics are a bit old, but the game itself is still enjoyable. I played it a lot many years ago, and its just good to do it again.If you have a bad/weak PC at your office, but still want to spend some time playing, while your boss is not looking, you should try this. Solitaire is nothing compared to this game.AI is remarkable. Developers of new games should take this as an example.			"

												Compared to Etherlords I, this game has had some changes for the better and some arguably for the worse. The graphics and engine appeared about the same. Combat still plays similar to Magic the Gathering, and you still have a hero that travels the world map. However, you no longer have a base to defend and you have only one hero instead of multiple. There are no more 'turns' on the map view so your hero just moves along at your own pace to gather resources; the game still tracks 'days' by your movement to determine resource collections and world effects. The camera is also locked onto your hero now so you can't survey the map as you could in the first game, which can be a pain. Also you only now have 3 resource types instead of the 8 or so in the previous game which makes tracking them simpler; resources are still collected, and are still used to purchase new spells. A major difference in this game, and one I liked, was that you can keep a selection of spells in reserve apart from your 'spellbook' for battle, so you can swap spells out between battles. You also no longer have to worry about running entirely out of good spells, as your spell supply is replenished automatically after every battle. However, now all spells - even basic ones - have limits as to how many you can cast in a  battle. This balances out the auto resupply, and I found it a welcome change. Heroes still gain XP from battles to increase HP and learn skills similar to the first game. Many of the spells and skills are the same, though there are some new ones too. Tooltips can now be set to appear just by hovering, but the delay means that usually you will still be spending a lot of time right-clicking to be able to instantly view the info about everything. The tutorials have been drastically improved (and because of this I might recommend to actually play this one first). The voice acting has improved from some of the worst in the first game to fairly decent in this game, which is good because now there are voices for characters as you travel around the map in game and not just for the objectives screen. Really the only thing I didn't like much or found frustrating was the obnoxious camera for the world map; it was nothing spectacular in the first game but now it is a major pain being locked on to your character (making the minimap almost entirely useless), often spinning around when you don't want it to, and zoomed in quite far. Fortunately the combat is about the same as in the first game which is to say very fun and the main focus of the game, improved further by your ability to exert greater control over your spellbook and more immediate access to new spells that can be swapped in instantly rather than having to charge them at a portal like in the first game. Overall, I recommend to fans of the first game or of CCG / MTG-like games or RPGs.			"

												This is a fun game. Nothing earth shattering, but it's well worth the price. I do wish it had more resolution options, but that's a small quibble.You have 18 (or 16, can't remember) spell / card slots and as you progress through the story you build your deck. In combat, you get a random hand from that pool with additional cards each turn. I do like the mana system - it's not cards like a lot of card games. Your mana increasea over time and can be boosted with spells (and you can reduce your opponent's). Feels nice.			"

												Etherlords is Magic The Gathering meets Heroes of Might & Magic. There is a lot to enjoy here and it's one of my all time favourites, something I just keep coming back to over the years, each time getting a little bit further. When I saw it was on Steam I couldn't resist picking it up. I recommend playing it on Easy as some of the battles are extremely tough even then, and playing as Vitalis first as it seems to be the easier campaign.While the English voice acting could be better, the in-battle voices are all in fantasy languages which sound great! some of the animations can take a little too long and the AI can make some weird decisions, but these don't take away from what is a very relaxing and enjoyable game, with a nice, if sometimes erratic, difficulty curve. Great music, sound and creature designs (seriously, what happened to good creature designs like this?) come together to create a rather under-appreciated experience.Highly recommended for the MTG or other card game enthusiasts out there.

Multiplayer is kinda buggy too, some ppl get disconnected constantly also there isnt much players on master servers.Dont hesitate with buyin this if u like card games.			"

												As an oldschool MTG player I love this game. I just wish each race's campaign lasted longer, or you could stick with one all the way through. I started as Chaot (red/black) but after completing that campaign it switches over to the winged race (blue/white maybe) which has a playstyle I don't care for at all. I will probably force myself to play through it, because I wan't to see what happens, but it's a bit of a downer that after all that work you just go back to level 1 of a race you don't get to decide on. Still, great game, even if the graphics haven't aged well.			"

I will probably force myself to play through it, because I wan't to see what happens, but it's a bit of a downer that after all that work you just go back to level 1 of a race you don't get to decide on. Still, great game, even if the graphics haven't aged well.			"

												Etherlords II feels like a game lost in what it's predecessor could have been, and what it wants to be.  It strives to give the same sense of battle as the previous game: turn based card battles in the same vein as Magic the Gathering.  However, it has taken all jeopardy out of those battles.  Normally, for me this would not be a bad thing, and indeed it is helpful, in that the game is formated much more like and RPG, like a story.  So each battle gives much needed XP and strategy information for further battles, and if one tactic doesn't work, another might.This would all work wonderfully, but for the fact that the story you gain is so scant, and the game primarily turns into a map crawl where you guess and pick and choose at which creatures are the best to pick this time.  If the game made the battles interesting, it would be one thing, but as a person who finds chess ultimately dull, this game made me horribly bored.  Plus there was no risk; you could just ""try again"" at any battle, having lost nothing, so the game turns into an exercise not really in strategy per se, so much as a guessing and recording game for each of the story lines, where you figure out what is effective through tedious trial and error, then reenact it on any higher level monster of the same type with the same types of creatures.The lack of investment this wrought, for me made the story boring, the battles tedious and the tactics canned.  With the sound and the graphics obviously salvaged from it's predecessor, this is barely two steps up the ladder from the first game, which was in all honesty more difficult and with a higher risk, but also much too punishing.  This sequel makes the opposite mistake, where there are no stakes, no worry, and the only thing this serves to do is waste the player's time trying to determine the best way to play, or to engender cheating using anything from guides to actual codes in an attempt to grasp the story.I cannot in good faith recommend this game.

												If you've ever wanted to play an CCG campaign, this game probably remains the best option out there to this day. Gave it another spin years after I first bought it and got hooked right back into a full playthrough. That was before I bought the game again on Steam.There's a strong sense of progression with good RPG elements, and your unlocks/opposition force you to frequently innovate/change your deck. "

												An All Time Clashic! After so many years of its creation, I still come back to this game for a kind of unique experience. Its similar as good as playing Magic the Gathering, but with many features making it different from a traditional card game. The turn-base abilities are actually like playing cards of MoM, there is the deck-building aspect that I consider mandatory for these kind of games, and there are artifacts you can trigger in a turn etc. The variety of cards is as needed to maintain interest, and since I played this game also before getting the steam version, I have gladly finished two of the races campains twice. The AI, one of the most important aspects in this kind of games, is 'clever' and challenging, even if at some point a specific enemy could be strongly specialised to one kind of attack-approach. Even if the game is really old, the visuals are not at all annoyingly audated. Dont expect fabulous light effects etc, but the graphics are still pleasant to the aye, and not a big deal at games like this in any case.The original CD version allowed for LAN multiplayer, and Steam version allows for multiplayer via a loby. Note that the loby is actually empty-abandoned, so you need to phonecall a friend so the both of you get in the loby to multiplay. But even if multiplayer is now harder to achieve, single play experience definetly worths the money on this game. I had and still will have many-many hours of fun with Etherlords II. Definately recommended from my end!			"

												I've tried everything to get this game to play. I've fiddled with various options in the settings.exe, run.cmd, and settings.cfg files to disable the videos and many other things. Also ran in various compatibility modes, as well as installed Microsoft XNA framework.No matter what I do, every time I start up I get a black screen that quickly exits back to the desktop, with a message reading, ""Can't create D3D object. (0x80004002) Unrecognized error value.""  I've also searched Steam forums and Google for this issue, and I see that many people using a 64-bit operating system seem to be having this issue, but there is also nobody that knows how to make the game playable.No game should be this difficult to get running.  I can play much older games with a simple compatibility change, yet this game just seems to hate 64-bit OSes.			"

												The saga continues! Etherlords II takes you back to the world of Ether and into a whole new realm of fantastic possibilities. Lead your hero on an unforgettable journey through lands filled with unsurpassed beauty and danger to unlock the ultimate mystery. Etherlords II is an exciting mix of role-play and tactical turn-based combat in the best traditions of fantasy trading card games. This version of the game supports co-op battles via Internet, including Round Table mode: round robin elimination tournament with random set of cards.			"

												I loved the Etherlords 1 back in the old days. So when i saw this on sale, I instantly wanted to go for it. Unfortunately there are no mission maps provided at the steam version of this, so this is pretty much a rip off to me, who enjoyed vastly the skirmish maps of first games. There does not seem to be any maps available to download either so I am considering a refund, not because of the price of measly 2 euros, but for the thought of being scammed.Will just go find my old Etherlords 1 and enjoy that some more I suppose. Didn't bother testing with the campaign. It was good in Etherlords 1, but not the thing that attracted myself.The game itself is a charm, even though it's quite old. If you enjoy Magic the gathering kind of card games or TCGs in general, this game might be for you. Etherlords 2 is not so much about map control from what I heard but I didn't have much chance to test the mission kind of gameplay anyways so how would I know.If you want just the core TCG part of the game, sure. Else dont bother purchasing this version!			"

												Graphics are nowhere as good as what is shown in the screenshots on the store page. The interface sorely needs an update i.e. I can't even scroll the window as the camera view is locked to the hero's position. Also, the various abilities could be better explained such as what Regenaration (1) means. If this game is remade with a better interface and achievements, I will definitely recommend it! But not as it is now though... reminds me of the old Shandalar game, this is that good!			"
