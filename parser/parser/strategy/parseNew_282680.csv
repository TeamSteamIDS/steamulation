								For now I would recommend to simply follow the game. In my opinion they have a good basis, but there's not enough content to keep you interested for more than 2 or 3 hours. What we have at the moment is a pretty easy game with few tactical elements, you choose your units at the start of a mission, you move them on hexagons and try to get rid of the enemy, and this is pretty much it. The missions are independent one of the other and they all offer the same things to do, no RPG elements, no persistent units, and the placement is not really important vs the AI, or is, most of the time, pretty obvious, warriors first line, archers back line. You have to manage a 'tactical' gauge (do good actions) in order to use the special power of your units, but you'll probably only use the self heal most of the time. This reminds me a little the combats in AoW 3, but simplified and easier. The game is visually good and there's a nice background. The choices they'll take in the next weeks will be determinant for the future of the game.At the moment, the game is boring after a few hours because it's too easy and not really engaging, even repetitive, but they really have something with the potential to become a good game. They also release regular updates. And for these reasons, the game deserves to be followed if you are into tactical games.			"

								A list far, far too long to bother with, this game has -Terrible- AI. The dev is too lazy to fix it or care about it so they just joke about it (such as the achievement blurb). It's a great shame, because the pieces are in place for a great tactics game here. But it's hard to have fun when:AI never moves or engages the player unless they have a line of sight on them. Meaning their army will stay in the deployment zone forever unless you move a unit close enough to them to be attacked on their turn. AI units never reinforcing (I once played vs a double strength AI, was whittled down to 2 units, then I just kept reinforcing those 2 units while wearing down the AI.... Those 2 units finished off about 20 AI units by themselves and I won the battle. Really broken). Units don't rout any more (this previously had been working but does not happen any more ever)AI never pulls depleted units out of the front, they just make useless attacks that do no damage until they are destroyed, this also means their full strenght units are just sitting in the back doing nothing. When playing as Attack vs Defend, the game defaults the Attacker as the Defender, and vice versa. But, it doesn't matter who is who, because the AI will never move unless you engage them first anyway!There's still only one map that can be played with more than 2 combatants. Ranged units ALWAYS fire last, never first, to soften up units. Melee attacks first, always, and then ranged. Also the AI NEVER buys/uses any cavalry whatsoever!That's just a fraction of how bad it is. Honestly I could go on for pages and pages, but this game isnt even worth bothering with. The dev doesn't respond any more, I think they have given up on the game, and now, I have too.			"

A very good game, even in early access! I can't wait to see what is added, but until then, this game is worth a good look, and even if you're not into early-access it's certainly worth watching for when it's fully out!			"

								10 / 10 Artwork.  The is absolutely beautiful.10 / 10 Soundtrack.  Amazing.  Although it's extremely relaxing.  You might not want to try to play this one during an all-nighter :P10 / 10 Gameplay.  It's deceptively simple.  Can you keep your simple more complex than your opponents simple?  That will be the deciding factor.  This game promises nothing that it does not deliver.  The price point is perfect.  I've owned the game for  while now (admittedly I've been distracted by other shiny things recently), but I've noticed that the dev's deliver updates every week like clockwork.  The few questions and concerns that I voiced on the forums were damn near instantly answered and alleviated by a developer's response.   Who would have guessed - They actually care!If you are a fan of strategy in any way, I think you'll find something to enjoy about Warring States.			"

								Only played for an hour, so this is a very early view...So far its all pretty great, supprised how complete it ""feels"", the controls are all working as you expect, this is great as you can jump straight into the tactics... So far the tactic have been really good, you need to think carefully about what you are going to do else you do fail (I have failed twice on the first stage) and this is how a game like this should be...Graphics are really nice and fit the period and the music is really excellent, not to much of it, but again like the graphics really fits all in...So I would have to say so far its a double thumbs up!!!Great price also, getting a lot here for you money, when did good games become so cheap??

								Pros:+Immersive: I'm not a fan of the Ancient Chinese theme (if that's even an accurate description) but I felt that I was actually a commander of the battle when I was playing. Something that doesn't happen very often for me sadly.+Polished for an Pre-release game.+Great battle mechanics+Intuitive: At least for an avid Civ5 gamer+Nice UI: Part of the reason it felt very polished+Feedback/bug report on main-menu and built into the game.Pre-release mentions:-Transition between turns felt a bit sluggish. This I'm sure will be remedied eventually and it doesn't really cause any grief other than my screen occasionally jumping to a random place on the map (due to border-scrolling and the lag caused by turn-transitions). No big deal though just something to be mentioned.-Short (I think). The campaign only showed 3 missions, I have not yet completed the third mission so I'm not sure if they're just hidden or aren't added yet. Again though, this is not a big deal as it is pre-release. I actually would prefer 3 polished levels instead of 10 buggy ones.Cons:None that I can think of aside from the pre-release mentions above which should be fixed and aren't really cons.			"

								I was one of those that greenlight this game. I'm a fan of turn-based strategy and this game is no exception. I bought it the first day that he was out on steam and I can tell you that for now the game, even if he isn't complete, Is great. The game is easy to play but difficult to master. For now, there isn't a tutorial included and no multiplayer (But the creator said that he will implement many feature before the full release of the game) So yeah, for now, the game look a bit like a demo, but I can guarantie that he will soon, very soon, look like a real game.For the creator: for a first game, this game is amazing. Keep up the good work!			"

								This game has a very good hex type combat system.  Right now its kinda short just a few scenrios and they are not customizable.  I think if they added a bit more complexity to it i.e. a small economy to add more options in battle. Or customizable maps.  Right now its a great battle game.  I paid 10.99 and its will worth it and if more content were added the value would go up quickly.still so bugs but the devolopers seem to be on the updates so give it a try.			"

								Warring States is basically turnbased tactical combat on a hex map, among forces of ancient China. Basically units can move, attack, special attack, or regenerate, depending on special points gathered, and the idea is for you to defeat all enemy units with just the units that you have (try not to lose too many). There are flanking bonuses as well as bonuses for having your flanks covered. There are terrain bonuses for attacking downhill. There are broken units (units that suffered too many casualties)  In a way, this is a little reminiscent of Civ5's combat, but with far fewer variety. The special ability points can also be spent on a special attack, which does extra damage. The story are of significance only to people who know Chinese history, and we're talking about the Romance of Three Kingdoms and thereabouts. And they are not important. The emphasis is on tactics, i.e. how to move optimally to force the enemy to engage on your terms, that you can surround it and flank it, pound it from afar with archers, and so on, while preventing the enemy to do the same to you. The scenarios can be challenging, and the main emphasis is multiplayer, which can be brutal. the SP are more of a tutorial. All in all, it's not a terribly good game, but it's fresh take on an area that's not widely explored out of China. Worth a try at least.			"

								Ok so I believe I have played enough to have an understanding of the game and how it works. Firstly, I like the Chinese warring theme (I am more of a three kingdoms strategist myself playing ROTK and Dynasty tactics) but this is a refreshing breath of air. The combat is interesting and intuitive and provides a decent diversity of units. One thing that isn't really a criticism but more of a doubt is the strength of archers. Whilst not strong in damage they seem to drop one morale per shot on any unit they fire on. This is both realistic and sensical however this may turn out to be OP (once again this is more of a worry rather than a complaint). I seem to only have encountered one glitch where I sent my horsemen back through the gate in the second mission (when I was defending) and they flipped out for a few seconds before the game returned to normal. But I have been throughly enjoying this game and am eagerly awaiting the games release P.S my name is an ancient chinese reference, I wonder if you know it ;)			"

								This is a straight up turn based hex strategy game, and that's not a bad thing. The game is good because it doesn't try to be something it's not. The devs concentrated on nailing the basics, and what you get is a well balanced TBS with units that compliment and counter each other well. Units have special abilities that can be used to great effect with intelligent positioning and timing.It's not a game that will haunt your dreams. It lacks in variety and the story is a bit bland, but the mechanics are spot on, so hexy tacticians will enjoy it.			"

								An ancient Chinese themed turn based strategy game. Even though it is EA, it is mostly polished and nearly ready to release in my opinion. Graphics are nice and clear. Animations are lively enough. Campaign missions are greatly varied and offers a nice experience around 5-6 hours. Only negative side of the game is the fact that you can dominate your enemies by swarming them with the most basic archer unit of the game. Siege machines are completely useless as you can conquer castles without them very easily. These two things are the only negatives of the game right now. Other than these issues, the combat is very strategical and fun.			"

								The combat is pretty fun.  Your units have various special attacks and moves that are very cool.  There are flanking bonuses, advantages and disadvantages to units attacking different types of units.  One thing that I don't like is that archers get NO defense when being attacked in melee.  They just sit there and take damage, while dealing zero damage back.  They should be able to at least attack back a little bit.  This is kind of silly and needs to be adjusted.The few campaign scenarios that I have played so far have been interesting and offer different types of challenges, which is a good thing.  I look forward to playing the rest of the missions.The developers, however, are glacially slow, and they are absent from the forums for extended periods of time.  Lately, they rarely, if at all, respond to questions on their own game's Steam discussion board.So, the combat is solid, and enjoyable.  It still needs quite a bit of play balancing.  The AI is not very difficult to beat (so far).  Multiplayer doesn't seem to work at all.  I hosted a game, and my Steam friend never saw it in the game list, nor could I invite him to join my game.  So, that seems broken right now, and the developers aren't responding when we ask them how to get multiplayer working.I hope the developers pick up the pace and finish the game soon.  It has a lot of potential, but it's currently hindered by play balance issues, multiplayer not working, and non-responsive developers.  So, I cautiously recommend this game. [Update 2/23/2017] - I am changing my review to ""Definitely Not Recommended"".  These developers have completely disappeared, leaving this game unfinished.  They no longer respond on the Steam forum.  Please stay far away from this game.  I feel bad for ever recommending this game.  Developers like these guys are what gives early access a bad rap.  No Bueno.			"
