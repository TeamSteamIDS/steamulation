												Terrible.   Lazy shovelware that is not worth playing at any price.Game plays very slowly with animations between each turn. Does not track used tiles (you have to do this yourself, on paper).No option to use the tournament wordlist (i.e., no swear words).  No option to supply your own dictionary.AI is garbage.  Its only strength is perfect word knowledge.  It's easy to bait the computer into throwing away blanks and S's for low points.No tools to help you improve your play, like a reviewer that recommends better moves.  Of course this would require a real AI.  No actual multiplayer.  Hotseat play is stupid and broken in a hidden-information game like Scrabble.If you want to improve, there are better single-player  Scrabble programs and most of them are free.If you want to play against many people, there are Scrabble games with real multiplayer and some of them are free.If you want to play against people in your house, buy a Scrabble board.If you want to spend $5-10 on a video game, there are much much better values for your money out there.

												There are three AI settings.  People who complain about the AI might have missed this, because the hardest AI setting is like playing the dictionary.  If there's a person out there who can routinely beat the computer on the hardest setting, I'd like to meet them.  And no matter the AI setting, the computer's responses are lightning quick.  The game has windowed mode and a slick presentation.  The only thing you could want for with this game (provided you like Scrabble) is multiplayer.  You can't even do multiplayer on a local machine.  But the thing is, I own a very nice real life Scrabble set, and when real life friends come over, we use the genuine article.  But EVEN THEN I have this software open in the background because of the convenient dictionary included in the game that allows you to type in a word and have it judged as a valid Scrabble word or not.  So this game wins in every aspect for single player, and acts as a perfect ""Scrabble Word Judge"" companion for playing the  physical board game with real life friends.			"

												It's Scrabble.  Seems to be stable and everything.  Nothing real wrong with it that I can find yet.  There are a few customizable rules.  If you're a fan of Scrabble, go for it.  If you don't know what Scrabble is, it's a board game about spelling words and scoring the most points for the best words.  Games on here that you may be more familiar with such as Bookworm, or DS titles such as Word Jong, were definitely inspired by the classic Scrabble.  It's a bit like a crossword puzzle that you build yourself, without the clues.  I've been a lifelong fan of Scrabble and having it here on the computer without having to worry about tiles everywhere or getting out the old board is pretty nice, and I have an AI opponent to test myself against.

												I love Scrabble. In my opinion single player word games are fun. This is something simple and easy for me to play before bed to wind down for the day.  Oh yeah, if you put the difficulty on Hard the AI is a little crazy with words most people have never heard of....lol.			"

												It's scrabble that's all. I would give it a thumbs up if they supported online multiplayer not LAN or two people on one computer keyboard. Come on people it's 2014 (this game was released in 2013 for heaven's sake) and we have the INTERNET, why aren't there more ONLINE multiplayer games?			"

												So I got all four board games made by this developer, decided to playtest each of them.Didn't know what to expect from this.  Never been a fan of Scrabble, never played it much, and no clue how you could put it on PC.So I started it up, made a new game, and played Scrabble.  That's it really.  It's Scrabble on the PC.The AI is a bit wonky in the way that it uses words that most people would never ever think of, the board looks quite odd with huge, tripple-dight points words on it mixed in with your own fairly unimpressive ones.Beyond that I really had no issues with it.  Just like the other 3 games they released, run, hit start, play.  That's it.This would be recieving a negative review if I could rate the actual gameplay, but it's a love or hate kind of thing.  If you like scrabble, it's worth shelling out $10.			"

												I enjoy the game vey much; however I would like to see it updated to reflect the Merriam Webster 5th edition dictionary additions.  Even some of the 4th edition entries are not acceptable in your game.  Is this is a possibility?			"

												Just like the classic board game, and a great game for when friends come over in person.  Too bad it doesn't have a multiplayer that could be done over the internet though.			"

												Inferior to tablet versions in notable ways; but it's still Scrabble.If you really like solo Scrabbling and don't mind a lack of options or customization, this is a fine choice. That said, as much as these digital versions get the basic game right, I always feel they should have just a bit more. Whether that would be giving you on-the-spot word definitions or providing significant rule and board variations that would actually take advantage of the fact you're playing a computer game, it shouldn't be as limited as it is.
