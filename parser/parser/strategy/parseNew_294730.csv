												I was so happy to find this game on Steam. I first purchased it years ago in a game store and it became one of my favorite tycoon games. I'm briefly going to go over some pros and cons.Pros:HUGE variety of animals to choose from, both aquatic and terrestrial. You could choose to have a zoo, aquarium, or a combination of the two. Some are available right away, some you have to research in game (you can set how many, if any at all, animals you must unlock by research in freeform mode.) Others are unlocked by completing bonus objectives in the campaign.Autosave featureTutorial, scenarios, and freeform modes It has a little bit of amusement park tycoon in it. You have a skytrain and a boat ride that you can design however you want. A nice little addition to the game.You can assign specific zookeepers/marine specialists to specific exhibits, which helps make sure all the animals get the care they need without too much micromanaging. Finances are easy to manage with various charts and graphs illustrating trends, profits, and expenses. In a pinch and need more money? Grab a loan and pay it back when you can. Customers and animals are very specific in what they want and need. If someone is unhappy, it's easy to find out why. Game can be paused or set to one of four different speeds. The game runs very smoothly on poor graphics cards. On my machine that has one of the worst graphics cards on the market, I experience absolutely no lag. (someone with low RAM or a small hard drive may have trouble, but I'm not sure)ConsThe graphics are outdated, undetailed, and kind of creepy (the people don't have eyelids). The animal models are decent at least. The terraformer feature needs some work. Freshwater can only be added at the default level, so if you're using hilly terrain and your exhibits are higher or lower, no fresh water for your terrestrial animals. (Salt water can be added at any level) You can get around this with a water dish, but the animals prefer the stuff they can splash around in. It sounds annoying, but it really isn't  big deal except in some of the scenarios which is easily fixed by leveling everything out. Some customers will always complain about availability of food and cleanliness of the zoo. You have to learn to accept it, or it gets very annoying. You can keep complaints to a minimum and have a great satisfaction rating in spite of this.This is the big one for me. Marine specialists do a poor job of keeping the aquatic animals fed, and the animals starve to death as a result. Also, when marine species get ill, it seems impossible to treat them for a similar reason. The marine specialists don't administer the medication, even when the animals are placed in an isolation tank. It's for these reasons that I normally don't bother with species that are 100% aquatic. I'm going to experiment a bit and see if there's something I can do to compensate for this issue, and I'll update if I find anything that helps. ______________________________________For the price, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys zoo tycoon games.

												Played as a child, just got it today. Loving it.  Only cons are that the camera is hard to get the hang of and that it can be confusing in finding items.			"

												I used to play this game a lot when I was 10-13, I still remember that I had it from a box of cereals that my parents baught. Now years later I tried to see if the game is on steam too and, guess what, we're here for this :)I'm currently 18 but still enjoy a lot this since it's a sandbox (you can literally shape the ground like is a piece of play-doh) and a strategic game at the same time. You need to adjust ticket prices, advertise your zoo on different platforms, make your animals become mascots and advertise them on tv, hire personal and adjust their salary, invest in research, care about the animals (or just put all them together and see who survives) and the visitors. You can even create little roller coasters but pay attention: visitors always have to complain about how you built it! Sometimes I want to put them in the same cage with lions!!One big advice I have for you, if you're thinking to buy ""zoo empire"", just buy ""marine park empire"" because has all the stuff from ""zoo empire"" and also the new marine park stuff.

												I used to have the cd for this game when I was 5 and still is a good as it as back then. Goals are fantastic, hard difficulty is exactly as it entails, Sure graphics are a tad. or very outdated but the game itself is fantastic. animals are very varied, there's many attractions to show, in comparison to vanilla zoo tycoon 2 marine park empire for me is just a tad more intuitive. I wish it had mod support like zoo tycoon though, would've became alot more popular if it did			"

												Good game, played it on CD when I was younger and was excited to find it on Steam a while back. The only problems I have are that the graphics are still like they used to be, and that workers are still prone to bugging out just like they were on the CD game.			"
