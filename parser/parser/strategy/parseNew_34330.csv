												I have been playing many different strategy games being most of them from the Total War series, and I must say that Shogun II is so far, the most complete strategy game available in the gaming industry.Let's begin by talking about the positive aspects of the game, which are many...Shogun II is a historically accurate game presenting a wide, never-ending content during Japan's biggest civil war known as the Sengoku Jidai Era. You will be able to play with many important factions that played major roles into shaping Japanese history along with their rulers which are until today famous and highly respected in all of Japanese society.In Shogun II, having a good solid army wont be enough for you to achieve success, to hire agents such as the Ninja, to have a respectful diplomatic relationship among other clans, to have a good technological progress over other factions and to control trade routes with other Asian nations will be all equally important in order to achieve your goals.The game might look slightly complex, but it's easy to learn compared to other previous Total War gamesIf you’re new to the series, the overload of information can be quite unnerving, and perplexing. But dig deeper, and you’ll start to appreciate the game, and its small details and intricacies. For a strategy game, this is near flawless, and definitely the best of the Total War series.There's no need for mods, the game is well-balanced and extremely polished in all of its aspectsIt's true! After long hours of playing this game, you will realize that there is nothing on this game that might require mods either to fix something, or to add any content that is lacking of.From a strategy perspective, it is a perfect gameIt has gunpowder units, artillery and even bomb throwers, but just enough to add a new element to the game without taking away its melee battle core. Despite the deadliness of these units, they must be placed in strategical locations in order to be truly effective and to counter the terrain penalties.The campaign mechanics, such as the family tree and events you can encounter throughout, really make you connect with your leadersIndeed, each player will feel very connected to the game in overall making the difficult task of leading and ruling an entire faction militarily, economically and diplomatic, a very pleasant task.Polished and clean graphicsThe graphics in the units, in the battlefield and even in the campaign map are beautiful and they will make you enchanted with their additional effects depending of the 4 seasons you are in.The multiplayer modeThe multiplayer mode in Shogun II is unique as the rest of the game itself. Players will have a Daimyo, the faction head-ruler, which will also be the general in multiplayer battles that can be fully customizable from his face structure to each individual armor piece and weaponry of himself.Before you play your first multiplayer battle, you must select your clan starting point by moving your general on to it, and as you progress and win battles, you will conquer lands which will unlock you more online troops, accessories for your Daimyo and also retainers to boost your army base bonuses.Loading screen quotesThe presence of quotes said or wrote by renowned people is well known in Total War games, but in my personal opinion the quotes were so well selected, that will almost give you the feeling that you are improving yourself in the game after reading them.MusicThe music in this game is capable of adding even more atmosphere that wraps perfectly with every moment of the game either during battles, in the campaign map, or simply in the game menu.Extra contentThe DLC's and the two singleplayer / multiplayer expansions available to this game, is seriously a must buy for anyone who enjoys this game, because not only it unlocks more factions and their unique units both for singleplayer and multiplayer, but also because the expansions such as the ""Fall of the Samurai"" and ""The Rise of Samurai"" will make you emerge to another dimension of old Japan making you feel that you are playing a different game.Now, to the negative aspects.The loading timeDespite the clean, polished and detailed graphics, there comes the price of it. A long loading time both before battles and also during the initial loading screen of the game which can be sometimes, quite depressing.The multiplayer modeShogun II blows us away with its unique refreshing multiplayer system, but there is simply too many de-syncs among players and the enormous lag during battles with more than 2 players.Irrational AIBattles with the AI will often become easy as you learn the same strategy they use in the three battle types (Naval,Land and Siege).Hard dificultyInstead of making the AI strategy effectiveness wider and complex, what happens is that the enemy units will have a greatly increased fighting stats making the game unbalanced, instead of harder as it should be.Conclusion.I would rate this game 93 out of 100 or 4,9 out of 5,0 stars. It's a masterpiece of game within the strategy genre, a must have for anyone who likes strategy or to be taking the seat of a strategian!			"

												Total War: Shogun 2 is almost perfect in every way. It has great graphics and optimization, spectacular gameplay and balance, and the sound effects immerse you into the game. I could actually write a review on this games music alone. This is one of the best Total Wars in gameplay standards, but the only thing this game lacks is cultural variety from other Total War games, which isn't too much of a problem considering the game is based on only one country. Other than that, I can't think of a way they could improve this game anymore. It is simply a masterpiece, and one of my favorites.			"

												I was being attacked by angry avon ladies at my door so this review is updated to contain more information regarding the game, if you were thinking about buying it you should start here. TL:DR At The Bottom with some funny fake quotes.  Field Rating Review   Graphics 9.5 The graphics are near perfect for a styled game like this, samurai swinging swords and spears around in sengoku jidai. You won't find anything like this anywheres else looking as good as it is. However you will need a modern pc in order to run it at maximum graphics, which is well worth it   Gameplay 8 Gameplay is great,  The morale [en.wikipedia.org] works as intended, if your units drop to a certain amount of men left they start getting nervous and then waver. Causing them to retreat to your set up regroup point or shatter, being unable to be clicked on and retreat offscreen for the remainder of the battle.  Cavalry [en.wikipedia.org]  do what they're supposed to do, they are used for flanking, charging men without spears and helping chase down routed enemies.  Ashigaru [en.wikipedia.org] are Peasants armed with weapons. Very low morale but comes with huge unit sizes with the ability to combat cavalry but do bad in normal melee against better melee units.  Samurai [en.wikipedia.org] are Samurai, better than ashigaru, but more expensive. The normal type of samurai which is  Katana [en.wikipedia.org] And  Yari [en.wikipedia.org] And No-Dachi which is a big katana are what we are going to cover here. Katana Samurai are easily outmatched by cavalry. Yari Samurai are easily outmatched by Katanas, The balance is great. No-dachi is basically katana samurai but if you charge with them they literally take twice the amount of units they are and bring them down. Like chuck norris as their spirit animal they go in and clean up everything. With a banzai ability stopping them from routing. The only problem is Multiplayer veteran balance which I won't cover in this review, however do not let this deter you from buying the game. The music is EXTREMELY well made. we're talking about music on par with Puella Magi Madoka Magickas soundtrack, I love my chinese cartoons.    Multiplayer and Co-op 10 Multiplayer balance is mostly fine, it's rock paper scissors dressed up with samurai units and some variety such as siege weapons, now you're probably wandering "" This game game out 4 years ago, I bet the community is dead "" It's not, if you want to buy this for multiplayer then I recommend it. Averaging at about 5,000 people playing every day (EST) and maybe more on the weekends, this game is far from being dead. and you buying it will help the game grow back to it's former glory of 25,000 people. Now explaining rock paper scissors in shogun 2, Spear beats cavalry, cavalry beats swords, swords beat spear. bow beat everything at range but everything beats bow in melee. this game has a form of RNG, Think payday 2 but without masks and colors you're getting armor pieces and retainers. Retainers boosts your armies stats, gives you helpful stats for your general and does other useful stuff. Some retainers are LEGENDARY and only have a 1/1000th Drop Chance, while giving you extremely powerful abilities. Example here is Legendary Retainer : Tengagoken Katana, gives your entire general unit +10 Melee attack. If you complete armor sets you also get retainers ONLY available if you completed that armor set, you can also wear the armor on your generals avatar and it can be seen in battle. I'm not covering naval because I don't play naval. Co-op campaign is another means of multiplayer under the multiplayer button. It's campaign but with two people and you can go head to head or play it together. More details for the same things under campaign.   Campaign 9 Campaign is brilliantly done. so many ways you can replay it, and  many difficulty settings for the die-hard. It includes most of the notable clans during the sengoku jidai era, while most smaller clans get wiped out in the first 25 or so turns. theres trade routes to boost your income you get to by ships while also giving you that item you're trading so it may not be in japan being highly valuable. You have a general system where they get traits overtime and rank up for a special skill tree, they also get retainers aswell. There is a research tree like many Total war games where you research what you want to learn with it branching down from two choices "" Bushido "" and "" Chi "". Bushido is ment for military means and getting better units, chi is ment for civil/diplomatic means while also giving you access to some units or agents. Agents are useful for many things such as apprehending ninja agents or infiltrating a castle and setting it ablaze with assassins.   Replayability 10 I can easily see people getting 3,000+ Hours on this game, theres nothing to NOT do. You can do campaign custom battles reinactments with friends conquer japan on multiplayer do Co-Op campaign, the possibilities are endless. Of the time i've had this the only reason I don't have over 3,000+ hours is because I have a  Youtube channel  to worry about, Piano/Music Theory, and other games.   Overall 9.5 No game can be perfect, except this one. There are such tiny issues i've found its the only reason it's getting a 9.5. Other than that it would be a MASTERPIECE  Do you buy it? Yes.TL:DR do I buy it? YesI'm not being payed to make this review.Angry Avon ladies visiting my house :  And who are you? You just got about 450 likes that doesn't say anything haha. Anyway, you were just saying everything is fine, everything is beautiful, everything is balanced, gameplay is funny, long term motivation blabla, you never wrote anything in detail. Why should someone buy or play that game after such a superficial review?:DRozzok : you're right completely unacceptable, review is now twice as long and filled with more detail, while i'm at the door, do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior jesus christ?"" Peasant : but general, how can they see with such tiny eyes? Fots General : ah but you see you don't understand, japanese squint,  have many vision, can shoot great distance. """" (K)Otaku : I felt like a weaboo japanese worshipping katana cultist warrior swinging around swords like this, I very much rate this game 10/10 ""			"

												So, after nearly inputting almost 100 hours into this game over the span of a year and still unable to beat the game according to its victory conditions...I have a story to share. (First total war experience, also I was a noob at the time)As the Hojo, I felt indestructible, with cheap siege units and cheap castles, I conquered the lands and elimanted clan by clan....no one could stop me as Japan was in civil war amongst one another....until, the realm divide. This is where the game truly shines. As I reached turn 93, I had half of Japan conquered and I was officially declared Shogun.The AI does a decent job of putting up a fight in the late game. But, with my decent warfare tactics, I truimphed over my foes.However, by turn 117. My empire was crumbled.It was not the wars I was fighting at the time. It was the war within myself...In the difference between turns many things had happened:Peasants grew restless, taxes were too high, soldiers constantly fighting for land, attrition... and eventually, civil war formed amongst my glorious empire.Independent and familiar clans reformed amongst my Hojo Empire. I struggled to gain food, to find shelter for my people, a place to call home amongst the oncoming rebellions.In the end, the Hojo empire was literally split in half. A major gap in my provinces, ruled by rebel scums.I had no choice, but admit honorable defeat.This was as far as I had gone in a year worth of almost 100 hours (which consisted of many re-trys)I never forget my glorious Hojo empire.As a matter of fact, I still have the saved file at turn 93, just before things went south. Should I claim glory once again?...Personally feel that this is the BEST Total War Game (as of 2016, even better then Warhammer! & Better then Attila which is my second favorite!)Great game, although, the loading times (and pretty much its only weakness) is the loading times. Unless you have a SSD, then your out of luck like the rest of us.Multiplayer is fantastic as well.Thank you for reading this, I hope you enjoyed my review as much as I have enjoyed writing this! "

												I caught wind that my oldest and most loyal general was planning to defect, so I ordered him to commit honorable seppuku to preserve his honor. The fool left with half my army in the night, marching towards the lands of his new lord, the treacherous great lord hatakeyama. We ran them down like dogs, and slaughtered the cowards who deserved even less than that, but the general, and not one other man, survived the onslaught. One man with a horse? My armies couldn't catch him, so i sent my most talented assassin. At the ripe age of 63, he had single handedly shifted the tide of war in japan in my favor more times than I (aparently) had loyal men in my armies. But, he succeeded only in wounding that snake, and he slithered back to the hatakeyama capitol halfway accross the country. I would not be made a fool of. I burned cities, slaughtereed thousands, overthrew a 200 year old dynasty and declared myself ruler of the charred wasteland I left in my wake... And I never saw him again.10/10 would feel betrayed again			"

												Shogun 2 is the apex of the TW series.  The period covered in this title is a fascinating blend of old and new period military strategy.  It has excellent animations, units, graphics, sound, layout and has many mods that can be applied to extend your gameplay.  The AI is ""good enough"" and the single player is simply superb.  I have played over 1000 hours on this title and can recommend it to anyone interesting in this genre.			"

NOTE:I was never able to play the original Shogun: Total War since it was before my gaming days, therefore, I will not compare it with Shogun 2. I'm  primarily a singleplayer gamer so I will focus on the single player aspects only.INTRODUCTION:Shogun 2: Total War is the 7th installment in the Total War franchise which takes the entire series back to the era that started it all. It retains the trademark featured gameplay of mixed turn based campaign and real time strategy battle map, along with a completely revamped and redesigned game mechanic on the campaign map.Shogun 2 revisits Feudal Japan, more specifically, the Sengoku Jidai era which was marked with social turmoil, political intrigue and an almost perpetual state of war among the different samurai clans. Take control of one of these clans and pave your way towards the capital city of Kyoto and gain your rightful seat as Shogun, military ruler of all Japan.PROS:+ Graphically Unrivaled in scale: -The environments, the level and map designs, art assets, unit animation, kaiga (gadō) Japanese artworks and the splendid seasonal weather effects brings feudal Japan to life once more. Although there are other games that also sport amazing graphical fidelity, I have yet to see any game to deliver it on the scale that was done in Shogun 2.+ Sound and Music: -Great Japanese inspired music themes, fully localized voices for all units (meaning they all speak Nihon-go except the advisers), and believable sound effects will trully be a treat to anyone's ears.+ Revamped Game mechanics: -Shogun 2 vastly improves on the mechanics that were laid down by Empire: Total War. New family management system, diplomacy, religion, unit types, General's Skill Trees and the Honor meter are just some of the things that make this game an improvement from Empire: Total War. Also, expect a lot of dead people from both sides after each battle due to the brutality of combat that is nicely recreated in this game.+ High Replayability value: -Different clans feature different specializations which will force the players to adapt to a new gameplay style to fit the clan's strengths. This game also adapts an ""Avatar Conquest"" feature which provides a good and fun co-op experience.+ Mods: -A lot of mods from a very active and dedicated community will extend your play time, experience and enjoyment.CONS:- Artificial Intelligence: -Given that this game's AI is vastly superior than that of Empire: Total War's AI, it still falls short from what I expected. One particular instance that I found to be annoying is the fact that the game outright spawns WHOLE STACKS of free military units for the AI to increase difficulty rather than improving upon the strategy or tactic that it should be utilizing. Naval battles are a bit clunky, specially when trying to board another ship.- Bugs and Crashes: -I can almost guarantee that you will experience some sort of bug or crash during your game. Saving occasionally is highly advisable. Conveniently though, Ctrl+S works as a quick save feature. No Anti-aliasing was placed on the game if the system is running on DirectX10 (disregard if already patched). FPS may also drop during some of the more cluttered or hectic battles that you will definitely encounter.- DLC: -There are good DLCs and there are BAD DLCs, unfortunately, this game has the latter. Factions and certain Unit Types that could have easily been placed as free DLC or in-game content were locked behind a pay-wall. One of the greatest sins for me is the ""Blood Pack DLC"" which adds a minor feature where blood and gore are added to the game. The Blood Pack DLC should have been a patch rather than be sold for $2 (or your regional equivalent).CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME! My personal favorite of the series and what I believe to be the best of the franchise so far. It retains the formula that made the Total War games great, and at the same time, mixes it up just enough to give a fresh new experience. Total War fans would find it fun with its vanilla version, but more can be had with the different mods available a the Steam Workshop.If you're a strategy fan but not particularly fond of the Japanese Feudal era, then this game might not be the game you're looking for.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

Posted: February 5
												I've played every Total War title since Rome 1 (bar Warhammer), and to this day will happily argue that Shogun 2 remains CA's magnum opus. ""But who cares about what you think, Lobstag?"", you'll say. I get that, but just hear me out. The game isn't perfect, but it's as close to it as you'll get from any Total War game. I also realise reviewing Shogun 2 six years after it was initially released is a little late to say the least, but having invested over 300 hours, and it being the second most played game in my steam library, I'd say it's about time I put my love for this game in writing. I also hope this review will be helpful to newer Total War fans who are on the fence about getting Shogun 2.Why the best Total War?1) It isn't overly ambitious – I'm looking at you Empire. Shogun 2 does really well to keep everything about it focused and narrowed-down without removing elements of the series that make Total War grand. Of course, it helps that it strictly takes place in Japan, but Total War games that attempt to encompass too much with too little ends up being worse than those that attempt to cover a niche with plenty of detail. That's not to say that CA won't ever succeed in a, for example, Victorian era globe-encompassing title. They just need to make sure every nook and cranny, every ounce of detail put into the game is tailored to each individual faction's objectives, buildings, tech, units and play style at the very least. Let's put this into an example. In Rome 2, you can play as the Iceni – a remote tribe in bronze age Britain or as the mighty Roman Republic. Their objectives don't differ. Both have to ""capture X number of provinces"" to beat the game. This works for Rome, but it doesn't work for the Iceni. Instead, they should have the Iceni's objective as ""form a Celtic federation with at least 5 other tribes"". It gives me absolutely no reason to suspend disbelief that the Iceni had ambitions to conquer continental Europe, Africa and the Middle East. I think CA realised this for Attila. But this is precisely why Shogun 2 succeeds, because all clans have a common focus.2) Immersion – Everything from the music, the speech and the UI, to the environment, the events and the clan behaviours creates an atmosphere that is truly feudal Japan. Shogun 2 is also the last Total War to include cut-scenes for events and agent actions. From your first encounter with the Nanban (Portuguese traders), to a plentiful harvest, there is a cut-scene to keep you entertained. It becomes something you look forward to. You end up with a level of immersion not seen since the days of Medieval 2.3) Graphics – I could swear Total War graphics haven’t changed since Shogun 2. They might have even downgraded. The Fall of the Samurai expansion campaign map looks and runs 10 times better than Rome 2’s and Attila’s. Either Shogun 2 had state of the art graphics for its time, or CA got lazy with their recent titles. The graphical jump from Napoleon to Shogun 2 is unrivalled. The jump (or rather, step-down) from Shogun 2 to Rome 2 is the exact opposite.4) Gameplay – Let’s start with the bad before I start creaming myself over how good this game is. CA has historically always been bad at developing AI and Shogun 2 is no exception. As you tone up the difficulty level, the AI doesn’t become “smarter”. Instead, they are equipped with ridiculous buffs and multiplier bonuses. You can widdle the enemy down to one town and they’ll still be able to support 2 full stack armies. It’s lazy programming. The AI also haven’t got a Scooby-Doo on how to use a navy. Expect stupid single ship “fleets” scattered all over the campaign map, doing nothing but act like annoying little mosquitos. On Very Hard and Legendary difficulties you’ll end up spending a quarter of your time dealing with those irritating motherpluckers instead of fighting real battles. The autoresolve is equally as broken, where you’ll see your British-made Ironclads ripped to shreds by wooden ships. Iron versus wood, CA. It's not rocket science!Right, so with that rant over I can get onto the good:– Family tree: you end up caring a lot about your Daimyo (clan leader) and his family, as a result. I grew so attached to Takeda Shingen during one campaign, that when he finally died in battle I felt actual sadness. It can also create some hilarious storylines. I managed to stave off war with a neighbouring faction by giving them two of my grandsons as hostages. Twice they were executed, but hey I didn't lose a single province!– Variety of agents: ninjas, ishin shishi, geishas, shinsengumi, monks, priests, metsukes. YES.– Game changing decisions: adopt Christianity and receive access to European cannons, trade ships and matchlocks or stick to Buddhism and conventional Japanese weaponry? And in Fall of the Samurai: adopt modernity, artillery and ironclads or stick to traditional bows and katanas? Both have their pros and cons and give meaning to the way you manage your clan– Dynamic campaign map: the geography of Japan is totally unique, with only 11% of the landmass being arable. This makes resources rare, meaning declaring war just for a bit of superior wood can make or break your campaign. There are also plenty of mountains, making the map feel tight and cramped – as it should be. Prepare for a ton of ambushes– Unit variation: historically, for the lack of different units available in the Sengoku Jidai, CA has done terribly well to include as many units in the game as they have– Multiplayer avatar system: pure genius. Create a general, customise your general's clan and specialities. Send him into battle. Decide if you want to be a traditionalist or a modernist if you fancy– Mouthwatering achievements: I've never been an achievement hunter, but this game makes me one– Co-op campaign: extremely fun to play with friends. Set the AI to legendary and strap your seatbelts folks. You're in for some gargantuan battles.– Mods: I highly recommend taking a look at the workshop if you want to spice this game up. But play the vanilla first– Community: highly supportive and friendly as ever, with plenty of enthusiastic players still on this game on a regular basis (including me)Conclusion – You don’t have to be a fan of feudal Japan to be a fan of this game. It is unique in its own right and effortlessly combines graphical, gameplay and immersive elements into a tiny collection of islands on the edge of the Pacific. Shogun 2 proves that you don't have to make everything big in order to make it epic. Here’s hoping that CA’s next historical title will be just as good, if not better.			"

												Total war Shogun 2 is a beautiful strategy game that really allows the player to be immersed in what is one of the most overlooked periods in ancient history. Shogun envelopes you into 16th century Japan and challenges you to control some of  the strongest families during the Sengoku jidai or age of war. The challenge that is posed against you is to overthrow the shogunate who has betrayed your family , therefore striking you to pursue unifying and controling Japan. With the highly acclaimed single player which contains the Civilisation style turn based gameplay to the real time strategy from the likes of Command & Conquer and competetive multiplayer, you will never be stuck with nothing to do. The multiplayer incorporates a unique personal avatar system that was introduced in Napoleon total war and has been reworked, adapted and enhanced within the newest total war title. The user has an avatar which can be created and edited from the start of the multiplayer experience. Throughout the multiplayer battles and through gaining single player acheivements new items for your general can be unlocked to make your leader dominate the battlefield with his new shiny greaves . Upon winning matches you start to conquer the area's of Japan, allowing for seperate unlocks to units and retainers (buff cards) which gives the multiplayer some replayability and continuinity. 8/10 - *Great strategy with beatiful visuals and great competetive Avatar multiplayer**Lacks greater unit variety in the single player**AI has improved massivly since napoleon total war however still somewhat lackluster**Wonderful mix of real-time and turn-based strategy really makes this game a winner*			"

I own all the DLC and Rise of the samurai and fall of the samurai. Got no idea on about how much money I spent. And too be honest I dont care. Would I do it all again? Yep.. I would do it In a heartbeat.Shogun 2 is probably the best thing CA has ever made. And too not buy this would be a SHAMEFURR DISPRRAY!			"

												I am the Daimyo of the Shimiza... I think. I'm not sure, we're just the ones who wear green and we're less likely to betray each other, which is good enough because we are extremely similar to everyone else on Nippon, the great land of Japan. We fight the same, eat the same, use the same weapons, if we all didn't agree to strict colour codes, it would be chaos.After hundreds of years, we have decided it is time to have a civil war. We're not too sure why, but it seems right. Some bloke turned up from Denmark, handed us Japan's first gun, and that was it; time to declare war on each other and decide who will be Emperor... No, not that, we're just going to fight for the honour of being the guy who fights for the Emperor. Okay then. Thankfully, everyone got the message and we all decided it was a grand old idea.So I began by sending out my son and two of his best mates with 400 blokes to the nearest town, where we had an honourable of 500 vs 45 men. Naturally, we won and peacefully looted the place, and paid the locals to pick up a spear and help us do it again.Our neighbours were honourable men who promptly got eaten by some nobody clan nearby who in half a year managed to have seven provinces; I had two. In the winter of Japan, we fought a great battle; a whole 700 people took part, a great size of blood and glory. I gave a speech in Japanese; naturally I can't speak a damn word, but rather than learn the language, life conviently provided subtitles so I wouldn't have to try and learn it. As we fought, I had an advisor shout at me in stereotypical Jinglish about the honour of my family and soldiers. We lined up, we ran at each other, and I sneezed. As I looked up, the enemy had broken and run and my advisor was now screaming at me about the honour of our win. Alright then.I asked if we could develop our technology, to allow us an advantage. My advisor told me I could either research how to stab better, or I could research some poetry and make everyone feel happier about me ruling them.We went with the stabbing route. They'd give some flowery prose about honour and balance, but it was just how to better stab people. My population was unhappy? Stab them. Clan unhappy? Stab them. Enemy unhappy? Stab them. We went for... Total War!Now, war is waged not just on the battlefield, but also by cloak and dagger. We began to hire people with a certain set of skills, skills that make life difficult for our enemies. First was the ninja; after we decided to build an entire building just for him, he agreed to work for us. He began to open gates for us, but then we realised we can just climb up the hill of dirt that is our castles. Then we asked him to sabotage buildings, but then we realised we would have to repair it later. Then we asked him to kill the other leaders; after only 10 years of constantly getting caught and showing us the comics later of how he did it every single time he failed (and he only ever did the same thing, again and again), he began to kill with semi-regularity. The new recruits? We forced them to stay on the gate of each town and look for suspicious people.Then we hired the metsuke, or the police guy. After we had to build him a whole building for himself as well (not wanting to be second best to the guy in pyjamas), he then leaves the town (and not needing the building anyway) and spends him time sending monks to jail, and telling people to quiet down when they complain about the fires and stabbings. All in all, not a bad investment.Lastly, we built a Temple and the monks came; they had the special power of making the enemy feel a little bit bad about themselves. Ultimately, we just had them sit in towns were foreigners came. You see, if you wanted the guns, you had to get the Christianity as well (Americans, amirite?), so we had the monk walk behind the Christians and refute everything they said, seemed to do well enough. We remained sufficiently Buddist, and in the spirit of Buddism, we continued our war.During the war, we began to trade with other countries. Now, we had an ally trading with China; they said no. ""But we're friends?"" Yes, they replied, but if you want us to share trading with one of the biggest countries in the world, you'll have to declare war with us. ""But you only have one trade ship, how can you possibly be trading with all of China? Why don't you have Beijing, and we have Shanghai?"" HOJI DOESN'T SHARE TRADE! So we went to war for some silk.After about 30 years of conquering, making vassals, having those vassal betray us, re-conquering vassals and burning them to the ground after learning our lesson, we eventually conquered Japan. Just in time for the Americans to conquer us later in the expansion.			"

												Best of the recent-ish Total War Games, but just starting to show some of the bad DLC practises which came in Rome 2 and Attila.Pros:- Easily replayable, and actually using your factions specific traits can make them fun and diverse.- Lots of cinematics to go with the story of your bid for the Shogunate.- Fall of the Samurai is hella fun and adds a lot to the game.- Hero units feel like heroes. They ****ing butcher everyone else.- The voice acting is great. There's a lot of passion in it to help deepen the immersion. (THIS IS A SHAMEFUR DISPRAY!)- Being able to recruit new generals from the rank-and-file if they lead an army to victory in the absence of an actual general is cool.- Gunpowder units are well-balanced in the base game. They require excellent tactical manouverings to actually do well, but if you get them into a good position, and prevent them from being engaged in melee, and stop them from hitting your own troops too much, then they will rek all shiz.- I like the tech trees, they're real frickin' nito. And the encylopedia has some nice little history tidbits for each unit.Cons:- THOSE ****ING LOADING TIMES, SRS- Rise of the Samurai doesn't really do anything for me, I find it dull compared to the base game and Fall of the Samurai.- It's honestly easier to play exactly the same for every faction; lots of yari ashigaru to pin your enemy in place whilst bow ashigaru (or bow samurai later in the game) do all the killing.- There is no unit variety; even the factions unique units are just the same as everyone else for the most part but with higher stats (there are a few exceptions), and the rest of the armies are exactly the same but for their colour scheme.- Defending a castle is laughably easy, which rather goes against the history that the feudal Japanese preferred to sally out and fight their foe on the battlefield.- Attacking a castle is extremely hard, until you get the long-range bow troops like warrior monks or daikyu samurai. Then it becomes easy.- Actually using your generals in combat is always a last resort; since most of all armies have either yari or naginata, your general will get slaughtered if he gets into combat for the most part. You can dismount them of course, but that weakens them anyway to a degree. Again, kind of clashes with the reputation of the lords rarely if ever shying away from getting into the thick of things.- Gunpowder units are borderline haxx in castle defence. Unless the Date are attacking, dem Bulletproof Samurai are pretty coo'.- The food surplus system isn't great. Kind of annoying at times. FotS removes that though.It's a great game though, despite all the flaws I list; I personally am just better at picking out the bad bits I feel. I've invested a huge amount of time into playing this game; it's a lot of fun and you should definitely get it over Rome II or Attila.			"

												First of all, I haven't played all games of the Total War franchise, only Medieval 2 and a bit of Rome 2, but Shogun 2 was the best so far. Its really captivating and its one of those games which can tie you to your chair for hours and hours, just like Anno 1503. I'm not bad at strategy games but I think that even for strategy newbies this game will be easily understandable and enjoyable.Pros:   -The setting. Feudal Japan is cool, Samurais are cool, Ninjas are cool, being Shogun is cool.-The graphics. Ok, the map is not the eyecatcher here but the battles are. The details are amazing and you can follow each samurai until his death.-Intuitive control and UI. Its impressive how easy to understand this game is. The principles and priorities are clear, you don't have to search for anything and the interfaces for diplomacy, trading and all that stuff are well done.-Sound in general. Wether its the effects, the music or voices (the japanese accent sounds great), everything feels right.-The campaign. Its pretty long and its full of surprises, you can always do something in a different way than you did before.-The characters. I'm talking about the generals, daimyos, ninjas, metsukes and all these people. I got pretty attached to them and it was exciting to see how they grew with the time (plus the skilltrees are awesome).Cons:-After you've finished the big campaign, there ain't much to do, you can go for the DLC's like Rise of the Samurai and Fall of the Samurai, but if you want to play the campaign again I noticed that you don't get any more clans that you can play, like in Medieval 2 for instance.-Sometimes you have to repeat battles (if you mustn't lose them) and it can get pretty frustrating after the 17th try.Conclusion:I highly recommend this game and if you enjoy feudal japan and strategy games, get this game. Now.			"

												Shogun 2 is a masterpiece.The game is already five years, soon six years old, but remains the best Total War up to date. Everything is there, every aspect or part of the game is in perfect synergy with all other aspects of the game. You want good graphics? The Shogun graphics are still on par with Rome 2 or even Warhammer Total War. The weather is so unbelievable well made, one time a thunder cracked in the distance of the map, I thought it was a movie.You can see sakura petals flying with the winds. If the enemy is sneaking up on you through some forest, sometimes wild animals running from them may warn you. The campaign map is incredibly good. The artwork immerses you immensely into the game, 'til you either won your campaign, or another Clan wipes you off the face of the earth (damn you, f***** Takeda).You want good battlefield animations? The ones from Shogun 2 are still the best compared to other Total Wars. Some dueling animations are godsend. The dying animation is by far the best in Shogun 2. You want everything else? It's all there, from japanese voices to gifting units in multiplayer coop-campaigns. The Avatar-system in Multiplayer is unrivaled and has not been seen in any other Total War. Want to name some of your Multiplayer-units ""Coldstream Guards""/""Stormtroopers""/""My mamas♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;? Then f******** do it.Heck, you now what? Imma phone right now the Louvre, why the ♥♥♥♥ didn't they display this game there instead of tat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Mona Lisa?Because this game is ART.Shogun is LOVE.Shogun is LIFE.5/7 would play again and forever.

												""We forge our own destiny. We are as ronin — wandering samurai without a master.""-Henchmen 21 to Henchmen 24Imagine playing a game for five hours only to get yourself in a situation where you cannot win and your last recoverable save was an hour ago.  Only to recover as you sacrificed a few provinces for your armies to retreat to a defendable position like the hot gates.  As the filthy Oda peasants amass for a siege, your general screams ""THIS IS KAGA"" as he Shogun kicks a captured ninja into a well.  Your elite warriors line up side by side and make short work of the peasant army armed with pitch forks as your men's katanas gleam with blood and martensite.  Only to be slowly dwindled down by mass ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ peasant archers that have fire arrows, your elite samurai get picked off dishonoruably afar from a man in a loincloth. The actual gameplay for Shogun 2 is quite diverse.  From the economic and diplomatic standpoint the game is turned base, as you set up buildings for your provinces to build up to bargaining trade routes and exchanging sons and daughters to secure alliances.  Just be wary, the computer is very devious and in the end most alliances turn into treachery.Think of a RTS where instead of creating a new army for every different map/campaign mission you play, you maintain your army throughout the entire camaign (unless you get them killed).  It is quite simplified compared to past Total War games, and if you have ever been interested in the Total War series I'd recommend this one.			"

												Total War: SHOGUN 2 is a strategy game from Creative Assembly and the next installment of the Total War franchise. The game is set in mainland Japan in the 16th century in the aftermath of the Ōnin War during the Ashikaga Shogunate. You play as one of the Japanese clan and aim to become the new Shogun.Total War: SHOGUN 2 retain much of gameplay from the previous Total War, with some of it improved or changed to suit the Japanese culture. The game feature less units variety since all of them are Japanese, but each faction has their own bonus and unique traits, and each general and character now has specialization which can be unlocked as they gain experience from battles. Generals can also be appointed to some positions thereby increasing their loyalty to the faction.Graphics in Total War: SHOGUN 2 are improved and there is a DLC that enables blood and gore effects. Units animation are better improved than in Empire: Total War or Napoleon: Total War and will animate better when garrisoning in castle or fort walls. Water shader has also been improved. With all these graphics, Total War: SHOGUN 2 yet has far better performance than the previous game, it's so polished.Multiplayer in Total War: SHOGUN 2 takes different approach from the previous game. Multiplayer campaign also make a return here. Multiplayer battles now will be played through avatar conquest mode. It's a fine addition in multiplayer mode. Total War: SHOGUN 2 multiplayer battles now also protected by VAC from Valve.Total War: SHOGUN 2 is great sequel of Total War series. This game is even better as this is the most polished and best Total War for me, now also has Steam Workshop support so custom content can be made and downloaded easily. This is the best Total War game yet, I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

												Released on Steam in March 2011, Shogun 2 was a long awaited game for by fans who enjoyed the first game and fans were not let down with this installment in the series. I had pre-ordered this game and paid full price, I was only upset that a few short months later is dropped to half price. Otherwise the game is very addicting to play.The game story takes place during 1467 to 1477 where all the nations in Japan came to war, a war that involved the Ashikaga shogunate and the territorial lords. The result of this massive power struggle three individuals would emerge who would unite Japan under one rule. You play one of the warlords who is to dominate the other clans and rule the whole of Japan.Those who are familiar with the Total War series will know what to expect in this game, but for those who are looking for a medieval Japanese strategy game, like me, will probably find this game overwhelming at first.I found this game difficult to get into from the start and learn what to do. The tutorials really help with the controls and how to do things in Shogun 2. You need to build, manage your clan, scout and war. When it comes to fighting another army you can let the game auto resolve it or you can go into battle mode.When you are in battle mode fighting another army, you will find yourself in a whole new mode, commanding your forces and setting up how they will advance and what formation they will be in. I really like this mode because its interesting to see how your battle is actually going and how you will react to the fight. The game holds allot more, sea battles using ships, storming castles and ninjas.There are cut scenes during play, such as when you send a trained ninja out to assassinate an enemy force. You will get to see a successful attempt or one where the ninja fails.The tutorial at the start to help you learn to play is very helpful and the Japanese geisha girl voice is a nice touch to help you learn what to do. The multiplayer portion of the game requires you to join a Total War Shogun 2 group and then you get to view a map of Japan and place your avatar on. Beyond this I haven't figured out how it plays out as there isn't any option to go to a ground to ground battle or auto resolve it. I am sure its something simple to do but I haven't been able to figure it out.Overall the game is hard to understand how to play and takes some time to learn. The multiplayer side I found very hard to understand and troublesome to figure out. I do enjoy playing it but its one I have been able to put down and wait a long time to get back into. I think I will have to give this another try sometime soon.I haven't gotten to the point of dominating all of Japan or anything but I do like the whole game because you get to fight during a most interesting time in Japans history and that period is a time of Total War!Pro'sSamurai's an NinjasVery detailed and historically accuratePersonal control over battles or automatically resolveMusicDLC adds more clan's to play asCon'sHard to comprehendCut scenes are repeatedMultiplay isn't as easy to understandVery large downloadCVGAnton's Ratingːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starː

												Easily the best Total War game they ever created. The art style, the music, Samurai skewering each other with Yari and Katana, the beautiful campaign and battle maps - everything is just polished to perfection. They captured the feel of 16th century Japan with the art style and music so perfectly that you get totally immersed in the game. I'm not even a fan of Japanese history but this game does such a perfect job of capturing the feel of it that I simply love it. The expansions (especially Fall of the Samurai) are both excellent. In fact I would consider Fall of the Samurai to be one of the best expansions ever created for any game.If you only ever buy one Total War game then let it be this one. Don't even waste your time with Rome 2 or Attila, just get Shogun 2. It is the highest point of the franchise before it all came crumbling down with Rome 2: Total Fail.			"

												==Shogun 2== Review	For players looking to dive into a vast map of a surprisingly accurate representation of Japan, waging war with innocent coastal tribes, all the while attempting to usurp the Shogunate for ultimate power. Looking for a TL;DR?TL;DR Shogun 2 is the best representation of the Total War style game since the original release of Rome 1. The Expansion DLC's help to add additional features on top of an already winning formula.---The Good--	-Map Navigation and Army Stacking has yet to be overhauled like it was with Rome 2. The classic form of 20 unit cards created from a city can be moved about the map without the need for a General.	-As bad as the AI can get in total war games, Shogun 2 manages to maintain a certain level of not headlong rushing into your spears and archer lines. However this is often the case when playing on lower difficulties. We are not talking about high capacitive thinking AI opponents but at least they dont charge into a meat grinder as consistently as previous entries.	-Shogun 2 released on the cusp of CA attempting to nickle and dime players out of playable factions and unit packs. That being said the core game does not falter under the weight (or lack there of) of these numerous fluff DLC packs. Rest safely in the knowledge that the vanilla game is just as grand as the fluffed out version.	-Battle UI is clean and unintrusive (I am looking at you Rome 2). Abilities and unit flags are easy to read and are distinguishable at a glance.	-Graphics Presentation; what can I say besides how amazing this game looks years after its initial launch. It is unfortunate that one of the best visual moments is locked behind a dlc purchase. This moment being a close zoom up to your samurai cutting limbs off his adversary among a field of flowers with blood spraying forth, in stark contrast to the beauty of the landscape. Cough up 1.59 for the Bloodpack, it's worth it.	-If you are a Mod person I shouldn't have to tell you Shogun 2 fully supports mods. Go forth and mod to your hearts content.--The Bad--	-AI charging into meat grinders. When it happens boy does it happen in spectacular fashion. Balls of Japanese soldiers ordered to their demise by crashing like a wave upon fixed spear or matchlock units behind baracades. When it happens make sure the blood is turned on.	-Most of the issues stem from the AI functionality, auto resolve with Sea Battles is entirely one sided in favor of the AI even when the player holds the advantage. Be aware of attempting piracy through vicarious means.	-Realm Divide. Diplomacy in Shogun 2 works well enough that the player can create long established trade routes and alliances with AI controlled factions throughout the majority of a playthrough. However; there is a functional game design choice that follows history a little too closely resulting in unfun gameplay past a certain point. If a player is unaware of what a ""Realm Divide"" is, it is entirely possible to lose everything within a few turns of the event triggering. Doubly so if players deside to invest in early game AI diplomacy and treaties. It is a balancing issue and design choice that requires save scumming to prevent the worst outcome (especially if going into the late game blind) creating needless frustration. For those unaware; Realm Divide is an event that happens when your clan is influential enough that the current Shogunate desides you are a threat to his rule. A cool idea if implemented properly. The incarnation of Realm Divide we got was the entire country turning on the player on a single turn. The AI forceably burns all of your bridges and can immediately attack any of your forign armies within any province. Previous allies always turn on you, there is no way to even buy their loyalty. In terms of a history vs gameplay decsicion I would have liked to see a threshold for diplomatic allies to stay as an ally if their loyalty were high enough. Alas this is not the case and the player always loses potentially useful allies.--The Meh--	-DLC; it's is a sore spot for many people. Understandably so as the number of skin packs, unit packs, Blood effect packs, faction packs, ect. (I could go on and on) is just staggering. Nearly all of the DLC for Shogun 2 is fluff and not necessary, outside the actual expansions, Rise and Fall of the Samurai, the dlc can be ignored entirely.			"

												Shogun 2 and its expansion Fall of the samurai is so far the best Total war game and one of the best strategy games of all time. Great Avatar conquest system in multiplayer. Nothing similar created in other TW games. All those faction systems are not even a bit as deep as  Avatar conquest in Shogun 2. Veterans, skills creation of your personal army. Nothing can compare with this. Yes it is really rough to new players. But if you have enough patience eventually you will enjoy Avatar conquest like nothing else before. The main negative feature of multiplayer of Shogun 2 in my humble opinion is that CA don't give a damn about this game any more and so they don't put any effort to it to make it better, they don't patch the game. Nothing. As for single player I find it really good as well. As far as I remember it is the first game where food system was implemened. So you get not just money but also food as the resource you always need to check and watch thoroughly. Also I really like coalition system as you grow strong and everyone else are turning against you even your vassals and allies. This feature makes you plan your strategy really caferully trying not to overextend too much. And that's great because for example in Rome 2 you just pierce through your enemies like a knife through butter and no one can stop you in the late game at all, so in the mid game you simply lose interest to game process because of no challenge what so ever. Overall I recomend this game to all RTS fans, it's totally worth its money.			"

 First sorry for my english.     Sotto la recensione in italiano. Total War Shogun 2 is a game released in 2011, remake of the first chapter, and isa mixed real-time strategy and turn-based strategy. Exponent of the seriesdeveloped by The Creative Assembly is set in feudal Japan era(2 different era in total with dlc), and has the best online multiplayer of all total war.This game is mainly based on the military part of both land and sea.Pros   Many languages ​​available Mod support and Steam Workshop Steam cards, cloud and achievement Good tutorial Pleasant encyclopedia Present demo Outstanding multiplayer Graphics and excellent sound Replayable and high longevity Fun naval battles Valve Anti-Cheat and Statistics RPG elements and agents Introduction heroes Improved ia More tactical in combat Diplomacy and management phase Complete options Unified launcher Atmosphere and interesting period Pleasing ui Few bugsCons   High price Heavy graphics Download and occupied significant space on disk Long loadings Linux and steam OS not present Dlc not always useful Variety of units Easy to learn hard to master Multiplayer access is difficult for newbies Sieges improvable Pathfinding inaccurateIt 'amazing game, stands out in the whole francise total war. The mods are a side dish to a game already with a solid foundation and the multiplayer is particularly rich and attended by many veterans.The dlc recommended to buy with reserve is the dawn of the samurai, the others could be free dlc.You have to be passionate of Japan to enjoy it fully.Very nice in all its parts presents an encyclopedia and many feutures of steam, butthe loadings can be frustrating.An advice , as usual try the demo, because the game is atypical for the series, with reduced maps to Japanand all factions have roughly the same units.The graphics are still great and the bugs are very few.The artistic and stylistic rendering is excellent. Hard to find major flaws; the variety of combat tactics is commendable.Finally the historical period is interesting and little explored.graphics 8.5sound 8.5longevity 9gameplay 9Rating 9/10 vote with mod 9.5 / 10Shogun 2 campaign voting base: 9 (this is the basic game, totally awesome)Vote campaign Dawn of the Samurai: 7 (is the poorest campaign set in the XII century Japan)Purchase price recommended under $ 5 per base game (note that the game was released in a bundle) and $ 10 per collection and under $ 0.80 for Blood Pack DLC (not present in the collection).Mod recommended:""Radious"" (improves the game in all the main areas and adds a number of units) in particular is divided in 2 versions for each game period (for each era installed base mod ,and the package that adds more units).""DarthMod: Shogun II SW"" that does the same; very customizable.

A strategist that respects his self, must have this game in his library.Harsh words, harsh truth, if you don't have this masterpiece in your collection, you are not worthy of playing strategy games. Shogun 2, in my humble opinion, is the last completed, balanced and well-made TW game that was released. While Rome 2 and Atilla are good on their own ends, they are miles away from this gem of the genre (not to add they where a bit of a mess upon release).Shogun 2 takes place in the same time period as Shogun 1, the Sengoku Jidai, the age of the country at war as they said. By 1545, the current Shogunate's power has dwindled, leaving the clans of Japan at each other's throats in a struggle for supremacy. Your task is to increase the power of your clan, expand your influence and conquer Kyoto to become the new Shogun. The Japanese martial culture is a fascinating subject for many people (me included) and it's a wonder to see it in action.Shogun's armies and maps look astonishing. Each unit has incredible levels of detail, like a demon mask here, a moustache there, a crescent-shaped helm and many more. The soldiers look diverse in a way we never before saw in massive scale battles. CA raised the bar too much, with amazing season-specific effects and splendid work with the textures, especially the rain. The music feels traditional, epic, and downright dashing. It will accompany you in every battle, victory or defeat, fitting the pace of the battle and you might find yourself searching it on youtube afterwards (I strongly reccomend Yoisa, Now and Zen, Ona Hei and more). It's an ♥♥♥♥♥♥, especially for fans of folk japanese music. The accents and intonations of your advisors and on the map are also incredible, especially in the heat of battle. You can almost see them spittle as they scream ""OUR TROOPS ARE RUNNING FROM THE BATTLEFIELD! A SHAMEFUL DISPLAY!""As always in the TW games, you got two phases: the turn-based phase, and the battle phase. In the first phase, you manage your clan and make your decisions as each season plays out, and in the second one you lead your armies to glorious victory or humiliating defeat.In the early stages of the campaign, diplomacy is a key factor. Even more so on higher difficulties, where the AI is merciless in its demands both on you and the other clans. It gives them a sense of personality: they can break relationships as easily as they come to you bearing gifts and asking for arrangements. Alliances feel fragile as every Daimyo wishes to become Shogun, and everyone is enemy to everyone. But your ""trustworthy"" allies are the least of your concerns: the AI will not hesitate tou backstab you and capture your capital, if it finds no resistance. These kind of surprise attacks and army landings on your shores make the game special: you never know where and when an attack will come from. When it comes to battles, just play it on Hard. In early levels, the AI is too easy to beat, forming small armies and making many mistakes in its deployment. But in Hard, it's a whole new story. The AI tries to flank you with cavalry, it's more aggresive, it bides its time and looks for weak spots in your formation. The game is merciless to you on higher settings, and you must be careful as you wage war against it.On the downside, as much as I'm trying to find flaws, only one comes to mind: unit diversity. Buying the DLCs gives you some extra, unique for each factions units, but in the end (and the basic version), every clan has the same ashigaru, the same samurai, the same monks. They differ in attack and defence, depending on the clan's traits. It gets a bit repetitive and somewhat tiring after a while, but I'm willing to look past it.Shogun 2 is the Total War series at its best moments, and boasts the most outrageous helmets in martial history. Daimyō no tame!RATING:Gameplay: 9/10Presentation: 10/10Story: 9.5/10Unique Factor: Replayability: 9.5/10OVERALL: 9.5/10 "

												It's my favorite total war game. Fall of the Samurai pack gives me a chance to experience line infantry battles as well as samurai battles, while shogun 2 leaves me a wonderful memory of senkoku jidai. If you like Japan history, you can purchase  this game. If you like line infantry, you can also purchase this game.			"

												Best Total War game besides Medieval 2.  Pros: - Multiplayer Campaign, which Medieval 2 does not have- Good Unit Mesh when fighting, again a plus over Medieval 2- Excellent Graphics- Good Agent Interaction and Diplomacy- Fun Time Period- BLOOD SPLATTER PACK- Overall Game feels great and a blast to playCons:- Not Much Unit Diversity- If you play multiplayer skirmish, or manage to get into a game, only experts play now- Historical Battles aren't great.Overall one of my favorite games of all time, and probably the best total war to start with for new players because of the limited unit diversity.  I would buy this game again over any of the other total wars.10/10			"

												The Best Total War? This game is one of my favourite total war titles and theres many reasons why. Not only does it have a backdrop that suits the gameplay elements extremely well but it really puts you in some challenging situations for players of any degree. - Competetive units (Everything has a match) - Fully strategic and continuously challenging campaign - Various DLC to keep it fresh - A beautiful Japan to explore and conquer This game really bought back the spirit of what makes a total war game great. The fact that you feel as if you are part of the battle and every decision is crucial to your success. Overall i would extremely recommend you getting this game.			"

												Having played this game for like 200+ Hours i gotta say i'm giving it a 100% good review and i will explain why i recommend this game to anyone who has interest on Japanese History. Pros- The game has an authentic array of units at its disposal- The campaign is so realistic than anyone who controls Kyoto shall be involved in the Realm Divide wherein all the family clans in Japan will become your worst enemies- The best thing about Shogun is the agents. Why? is because they can make a difference in the game like Sabotaging Armies, Committing Arson and Assasinating Generals and Faction leaders. Aside from that they can administer settlements and apprehend spies from other factions- The movement points that you can build a railway to easily transport armies across Japan- The General can rally and inspire wavering troops that are falling back - Lastly offcourse no Total War game would be complete without the battle. The battle has a new animation system that you can even see Samurai decapitating enemy warriors and blood splurting all around the battlefield.Cons- I can't think of a bad review for the game the only thing that bothers me is the price of the DLC's so if you want to play this game better buy it on Sale just like what i did.

												Total War: SHOGUN 2 is a strategy game set in feudal Japan, and is a turn based strategy game. The game has two major mechanics I will get briefly into here. After you have chosen your clan you will see a map of Japan, and where you have your units and town. This map isn't the entire game by far, but here you have an overview of how you run your lands by building necessary building for your war effort, diplomacy and gathering resources and researching technology. You will also have a family tree where members can grow up to be leaders or the women can be wed to form alliances or make them stronger. Basically you govern everything from this map.The major strength of this game is the battles however. When you enter a battle you will enter the zone from the map you are either attacking or defending, and is where the game gets more complex for strategy fanatics. If you have 80 men attacking you will see 80 detailed men on your side in formations you can change, and the same goes for 1200 men which make battles huge and impressive as you see them battle it out. The various formations and approach you can make is extremely fun, and even the terrain and weather has an affect of how everything will play out. This also means you can win despite being severely outnumbered if you somehow manage to use the terrain to your own advantage. Generals also play a huge role here as they give better morale and can add buffs to units as well. There are also many units in the game, and this is not counting the DLC's out there either. I found this game to be impressive and extremely fun too and challenging. I certainly enjoyed this game and if you like any form of strategy game you should consider this, especially if you like samurai, ninja or is just fascinated by feudal Japan!			"

												Shogun 2 is, by far, the only decent TW game that has been made using Warscape engine. The AI gives a challenge in the campaign map a big chunk of the time, province development and realm prosperity saw some really nice improvements like food supplies (vanilla and ROTS only), limited building slots, taxation level penalties and trade enrichment. Diplomacy is required to survive and you will be doing more than just declaring/getting declared wars; you need trade as much as taxes. There's also an incredible sense of balance for all clans, given that they all have the same units and all clans differ in that some of these units have their name and are slightly more powerful. This is a big no-no for people who have played other titles and enjoyed the diversity that each faction gave; in fact playing with different factions in Shogun 2 might feel repetitive. I honestly prefer this, since Creative Assembly has proven that they tend to make some factions with extremely OP units and some factions with terrible ones when they put too many of them in a game.Having said this, this game is not perfect. Here's why:- Warscape engine. Really, almost every negative aspect will be related to this terrible piece of software.- 1v1 and blobbing. If you've played Medieval 2 and RTW, you know what it means to see your units spreading out, pushing or getting pushed by the sheer mass of bodies they're fighting. Shogun 2 has none of that. You're going to get constantly trapped in sieges when fighting in a gate with your katana wielding masters against 1 unit of the weakest, exhausted of melee units because units do not have mass in this game. It's ugly to look at, and it hinders gameplay.- Sieges. Supposed to be dynamic and innovative from your usual ""storm the walls and fight in the streets"" approach from the other TW games. But thanks to the blobbing, it's a nightmare to fight and requires constant AI abusing or an insulting amount of troops to get just one stronghold. (lowest of castle level)- (vanilla-ROTS) Ranged units are like homing missile launchers. You don't even need artillery to capture a castle, just the best of archers who can shoot with god-like precision above 15 meters of stone wall and some decent melee units.- Lack of a castle-preview mechanic. It's impossible to form a strategy and say what kind of troops/how many would it require to protect a province if I can't see the castle in question.- AI, although the best of all TW games so far, it's still incredibly stupid sometimes. In legendary difficulty, when defending a siege, they'll keep a quarter of their troops in an area where there aren't even enemies around and let their castle be taken by timer; when attacking, they'll send 50% of their troops to scale the same part of the wall. They also tend to spam useless artillery units (in FOTS, even if they can make Parrott/Armstrong guns, they'll make wooden cannons instead).- Difficulty settings. Directly connected to the above point; the developers knew that they couldn't make a proper AI that could actually give you a strategic and tactical challenge, so they instead gave them insane bonuses the higher the difficulty. Their troops fight better, their economy lets them have 2 full armies even with just one province. This doesn't improve your experience at all or rewards a master strategist, it just forces you to find more ways to abuse the AI.- Unit pathfinding and individual AI for regiments is terrible as it always has been. You'll suffer it more in FOTS, where 1 soldier who got stuck somewhere makes the entire unit not able to shoot.- Terrible optimization. Unless you got an SSD capable of storing the almost 20GB of this game, expect the game to take around 2 minutes to boot and almost a minute to load one battle. Don't get excited, however, because with an SSD these loading times get reduced to half.P.D.: Almost all of these issues could be fixed if CA just completely botched Warscape and spent more resources on the AI department. But they won't, and they're still developing and releasing games having learned nothing of their flaws. So I heartily recommend this game because, despite it's flaws, it's the only decent modern Total War game you're going to get in years to come. It's fun, in a very casual way. Just don't expect deep strategy gameplay.			"

												Me and a friend started up a coop campaign. I was the Takeda and he was the Uesugi.After we started the game he reminded me (because I hadn't played the game much) that pretty much every unit in the game had a spear and my focus was cavalry. foooooookSo I start the rise of my great empire like any other great empire by sending off one of my two generals to die in a hopeless battle to remind me that literally everyone in Japan has a pike so why the ♥♥♥♥ am I still using cavalry.Undaunted by the loss I decide to fortify in my province of Kai. I begin training some Ashigaru and upgrading my stables and lands. My Uesugi ally does the same, except he isn't stupid like me so he actually has an army. Inevitably the clan he starts at war with enters his lands. But then winter sets in so they decide to leave cause they can't handle a few snowflakes.A few turns later and my ancient enemy of like six turns has been conquered by my ally's ancient enemy of like five turns and they declare war upon me. That's alright Takeda shall stand strong. Too bad my other ally, the Imagawa, decided they don't wanna be friends without benefits anymore so they ♥♥♥♥ off. That's alright I didn't need them anyways. I still have my ally at Uesugi and his vassal.Well when♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan, it hits the fan hard. The Hojo, my southern neighbor, seeing my decimated army as a weakness decrare war. ♥♥♥♥. I am now surrounded by enemies so I decide I'm just gonna be a ♥♥♥♥♥ and hide in my castle. In a few turns the Hojo send an army to my border and I prepare for the worst to come.However, they change their mind and decide that fighting me is too hard so they go pick on my ally's vassal and they get wreckt n shrekt. And to make matters worse the Anegakoji have invaded Takeda lands to the north and are pounding on the gates of Kofu.The Daimyo has decided enough is enough and sallies out of the castle to meet the Anegakoji. While their army attacks the castle, the Daimyo's son, Yoshinobu, leads the cavalry out of the eastern gates and surges before the enemies rear lines crushing their archers, killing their general and delivering a crushing blow.With that army defeated we prepare to face the Hojo horde that is bound to arrive from the east. However news has arrived from the Uesugi. The Anegakoji to his west have invaded but were ultimately crushed by their army. However to make matters somehow impossibly worse it would seem the Ikko Ikki have taken over Etchu and are now waging war against the Uesugi, all seems lost.And yet from the jaws of defeat comes victory and survival. The Uesugi have decided that they are going to abandon everything in their captial and assist me by taking Shinano to my north. I say he's bloody mad and going to lose us the game. He says that it's ingenius and to shut up.Regardless I have no say in the matter and can only watch from the edge of my seat in terror as two armies appear on his border as soon as he leaves his capital undefended, one from the Anegakoji and another from the Ikko Ikki. It would also seem at this time that the Hojo have decided to invade Kai and an army appears on my eastern border.First to the fight is the Anegakoji to the southwest of Uesugi. They are torn asunder and retreat back from whence they came. But now the Hojo attack Kofu and I must prepare myself. The Hojo arrive at the city having torched the valley behind them my Daimyo gives a heroic speech and decrares we shall take no prisoners.We meet them on the open field of battle. My Yari Ashigaru, who form the center shall be the bait for my trap, charge the enemy head on uncaring of losses. They strike the enemy with the force of a tidal wave and yet it seems that it barely put a dent in their line. But it matters not, for my Katana Cavalry have arrived on the enemies left with the Daimyo's son to destroy their line. And yet even they do not have enough of a force to rout the Hojo. So I order my Daimyo to attack with the two thirds of the Takeda cavalry.Cutting through the enemy like a death star through alderaan we completely destroy the Hojo army with barely a hundred fleeing the field of battle. However it comes a great cost with nearly all of our horses killed and half of the Ashigaru dead, it is a pyrrhic victory in every concievable sense of the word.However we do not despair. Our Uesugi allies have taken Shinano to the north and somehow retaken their capital from the Ikko Ikko army that had captured it. And so we begin to rebuild our force and in time advance through the valley to the east intent on returning the favor to the traitorous Hojo.After reaching the border we spot the enemy army on a range of hills to the north. And so we advance upon them our cavalry yet again giving us a glorious victory. However terrible news has come from the west. The Imagawa sensing that our capital is undefended decrare war against us. And so the Daimyo's son races back to Kofu to save the city.The Imagawa are at our walls before we know what has happened. But it seems that Yoshinobu has arrived with the Takeda cavalry just in time. With the Daimyo leading the defense of the city with a small Ashigaru garrison, some given to us by our ally Uesugi, distract the enemy spearmen at the walls while our reinforcements come in from behind. Looking to be a repeat of the earlier siege I begin to celebrate but then realize that those are indeed hundreds of spearmen charging at my cav.Taking but inflicting heavy casualties upon the Imagawa I pull my cavalry back to the east gate with barely a total of thirty living. However, upon cresting the hill I notice a massive horde of enemy Yari Ashigaru approaching. Deciding that I'm going to go out on fall of the Samurai levels of badassary I charge the enemy with my thirty horsemen.Miraculously the very first unit my horsemen encounter on their charge it the enemy Daimyo. And after about ten seconds of fighting he is slain. This causes the enemy army, which is about 40 times larger than my horsemen to shatter and rout. Amazed my Daimyo charges to save his son n friends from any remaining foes.Having lost nearly my entire army in the battle I decide to be a ♥♥♥♥♥ again and watch the Uesugi. My ally has once again abandoned his captial, which once again is under immediate threat of invasion by the Ikko Ikki. He conquers a towny held by an enemy I didn't even know he was at war with and runs back to defend his capital just in time yet again. MOFO is a lucky sonova♥♥♥♥♥.Destined to be eternally stuck in my capital the Hojo are attacking again and it seems the Imagawa aren't far behind.I defeat the Hojo army in the open field yet again with my cavalry taking minor losses and fall back to defend Kofu once again.But this time was not destined to be like the others. Yoshinobu, like a well practiced routine, takes the cavalry to destroy the enemy from behind. Everything is going well enough to plan. Enemy archers, dead. Enemy spearmen, fighting but losing at the east gate. Enemy cavalry dead from a prolonged engagement.Somehow, t'would seem. The enemy general, by himself and himself alone, has snuck into the castle and is now twenty seconds away from ultimate victory through pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and luck. But no, I can make it! I order all of my forces inside to banzai the general and retake the tower. Beginning their charge I can only watch in desparation then horror as I realize they won't make it. With barely ten paces between my troops and the enemy general the timer reaches zero. And I lose my only city.			"

												This game might possibly be the best strategy game I have ever played in my entire life. Shogun 2 introduces a great morale system, it has a great Co-op campaign where I can take on all of Japan with one of my buddies. The other clans in the campaign react perfectly depending on what you did and how you treated the other clans. This game has provided me with the most fun and entertainment then any game I have ever played and I played over 100 different game titles, its a must have for all the strategy game lovers out there.10/10			"

He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks.All warfare is based on deception.Shogun 2 is an exceptional strategy game that is supported by it's powerful atmosphere as it enters the Sengoku period. It's soundtrack also attempts to tie in a Japanese cultural theme, while also sounding a bit interesting. Graphically, I think the game also looks pretty decent. You're given the objective of taking over Japan in it's days of constant war, to become Shogun. You'll be able to make allies with clans that, historically, would have fought you to the death, like making allies with the Uesugi as the Takeda. There's even a multiplayer campaign mode you can play if you want to conquer Japan with a friend, or against one. It's also quite immersive, thanks to the way the game presents every detail, such as a general's speech before battle, which changes as they grow more experienced.The game follows the premise of total war, strategy becomes key in most battles.The rules of the game are simple, break your enemies on the battlefield. The main goal isn't to kill everyone, but to be victorious and conquer. You can even watch the carnage on the battlefield, as the melee combat's visuals have greatly improved in the series. There's even naval combat, which also has some immersive details, like the sailors singing a song as the row towards the enemy, or burning the enemy ship and even boarding them. There's a lot of strategy, both on and off of the battlefield. In battle, most of the choice belongs to you, as your men won't give themselves orders. Off the battlefield, you will be making deals with other clans, you will be betrayed by allies, or you will betray them, and you will make unlikely allies in times of war. You will also trade with anyone because you will be poor after everyone tries to murder you. You'll revive clans that have been defeated by conquering their homeland and making them your vassal. You may even be defeated yourself in an attempt to overthrow the Shogunate.As the player, you are given absolute control over how you secure victory. There is no hand to guide you, other than your own, and you decide everything, like army composition, the strategy you employ, and how you plan to stab the others in back. There is much depth to the many aspects of the game, there's even an encyclopedia that explains the many things about this game, including the history of certain units, the function of skills that may be used in battle, and other various literary material. Now, let's get into detail about combat. It's fast paced and rewards decisive actions and quick strategic thinking, so there's a ton of micro-management.Well, unless you pause the game, but then again, there's still a lot of decision making.The UI makes it easy to understand the strengths and weakness of individual units, so you won't need to do research off the battlefield. Just hovering over the unit tells you what characteristics the unit has, so even novice commanders can play new units to their strengths, and many units provide interesting mechanics that expand on the gameplay. For example, a spear wall neutralizes enemy charges and is particularly deadly to cavalry, but it is incredibly vulnerable from the rear. Nodachi samurai have a lethal charge, but they can't hold out in a sustained battle, and katana samurai are powerful anti-infantry all-rounders. Naginata samurai are heavily armored and are strong against cavalry, but are slower than other units. Ninjas can use stealth and throw bombs, making them perfect battlefield assassins.The terrain and weather makes an impact on the battlefield too. If it's raining, fire arrows won't work, and more soldiers will slip off the side of castle walls when making a siege. Trees can conceal enemy forces, or perhaps you can use them to set an ambush. Gunpowder units can't fire over terrain like arrows can.Morale plays a huge role in the Total War series. In fact, it might be one of the most important thing in the series.Units with low morale will rout, causing chaos for an army. Psychologically breaking the enemy is key for this reason, as it could lead to defeat or victory, as it has in many real battles. A good commander knows when and where to strike, and how to do it as well. This is where that extra layer of complexity comes into the game. A decisive charge, for example, doesn't just kill troops. It breaks the troops in the unit when they see their friend get butchered. When a whole unit routs, other units watch in fear. A good commander exploits that knowledge. He doesn't just break them one by one, he tries his best to break all of them, and under the right conditions, it's very possible. Conditions that you can set up. Now, combine that decisive charge from earlier with a barrage of gunfire to the enemy, and then, combine that with the fact that you've just ambushed and killed the enemy general, and finally, put everything you have at the main force of the enemy and return victorious as you cut down the cowards. Welcome to Total War. ( End of the review for Total War: Shogun 2. )Below, I will briefly discuss the DLC, which should help you decide if you want them or not.DRAGON WAR BATTLE PACKIt's about the legendary samurai Saigo Takamori, and you get to live his famous battles.Saigo Takamori was probably one of the most influential samurai of his time, so if you're interested in the Boshin War, check out this guy on the internet or something.Anyways, this DLC isn't worth it because it is only six battles. You're better off with just getting Fall of the Samurai, because Fall of the Samurai comes with this anyways, along with a campaign and multiplayer.In terms of length, it took me about 3 hours on very hard, if that means anything to you.Rise of the SamuraiIn my experience and opinion, nowhere as interesting as the base game and Fall of the Samurai, as those two were simply more interesting eras, personally. It's just that the Sengoku period and the Boshin War were far more unique in terms of history. However, the thing is, if you prefer melee combat with bows instead of lots of gunfire, you may enjoy this over Fall of the Samurai. There's also a bigger emphasis on diplomacy, so there's a lot of political stuff going on. Agents are also different, and provide a different gameplay experience. Consider this DLC if you hate guns and love political intrigue.DLC UnitsNow we can move on to the 'Unit' DLC packs. Those, in my opinion, are quite ridiculous. Instead of adding extra unit variety in the base game, CA decides to put these units as DLC. This is why some people consider the game's multiplayer to be pay-to-win. Now, can you win without any of the DLC? Absolutely. I've beaten plenty of Fall of the Samurai avatars and heavy DLC Shogun 2 armies with the base game, before buying the DLC, but you get a lot less options when it comes to strategy as you don't have the flexibility that the other guys get. Now, is the DLC worth buying for pure 'fun'? I would say so. The units are more fun to use and generally they add a bit more spice to the game, even if you aren't playing multiplayer. However, it's still disappointing to see that this is where the Total War series decided to go all-out with the DLC milking, and it has gotten worse with every other release.			"

												Phenomenal installation of the Total War series. Shogun 2 exceeded all expectations and will forever be a ""golden age"" for the series. Utilizing the unique history of Japan and the time period while incorporating necessary RTS components is pulled off flawlessly. This is a game I spend a lot of time with for good reason. The historical knowledge gained from playing is always fun. Plays how you would expect a Total War game to play. If you're a fan of turn based strategy games or RTS battle games, This might be for you. ***warning can be found to induce addiction***Gameplay 9.5/10. Exceeded expectations. Very easy to get lost in ""Just one more turn"" Many in depth aspects that make your ability to either get extremely involved with every decision or let the AI take over some for you.Visual effects 8.5/10. A wall of flaming arrows is a thing of beauty.Graphics 8/10. Any RTS/TBS game on this scale will struggle to make each individual unit/building visually pleasing let alone a thing of beauty. Shogun 2 has in depth units and great castle design. Above average. Controls 9/10. As always I am a big fan of Total War in battle and campaign map controls. Very genre appropriate. Story 8.5/10. Total war games will always take a hit in this category with reason. You influence every aspect of the game with every choice from turn one. You either follow or re-write history. Sega and Creative assembly does everything they can to give you a historical perspective/background. The rating is given due to that.Replayability 10/10. This is a game you can play however you'd like. Dump hours into quick battles, hours into grand campaigns. Play as one faction three times, three factions once. If you enjoy multiplayer this Total War shows us how great of a multiplayer experience one can get from a TBS/RTS game.9/10. Beautiful. "

												Look at my play time on this game. More than nine hundred hours. Nine hundred hours ruling over clans, crushing rebellions, sabotaging castles, raising armies, commanding navies. Nine hundred hours keeping the peasantry happy with ♥♥♥♥♥houses and surplus food. Nine hundred hours giving diplomats express orders to walk into a room full of armed, angry men and flip them all off. Nine hundred hours maiming, butchering, burning, killing, conquering.Actual, for-real wars have lasted less time than nine hundred hours. Global crises have come and gone in nine hundred hours. Fortunes have been made and lost in nine hundred hours. The ten plages of Egypt didn't last nine hundred ♥♥♥♥ing hours, for goodness' sake. The twelve days of Christmas don't last nine hundred hours. Lent and Ramadan both last slightly longer than nine hundred hours.So give something up for Lent or, if you're Muslim, take your mind off how hungry you are during Ramadan by playing some Shogun 2.

												Shogun 2 is a must-have game for fans of the Total War series.Out of all the Total War games, Shogun 2 is perhaps the most expansive game with the highest average quality of graphics, content, and gameplay combined. You will find yourself in scenic Japan, conquering regions in Total War style as the blossoms flutter over your battleline. You will have plenty of choices and options for your empire and they are all meaningful in some way. You can embrace the new western technology and get yourself some guns, take on christianity or stick to the old ways, eventually becoming the ruler of Japan.All of this comes with you being able to manage your entire clan - Build your holdings, expand them, train units and send your military to where they're needed and command the battles yourself. Naval battles of ancient Japan(Floating castles and archers) are an interesting thing, with entirely new tactics to learn - Which you can do yourself. Just as battles on land are commanded by you personally if you wish. You can lead your clan from humble beginnings to glory, personally commanding every battle on the way there. Watch those forts though - They may look simple, but they are not to be underestimated. Keep in mind that this is still an arcade-y game, as far as history goes. So while it does present a decent historical accuracy it does ignore some things for the sake of gameplay.That said, it does have its flaws. It occasionally crashes and there are arbitrary unit limits preventing you from using more than a certain amount of specific units , along with an AI that is not too amazing(Not awful either though) are some of the lesser points of the game. The AI is very keen on plundering your lands, which ends up being more of a pain in the...Rear end than entertaining as you have to repair -yet another- farm and hunt down another four units of spearmen that ran past your defence and just keeps running away from you. It does mean that you can't really sit in your fort all the time and let the enemy come to you, but in the end you don't really gain anything aside from a headache from hunting down all the little armies running through your land. Luckily there are river crossings and mountains you can stand by to block most of the enemy from getting throughOut of all the Total War games to get, Shogun 2 and Rome (The first, not Rome 2) are the ones you should consider first. Shogun 2 provides you with excellent quality and a great experience, and is well worth spending your time and money on "

												It is my new lover after Napoleon: Total War. Some may argue this game is the best of the entire series. Honestly, I can't agree more.Graphically, this game looks amazing with the highest setting. Though three years old already, this game presents a kaiga style graphical experience that few newly published game can compare with. The water reflection looks just fantastic, soldiers realistic and fog artistic. Different modifications even make the graphics better.In terms of gameplay, it has too parts. In macro, just like other Total War games, Shogun 2 relies on a turn-based strategy system. In each turn, as the learder of your clan, you can conduct treaties with your friends and foes, recruit different kinds of soldiers, manage han or clan wide tax, etc. Battles are fought at a real-time basis in which you need to be smart enought to use the right tactics and be fast enough to micro your units. You always need to combine strategy with tactics in order to win.The history background truely intrigues me. As a Ph. D in History, I can never deny any game that involved with historical reality. All three backgrounds of this game are well selected. They are the watersheds of the history of Japan. Shogun 2 Vanilla takes place during the Sengoku Jidai, the Warring States Period. It is just amazing when you can control Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu yourself! You see them riding, speaking and moving. Perviously too me they were just names in some history books. Fall of the Samurai expansion takes place prior to the Boshin War, the era of Meiji Restoration. Japan was westernized. You can hardly find samurai units in this expansion because they have been outdated. Instead, line infantries, line cavalries, cannons and iron clads dominated the world. You can also work with the Westerner. They have superior units. In some modifications you can even recruit soldiers from Napoloen Total War in this game. Currently I use French Grenadiers and Voltigeurs as my elite units. Rise of the Samurai takes place during the feud between the Tairo and the Minamoto. You can read about it in The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu. Historically, the Minamoto defeated the Tairo, becoming the first Shogunate of Japan. In this game you can change it if you have the ambition and the competence!See, I ramble on and on. Just buy this game already! Long live the Emperor!			"

												Saying which Total War is best is a subjective thing of course... but to me Shogun 2 and Rome 2 are the most polished and thorough games of the series. Once you've played all total war over and over, and then all total war with mods (darthmod comes to mind for me), you get to know what's good and bad for each of them. Shogun 2 is on the podium for me with Rome 2 and followed by Medieval 2. I'm too lazy to write a detailed cons and pros for each etc. but for Shogun 2 here's some pros:-Good campaign and battle AI-Very replayable, each game different factions will stand out-Diplomacy is important as there's many clans out there and the AI is decent at itSome cons still:-Economy is not as clear or detailed and there aren't as many things to build as a Medieval 2-Units are not as varied as a Medieval 2 or Rome 2Still, Shogun 2 is a solid consistent game. You can't go wrong buying this game. Also, do consider buying Rome 2 instead of you don't have it yet, leaving preferences for time periods aside, Rome 2 might just be the better game. At least it is for me.PS: Bear in mind that I've never played Attila and only played Warhammer a little.			"

One of the best strategy games of all time  	  Introduction: 	 Total War: Shogun 2 is the sequel to the game that started it all back in year 2000. I've got to say that the developers really succeeded in improving things while still keeping the core concept of the previous games intact. Everything from managing your towns  to controlling armies works and feels great. Even though those systems isn't as advanced as the previous game in the series. Unlike the other games in the series Shogun Total War 2  is set in 16th-century feudal Japan which i think fits very well. Both the enviorments and units looks amazing and really gives an fair representation of what Japan could have looked like during the time.For anyone not familiar with the Total War games they basiclly consists of two diffrent parts.  1. The Campaign Map: 	 This is where you will spend most of your time playing total war. From here you can get an overview of the diffrent clans territory, their respective armies/agents aswell as the diffrent trade routes. This is also where you will be able to manage your settlements, recruit diffrent types off soldiers and make diplomatical proposals with other clans.You can also move your armies/agents by simply selecting them and then clicking wherever you want them to go. The amount an army or unit can move every turn depends on what kind of units you're using (cavarly units moves really fast while cannons moves extremly slow). in terms of balance every single unit/agent plays their own role. The thing that makes this work is that every unit/agent in the game has a counter, basiclly it's kinda like a game off Rock-paper-scissors. Spears wins over cavarly, cavarly wins over ranged units, ranged units wins over spears.Whenever one off your armies engages in combat you get two choices 1. Auto resolve the battle (which let's the AI fight the battle for you) 2. Manually fight the battle (which transfers you to the real time battle mode)  2. The Battle Mode: 	 This is where you will be able to controll your units during battles. The battles is always fought in real time and are in massive scale. To win an battle you will have to utilize every unit to their full potentional by using diffrent formations, flanking the enemy soldiers and by using your units special abilites. How good your units performs will also depend on their morale, which is based on a number of different things like for example your chosen general and overall odds off winning the battle.  Conclusion: 	 Shogun total war 2: is an amazing strategy game that's well balanced and has very well suited design. Like the other games in the series this might not be everyones cup of tea and i whould recommend it to anyone who enjoy slow strategy games rather than RTS games like StarCraft and Age Of Empires. I give it a solid 9/10 rating -IGNAnd finally a quote from the game....""Our men are running from the battlefield! Shameful display!”- Asian advisor guy			"

												My first Steam bought game. Shogun 2 stays true to the grand strategy and battles of its predecessors. The Total War franchise is great. Not only has it created (and is still the leader) a new genre, it also defined the way we play strategy games on a grand scale. At the time Shogun was a mind-blowing experience. I still hear sometimes the music of that game in my head. The sequel, Medieval, was also great, but it felt like a step back. Rome was a huge leap forward and is still one of the best games out there. And while Medieval 2 didn't bring much new to the table, it was still a good game, as were Empire and Napoleon. Shogun 2 was certainly a big step forward for the developer Creative Assembly.

												Total War: Shogun 2 remains one of the definitive Total War games to date, upholding the series' longstanding reputation for melding turn-based campaign gameplay with the scope of real-time  tactical battles. Taking a focused setting in Japan, it sacrifices the ambitious scale of previous games for a more fine-tuned setting which to its credit works very well.If you are new to Total War, then in layman's terms it's a wargame. You vie for military control of Japan, taking on the role of one of several prominent clans with unique attributes as you fight, negotiate, and conquer territory. Most of the gameplay will be on a geographical map of 16th century Japan's provinces. Here you move armies and manage your provinces. When your army contacts with a foreign one, the game transfers to a 3D battlefield where you then fight using your army's units. Check out some videos to see the map and battlefield and if your inclined the demo on Steam.For Total War Veterans: It is a grand improvement over Empire and Napoleon's awkward execution. An impressive return to its roots. Shogun 2 is also aesthetically tantalizing, stylistically and graphically impressive.Despite the A.I. still being prone to occasional lapses in judgement, Shogun 2's A.I. is quite capable of self-preservation and is formidable. In battles it will try to flank, take higher ground and on higher difficulties is merciless in the campaign but not irrational: skilled use of diplomacy will save you.There is also the addition of two DLC expansions into the Genpei War (Rise) and Boshin War (Fall). Thus incorporating antiquity and modernization in new campaigns. You have a choice between the old ways of war or the struggle to modernize Japan. The rest of the DLC is passable, mostly superficial unit packs.Multiplayer has working cooperative campaigns with two players. When it works, it is great fun. The classic lobby is still there, albeit hidden under the new avatar mode (which is more or less a customized progression based match-making system). No regrets, still the most polished Total War game as of the present.			"

												In a lot of ways, Shogun 2 represents the cleanest, most polished of the Total War series. It's very balanced, intuitive interface, solid AI, interesting tech, and clearly defined goals. The unit art and animations look great and hold up well. The strategic map is pretty with a great interface to help you avoid ""losing"" units and armies like in previous versions. Playing through the main campaign is a challenging treat. Once. The biggest problem with Shogun 2 is the lack of variation between the factions. Each plays very similarly and is largely comprised of the same units. I suppose it's historically accurate considering the much smaller theater of Japan (versus Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia in Medieval and Rome games), but it really squashes the replayability. Additionally, having such tighter objectives makes it a much more linear Total War game. You can approach the capture of Tokyo in any order, making and breaking alliances along the way, but with a smaller landmass, minimal unit variety, and a singular objective, you'll have seen pretty much everything in your first playthrough. All told, it's a great game and a lot of fun. The graphics are solid, it runs well, intuitive UI, competent AI. But lack of replayability makes this arguably the least ""value"" game of the Total War series. Pick it up on sale.			"

												Shogun 2 is a Quantum leap forward from ( The now ancient Looking ) original Shogun. I believe it was the Original Total War Game. The creative assembly have done a sueprior job with the base game, not to mention the Awesome DLC`S. I especially like the job they did with the Naval Combat. The Battles look and feel wonderful. The Ironclads are a blast to fight with. The A.I. Improvements really stick out, especially at higher difficulty levels. I dont pretend to be a Jappanese expert , but everything looks authentic. winning the Campaigns are a Real challenge and It doesnt take many mistakes to bury your chances for victory. Choosing your Tech advances is very important and picking the correct ones for the Clan you hace chosen, is Vital. TO make a long story short , Great Game. I highly Recommend you to give the game a try. It takes some time to get immersed in the the Game system, but if you are patient, you will grow to Enjoy the Unique pleasures of this game !!!			"

												Shogun 2: Total War has to be one of the best experiences I've had in an RTS in a very long time. The campaign is stellar and reeks of creativity. Many features from previous Total War games really lacked in comparison to this game. It literally kept me up for a 36 hour period of non stop campaign fun. Multiplayer is the most hilarious fun I've had in years. The players are fair and challenging, not to mention friendly which is a surprise from most of my RTS experiences over the years. The games mechanics and innovation from previous Total War games are awesome to say the least, the Concept of Bushido, the ability to convert to Christianity, and the whole concept of massive warfare, I loved this game, I highly recommend it to anyone who's ever enjoyed an RTS or a TBS game. The game play is fun and challenging. The one flaw I'm sure they will correct is the sort of uselessness the Bow Calvary have, otherwise this is simply a great game. It's one of the best games I've played in two years.			"

												9 / 10SHOGUN 2 is a game, which creates a flawless Japanese atmosphere, where you can lose yourself into, very fast. You should not miss out on the Experience, to get to know the different game modes. Since it is difficult to separate from it, the sense of time is lost easily. Furthermore, thanks to the diversity between the clans, this game has a high replay value.If you want to know more details:- Every clan has its own unique abilities and a more or less useful capital city position, which increases the replay value.- Special agents can be recruited to strengthen own cities and armies, or to weaken hostile ones.- Ships and naval battles are quite unspectacular in the basic SHOGUN 2, which improves greatly with the DLC ""Fall of the Samurai"".- In multiplayer mode, you can encounter other players in friendship or in combat - with your own customized Avatar.- The honor of the clan, the military strength and the number of populated territories, have all influence in the game of thrones ...errr, I mean, diplomacy of Japan.- The texture of the figures is incredibly detailed and fascinating.

												Does anyone else remember years ago when they were little when they called the Katana a Samurai Sword or a Yari a samurai Staff, Does anyone remember talking about the ninjas were the richest people who only threw ninja stars and kicked so much♥♥♥♥♥they were unstoppable. Well if any of you are still in that mindset, I've got bad news for you. This game changes ALL of that to a more historically accurate representation of what happened during the Sengoku Jidai, Boshin War and many other areas. Normally when a game changes my understanding about reality I'm not really keen on reviewing it. I mean it shamed my knowledge and as the consumer I want to be able to have some control over what is right or wrong in a game. HOWEVER, Shogun 2's depiction of this is so good There's no point me trying to argue, I mean hell I can change the course of history what more do I need?In general user Freindlyness this game requires some work, Either you need to have practised on another total war game when they updated the engine, (So From Empire total War onwards according to the time this review was written) Or you mastered the turorials right off the bat.The mechanics are shockingly good and shockingly bad, If your general dies unlike other total wars when you got a fairly decent morale hit. In Shogun 2 you get a HUGE one. In competitive multiplayer (My favourite Field right now) if you or an ally looses his general. It could be game over right there, however other mechanics like the action chance on the campaign map and the unit abilities on the battlefeild are extremely good. Only once out of the hundreds of times I've used ninjas has one turned into an extremely skilled master killer who kills anything. Hell he killed the shogun as well!on the battlefield Things like whistling arrows and fire arrows make total sense, if your near the arrows weather right when theyre loosed or where they fly/land, the Devastating morale effect is there. meaning you have to really think before using some of these double edged sword abilities.Graphics are beautiful, and even the lower graphics still meet Napoleon and Empire total war standards. The fire arrows, Cannons/other siege equipment and blood do do a number on your PC. And you'll need a decent one to get full action unfortunately. nonetheless They are definitely a stratagey gamers Eye candy.The historical battles are mediocre at best. Glitches are easy to find and some of the battles are so exploitable you can win them without even trying. They fail to depict Oda Nobunaga, Uesugi Kenshin, Tokugawa Ieyasu and many other important characters from the sengoku jidai (Note I'm not a weeaboo, These are historical figures like any other country's it just happens to be from the land of weeaboos) The historical battles of the Boshin war have a great story to them, But some of them are just so random I don't even have to push foward that much and I can win them. I'dve liked to add more to this review but to be honest you really are only here for the final verdict. I rate this game 8/10 because it's such a pretty game and if you love the competitive gameplay like me you'll know you don't have to not enjoy the game to play multiplayer, you can just watch in awe as your experienced army marches onwards to victory! As I say though there are some horrible things about the game but they only take 2 off the score because a fair amount of them can easally be avoided. Buy this game with all DLC, your missing out on a lot without it and buy it on sale.			"

												All hail the RTS player and his glorious computer seat. Why be a king in real life with the possibility of screwing up and tarnishing your reputation for eternity. When you can simply hit the reset button in this game and start a fresh!Shogun 2 is a total war game and if you have been following the total war series you know how consistent they are with breaking the game at first and then developing upon it into something that looks and works great. This game however was a great exception and its release was alot more smooth than the other total wars.The diplomacy is a pretty good system in this game however I find myself bribing to many kingdoms in order to gain a favorable status to the point where the neighbors are attempted to invade my barn! You have to remember that just giving people gifts can weaken your own status and make you more prone to attacks.The RTS combat is pretty great in this game however I find myself hitting the fast forward button (basically making AI fight) when I am being lazy and I suffer great losses as a result. The Generals do not take kindly to a lazy shogun/Daimyo (player). While your generals might have ranks that can help them overcome battles easier for you its best to improve your own skill set to outmatch any AI you encounter!I have tried the multiplayer with my friend and tend to drive him mad. I would invest to much money into the most ridiculous things. Multiplayer sometimes takes coordination between two people in order to better penetrate the enemy forces or you might end up with a minecraft partner.Overall I would say shogun 2 is a great RTS that has lots of re-playability both single player and multiplayer wise.

Pros:-Extremely deep turn based strategy-Huge number of different units-Each clan feels unique-Strategies are fluid and evolving-Diplomacy is remarkably well done-Fantastic multiplayer with a large variety of options-Every turn matters; even passing a turn is often a harrowing choiceCons:-Learning curve-SHAMEFUR DISPRAY!-Minor gripes about unit balanceOverall: This was my first introduction to the Total War series, and apparently I picked one of the best.  The game does all the core elements right.  Clans are given unique bonuses and starting situations, and you have to find a way to win the shogunate.  Doing this involves knowing how to utilize your own clan's advantages, how to diplomacy your way around too many fights at once, and just... so much more.  Trade routes, foreign religions, ninjas assassinating your dudes, monks inciting rebellion, generals betraying your daimyo, and on and on the list can go.There is a remarkable amount to learn and master.  The core game is simple - make an army, conquer a province, wait to stabilize your new province.  But there are so many units in the game.  Do you use ashigaru, peasant warriors with mass numbers but low morale?  You can if you build your general around morale boosting, making your cowardly peasants into an unstoppable horde.  And if you're the Oda clan, your peasant army costs next to nothing to hire while having natural morale bonuses, allowing you to zerg down opposing clans with the most massive army in the game.  Or you can focus on building samurai, trained warriors with fewer numbers but who are more skilled and who rarely flee the field of battle in a SHAMEFUR DISPRAY.  Do you rush matchlocks, and use guns to gain an advantage?  Does the province you're invading have an alliance with a clan that's big enough to wreck your face?  And what happens when you're allied with a clan but need to conquer their provinces to win?  If you betray the alliance, suddenly no clan will cooperate with you diplomatically.My only complaints are minor nitpicks.  Nanban trade ships are overpowered, for example, and once unlocked can dominate the naval experience completely.  But so much of this game does it right that even the nitpicks aren't that bad.  I still play this game.  And I still keep learning new strategies and new tricks for how to win.  It's absolutely fantastic, and you should give it a try if you have any love for turn based strategy games.Bottom Line: Worth full price in a heartbeat.  Old enough to go on sale from time to time.

												The historical battles for shogun 2, especially for those of FOTS are amazing. Following the time axis and saigo takamori,  the player would have a chance to command the imperial force in Boshin War. The historical battles really recall my memory of Shinsengumi! and Ryomaden, two of my favorite Taiga dramas. although a bit of complicated, the avatar multiplayer system is really a nice MP experience, you can set your own unique fighting style with your veterans and avatar skill. The difficulty may prove to be the one of the hardest one in the total war serie, but it's definitely worth to study for a while and learn the game mechanism. The only thing I hate most, it's one of the achievements which requires you to be rank 1 in ladder, which is ridiculously difficult.			"

												Greetingsa, my Shōjo and Shonen Aishgarus. This will be a quick feelings infused review from someone who loves to tackle medieval and fantasy typed strategy games. I had played some total war titles. Atilla, Shogun 2, Total War 2 and Napoleon. I am told Warhammer is great, as i do love Warhammer i shall get it too, once iget a better PC, and not this silly old  Laptop.Now to review, and arigatou gozaimas for reading into introductionary line.Shogun 2 and its DLC titles tackle three different ages of the land of the rising sun, the Japan, in its different ages of Feudality, or to be precise, Shogunate and Empire. Rise of the Samurai DLC tackles the years when Samurai warriors were mearly a thing to start, and Naginata spear was something more common than a katana sword. They want to become Senpai.Shogun 2 tackles the 16th-century feudal Japan, in the aftermath of the Ōnin War during the Ashikaga Shogunate. Many clans fight for ''Emperors'' and Shoguns (the real powers) atention. Senpai notice me or Senpai let me be Senpai.And Fall of the Samurai DLC takes on the role to represent you with units that were around messing with the last feudal days of Shogun's power, before the Emperor became again the Real Power. Or that is, how you actually want to make it. Alternative ends are after all, exactly the point of such games. You are mearly placed into realistical starting positions. Future, is up to you.Make Japan all christianised? No problem. Create democratic Japan in Fall of Samurai DLC? No problem. Political aspect of the game is easy enough but affects the game regardless if you focus on it or not. It offers far less options than Medieval Total War 2 or Atilla do however. Especially in comparisment to later, the Shogun 2 is a shy imotou to her. So when you ponder whenever should you buy this game or no, let me help you. The Ai can be really complex even on easy mode. So if you seek challenge, the hardest setting will give you one for sure. For casual players, easy gives enough of brainstorming already.  It is indeed a game worth of having it played. I spent quite a sum of hours playing it, while drawing, while eating and even while cooking. No, not that it is a no brainer, but the game's dynamics, of it beein a turn based game, makes it so. So if you like turn based game and feudal Japan and you generally want to play something different than is either shooting units only Napoleon or slobered over too much and stale knights - Shogun2 with its DLC's on sale is a definite hit for you! 10/10 would buy again when on sale. Oh wait. I actually did. And play Co-Op campaign with younger imotou.*bows*			"

												Probably the most balanced and streamlined total war I've played. I'm kinda sad that all the units are like the same for all the factions, like everybody's sword, spear, calvary or bow dudes, but the graphics are amazing, the combat and campaign view are easy to understand, and the multiplayer co op mode is really really fun!

												So, at just under 700 hours I feel like I can finally review this game properly. As of writing this we've had Rome 2 and Attilla, and the new Warhammer is under way too, but until that gets released and we can get a feel of it, Shogun 2 remains the pinacle of Total War so far.I'll try to split this up for ease of reading:Animation - The animations in this game are simply the best we've had so far. From crossed blades to beheadings (Only with DLC I think though) to men drowing on their own blood on the floor, it all looks so real. Admittedly you can see how two people have to awkwardly shuffle into what seem to be ""combat lanes"" and their  can be clipping due to this, this only takes a second and afterwards the fight is very fluid. Men will cheer when they rout a unit, your general swanks along cockily as he walks towards his foe, infantry lower their spears when they're close enough to charge... Its all done very well. On the campaign man, generals will pull out chairs when they run our of movement, and agents will act of small gestures and do an action when they level up, such as a ninja dropping a smoke bomb. Rome 2 and Attilla sadly lack this attention to animation, especially in fights, where combat animations are hard to see or very short. Overall, the animation of Shogun 2 is very in depth, if not without its occasional clumsy moment.Combat - Using a smaller amount of unit types makes combat a more strategic affair, as unit abilities and stats are easier as you will have access to the same units. The game uses a easy to remember but hard to master formula of sword beats spear, spear beats horse, horse beats bow and bow beats sword. On the surface this is simplistic, but your katana samurai won't last long running uphill into a spearwall. This means that each unit type has its advantages in certain situations, for example bowmen seem to be alot better at attacking a fort than defending, but they can still fit into an overall formula. Gunmen are the awkard exception to this, as at times they seem to beat everything due to their high morale shock, while at others they simply refuse to fire fast enough or fire at all, rendering them useless. Added to the mix of unit types are unit tiers, with peasant (Ashigaru), samurai, monk and hero units being respectively better yet costing alot more. This means that a balance must be struck between rather weak but cheap peasant units and more hardy samurai, though at a later point ashigaru are basically useless due to the player having a large economy. Hero units are rather unbalanced, being able to take on whole units before dying, but they are certainly not invincible and die very easily to ranged units. While there are not as many exciting units as Rome 2 or Attilla, the balance is alot better, though expect to see lots of spear ashigaru in the majority of your battles.Graphics - I run this on max, and I have to say that it still looks pretty damn nice. On lower settings however, the game looks pretty dreadful, but this then again what did you want from low graphics? Take a look at the community screenshots to decide for yourself, but I think the game looks very nice. Rome 2 suffered from always looking bland IMO, while Shogun is full of life and colour. From a short distance the graphics get abit blurry, but I guess this allows it to run smoother, and by abit blurry I mean that specific detail can't be spotted, but maybe this is just me being picky. Each person in a unit usually looks different, though Rome 2 and Attilla have more face variations. Unit clothes are nice and detailed, with monks, samurai, ashigaru all looking very different and ofcourse all the different subgroups such as bowmen adding more diversity. Naval battles are quite bad at times though, as holes are blown in the ships you can see water just awkwardly clipping through, but again this is me being picky. Overall, very nice.Sound - I don't know much about sound so this will be short, but the music is entertaining and can make you feel engaged alot of the time. Its not something I'd sit and listen to in my free time, but it fits the setting very well. One of the songs was even used by the Japanese in the Sochi olympics, so I guess it must be good! The narrator is amazing in my opinion, especially at the start when he shouts ""The reign of the old shogunate... IS OVER!"". Battle sounds are well done, and the choking sounds even managed to make me feel sorry for the troops every now and again.Multiplayer - While not much of a fan of just playing battles, Shogun 2 has a clan system and tournaments, so if competative play is your thing you got it! You can conquer provinces on a special multiplayer map by beating other players, which then unlocks new units for you and advisors that give bonuses. Personally, I feel like this aspect of multiplayer ruins it, as a starting player is going to have a VERY hard time beating anyone expect other new players as they are locked to basic peasant units with no buffs while higher level players have hero units and buffs such as being able to see your deployment, Multiplayer is far from fair, so if you're new a hard climb will be infront of you unless you boost, which kinda sucks for people who want to level up legit or just play for fun. On the positive side, you can do large battles, seiges and naval battles online, and the maps are well made. One AMAZING aspect of multiplayer is the ability to make your own avatar and customise him from lots of armour sets unlocked by doing the steam achievements, winning multiplayer battles and conquering regions. You can choose his banner, colour and abilities, so if you've ever wanted a daimyo called Sam Peggle who wears fabulous pink and can personally tank an entire army, you can go for it! This character customisation is the only thing that makes me play multiplayer, as otherwise I find it too unbalanced, but the prospect of new armour is too good a reward! Rome 2 and Attilla sadly lacked this aspect, which is a great shame. Finally, the entire campaign can be done in coop, and unlike Empire and Napoleon players can battle the AI instead of forcing the other player to be the opponent or auto resolving, which made coop for me. You can spectate your friends battles and they can gift you units mid battle to use to keep it from getting boring. The only problem is that you are stuck between coop or vs, so in coop if your friend on the other side of the map gets declared on you are FORCED to help, but in VS all you need to do is hold their capital for a turn, meaning you can just rush through their entire empire ignoring everything. Rome 2 and Attilla sadly didn't fix this.Campaign - Final part now, sorry if I've bored you! The map itself I find quite interesting, if not unbalanced in a way; In the south you have islands which can be heavily fortified and used as a powerbase, and also brings in naval warfare. As you get closer to the map it gets more messy, as each province can have 4 bordering provinces to be invaded from unlike the south. East and North are full of huge provinces that take ages to cross and have little need for a navy. It is alot easier to play near Kyushu as you can't be invaded from the west as the map ends, so you can focus on pushing right, while clans like Oda or Hattori will always be surrounded. Diplomacy seem off to me, with Rome 2 making more sense. Allies will randomly break all their pacts with you, neutral clans will attack or factions on the opposite ends of the map will delcare on each other. You have a family tree mechanic which is nice and reminds me of Medieval 2, and this creates a roleplay element as characters get traits and followers. When you are powerful enough all the clans unite and declare on you, which is a fun challenge as usually in TW games at this point you can't be beat by single clans, though its damn hard! The building mechanic isn't as good as Empires, but its clearer and more refined.			"

												Shogun 2 was my initial introduction to the Total War series and boy have they set the bar high.  I bought this game almost 6 years ago and am approaching 500 hours of total playing time and still love every second of it.  If not for about a 3 to 4 year relative dead period because of pharmacy school I'd easily have eclipsed over 1000 hours.Its a great game that has a diverse number of options to go down whether it be army compositon, diplomacy, use agents, skill trees, etc as the list goes on.  Combat is also fun to watch and not terribly difficult to master as its not as micro intensive as some other RTS games are like Starcraft 2 which is great if you are not terribly skilled (I was Gold on SC2 and then hit a massive skill wall).All in all this game got me introduced to the Total War series and has caused me to play other titles before and after its release but I still prefer this game above all the rest.  Its even got me interested in the Civ series which I will also be trying out as well.  Its a great game and I would recommend this to anyone looking to try out an RTS or Turn based strategy game whether they be a new to the genres or are a veteran....and this is is just the basic game without DLC.  Do not get me started on the DLC as I will be here forever xD.  Happy playing everyone!			"

												Here's some basic math about shogunTotal war: Shogun 2 = goodTotal war: Shogun 2 + Rise of the samurai = more hours that you can spend in the gameTotal war: Shogun 2 + mods = Awesome play time hoursTotal war: Shogun 2 Fall of the samurai = ♥♥♥♥ing great, beautiful graphics.All of that + The blood DLC = 10/10 by me, great battles, ALWAYS interesting to watch the little guys slay eachother and watch blood spill out of their guts.Buy this game if you like strategy games, sadly there isnt that much strategy other than to spam units but you have mods to fix that part, the workshop gets the game the needed punch.

												Honestly, I'm pretty old ... I first learnt to program on a zx81. And, actually has a ZX80!  I loved stratagy games and tried to play and find as many as I could, good and bad growing up!  So, I looked forward with great anticipation the first Shogun game, it was discussed in the game magaines of the time and I couldnt wait! I bought it the day it came out - same with Medievel, and Rome I bourght on the day after I was on the old BBC 2 show""Time Commanders"", just look up Time Commanders, vicars take on Teutoburg Forest  in any search engine and you'll see us..... We Won!!!  I've kept the boxes guide prima stratagy guides and all the expansions, I've some complations  and a collectors full set.  I loved this series (.. I'm what is probably called a 'fan Boy')However, .... Work and Family life hit in and for a few years couldnt play as much, Empire and Napolean pretty much past me by, I kept buying  them all as and when they went on sale, beacuse I knew one day I might get to play them again! (Sorry ""Game Horder"" alert!)That day has come, I've played when I could on and off over the years, but this week I managed to knock the bottom out of Shogun 2, and its quite frankly awsome!The graphics are so good I keep taking screen shots,The Diplomacy and the AI seem great, and a challengeThe Multiplayer fun , (except theres a lot of guns out there in multiplayer world),I like the Avatar systemShogun 2 is polished, runs well and truthfully, I've not had so much fun since Time Commanders!...Did a tell you we won!10/10			"

The graphics are good, the small difference inbetween the Clans are noticable but not gamebraking as each of them has certian advantages and disadvantages. As i dont like shipwarfare much i a m very happy to report that it can be mostly avoided and that is auto function works well. "

												I've owned this game for a long time now and have never been able to play it because it hangs on the load screen and the game goes non-responsive.  A ton of people have this problem and there are no good answers to fix many of them.  So many of the threads I've found ended with people still having this problem and it remaining unresolved.   Steam should seriously consider taking this game out of it's lineup because it's as close to a straight up cash scam as I've come in a long time.  GG steam you got my money for a game that doesn't function for so many people who have bought it.  I absolutely DON'T recommend buying this game - go give your money to a charitable cause you like instead because you'll get more return on your investment that way.			"

												Fun game...until you realize the AI cheats BADLY and can spawn impossible armies out of nowhere. 1st, the AI gets more recruitement slots. So it can pull entire armies out of thin air. 2nd, the AI can't manage its economy, so instead most of the factors don't apply to it. It pays almost no upkeep, and it can never go bankrupt.3rd, the AI's don't play to win, they play to kill you. So as soon as they declare war they'll take everything they have and run it at you. At which point, being entirely defenseless it'll lose to another AI player, which after a few turns will declare war on you. Rinse-repeat the rest of the game.4th, the AI's get unlimited generals, which they will chain suicide at you.5th, the AI gets massive moral and economic boosts in very hard and legendary.Overall a decent game...minus the cheating.

												Best total war game ever. I was a bit indifferent with the standard Shogun 2 campaign, but the Fall of the Samurai DLC makes this game better in every possible way. If you liked empire total war and napoleon total war, this DLC is an immensely improved version. It's set in 1868, the Boshin War, where the Shogunate falls to Imperial Japan. There are line infantry, riflemen, cannons... Adding on from Napoleon total war, you can use your ships to bombard the enemy on the campaign map and DURING THE BATTLE. It's amazing. Unless the enemy uses it on you ;).Pros:The AI is much better in this game than the previous ones. All of the ships are steam powered, so naval battles are faster. British, United States, and French troops are avaliable to use. Your allies are actually helpful, they may fight with you as you all fight for the Emperorer or Shogunate and they hunt the enemy and take regions. The Imperial army is superor because they use more guns and cannons. This also means you may be fighting two different faction armies in one battle, but maybe some allies will be nearby to help. If you have a ship in port that is attacked, the port has cannons on the shore to help you.You can use a train to transport troops over long distances (if no one is blocking the railroad)When I play Rome total war, I like to play as Rome. When I play Napoleon total war, I'll play as France, usually. This game does not have an obvious choice... The imperials are easier campaigns and the shogunate campaigns are hard. I have more of a desire to explore the other factions.Management of provinces is very easy... Unlike Attila where you have to worry about food and disease as well as public order... Realistic? Yes, but very burdensome. Cannons in this game are a major improvement from Napoleon total war.The game is all-around good. I mean, I'm just listing noteworthy pros.Cons:Autoresolving ship battles almost always results in an unnecessarily large amount of damage to your ships, no matter if you are an ironclad vs a small wooden 12 gun boat.Garrisons regenerate immediately. If you attack a settlement and kill almost all of the garrison, but run out of time or barely lose and attack next turn, the entire garrison regenerates while you do not... :P (also means your garrison regenerates too, so let your garrisons die firstYou have to play fast enough or you will not unite Japan in time. I do not understand the importance of getting done by a certain time, but I had 1 more year left and needed 7 more provinces, so I had to blitz all of my forces to every enemy province. I got the last province in the winter. The armies in this game seem to move quite slowly which may be due to the fact that this campaign spans over just a few years.If you like empire total war and napoleon total war, you'll love this game.

												How would I explain this game? Out of all Total War I've seen gameplay on this is one of the best Total War I've played. Its a whole different era with all these Japense Samurai and units. This game is really fun and diffcult. Trying to mantain public order between each provinces, food surplus and the currency you get each round. Not all clans are usually friendly when you encoutner them but some are. My tip is when you first start a campaign, instantly try to make allies and start up trade agreement. Also focus on the nearest clan near you that is hostile and take the free trade ports in the early turns! Overral one of the best RTS game I've played :D			"

												The mix of turn based strategy (with economical, political and diplomatic ramifications) and real time battles is still wonderful, but the need to balance timing and aggression is more important than ever. Aggressive players will feel a little cheated, while diplomats will hate Realm Divide stage. Still, Total War was always about realism and the AI's scripted actions make logical and historical sense.It's the ideal example of evolution trumping revolution in creating great video games.It's wonderfully colourful and completely unique, and it should provide the usual hundreds of hours of gameplay for the hardcore. Those worrying about a retrograde step being taken for the series shouldn't have done so - it's a classic, no question.Creative Assembly is flirting with a new audience with its totaly new and fresh multiplayer component and a streamlined overhaul of the Total War series. But underneath the polished surface lies the Total War we know and love and Shogun 2 has not lost the depth and complexity that has been established over the last ten years.			"

												Shogun 2 allows you to be a Japanese general in the midst of civil war, and it is one of the most authentic, fun, and challenging games set during this period. There are many different factions to choose from, although almost every faction has the same units (with differently colored armor). My favorite part of the game was the Custom Battles option, where you can choose a map, weather, and time of day, determine your units and those of you opponents, and fight. This means that you can make crazy battles; I created a battle solely of ninjas and generals, for example, which was entertaining. The units have different tactical formations and powers that you can use, and the individual soldiers have been recreated with great detail. They also speak in Japanese, which adds to the realism of the game. This game is difficult, and is not exactly a good starting point for new Total War players. I have never played a Total War game before this, so I had absolutely no idea how to do the campaign, and my first few Custom Battles were frustrating and too difficult. Yet, you do learn how to command the troops, and the game becomes very fun. The graphics are good, and the music is excellent. In addition, there are Japanese quotes on the loading screens that can inspire you. If you like feudal Japan or the movie The Last Samurai, you will love this. Recommended.			"

												Because of my poor upbringing with anime, I thought Japan was stupid.  That was, of course, until I took a global history class in high school, and learned about the super badass history of pre-Western Japan.As of this review, I have only played this game for 5 1/2 hours.  From that time, however, I can tell you this game is awesome.  Not necessarily ""awesome"" like ""totally rad bruh"", but ""awesome"" as in inspiring awe.The RTS combat depth of this game is like something out of a LOTR film.  Mechanics include: Ship boarding, burning ships, castle sieging, hill charges, and troop morale.Speaking of troops.  In this game, I feel like each individual soldier is counted.  For example, with archers, rather than getting in range, shooting at an enemy unit, and having a % chance to kill a random soldier in the unit; every arrow launched has a path determined once it is launched, and if that path happens to intersect with a soldier, then the arrow will hit someone.Shogun 2 is one of the few strategy games that makes me feel like I'm commanding an army instead of playing high-tech chess.

												I startet with the original Shogun: Total War. It blew me away. I was always a fan of the samurai stuff.I have to add that I got this game fully patched and will all DLC, so I can´t say anything about launch state.It´s awesome!Gameplay 10/10You can play diplomacy (trade, payments, hell you can even marry your daughters or give your children as hostages if you´re desperate enough) You choose how every province specializes (economy or military). You will plan your steps or you´ll regret them. The stories you make yourself in your campains are so awesome. (I once gave my youngest son hostage in the hope to extend a peace treaty with an mighty ally who was close to declaring war to me...he killed my son the next season. So I killed him in a furious revenge :)And them real time battles. It makes a huge difference on how you plan your moves. You can easily loose while having twice as many men if you are stupid...and you can win if you are smart while having half as many.Grafics 9/10If you run it on ultra it looks amazing. It is glorious watching your army march towards a fortress. Ground textures are not that great, tho.Music 10/10Simply fitting, calming and awesome. That song after a victorious RTS battle always makes me dance.I have to go down by one point for how bad it utilizes CPU. The loading times are still pretty longSo overall 9/10. Get it. Play it. Period.			"

												Shogun 2 is quite, a game.Let me give you a rundown:So you're playing a strategy game taking place during the sengoku-jidai ''The age of the country at war''. Essentially this was a Japanese civil war, where landlords (daimyo) are fighting for control over feudal Japan. It's quite an unique setting, and it leads to some unique and cool things (which I'll cover a bit later).I'll start off with the core gameplay; There are two core modes in the game, an overworld with a stack movement and city management game, where you're administrating armies, agents and your castle towns. This mode is super cool, since you can ambush other armies by hiding your armies in forests, have agents (like ninjas) assasinate or sabotage armies and towns and so fourth. There's also a whole financial management game (I'd reccomend auto-management and then minimal taxes if you're doing very well financially). There's also diplomacy, and, oh I won't spoil it.The other core mode is on the battlefield, where you'll have your units fight. It's super awesome going all close to the battle and seeing individual units fight. All (I think melee weapon combat) was correographed by professional users of the katana and naginata (People who practice kenjutsu and naginatajutsu). It's really freaking cool, combine that with archers and all you can get some interesting battles. You're in control of unit stacks, where each unit also has special abilities etc. There's a lot to talk about, and it's quite hard for me to explain (even though it's really simple). If you know Total War however, you'll know what to expect combat wise.Graphically this game isn't that bad, in fact it requires a lot from your pc. Since all units are rendered etc. However, even on mid-tier settings this game looks great. It's what to expect from a strategy game in my opinion.Now; what sets Shogun 2 out, is the period. You have a combination of melee units as well as ranged as well as gunpowder units. So the battlefield combat can get really interesting, since you'll take chances etc. I won't explain how it feels, just, get this game. If you can get it cheap, do so. Full price is worthy of it all though.			"

												This is a very, very good strategy game. It is my first time playing any of the Total War series, and I am not usually a fan of the genre. But this game is so very well done, I recommend it to anyone who is, and also, more importantly anyone who is NOT into strategy games. You will see what the hoopla is all about.Addictive, with tons of replay value, beautiful graphics, no visible bugs after nearly 100 hours, yes, this is definitely up there among the strategy genre.

But than when u encounter the enemy ,you go to a whole other level by being transported to the battle ground, were u get to be a true general  and control your throops in actual battle . Where get to see your skill as a strategic  general on the battle field. it also has geat replay value for the IA is truly random and no 2 games are identical.			"

												Total War: Shogun 2, is the Seventh game in the Total War series, and the Sequel to the Original Shogun: Total War, which was the first game of the series. Taking place in Feudal Japan following the Middle Ages, you can play as one of several warlords, or factions, whose job it is to take over and unite Japan under one ruler. Each faction has their own strengths and weaknesses, Economic, Political, and Militarily. There are several DLC's for Shogun 2, including; Rise of the Samurai, Fall of the Samurai, The Dragon War Battle, as well as several downloadable clan packs. Unlike previous games in the series, Shogun 2 takes place only in Japan and not Europe or the overall world as a whole. The tutorial is also different, in that when I tried using it, it seemed to be a series of video clips on what to do, as opposed to an actual playable tutorial, the way previous Total War games have allowed. The game is straightforward, easy to learn, and reminds me of a rebooted and upgraded version of Shingen The Ruler, which was an old NES game. I had a lot more fun with this game then I figured I would, given it's region-specific story arc and lack of a sandbox feel the way previous Total War games were. As with all Total War games, it is part real time battle strategy and tactics when in combat, and turn-based role play when not fighting enemy units. A departure from many of the previous Total War games in some ways, but a fun and interesting game in any case.			"

												Total War: Shogun 2 is probably one of the best modern Total War games. Revisiting the classic that started it all, venture into the tulmultuous period know as the Age of the Country at War, when the Ashikaga Shogunate declined in power and left a vacuum to be filled. Will you unite a divided Japan under one rule. Do you have the will to lead your house to its destiny in order to become the next Shogun?Overall, this is probably the best Total War on the Warscape engine to date. I would very much recommend buying this and trying it for yourself. I'd also say it has excellent replay value and attention to detail in the historical world of feudal Japan.			"

												Being someone who has played the previous 2 installments before shogun 2 extensively, what I can definitely say is that shogun is the first truly modern total war, resembling the series more recent titles, a lot more then the previous ones. Shogun however is a stand alone itself, retaining what made total war great immediately prior to this game, and adding many mechanics that a modern player of the series would recognize. Shogun however is the Ferrari of the total war series. Everything from the graphics, to the smoothness of how the game handles, and controls. Shogun is very under appreciated, due to it being limited to just Japanese style warfare, but this game truly does handle much better then stupid Rome 2 and much more balanced combat than Attila or Warhammer. Heed my words.....CA has failed to make a total war this good when the game was on a subject that more people would be interested in. Shogun mp was the most unique experience between all the total wars thus far too, since you can basically make your own faction with your own colors and unique units. Many features from this game need to be brought back, it would really save the mp in future total wars.			"

												When Total War: Shogun 2 first came out, its real-time battles made me feel like I was playing through an epic battle scenes from one of those old samurai films. Shogun 2 is like playing through a new, remastered edition of those films (if...they..where...games hmm >_> anyway....) complete with both the character dramas and the enormous battles. Combining beautiful graphics, scheming generals, awesome multiplayer, and deep strategic gameplay with countless small details that fill it with historical flavor and drama, Shogun 2 is one of the most captivating strategy games ever made. You can take charge of any of the major factions of Japanese feudal history, from the mighty Oda to the more delicate but well positioned Tokugawa clan. Any of the clans could rise to take the position of Shogun under your leadership.I would also highly recommend you to get the two main DLC for Shogun II the “Rise of the Samurai” and the “Fall of the Samurai”, as they are stand alone games in there own right adding a whole new level to your gaming experience. To finish I'd like to say this game is possibly one of the best RTS's I've ever played, the attention to detail is impressive and the tremendous replayability make the game a must have for any gamers library, enjoy hours of entertainment with Total War: Shogun 2.(Like all my reviews I do not put a score as it is my belief that games like all forms of art are subjective and therefore it is impossible to afix a number to them)			"

Family and diplomacy is okay but it can be improved and have more in depth options. The AI isn't completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you play on more difficult levels. The campaign is fun and long with a handful of starting nations to start from with unique starting point and bonuses.The multiplayer is good from what I've seen. But it's completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that Mac gamers can't play with PC gamers. To add that I haven't found a single mac server as it isn't common so I haven't been able to play that part of the game. The DLC is completely worth while, with a large add on to new units and strategies when you get to fight for the Shogun or the Emperor for Japan using firearms, calvary and artillery.Loads of fun and worth the cost.

												This title is possibly the best one in the Total War series. The campaign is mostly well and the different starting positions of the clans really give you different feelings despite all of them having most of the time the very same units.The weak part of the game is - as always in CA games - the AI, especially when it comes to diplomacy... I guess the battle AI has improved a little since the absolutely terrible one in Empire TW, but nonetheless it is nothing to write home about.The multiplayer Avatar Conquest game mode and the possibility to play co-op multiplayer campaigns is brilliant. A down side may be that the waiting time to get in a battle in Avatar Conquest is a bit too long for my liking.Another thing I dislike is that - just like in Medieval 2 TW - I think gunpowder units are underpowered because of their poor range and reload rate and always get massacred by those primitive archers -_- ...On the other hand, I really like the agent system which they improved a lot since earlier titles. Also, the naval battles seem to be fun and more easily playable then in Napoleon TW for example. I do have a few concerns with naval battles, but not big enough to mention them. They are mostly ok.To finish on something positive, the absolutely immense amount of mods - quite some of them actually likable - which you can get on twcenter.net and the Steam workshop give you the possibility to enhance your game experience sooo much that - thanks to the modders - from a fairly ok game you get something really really good and you will utterly enjoy it all the time - as I do. ;)			"

												To me, this is the best Total War to date. It is very well optimized. I could run the game at medium DX9 settings on my HD2000 Intel Laptop. I can run it at max DX11 settings on my i5 660ti Desktop. It looks great as well, and a really vast improvement in soldier models/textures over Napoleon Total War. The campaign is the most fun, as it is really focused. At the start you can make alliances and grow in power. Once your big enough, you start the civil war where everyone is against you providing a fun late game challenge I felt other total war games lacked. The atmosphere is spot on, but troop variety is limited so the different factions only have 1-2 unique units. The multiplayer is also the best out of the Total War Series, allowing for co-op campaigns and a clan focused completive multiplayer where your army levels up and you can customize them. "

												Despite only having 47 hours on it, for me it's the most well-rounded TW game to date, I think the only thing stopping me from playing it any more is the cultural diversity, but you can't go very far when it's basically one nation fighting internally. Graphics are absolutely beautiful, it has been so well executed, in terms of the time-era, it really gives that Sengoku-Jidai period feel to it with it's blending colors and cherry blossom terrain.The AI is very well-done, I feel they took a step back in Rome II with the AI, but with Shogun 2, it feels just right, the enemy actually stays on hills, fights defensively or offensively depending on where they are. I saw this on sale for $9.99 yesterday, absolute bargain if you ask me, a must pick-up!			"

The campaigns are not all the same thing you get to choose clans such as Otomo and Shimazu and they all each have there special characteristics and traits such as ""Master gunners."" This game is great,but the only thing bad would be the multiplayer people in there are mostly high levels and would spam no dachi samurai or cavalry to win so be wary of them. All in all if you are looking for a great strategy game I highly recommend this game.			"

												Yo Ho Ho Ho Ho HoThe screen is shaking, the war march is underway. Scores of Yari Arigashu, Bow Arigashu and Loan Swordsmen descend upon my castle. My meagre defence is lined up at the wall, archers at the ready and katanas sharpened. Ready for the upcoming battle. Yo Ho Ho Ho Ho HoThey fire flaming arrows at my battlements, leaving my defences as naught but charcoal and ash, and then they begin to scale the walls. A few fall and plummet to their death, the rest scale over the side and charge into my men. The sullen grey sky now full of smoke from the ruins of the wooden pallisades.Yo Ho Ho Ho Ho HoMy mens morale is dropping but they're staying steadfast in the face of certain death. I rally them with my makeshift general in the form of Katana Samurai to get my troops to hold their ground. They do. I win.This is Shogun 2.The gameplay in Shogun 2 is the pinnacle of the series, everything is fluid and just works seamlessly. From the campaign map to the battlefield, it's glorious. The graphics are beautiful too, you just sit at your seat, in your boxers covered in sweat and you can't help but gawp at some of the landscapes. The online is fun but can get samey over a period of time. This is where Shogun's Achillies heel is, it's the samey troops that every faction has. Sure they have a little variation but they look and mostly feel the same to play as.Overall, Shogun 2 is a definite purchase for any strategy fan or anyone that plays video games in general as this is, in my opinion, the magnum opus of the series.

												This is by far the best TW game that I've played. It has that aspect of replayability that Rome II and others in the series just didn't have in my opinion. You may disagree however. The visuals are stunning and the combat animations are flawless. Coupled with the blood and gore DLC and you have a truly gritty visual experience to behold. Multiplayer is a fresh start in the right direction in terms of what you are used to in the series. - In conclusion, if you are a fan of the time period, the culture, or the series in general, I fully recommend that you buy this title.

The sequel is just as good, nice unit selection, settlement upgrades, and good visuals without blowing your pc up, fairly good AI.

												This game is a perfect example of a total war game done right. The game feels very polished wether that be the sleak graphics in battle, agent videos, or the neat menus and tabs on the campaign map,  everything comes together very nicely. Unlike most previous games in the series, the campaign ai is aggressive and can easily end your campaign prematurely if you make to many enemies or neglect diplomacy which is a welcome change.  Diplomacy has been improved greatly with the campaign ai generally making sensible decisions( e.g. they will usually accept any terms when close to being destroyed, allies will often offer money to assist them in wars, or offer to assist you in wars in exchange for helping them in their own)Allies  are easily the most reliable in the series and will normally not backstab you unless you are allied with a trechorous clan, have become weak and failed to maintain good relations, or triggered realm divide(more on this later) , and have even occasionally send troops to help you in battles which is a refresing change. The co-op or versus campaigns(when no connection issues are present) are a complete blast, cordinating attacks with your friends and building your empires together is satisfying and a very enjoyable experience. While it is unrealistic that you will both have armies in every battle, it is possible to give friends in the campaign units under your control in both the campaign, and on the battlefield allowing participation in eachothers battles, regardless of faction and distance from one another.Now that we have spoken about what is good about the game, I will now discuss the main problems, the battlefield ai is hit and miss. Sometimes the ai catches you by surprise  with clever use of flanking, or whittling you down with massed archers when it has missle superiorty, on the flip side the ai is prone to getting careless with it's generals, or playing far to passively on defense allowing players to take the initiave. It's most noticablely bad in sieges, where it often deploys it's troops akwardly allowing them to be dealt with easily( e.g. leaving it's archers completely undefended) and will climb the walls every time, even if a gate to the castle is wide open, causing their troops to take uneccessary casualties and morale loss. Unfortunatly though bad ai is nothing new to the total war series and  may stay this way for quite some time, however if this concerns you you may opt to allow a random player to take control of the ai armies on the campaign map to offer a (usually)greater challenge. A lot of people are uhappy about the lack of variety in the clans, while each one has it's own unique specialty, and often gets a more powerful and cheaper, variant of a certain unit type, they do all use the same units(dlcs add some unique units to each faction, as well as one or two factions with many different units) although personally this doesn't bother me to much as playing to the factions specialty allows each clan to play differently offering a unique playthrough each campaign. Finally one of the biggest issues in shogun 2 is realm devide, this mechanic happens late in the game when you take enough provinces. This causes the shogun to fear your power and declare you a enemy of the state, the result is diplomacy is thrown out the window, and inevitably all factions will declare war on you, including your allies. This mechanic is not implemted well and can often feel unfair, although mods can change the way realm devide works allowing you to easily keep your allies and friends after realm devide allowing for a much more enjoyable experience.Some people may feel intimited by the setting of the game or the flaws that i have outlined, but i can't stress enough that this game is a easily among the top total war games in the series, and in my opinion is vastly superior to it's successor rome 2. There are ways to deal with most of the games flaws which i have outlined above allowing you to take full advantage of the many great features CA nailed when making this game. Wether you are a total war fan that has not purchased shogun 2, or someone who is interested in the franchise or strategy games in general, i can't recommend this game enough.TL:DR The game is polished and has some of the best diplomacy/battles in the series, multiplayer is fun and addictive while it does have some issues(siege ai/realm devide and a lack of variety) it's in my opinion well worth the price.

												[This review is for TW: Shogun 2 - Fall of the Samurai.]My hours played speaks for itself. 1,020+ hrs played and I still come back to this game. Rome II has been out for almost a year and I just couldn't get into it the same way.I love the 'family tree' feature in this game. Being able to look back at the end of a long campaign, with my Daimyo(clan leader) now 53 yrs old, having started the game when he was 18, it's a great feeling. To remember the past battles, close calls, the sacrifices etc.  It really helps build that immersive connection, so that you actually care about your clan and your armies.Like all games, this one isn't perfect. The multiplayer could be better. I'm a big stats type of guy with a game like this, and I really felt like the end of game stats weren't as informative as they could have been. For example, when you look back through the history, it says ""Won battle on this date"", but that's it. I wish it said which general and included all of the stats for that specific army, etc.If you've never played a game like this, you're in for a treat. Obviously, like every other game you spend money on, you should watch some youtube 'Let's Play' videos to see what's really in store. The top-down strategic view is nicely done, coming from the Civ series, it wasn't hard for me to get used to. Having the option to enter the battles in 3d is just fantastic. These battles can be absolutely epic and it's a joy to watch them unfold, especially when you're the underdog.Now to be honest, I got my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me during my first campaign. I didn't read any tutorials and I jumped right in without paying much attention to some important bits of info. The starter clans differ in difficulty, for starters. Select auto-management for Taxes at first, this will help in not becoming overwhelmed as you add more cities to your clan's dominion.That's all for now. Grab this game if you're a Civ fan that has always dreamt of actually entering the battle in 3D!			"

												My main issue with this game is the battels started to become very fast and arcade like.  I say started because this style of battle never went away in the new games.  Basically what I mean is the the battles go way to fast.  They can be over in less than ten minutes which is some what ridiculous.  I love playing battle multiplayer and thats waht I spent most of my time doing in the other games but this made the battles less fun.  They are also based on a rock paper scissors style.  Basically spears beat horses, swords beat spears, and horses beat swords.  Too streamline for people who like nice tactical battles.  However, the streamline easy to learn nature of these battles makes it a good game to start playing the series with.  The battles also look beautiful and the fighting is so fun to watch.  I just wish Creative Assembly would make a more real way to fight battles like earlier.  It wouldn't be that hard to do.  In earlier installments they even had a button to make the battle basic if you did want that but still kept the normal battles a feature.  Now you may be wondering why I gave it the thumbs up but the multiplayer system in this is so well done.  The avatar conquest is such a good way of doing multiplayer battles.  Also, your units gain more experience the mroe they fight making your abttles more meaningful.  The campgain I felt was also pretty good.  I like the idea of the clans and such.  Really captured Japan well.  It's a great beginner game for people new to total war but if you are really here for instense, strategic, battles then you'll probably only play one or two campgains like me.			"

												Total War Shogun 2 is a link between the first Total War game and the later games this game is a great Total War game which takes us into an area of history that is far from our familiar European grounds which the other Total War games have been set. Shogun 2 is in my opinion very well refined and exeptionaly tidy in that it plays very smooth and seems to have the least issues in terms of performance. The games campaign is interesting and engaging with new aspects. I do think that this games multiplayer though is its best area it of course introduces the Avatar system which works well for this game although personally i dont want it in other total war games. The battles look fantastic units are well balanced and interesting with plenty of viable tactics and unit builds i do however belive this game suffers from a lack of variation with many factions sharing the same unit rosters and there being very little in the way of faction uniqueness. This is however balanced out nicely by the Fall of the Samurai addition which combines Japans Musket and cannon age into the game and makes for some very intersting and exciting tactics and new campaigns in wars against tradional and modern armies its a very good Total War experience			"

												This is by far the best TW game that I've played. It has that aspect of replayability that Rome II and others in the series just didn't have in my opinion. You may disagree however. The visuals are stunning and the combat animations are flawless. Coupled with the blood and gore DLC and you have a truly gritty visual experience to behold. Multiplayer is a fresh start in the right direction in terms of what you are used to in the series. - In conclusion, if you are a fan of the time period, the culture, or the series in general, I fully recommend that you buy this title.

												This a review of the standard vanilla game without any DLC.Shogun 2 is a turn-based total war style game that has you picking a clan and trying to conquer a sizeable portion of the campaign map,Pretty standard stuff.Shogun 2 boasts some very nice graphics and a much improved user interface from some of the previous installments in the franchise. This makes managing your empire far easier and unlike previous titles you have tabs to help locate anything you might need Examples:Agents,fleets,armies etc etc.The balancing of the clans is also very good as the nature of japan and its warfare means that all clans use the same unit types. The only advantage your clan will have will be in your passive bonuses and starting location.However this balancing comes at a price:None of the playable clans in the game feel unique, they all boast the same units and buildings and tech/research trees.Players who enjoyed the unique factions and units from previous titles such as Medieval 2 total war will feel a bit let down by what this game has to offer in that area.Another problem is religion. Most factions in the game start as the shinto-buddhist religion,This wouldn't be a problem except that the other 2 religions(Christian and ikko) spread like wildfire and can quickly overwhelm your provinces. This means that you will find yourself spending large amounts of money to build structures and agents or even going to war in a attempt to slow the spread of these religions should you wish to remain buddhist.Overall Shogun 2 is a nice return to Japan for the total war series, but feels like a basic but enjoyable experience.

												One of the best total war games ever. The common reason why people don't like this as much as Rome, Medieval 2, Empire, or Napoleon is because of the non-European focus and they do not understand Japanese history nor its culture. However, Japanese culture and history is just as interesting as other cultures but just not touched much in school as history today is overwhelmingly eurocentric. Shogun 2 is definitely worth playing with minimal bugs and probably has the best AIs in the series. Don't get Rome 2, get Shogun 2. You won't be disappointed.			"

												Seriously. This is the BEST Total War game. Rome 2 does not come close to it. The campaigns are well thought out, and the units are well balanced. If you like micromanagement of everything from your units to resource generation, this is a game for you. If you like smart AI who can counter your moves and act with relative intelligence, this is a great game. The details from units to buildings to the descriptions are perfect and gives an air of authencity.			"

												Where do I begin on such a deep, interesting and addictive game. As an avid member of the Total war fan base, since the original Shogun, I can safely say that this is in contention for being one of the best itterations of Total war to date. I personally consider this on par with the original Rome and Medieval 2. The positives: Streamlined but detailed campaign map, well balanced and interesing units, period aesthetics with repsect for traditional Japanese culture and extremely polished and exhilerating multiplayer componenets highlighted by the exceptional coop campaign.The negatives: Not the best optimised game I have played and can be a resource hog especially for lower end systems, playable but offers a much better experience on a more powerful PC. My only true minor complaint is that clan diversity isn't as prominent versus previous titles but this is overshadowed by more balanced gameplay.Verdict: Definitely worth a buy especially if you love grand strategy and huge armies clashing on an unrivalled scale, best purchase you will make, especially if on sale.

												Remove the sword from your stomach, turn on the Karaoke machine, pull out those unwashed schoolgirl panties and get sniffin' because Shogun 2 is finally here!  All the shame you feel from dishonering your family will be washed away when you are immersed into the experience that is Shogun 2!  Feel your innter girly side by being bombarded with countless cherry blossoms...Relive the glory days of Japan before the thing that is left out of most Japanese textbooks happened...March your armies to victory with more efficiency than the Bhutan death march...Build the most glorious railroad since the Burmese railway, but with less slaves...Pwn and r4pe your enemies  more than the city of Nanking...and destroy your enemies harbors more than Pearl Harbor!  The experiences and playstyles are endless!  In all seriousness though here is my actual review....above was just my promotion of the game..I could never get in to any of the other Total War games.  I played both Rome 2 and Empire a bit, but eventually stopped playing them after a game or two.  I find this game way more fun to play and I think it is way better to look at.Here are some reasons why I think this is the best newer Total War game..-Balance.  The other Total War games can become confusing with the huge amount of other units...It takes way too long to figure out what counters what.  In this game, it is quite simple but still complex at the same time.  Horse beats archer, archer beats soldier, soldier beats horse...this rock, paper, scissors forumula makes it easy to pick up and learn.  There are still other units that add complexity, but for the most part you can rely on trusting this simple formula-Design/Graphics.  Rome 2 might look slightly better in terms of polygon count and effects, but not by much.  This game looks better overall though!  The Japanese artwork and music throughout the game really helps to immerse you.  Everything else looks nearly identical to the new Total War games, but this runs better and has better performance.-Decent unit movement, control, and COLLISION DETECTION!  One of the main reasons I always got sick of the other Total War games was because it always felt that you wern't in control of your units or armies...A group of 40 soldiers, essentially acted like one unit.  This game still isn't like other RTS games where you have control over a single unit...a single unit is still considered an army, but this concept has been improved and is actually better than it is in Rome 2.  Sending in a group of 30 or so soldier in Total War games was always lame...the individual soldiers would kinda just walk around the enemies not doing anything and every 5 seconds you would eventuall see one of your units hit someone with a sword.  This is only really a problem with melee units, but its a really big problem because it make it feel like your units arn't fighting right.  Its still an issue in this game, but units are much more likely to engage eachother in battle and not just walk around not doing anything.-The expansion!  Usually expansions in Total War games or other RTS dont really change the gameplay that much.  The expansion in this game almost turns it into a whole other game!  Without the expansion, you are just using mainly archers, sword, horses, and other simple weapons....but by installing the expansion you upgrade the technology of the Japanese by like 500 years!  This is mainly because Japan was feudalistic before the arrival of western powers...The introduction of such different weapons and technologies would seem out of place usually, but in this historical context it makes sense!  It really changes the game a lot, and it makes both versions of the game fun to play.Way better than any other Total War game I have played...which is medieval 2, empire, and Rome 2.  A great game which you can always come back to!  Tons of cool MOD support, like one where they add tons of blood and decapitations!  Awesome!8/9 Sudoku boxes!			"

												This game is a perfect example of a total war game done right. The game feels very polished wether that be the sleak graphics in battle, agent videos, or the neat menus and tabs on the campaign map,  everything comes together very nicely. Unlike most previous games in the series, the campaign ai is aggressive and can easily end your campaign prematurely if you make to many enemies or neglect diplomacy which is a welcome change.  Diplomacy has been improved greatly with the campaign ai generally making sensible decisions( e.g. they will usually accept any terms when close to being destroyed, allies will often offer money to assist them in wars, or offer to assist you in wars in exchange for helping them in their own)Allies  are easily the most reliable in the series and will normally not backstab you unless you are allied with a trechorous clan, have become weak and failed to maintain good relations, or triggered realm divide(more on this later) , and have even occasionally send troops to help you in battles which is a refresing change. The co-op or versus campaigns(when no connection issues are present) are a complete blast, cordinating attacks with your friends and building your empires together is satisfying and a very enjoyable experience. While it is unrealistic that you will both have armies in every battle, it is possible to give friends in the campaign units under your control in both the campaign, and on the battlefield allowing participation in eachothers battles, regardless of faction and distance from one another.Now that we have spoken about what is good about the game, I will now discuss the main problems, the battlefield ai is hit and miss. Sometimes the ai catches you by surprise  with clever use of flanking, or whittling you down with massed archers when it has missle superiorty, on the flip side the ai is prone to getting careless with it's generals, or playing far to passively on defense allowing players to take the initiave. It's most noticablely bad in sieges, where it often deploys it's troops akwardly allowing them to be dealt with easily( e.g. leaving it's archers completely undefended) and will climb the walls every time, even if a gate to the castle is wide open, causing their troops to take uneccessary casualties and morale loss. Unfortunatly though bad ai is nothing new to the total war series and  may stay this way for quite some time, however if this concerns you you may opt to allow a random player to take control of the ai armies on the campaign map to offer a (usually)greater challenge. A lot of people are uhappy about the lack of variety in the clans, while each one has it's own unique specialty, and often gets a more powerful and cheaper, variant of a certain unit type, they do all use the same units(dlcs add some unique units to each faction, as well as one or two factions with many different units) although personally this doesn't bother me to much as playing to the factions specialty allows each clan to play differently offering a unique playthrough each campaign. Finally one of the biggest issues in shogun 2 is realm devide, this mechanic happens late in the game when you take enough provinces. This causes the shogun to fear your power and declare you a enemy of the state, the result is diplomacy is thrown out the window, and inevitably all factions will declare war on you, including your allies. This mechanic is not implemted well and can often feel unfair, although mods can change the way realm devide works allowing you to easily keep your allies and friends after realm devide allowing for a much more enjoyable experience.Some people may feel intimited by the setting of the game or the flaws that i have outlined, but i can't stress enough that this game is a easily among the top total war games in the series, and in my opinion is vastly superior to it's successor rome 2. There are ways to deal with most of the games flaws which i have outlined above allowing you to take full advantage of the many great features CA nailed when making this game. Wether you are a total war fan that has not purchased shogun 2, or someone who is interested in the franchise or strategy games in general, i can't recommend this game enough.TL:DR The game is polished and has some of the best diplomacy/battles in the series, multiplayer is fun and addictive while it does have some issues(siege ai/realm devide and a lack of variety) it's in my opinion well worth the price.

												My main issue with this game is the battels started to become very fast and arcade like.  I say started because this style of battle never went away in the new games.  Basically what I mean is the the battles go way to fast.  They can be over in less than ten minutes which is some what ridiculous.  I love playing battle multiplayer and thats waht I spent most of my time doing in the other games but this made the battles less fun.  They are also based on a rock paper scissors style.  Basically spears beat horses, swords beat spears, and horses beat swords.  Too streamline for people who like nice tactical battles.  However, the streamline easy to learn nature of these battles makes it a good game to start playing the series with.  The battles also look beautiful and the fighting is so fun to watch.  I just wish Creative Assembly would make a more real way to fight battles like earlier.  It wouldn't be that hard to do.  In earlier installments they even had a button to make the battle basic if you did want that but still kept the normal battles a feature.  Now you may be wondering why I gave it the thumbs up but the multiplayer system in this is so well done.  The avatar conquest is such a good way of doing multiplayer battles.  Also, your units gain more experience the mroe they fight making your abttles more meaningful.  The campgain I felt was also pretty good.  I like the idea of the clans and such.  Really captured Japan well.  It's a great beginner game for people new to total war but if you are really here for instense, strategic, battles then you'll probably only play one or two campgains like me.			"

The sequel is just as good, nice unit selection, settlement upgrades, and good visuals without blowing your pc up, fairly good AI.

												5 years later and this is still one of my favourite RTS games to date. I don't even like RTS games that much either but this game still manages to capture me and entertain me. This game is a definite buy for anyone who loves the Total War or RTS genre in general. P.S: Make sure you get the blood and gore DLC its worth it ;)			"

I am here to talk about two things.The AI doesn't have to pay upkeep.The AI gets free units.Game Broken.There is nothing else to say.			"

I'm having more fun in this than I ever had in Rome, which was fun, But this, I can't put my finger on it. It just has something. It makes me WANT to play the campaign, I want to play one more battle. I WANT TO BE SHOGUN!The agents, provinces, map, units, the general art style, it all feels right and makes me want to play more.

												Winter 1568. My mighty samurai army is ready to assault the walls of the Otomo Clan fortress. The commander Chosokabe Motochika gives a speech to the troops before the battle: -"" So we face foes who understand nothing of the finer feelings of duty, loyalty and love of home, clan and family.Death will be their reward! Spirits of this place! I apologise for what is to happen! But blame the bravery of our enemies: if they ran away, you would not be offended! My plan is simple: we batter the walls down. Failing that, we go over them. Failling that, ha! I will haunt this place for ten thousand years!

												Awesome game that goes back to the origianl Shogun: Total War formula, you can feel the influence of Sun Tzu's Art of War all over it. Katana's clash, bombs are thrown, flintlock muskets are fired, and throats are slit by shinobi in the night. The Battle AI is finally competent enough to make use of forests for ambush and avoid charging directly into your spearmen across the bridge, and finally put up a decent challenge to your forces. In Direct X 11 mode, the game looks absolutely superb, a big step up from Napoleon, and uses the new form of anti aliasing called MLAA created by AMD, which increases performance. Multiplayer is engaging, and the coop mode is simply fun to play with a friend. Now, maybe if the game didn't SINGLE THREAD in Direct X 11 mode, and we didn't have to pay for the factions already in the game as DLC, this would have been a near-perfect game.			"

												Game crashes at load. Buy at your own peril. Many users cannot play this game at all and there are almost no fixes and those that do exist are very inconsistent. The game is essentially broken and needs to be patched by the devs, but they are not doing so. Suggest not buying anymore total war games. CA and Sega are garbage companies now. Never will buy a total war game again with this and the♥♥♥♥♥♥show that was rome total war 2. Edit: Some moron said I had several hours played. And I do. Way back when the game was first released. Since then I reinstalled it on my old pc. It didnt work and I gave up fixing it. Reinstalled it on a new pc. Didnt work, gave up and wrote this review. BUT FINALLY I GOT IT TO WORK. How you ask? It only took upgrading to windows 10. But still others continue to have problems. Some said a complete reinstall of OS is the only thing that seems to work 100 percent. Still pass on this one.			"

												AWESOME game. The mutiplayer on this has outclasses all total wars, you and your clan can dominate japan together without being in the same battles. The battle system is exactly like all the other total war games so very easy to pick up, but with the abilities you can add along with veteran troops and heros adds a great dimention to multiplayer matches. Unfortuneatly the campaign comes with a turn limit which forces you to rush through. Other than that a highly recommended game.			"

												UhNot too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes insteadIngredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6.

												Absolutely amazing game. Siege battles are more fun then before, as they got better ways of taking the gates. I also like the way generals are managed, the generals are more in depth and you affect more to their traits and personality.Tactics are needed in this more then in Napoleon: Total War. There is units for everything, there is some all-around units, but they arent so good in all fields as specialized ones. For example Katana-Samurais are better then Yari-Samurai in infantry combat, but fail against cavarly.Also to add: Fall of the Samurai is very good expansion for this, nothing wins using Gatlings & Amstrong Guns against enemy spearmen.

												To begin with, this is perhaps one of the Semi-Recent Total Wars that is deserving of a proper and postive review.Think of a time when CA was innovative with each of their titles (Yes including Empire) and when DLC was actually worth buying for a total war title. Shogun 2 in my opinion remains as one of the best Total War titles, and I would recommend this over Rome II anytime. Not that Rome II is not fun, it just doesn't feel as innovative as Shogun 2 is. Shogun 2 set in Fedual Japan has a very straightforward Rock Paper Scissors mechanic for the massive battles. Yet, it is one of the hardest battle styles to master in my opinion, not because of the diverse nations, not because of the unit power ups, and not because of overpowered special units. The game is hard because each unit counts and can mean the difference between being conquered or conquering, I still find myself having the hardest time against a large stack of units in Shogun 2 than Rome II.Shogun 2's campaign although not as extensive as the whole of Europe or the conquest of the New World, Shogun 2 is one of those games that will make you manage each province with specific priorites and strategies. Sacrificing a province in order for it to become a gold powerhouse while another province builds your katanas and cav, makes you ponder as to the desicion in order to become the shogun and conquer Kyoto, and if your ambitious enough Japan.And even with the games age, this is still beautiful, even the loading screens are easy on the eyes and give you an even more realistic interpretation of the Medieval Era of Japan. CA worked around the forced combat animations that made each unit look as if they were each a Samurai Soldier that trained with their blades before the battle. This game is not a SHAMEFUR DISPLAY rather it still stands as a beautiful, tough and fresh turn base strategy game. CA and SEGA should both take the time to go back and listen to the gamers, people responded well with Shogun 2 not because it was the newest total war title, but because it was nolstolgic and fresh. The DLC is worth buying, the base game isn't ""incomplete"" and battles are fun to play and watch.			"

												To be frank this game is simply amazing. I will split the following review into three parts starting with G, graphics, gameplay and godly awesome animations.Graphics.This game is simply beautiful. The highly detailed distance scaling units and landscape add so much to the game visually. It looks very fitting into the time period of which it is set. Other details such as falling cherry blossom flowers on the battlefield make the game's atmosphere very appealing and genuine. Although the rediculous blood effects may turn you to believe it is bad exagguration, it honestly reminds you of good samurai movies with similar effects. These small details make the game so much more fantastic.Gameplay.Total War: SHOGUN 2 has an easy to understand ""food chain"" of units.Spear beats cavalry, cavalry beats bows, bows beat swords and swords beat spears.This is the core of the game, however other units are thrown in as well to make it more exciting. These include matchlock units, which are basically short range gun units effective at murdering everything on the battlefield. You might think at first these are overpowered, but just like everything else in the game it has a weakness. Other missile units because of it's low range. Another example are kisho units such as ninjas who can hide on the battlefield while moving slowly or sitting idle. These units are usually weak to cavalry and missiles, so they are best at engaging melee infantry units from the flanks using their special abilities such as grenades.Retainer cards are special, well.... cards, that you can choose a limited number of to play for a battle. These retainer cards can give bonuses to your units such as +2 melee attack to all sword infantry or hinder your opponent's army with cards such as -10 ammunition for enemy bow units.The main multiplayer mode is called avatar conquest, where you create your own general and build his skills and army using veteran units, which are experienced soldiers that you can upgrade and keep in your reserve. In avatar conquest you are given a map of Japan on which you move your general across to capture provences. Each time you win a multiplayer battle you will unlock the provence you are currently standing on, which may reward you with a new specific unit or retainer card. Finally we have god damn animations.The animations in this game are fantastic. Using motion capture technologies Creative Assembly was able to create some of the most beautiful animations I have seen in a video game. From decapitations to complete entry and exit of a weapon through a man's chest, these animations happen in 1 vs 1 duels in the middle of a battlefield surrounded by other units who are also doing the same. The clipping in this game is barely noticable unless you are really looking in a high clipping scenario such as when a unit of yours moves through another unit of yours. The detail of the animations are fantastic and inserted EVERYWHERE. Interestingly there are highly detailed animations for men climbing walls, throwing flaming kindling and even firing and reloading seige weapons. Simply well done Creative Assembly, if I wore hats I would take mine off.So, well done on reading this entire review. What are you doing? Honestly? Get out there and murder some fools!			"

												(0) The feature where they claim how awesome it's to see units up-close is an over-valued joke, do not pay for this feature. Be wary.+The Macro Strategic elements are easy to use.+Easy to learn, a system to help not forget to finish doing everything in a turn is lacking. This is atleast offset by auto-save.-Naval Auto-battle is supernatural forfeit.-Some diplomatic basics can only be discovered through error.+Good diplomacy, -no diplomatic penalty for being sociopathic.-Battle Breaking bugs with AI in Naval combat. (99% of the ship's firepower get's stuck from moving to firing positions which you have no control of)+-Mod support, some hard-coded things.-Some extremely unpredictable and counter to mathematical certainty moral anomalies  (naval).-The Naval AI in normal when attacked has an IQ of 16.-When you tell a ship to go somewhere it will randomly choose to use half its speed and your screwed if you fail to realize before it's obvious.edit: The vessel AI lacks 1 fundamental basic in logic when it has to do a 180, also the vessel AI can get stuck not going where you told him to go (loses its brains)			"

Learning more about Japan and Japanese cultures is a huge plus for me as a history enthusiast. I recommend it to gamers who enjoy other Total War series. Cheers!			"

												Well, I had my first experience with the Total War franchise in Shogun 2.I bought and played all DLC's, played both the online avatar conquest and coop campaing (only once, because it is practically dead now).All the singleplayer campaings are awesome and the playability is really good.All campaings will give you large amount of play time even playing on short campaing (I only played on long, but I can tell that even the short one is at least 30-50 hours of gameplay), but the first campaing, Shogun 2, and the Shogun 2 - Fall of the Samurai were my favorites due to the style of gameplay and technology already available, since the campaing Rise of the Samurai is supposed to be set before both, and they diverge in the gameplay because you don't actually need to capture the settlement to make it yours in the Rise of the Samurais (the allegiance system). What I was more excited about was the historical battles you get to fight, really amazing how they made that so every ramdom battle turns out to feel like you were reviving the Japanese's past fights (at least for me).My only complaining is about the multiplayer, it is true, I didn't play much of the avatar conquest, but from what I played (2-3 hours) it was a real♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the coop campaing could be really awesome, but as I said, it is dead now...Summary, if you are a fan of Samurais and Japan history.. buy the game for sure! Just don't expect multiplayer...			"

Also for someone who has no clue about feudal japan and it's history it is very difficult to stick with this game and try to rewrite a history who he himself doesn't know . So it is recomended to learn something about this setting before launcing the game.			"

												The true predecessor of Medieval 2 Total War. This is one of the best and most polished total war games one can get, with the bonus of avatar multiplayer (building your own army and training your units in competeitve online gameplay). The single player is also soild with hard to beat AI and fun and unique units\clans added in small dlc packs. The only downside is that you are going to be looking at the same culture and very similar units for most of the clans with small stat changes. All in all a really enjoyable game once you get into it.			"

In many war games, when you already have many territory, then the fun just vanished, but it's not like that in shogun 2, even the most friendly ally can become your enemy just in a single moment, and trempling all of your hardwork just in one single turn lol.Try this, and thank us later~			"

												Hirashai! Hirashai! Come! Take a seat and hear me fellow Samurai!Yea.... kinda over the top opening line.. But! Back to the topic!I was always intrigued about Asian warfare,especially Japan and its samurai.Total War:SHOGUN 2 was the game that came before ROME 2 to the TW series known for their turn based campaign and real time-chess like battles.Shogun 2 is set durning 3 crusial time periods of Japan's history (well,one if you don't buy the DLCs...):1) Sengoku Jidai (The age of the warring states) set at 1545 when most of Japan's notorious warlords were already alive and active.2)The Gempei war,set at 1175. This war is what caused the Shogun to be the main ruler of Japan and what made the empror who ruled until then a figurehead.3)The Boshin war,set at 1865,During this war,Japan yet again fought itself to change the regime,this time the empror wins. This war also marks Japan's massive modernazetion which will lead her to be a superpower eventually,but not all are happy with this and some tradition-loving Samurai will revolt and try to take matters into their own hands (Sheesh... sounds like Mea Shearim on an asian grand scale...)Now enough with history lesson! (if you wanna know more just go to wikipedia or somthin'... thats what I did... and somehow got hooked on anime in the prosess...) Lets talk about the game!GameplayEven for an unexpirienced player to the series (which I was when I bought it) learning the controls is easy as they give you a well directed tutorial on every aspect of the game.The AI might be a bit annoying (waiting on the highest hill,setting tax rate on extreme and not getting any rebellions,betray you when you can clearly crush their arses,etc) but it is still quite well made,still,if they grind your gears,there are many wonderful mods on the community's site: twcenter.net which change gameplay for the better (some are even setting the game on different timeframes if you ever get bored with the main campaigns).GraphicsFrom my limited japanese: kire desu! Or,the game is looking f***ing beautiful! (well if your computer can run it on med-high settings and up... I seriously upgraded my rig just so I can see those tiny asians kill each other without the game moving slow! But thats just me,and if you'll know me,you will see I'm bloody wierd!).Graphics look amazing! both on the battlefield and the campaign map. If you close up durning a battle, you will see samurai and ashigaru fighting to the death,on the campaign map you can see clouds around mount Fuji,seagulls flying above ports and your generals (who used all their movement points) sitting on a stool with your clans flag in hand and relaxing (or taking a crap,they do sit like they are...). If you zoom on a unit that's been hit by a volly of arrows (considering they are not naginata or bulletproof samurais) you will see that some men will instantly die with 2-3 arrows stuck in them while some others will roll around in pain with the arrow stuck in their body (I'm pretty sure an arrow to the knee won't kill you instatly... we have the guards from Skyrim to justify this!). There is much to say about the graphics but its better for you to see everything yourselves,after all,a picture is worth a thousand words!SoundThe game sounds wonderful! When on the campaign map,a calm tune will be herd,changing from turn to turn to have the feeling of the season's changing. A tentious music will be herd during a realtime battle,until the two armies clash and the tune will become glorified and brutal to mark the horrors and beauty of war at the same time.As for the voices,in Japanese they sound amazing,the commander of the unit will respond to every command you give them as they should (they will shout ""kogeki!"" when you order them to attack and ""zenshin!"" when ordered to advance,I ain't gonna explain to ya what his words mean! use your logic,or google translate if you are in dire situation!),that massive ""hai!"" a unit shouts after the commander always makes me smile.On the campaign map,everyone of your figures will call you ""dono"" or lord in japanese and will always jabber something after you order them to do something (as I said,my japanese is LIMITED,very!),too bad the voices in english don't sound as authentic as the japanese ones as most of the accents sound very forced (and all the VA's of the game are japanese,kinda wierd...),but,at least it can make you laugh a little.I forgot to talk about the speeches a general makes before battle,but they are getting annoying and repeatable after a short while so I'll leave that aside.MultiplayerAlthough Rome 2 came out not a long time ago,there are still many honorable samurai lords who have'nt abandoned 16th centuary Japan for Roman europe!Multiplayer has two sections: online battles and multiplayer campaigns.On multiplayer campaing I don't have much to say aside from that you can play with a friend and conquer Japan together (or fight against each other for control). I haven't tried this so I won't speak aout what I do not know.Online battles is realy where Shogun 2 differs from other Total War games:It is the only game on which there is a dynamic campaign-You start with costumizing your own general (other TW games doesn't have these feature aswell which is a shame...). During the battle,if you zoom on your general you will see that he looks like you cotumized him! same goes for enemy generals!,As time passes you willl earn more costumisable armor for your general. After a battle,the game will suggest to make the unit that earned most expirience to become a veteran-veteran units are also costumizable,but,the most important thing about them is that the veteran unit can enhance their skills (as you desire) to make them better,but more costly! After your general fights enough battles he will rank up and earn skill points which will help him enhance his skills as well.One of the most important things on mp is to join a clan ASAP! after every victory you will earn clan tokens which will unlock further abilities for your veterans,to do so,simply click on a clan name,or look for a Shogun 2 group,go to the clans panell and click ""mark this group as my clan"" or something like that,there are clans that will only accept proven players but most will accept you with no conditions,one clan for example is ""HeirOfCarthage Fans"",or,if you wanna,send me a message and we can start a clan together and rule over Japan!Beaware though! Most of the players are pretty expirienced in the game and the matchmaking system will usually throw you with whatever they find,even if it means a 10 star gold player! So you might have a rough beggining but after a while,I'm sure you will master the art of war in Shogun 2! So I'll say for ya-gammbatte!Anyways,if you consider buying this game,I don't see any reason why not! It is the most refind TW game at the moment and many still play it and generally,don't buy this only if you hate strategy games,it has both guns and swords for your pleasure (empire/napoleaon and rome combined) and is a very good game.So if you somehow made it to the end of this review (and didn't skip right to the end like we Israelies usually do) all I have to say is thank you for reading this! arigatou and sayonara!P.SIf you found anything in this review offensive (like those dots...) I had no intention to insult you! Its just my stupid humor! Thats all!			"

												First off I love the Total War series.  These games are exceptional to say the least.  SHOGUN 2 is probably my favorite out of the franchise thus far.  The ease of map and town navigation make the game simple to jump into if you've played any of the previous Total War games.  If you haven't, the overwhelmingly helpfull ""advisors"" will get you through the early stages of the game rather quickly and efficiently.  What's good:- Graphics are smooth and quite detailed even when you zoom way in on units- Map control is crisp and easy to manage- Naval battles are easy to get a handle on after a few battles- The technology trees are easy to understand and plan out- It's easy to jump right in and playWhat's not so good:- Understanding what each building does or chains to easily (it took me a few games to get it right)- Not knowing what building to make keeps you from getting the right units as early as you can in the game.- The time table to win the short campain is VERY challenging- Takeda clan never wants to trade with me....... WTH Takeda!?!?!- There always seems to be SOMETHING that makes your Dynamo dishonorable, and everyone hates that.- some diplomatic solutions just plain don't work, I've tried to give children away as hostages so many times, nobody want's my kids!  they must all be brats.....All in all I love this game.  I've played it a bunch just solo.  I can't vouch for any online play however so those experiences may vary.  I hope you pick this game up and check it out.  Enjoy! "

This game makes it more interesting to play and offers even more detailed game mode than the previous games mentioned. Learning more about Japan and Japanese cultures is a huge plus for me as a history enthusiast. I recommend it to gamers who enjoy other Total War series. Cheers!			"

												Ever wanted to be a general in feudal Japan, controlling literally thousands of Samurai marching onto the fields witht the ultimate goal of having it all? Well now you can! Even though it was released in 2011, it still remains one of the greatest strategy games of all time 4 years later. Compared to Empire and Napolean, this has so much more of a melee focus, similar to the original few games such as Medieval and Rome (unless you have Fall of the Samurai, which I'll mention later). You spend most of your time on the campaign map, choosing strategic positions for your armies and improving your economy through the use of farms and other institutions. This being a total war, you can order your armies to sabotage and attack these civilian settlements to damage an enemy's economy and bring disarray to the people. You can also forge alliances, initiate trade and improve relations through diplomacy as well, all designed to help you take over Japan. Sounds fun, right? Well actually... it is! There's something satisfying about seeing your provinces prosper and become rich. But of course, what is the real reason you play Total War?The battles! Instead of the turn based actions of the campaign map, a real time battle takes place. You command your army to defeat the opposing side. To do this, you must employ military tactics and flank the enemy with knowledge of their strengths and weaknesses. The battles are quicker than previous titles and, thanks to the new AI, harder as well. However, I fully recommend using the Darth Mod to get the enhanced AI and gameplay features. Unfortunately, I can't say that naval battles are the same. They fell far less enjoyable and I often feel that victory comes down to who has a bigger navy rather than the appliance of tactics.Summary:Pros-- Excellent land battles that encourage the appliance of military tactics.- Terrain and weather which can help or hinder you and your opponents.- Units are mostly balanced.- Excellent campaign map.- RPG system that allows upgrades to units, generals and agents.Cons- UPDATE: Cavalry are not as meaningless as I said before. They are meant to be morale damagers, not units racking 500 kills. And Naval battles are actually quite fun. More depth than I originally thought.			"

												The total war series has always been my favorite, and Shogun 2 is my favorite of that series.  It has great gameplay mechanics on both the tactical and strategic levels due to a simple but elegant unit system.  Each unit excels in a certain situation, and there are enough unit types so that even after hundreds of hours, you can still innovate with units you have never really used before.  Each army build has strengths and weaknesses, and each clan favors slightly different build, giving lots of replay value.  Simple but elegant is really the theme of the game, and is carried over to the building trees, tech trees, agents, and political aspects of the game.  Each aspect of the game is simple enough to pick up and use easily, but the game is deep enough to allow a great deal of engaging and varied gameplay.  The campaign map, tactical maps, in game encyclopedia, and user interface show the attention to detail that was given during development.  In addition, I strongly recommend any and all of the DLC, but especially the Sengoku Jidai unit pack, which gives unique units to each clan.			"

												Absolutely amazing game. Siege battles are more fun then before, as they got better ways of taking the gates. I also like the way generals are managed, the generals are more in depth and you affect more to their traits and personality.Tactics are needed in this more then in Napoleon: Total War. There is units for everything, there is some all-around units, but they arent so good in all fields as specialized ones. For example Katana-Samurais are better then Yari-Samurai in infantry combat, but fail against cavarly.Also to add: Fall of the Samurai is very good expansion for this, nothing wins using Gatlings & Amstrong Guns against enemy spearmen.

												To be frank this game is simply amazing. I will split the following review into three parts starting with G, graphics, gameplay and godly awesome animations.Graphics.This game is simply beautiful. The highly detailed distance scaling units and landscape add so much to the game visually. It looks very fitting into the time period of which it is set. Other details such as falling cherry blossom flowers on the battlefield make the game's atmosphere very appealing and genuine. Although the rediculous blood effects may turn you to believe it is bad exagguration, it honestly reminds you of good samurai movies with similar effects. These small details make the game so much more fantastic.Gameplay.Total War: SHOGUN 2 has an easy to understand ""food chain"" of units.Spear beats cavalry, cavalry beats bows, bows beat swords and swords beat spears.This is the core of the game, however other units are thrown in as well to make it more exciting. These include matchlock units, which are basically short range gun units effective at murdering everything on the battlefield. You might think at first these are overpowered, but just like everything else in the game it has a weakness. Other missile units because of it's low range. Another example are kisho units such as ninjas who can hide on the battlefield while moving slowly or sitting idle. These units are usually weak to cavalry and missiles, so they are best at engaging melee infantry units from the flanks using their special abilities such as grenades.Retainer cards are special, well.... cards, that you can choose a limited number of to play for a battle. These retainer cards can give bonuses to your units such as +2 melee attack to all sword infantry or hinder your opponent's army with cards such as -10 ammunition for enemy bow units.The main multiplayer mode is called avatar conquest, where you create your own general and build his skills and army using veteran units, which are experienced soldiers that you can upgrade and keep in your reserve. In avatar conquest you are given a map of Japan on which you move your general across to capture provences. Each time you win a multiplayer battle you will unlock the provence you are currently standing on, which may reward you with a new specific unit or retainer card. Finally we have god damn animations.The animations in this game are fantastic. Using motion capture technologies Creative Assembly was able to create some of the most beautiful animations I have seen in a video game. From decapitations to complete entry and exit of a weapon through a man's chest, these animations happen in 1 vs 1 duels in the middle of a battlefield surrounded by other units who are also doing the same. The clipping in this game is barely noticable unless you are really looking in a high clipping scenario such as when a unit of yours moves through another unit of yours. The detail of the animations are fantastic and inserted EVERYWHERE. Interestingly there are highly detailed animations for men climbing walls, throwing flaming kindling and even firing and reloading seige weapons. Simply well done Creative Assembly, if I wore hats I would take mine off.So, well done on reading this entire review. What are you doing? Honestly? Get out there and murder some fools!			"

												To begin with, this is perhaps one of the Semi-Recent Total Wars that is deserving of a proper and postive review.Think of a time when CA was innovative with each of their titles (Yes including Empire) and when DLC was actually worth buying for a total war title. Shogun 2 in my opinion remains as one of the best Total War titles, and I would recommend this over Rome II anytime. Not that Rome II is not fun, it just doesn't feel as innovative as Shogun 2 is. Shogun 2 set in Fedual Japan has a very straightforward Rock Paper Scissors mechanic for the massive battles. Yet, it is one of the hardest battle styles to master in my opinion, not because of the diverse nations, not because of the unit power ups, and not because of overpowered special units. The game is hard because each unit counts and can mean the difference between being conquered or conquering, I still find myself having the hardest time against a large stack of units in Shogun 2 than Rome II.Shogun 2's campaign although not as extensive as the whole of Europe or the conquest of the New World, Shogun 2 is one of those games that will make you manage each province with specific priorites and strategies. Sacrificing a province in order for it to become a gold powerhouse while another province builds your katanas and cav, makes you ponder as to the desicion in order to become the shogun and conquer Kyoto, and if your ambitious enough Japan.And even with the games age, this is still beautiful, even the loading screens are easy on the eyes and give you an even more realistic interpretation of the Medieval Era of Japan. CA worked around the forced combat animations that made each unit look as if they were each a Samurai Soldier that trained with their blades before the battle. This game is not a SHAMEFUR DISPLAY rather it still stands as a beautiful, tough and fresh turn base strategy game. CA and SEGA should both take the time to go back and listen to the gamers, people responded well with Shogun 2 not because it was the newest total war title, but because it was nolstolgic and fresh. The DLC is worth buying, the base game isn't ""incomplete"" and battles are fun to play and watch.			"

												To be frank this game is simply amazing. I will split the following review into three parts starting with G, graphics, gameplay and godly awesome animations.Graphics.This game is simply beautiful. The highly detailed distance scaling units and landscape add so much to the game visually. It looks very fitting into the time period of which it is set. Other details such as falling cherry blossom flowers on the battlefield make the game's atmosphere very appealing and genuine. Although the rediculous blood effects may turn you to believe it is bad exagguration, it honestly reminds you of good samurai movies with similar effects. These small details make the game so much more fantastic.Gameplay.Total War: SHOGUN 2 has an easy to understand ""food chain"" of units.Spear beats cavalry, cavalry beats bows, bows beat swords and swords beat spears.This is the core of the game, however other units are thrown in as well to make it more exciting. These include matchlock units, which are basically short range gun units effective at murdering everything on the battlefield. You might think at first these are overpowered, but just like everything else in the game it has a weakness. Other missile units because of it's low range. Another example are kisho units such as ninjas who can hide on the battlefield while moving slowly or sitting idle. These units are usually weak to cavalry and missiles, so they are best at engaging melee infantry units from the flanks using their special abilities such as grenades.Retainer cards are special, well.... cards, that you can choose a limited number of to play for a battle. These retainer cards can give bonuses to your units such as +2 melee attack to all sword infantry or hinder your opponent's army with cards such as -10 ammunition for enemy bow units.The main multiplayer mode is called avatar conquest, where you create your own general and build his skills and army using veteran units, which are experienced soldiers that you can upgrade and keep in your reserve. In avatar conquest you are given a map of Japan on which you move your general across to capture provences. Each time you win a multiplayer battle you will unlock the provence you are currently standing on, which may reward you with a new specific unit or retainer card. Finally we have god damn animations.The animations in this game are fantastic. Using motion capture technologies Creative Assembly was able to create some of the most beautiful animations I have seen in a video game. From decapitations to complete entry and exit of a weapon through a man's chest, these animations happen in 1 vs 1 duels in the middle of a battlefield surrounded by other units who are also doing the same. The clipping in this game is barely noticable unless you are really looking in a high clipping scenario such as when a unit of yours moves through another unit of yours. The detail of the animations are fantastic and inserted EVERYWHERE. Interestingly there are highly detailed animations for men climbing walls, throwing flaming kindling and even firing and reloading seige weapons. Simply well done Creative Assembly, if I wore hats I would take mine off.So, well done on reading this entire review. What are you doing? Honestly? Get out there and murder some fools!			"

												(0) The feature where they claim how awesome it's to see units up-close is an over-valued joke, do not pay for this feature. Be wary.+The Macro Strategic elements are easy to use.+Easy to learn, a system to help not forget to finish doing everything in a turn is lacking. This is atleast offset by auto-save.-Naval Auto-battle is supernatural forfeit.-Some diplomatic basics can only be discovered through error.+Good diplomacy, -no diplomatic penalty for being sociopathic.-Battle Breaking bugs with AI in Naval combat. (99% of the ship's firepower get's stuck from moving to firing positions which you have no control of)+-Mod support, some hard-coded things.-Some extremely unpredictable and counter to mathematical certainty moral anomalies  (naval).-The Naval AI in normal when attacked has an IQ of 16.-When you tell a ship to go somewhere it will randomly choose to use half its speed and your screwed if you fail to realize before it's obvious.edit: The vessel AI lacks 1 fundamental basic in logic when it has to do a 180, also the vessel AI can get stuck not going where you told him to go (loses its brains)			"

												TW: Shogun 2 is by far one of my favorite games. The reasons being the balanced units, co-op, multiplayer, the excellent expansion that is Fall of the Samurai, unique and interesting bonuses for the majority of the clans, well placed tactical structures  on the maps, a very well designed skill tree that scales into late-game, and the manual battles are something else.However as much as I could praise any positive attribute i've previously stated in detail, i've no intention of doing so. You'd be better off not having what the game has to truly offer being spoiled. Which leads me to the negative attributes of TW: Shogun 2 because I will go into a bit of detail, and you should definitely know what you're getting into because realistically what is a minor complaint for me could be a major problem to you. Specifically within the standard campaign diplomacy is for the most part a joke. The player has options to increase their diplomatic standings with another clan, but you will face situations where neighboring clans refuse nearly all attempts at diplomacy and ultimately on the higher difficulties this means going to war early with 4 or more clans. The only ways to avoid this are to pay other clans off and/or hope you can set up a prearranged marriage, and realistically both are not an option in the early game phase. Well that or you have to choose a clan that is positioned in a corner or the Chosokabe which are on a small island. Now if you reach a certain point where you've gained too much territory there will be a realm divide and you instantly lose about 250 diplomacy with all clans meaning you're instantly at war with every remaining clan in Japan unless you've been paying them off until that event happened, and even still it's meaningless to pay that clan off because no matter what you do they'll eventually go to war with you anyway due to the fact you lose a large amount of diplomacy every turn after a realm divide. Essentially within the standard campaign at a difficulty of 'hard' or higher, the diplomacy mechanic within the game is what will literally make your life a living hell  and it gets worse as you bump up the difficulty. That isn't to say you can't win, but unless you're either willing to play co-op or sacrifice much of what you've conquered for a better tactical position you can and will be completely crushed losing all time invested in playing. Regardless though the game can still provide a challenge at normal difficulty for some time, and the hard difficulty isn't going to give you nightmares if you're well versed with the game. Anything beyond the hard difficulty obviously isn't going to be forgiving at all. Now that we're done with that, how about that Rise of the Samurai expansion? It's fairly horrible due to the same diplomacy issues, less unit types, slower gameplay due to each province needing to be converted to a specific allegiance, less building types, less potential money made per turn, etc. Buyers beware of the RoTS expansion.To end this review I want to reiterate that the Fall of the Samurai expansion is truly excellent. Most of the diplomacy issues are fixed in this expansion, there are even more unit types, a longer overall campaign in regards to available turns, siege units  matter now, a similar skill tree but with a nice twist and better economic opportunities that make it feel very different from the standard skill tree, more provinces, design changes to the overall map of Japan, etc. Personally I prefer the feudal units in the standard campaign to the more modern units in the FoTS expansion but there's still so much to enjoy here.What else can I say? Great game, but it has its faults.			"

Now my clan leader has kids who are taking his name and making army for themselves, while my leader is becoming a war god, gaining title and acclaim (Mirror of Amaterasu due to his victory in defending a critical castle from a much strong force due to tactically placed bowmen), Now my clan garners respect and fear as I continue my conquest and hope my clan makes more heroes and warrior that distinguish themselves on the battlefield. 10/10 would send old Asian man to lead army again			"

												Shogun 2 is a decent additon to the total war series. But, if I could have Shogun 1 with Shogun 2 graphics I'd take it anyday. Since Shogun 2 lacks key features that Shogun 1 had. Overall I'd give it a 8/10.Pros:-Better graphics.-Ship battles.Cons: -Same crap economy from Empire: Total War.-Naval trade is useless like in Empire: Total War. No trade partner = no income from it.-No more Kensai from Shogun 1.-Race to build the fastest to get ""special"" units.-Buggy. (Some ship battles got all screwed up).-Game would crash to desktop.

												Total War is a series that has intrigued me, but frightened me off just the same. The difficulty in learning what unit does what, and how each operate was a very difficult task, but learning to overcome that uncertainty pushed Shogun 2 into a limelight that it's easier predecessor (Empire) held.Shogun 2 provides a mixture of well-designed characters with extremely detailed animations into deadly historical war. In true Total War fashion, just having superior numbers and ""zerging"" an enemy unit does not always win. It's the proper use of the right ""tool"" to do the job that prevails here.It does take a LOT to get used to, and it takes awhile to get into the ""swing"" of things, but give it enough time and you will be stroking your chin in thought as you effectively play your real-time chess against an opponent that already knows your army better than you do.

												Shogun2 is a total war with lot of ""improvements"" good or bad. Indeed you get an avatar that get experience, levels, points and armor pieces that allow you to get stronger units and bonus, but also less money for your army, but that mean you dont start with the same army than your opponents, in contrary to other total war games, and it seems creative assembly will keep these things for the next ones (not sure, due to some steam petitions from total war players - you can still play unranked classic battles). Except that, shogun2 offer nice siege battles, with tough fort and less money for defense, where empire and napoleon missed it : on these 2 games, defense is as strong as attack, but as forts are undefendable, then the game become a standard land battle. All works fine on shogun2, you get land, sea (less epic than in empire and napoleon) battles and solo, multi campaign. empire/napoleon and shogun2 have quite different atmosphere. Large battle due to artillery on empire/napoleon whereas large mellee on shogun2. The extension Fall of the samurais is playable inside the vanilla game, land battles should look like empire/napoleon battles, but have a different feeling and way of playing. Naval battles are epic at start, but lack in number of ship after a while.			"

												The best game in the Total War saga so far. A masterpiece of strategy where every single move and/or decision has aftermaths. Shogun 2 brings you through the Japan of the Sengoku ages, which literally means ""Country at war"". During this years, you have to pick the role of a Daimyo (Clan leader) and drive your Clan to prosperity and military might unltil you reach your final objective: become the new Shogun, the General of the Generals. This task is not easy, at all, and the chances of success are all up to your capacity of thinking strategically. The new major feature is the implemente of skill trees in characters: from Generals to Monks, each time a character levels up you can spend points in skills and retinues which improve the character ability to do certain things. You can either decide to have an all round character, who can do everything but specialized in nothing, or the exact contrary.There is also a brand new tech tree, adapted to the historical period and culture of Japan. You can't reserch everything, so you have to be concerned about what you really need to.Every now and then you are requested to make a decision over some dilemmas that can trigger during your campaign, be careful tho, because the wrong decision can be your ruin.So take your Katana, new Daimyo, and guide your Clan through a land of war, where trusted frinds can turn in foes, and where the spread of the Cristianity splits the land even more. The Shogun throne awaits for you.			"

												Alright my original review was over simplified and really didn't express how good of a Total War game this is. I am a huge Japanese history nerd, but even then Shogun 2 is a shinning example of a good Total War game. Lately Total War has been releasing extremely buggy and simply broken games. I own Rome 2 and whilst I would love to play it again I literally can't because my game has broken entirely. My faith in Total War as a company has dropped to an extreme low. However whilst their newer titles have been disappointing I feel like I can still come back to Shogun 2 and enjoy the Total War experience. Shogun 2 will continue to be a staple of Total War games despite how horrible recent titles have been and I recommend this for any fan of strategy games and I especially recommend this to people who are fans of Japanese history. Not to mention this game actually runs!			"

												Big fan of the origal Shogun. Shogun 2 is a massive upgrade in graphics and new game features.This is a real strategy game, where flanking makes a difference and the type of unit you use can make or break the battle even if you are outnumberd.If you are a fan of RTS games, this is a must have in your collection.

If you like the other games in the Total War series, you will surely like this one. I personally enjoy fighting as an army of samurai and such as this is one of the historical period I like to read about and I found the game to be relatively accurate to real history (but obviously this is a game so the amount of soldiers is a bit exaggerated, etc.). I really recommend it!			"

												Honestly, this game is AMAZING! I personally think it is among, if not the best game from the Total War franchise. As a RTS and turn-based strategy game, it lives up to all that and much more. Unit, structural and environromental details leave nothing to the imagination; however, the campaign cinematics are humble despite the game having perfectly rendered in-game clips. Overall audio and visuals are breathe-taking (comparable to much newer AAA games). Don't be fooled, this game can still give your PC a run for its money especially on ultra settings with multiple AI's in the mix. I strongly recommend getting this game in a bundle with the standalone expansion (Fall of The Samurai) and the other existing DLCs. It is also VERY replayable and will always be great value for your money. If you don't already own this game and you like RTS and Japanese feudal lords, it's time to commit seppuku.			"

												Its a total war game with standard Total War type fighting. Watch some youtube videos on gameplay, I personally recommend PixelatedApollo at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC45a_j76kNDwJvbc2ufOkJg for a general idea of how Total War games are fought. Shogun 2 is in my opinion tied for best Total War game with Midieval 2, with it's own particular strengths. Shogun 2 has hands down the best AI, campaign + campaign map, and pitch battles of anything in the Total War series. It relies heavily on using intelligence to outwit and outmaneuver your opponent rather than strength to win the day. Commands are smoother and forces more reactive than ever before. The sea battles are nice, although they feel a bit like an unbalanced minigame much of the time. Even so, it feels a little less rewarding than Midieval 2 or Rome 1, and the siege battles are boring, although most battles on campaign at least will be fought in the open fields. Oh yeah, and the game looks and sounds magnificent. :D			"

												It's okay...Only going to list the bad things in this game.- Diplomatic mechanic is very shallow, example: AI will not agree to your offers regardless of your military power or economic success. Even if AI is friendly. - Soldiers AI can be stupid, expample: Half of the company is attacking while the other half is just standing. Looking... dancing... and pretty much confuse to why they exsist. - Seige battle is unbalance, Player never actually need to battle in a seige battle to take the castle. Player can seige a castle then wait until the enemy AI launch a counter-offensive, which will take place OUTSIDE of the castle.- Never trust anyone, all clans are A$$H@LE back stabbing SHAMEFUR DISPURAY! And why I still play nearly up to 1000 hours?I like the Ninja fail video...A recomendation: Play this game with Darthmod!What it does?- Improves soliders AI, so they won't run into each other into a massive blob, but rather fight.Other loads of things..... I dunno try it....			"

												The best game in the Total War saga so far. A masterpiece of strategy where every single move and/or decision has aftermaths. Shogun 2 brings you through the Japan of the Sengoku ages, which literally means ""Country at war"". During this years, you have to pick the role of a Daimyo (Clan leader) and drive your Clan to prosperity and military might unltil you reach your final objective: become the new Shogun, the General of the Generals. This task is not easy, at all, and the chances of success are all up to your capacity of thinking strategically. The new major feature is the implemente of skill trees in characters: from Generals to Monks, each time a character levels up you can spend points in skills and retinues which improve the character ability to do certain things. You can either decide to have an all round character, who can do everything but specialized in nothing, or the exact contrary.There is also a brand new tech tree, adapted to the historical period and culture of Japan. You can't reserch everything, so you have to be concerned about what you really need to.Every now and then you are requested to make a decision over some dilemmas that can trigger during your campaign, be careful tho, because the wrong decision can be your ruin.So take your Katana, new Daimyo, and guide your Clan through a land of war, where trusted frinds can turn in foes, and where the spread of the Cristianity splits the land even more. The Shogun throne awaits for you.			"

												I love this game. I trully do. 400+h till now and i still feel like ""hmm maybe another match""It is, for me, the best Total War game for the past 6 years. Yes the graphic my be a bit older but the gameplay is still the best. No unneccesary, overly complex region-management like in Rome II and no endless Bug-marathon like in TW:Warhammer. It is just overall polished and tuned to be trully amazing.Positive:+ You feel like a real Daimyo. A true Samurai and General+ Many Mods to improve and change your gameplay+ Balanced units+ Very complex(if you want to) army building, which completly depend on your battle tactic. No stupid samurai Steamrolling.+ Countless ways to build and evolve your empire- Some bugs(see below)- Ki ist sometimes just plain stupid or unlogical. - ""Hey you there. I declare you war!"" - ""Hmm. Who the hell are you? I didn't encouter you so far. You must be on the complete other side of the map.....""- Higher Ki-Difficulty is just plain OP-Cheating. Ki usually will declare war and some of this wars cannot be won. Once a KI started a war with me. Their buddys joined in. I got 1 Army of week starting units. This was the max. i could maintain. They just came with a full samurai Army and one weaker army. The cost to maintain those 2 armies would be roughly 5 times the amount of what a real player could maintain with the given ressources at this time....simply unwinnableI strongly reccomend a Coop match, as this proves to be more fun in later stages of the game.Bugs: I encountered some bugs of which one was basicly gamebraking: Multiplayer desync.If you and your friend playing a VS or CooP match it happens from time to time that your games will desync. Resulting in a crash, every time you try end a round.Lucky we found a workaround for this: The host sends his local savefile to the coop partner, who than replaces his local save with this one. -> Fixed			"

												Total War: Shogun 2 is an outstanding achievement, certainly worth the price you'll pay. It may be just focused on Japan and there's no cultural diversity etc. But that means that CA have been able to pay a lot of attention to detail and when it comes to detail there's a lot of it in Shogun 2. The battles are amazing, all the animations and effects are really immersing and will have you playing for hours. Along with the campaign, which is great fun. The multiplayer is a massive improvement, there's coop campaign and avatar conquest; which is where you create your own general and army, and battle other players either in custom battles or for territories in Japan.If you're a Total War fan don't hesitate in getting this game, the same can be said to anyone else who is interested in a good strategy game.

												This is the best total war game. it has all the good things they have ever done, including the family tree, and very few of the bad. being able to make units without generals is nice... the new total wars just seem like money grabs. this thing is polished. would recommend.			"

												-You are not allowed to set one unit group in one control group (it has to be 2 or more) which can sometimes be annoying.-The maximum camera zoom out is not enough. You are required to do some script changing.-AI gets bugged sometimes resulting in the AI being idle in a non-sea battle.-Would be good to be able to sort your agents by class (ninjas first then metsukes then missionaries or in any order, but by class)Other than that, it is a pretty good game.

												It is kind of misleading that I can review Total War Shogun 2 Fall of the Samurai on the TW: Shogun 2 store page. Since I have only tried the original title through family sharing, BEFORE buying Fall of the Samurai. So now, I cannot family share anymore for it and my review is confused by its placement on SHOGUN 2, while being a review for FOTS. Well, it would be, if I was actually reviewing anything more than the game's poor integration into Steam.But this is a fairly big issue, it would be nice to fix this - it's not something simple to overlook, it's an obvious big issue with no fix yet.

												I like this game. Decent graphics, addictive gameplay and fairly well optimised. Multiplayer is fun and quite challenging, however the online community is fairly small and it can be hard to find online matches. Single player is definitely this game's strength and is what has made up most of my play time. For a grand strategy game, it is a simple game, far less complex than a game like Europa Universalis IV. If you are just starting with the Total War franchise, I would recommend this game over the rest.			"

												Alright my original review was over simplified and really didn't express how good of a Total War game this is. I am a huge Japanese history nerd, but even then Shogun 2 is a shinning example of a good Total War game. Lately Total War has been releasing extremely buggy and simply broken games. I own Rome 2 and whilst I would love to play it again I literally can't because my game has broken entirely. My faith in Total War as a company has dropped to an extreme low. However whilst their newer titles have been disappointing I feel like I can still come back to Shogun 2 and enjoy the Total War experience. Shogun 2 will continue to be a staple of Total War games despite how horrible recent titles have been and I recommend this for any fan of strategy games and I especially recommend this to people who are fans of Japanese history. Not to mention this game actually runs!			"

												This game has stolen more hours from my life than any other game in my library; why?The Total War series has been the LEGACY for strategy games in the past two decades and I can certainly see why.I have played for every clan in this game thus far and still havent beaten it, the AI learn very well considering the time this was made, also I like to play on hard >.>But yeah if you're a casual player or a hardcore strategy game sado-masochist, PLAY.I dare you to play an entire campaign without raging at the AI for destroying a beloved army or agent.One thing that STILL DOES need work; Allies should be ALLIES, not 'Heightened Peace Treaties'. If you are new to this game DO NOT feel like your allies will have your back, they will sit by and watch your lands crumble then vulture their way in. That is pretty much my only piece of advice. This game has sucked up so much of my time and with a great deal of reason. I love this game like I love bacon <3			"

												This was the first Total War game i played, i mean, It's based during the Sengoku Jidai, and the twist? you get to put the Clan you chose (in respect with you actually winning) on the shogunate. I love Japanese culture and History so this game really appealed to me, but not just that, as my first introduction to the Total War Strategy Genre, I really like this game, controls and tactics are easy to grasp and it's overall a fun game which you can lose hours of time merely conquering a bit of land, assassinating some Daimyos and tending to your ever expanding Clan territory.

												What is Shogun 2 you asked? Shogun 2 is a Turns Based Real Time Strategy Game. You play as one of the selectable clans from Sengoku Jidai periods, also known as the time period where the samurai dudes were killing each other becasuse they were high on the bushidos (Suicidal Warriors Code) stuff. There are around roughly 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 clans. Each with their own Unique traits and special unit. If you haven't played any of the total war games ,you should just unplug your computer and donate it to someone more deserving. But in case you're a newborn and haven't experience the glory of a total war game, you should pick up this game whether it's on sale or not ASAP and play as either the Chosokabe or the Date clan to learn the basic. Now, I called this game a Turns based real time strategy game because the world map is like a board game based on the island of Nippon or Japan unless you're not as weeaboos as I am. You construct buildings, raising armies, recruiting spies, politicians and (Women that do nasty stuff for money because pros-ti-tute is apparently censored) to do your bidding. You can also make diplomacy with other clans. Once you attack an enemy's army. The game shift into hawk eye view of the battlefields and you commands your troops to do all of these fancy tactic you've always dream of doing because you watched too much actions movies. ""Why should I buy shogun 2 when I can buy Rome Total War  since it has more people vouch for it? or Heck I can buy Rome 2, it's newer so it's probably better"" Rome 1 is a great game, but it's a relic of the past. Shogun 2 is the best total war game to date at the time I wrote this review. Rome 2 is a complete joke compared to this game. Each and every single little character in the battlefield in Shogun 2 are animated. The graphic is beautiful and it has a great mod community.  The musics and sounds effect are amazing. But, if you cringe at the sound of japanese language I would suggest you not get this game and spend the money to get a new personality because you are racist. In a war game such as this, the AI play a huge role as they are your opponent most of the times so how are the  AI? The AI in this game are great for a total war game. They do sometimes make stupid decisions though. As a strategy game enthusiast, I recommend you get Shogun 2 Total War. It is a great game that would suck your life away. Once you beat the vanilla game you can try out the two new expansions Rise of the Samurai and Fall of the samurai to see how it all started and how it end. I rate this game a 10/10/10 it's a must have! Unless you hate Japan for some reason. Then don't, go buy a new personality instead because the world doesn't need closed minded person like you.			"

But this is by far one of the best if not THEE best game in the series.The thing that made me drawn in and attached to this game more then the others were the traits you can choose for your generals and the tech trees. The family tree is also in this game which is a huge plus for me. The combat is smooth and ambient. The sieges are the best in this game in my opinion (Although i heard Attilas is best but have not played it)The units are all unique and there are many to choose from, this game has at least 2,000+  hours in replay value.

												Before I begin, I would just like to explain the reason I don't have much recorded time on this game is because I play offline. At the time I wrote this review, I must've invested a good 20-30 hours in this game already, only 9 days after recieving it.The main problem I find with most Total Wars (Mainly the ones before Empire) is how complicated it can be, both in battle and the campaign map. Shogun 2 isn't very complicated at all, and it's quite simple and easy to play. You could say it's optimised for a Human's CPU lol. At the same time, the gameplay in both campaign and battle is epic. Despite all being in their same Japanese cultures, the clans have different units and advantages, without ruining the atmosphere of the game, and that, I'm pretty impressed with.For example, the Otomo clan are great with matchlocks, whether it's recruiting them, or firing them; So this makes up for the fact the Otomo isn't well liked due to being Catholic. The Shimazu clan are well known for their mastery of melee combat; And for a simple player like me who relies more on the skill of their soldiers rather than their strategic minds, that's pretty awesome.A tactic I commonly use is matchlocks at the front, bows behind the matchlocks, and infantry behind the bows (And obviously, heavy cavalry at the flanks). This way, both the bows and matchlocks can unleash devastation on the enemy, and when they get too close, I tell my matchlocks and bows to pull back and my infantry to charge. And obviously, if they try to flank me, I'll just run them down with the cavalry.The campaign is pretty damn awesome too. Everything from the diplomacy, to the technological tree, to the city and army management, it's really well made in my opinion. Honour is also taken much more seriously in Japan as well. I wouldn't recommend sacking or razing cities, or any other dishonourable actions, no matter how raging you are because you were betrayed. The thing is, horrendous actions like that lowers your Daimyo's (Faction Leader) honour significantly, and this causes many problems, such as relations being strained with other clans, even if they're your allies. Your subjects and generals will take a disliking to you and become less loyal.Shogun 2 has alright graphics, and runs pretty smoothly most of the time. But I suppose it all depends on what computer you have. Shogun 2 runs on pretty high settings smoothly enough for me though.Aside from the gameplay, I really love the atmosphere of the game itself. The soundtrack reflecting the bloody and terrifying times of the sengoku jidai period in Japan. Especially during battles, the soundtrack gets a bit scary. It just makes you think about how terrified the soldiers must've been, because not all of them were samurai just wanting to die, a lot of them were just civilians levied into the army.I love both Total War and Japanese history, that's why I love this game. If you love Total War and Japanese history, then I would definitely recommend this game.Fall of the Samurai: Normally I don't review DLC but FotS deserves one anyway. Fall of the Samurai is more like Napoleon Total War but 60 years later. This is exactly what I love about it. Why? Because all manner of weapons are much more deadly. From sabres, to rifles, to artillery. This naturally means the battles are much more fast-paced, adding more tension while you're commanding your army. Damage, accuracy, range and reload speed are all increased dramatically.Also, if you've never played the ""Line Infantry Genres"" of Total War, this expansion will force you to adopt new strategies, while under heavy tension.

												Great addition to anyones collection of strategy games. It is turn based so be prepared for a very large scale chess game. Amazing graphics (Depending on if you can run the game well) . The campaign goes in sync with what if scenarios which luanch off historical events. Example of this would be , say i take over Kyoto (Shogun's palace) , i then must hold the city till the following winter and by that point every clan will declare war on you for the right to the throne. Shogun 2 also has quite a few exspansions which gives the player the ability to go out and pay for brand new campaigns with just as imersive story lines and whole new play styles. Overall its a sound game with small flaws like the multiplayer being a bit buggy when it comes to the avatar. Besides that the game is quite fun to play alone or with friends on a joint campaign.Rate this up if it does help you, thanks.			"

												It's Epic. I love Total War, and Shogun 2 hasn't diminished that love, but enhanced it instead. If you haven't played Total War before, I'd suggest playing an earlier game, possibly Empire Total War, as like all games, playing one of the newest ones usually means you're less inclined to go back and play previous titles. Luckily, Total War games are all good, and once you're learnt the battle mechanics, you're good to go. I've always been particularly interested in Oriental culture and my love for Japan isn't a recent thing. However, the flavour of Shogun2, the fantastic artwork, the excellent units and eastern music really completes an already great game. Buy it, Buy it, Buy it, Buy it, BUY IT!!!!!!!			"

The family tree is also in this game which is a huge plus for me. The combat is smooth and ambient. The sieges are the best in this game in my opinion (Although i heard Attilas is best but have not played it)The units are all unique and there are many to choose from, this game has at least 2,000+  hours in replay value.

												Before I begin, I would just like to explain the reason I don't have much recorded time on this game is because I play offline. At the time I wrote this review, I must've invested a good 20-30 hours in this game already, only 9 days after recieving it.The main problem I find with most Total Wars (Mainly the ones before Empire) is how complicated it can be, both in battle and the campaign map. Shogun 2 isn't very complicated at all, and it's quite simple and easy to play. You could say it's optimised for a Human's CPU lol. At the same time, the gameplay in both campaign and battle is epic. Despite all being in their same Japanese cultures, the clans have different units and advantages, without ruining the atmosphere of the game, and that, I'm pretty impressed with.For example, the Otomo clan are great with matchlocks, whether it's recruiting them, or firing them; So this makes up for the fact the Otomo isn't well liked due to being Catholic. The Shimazu clan are well known for their mastery of melee combat; And for a simple player like me who relies more on the skill of their soldiers rather than their strategic minds, that's pretty awesome.A tactic I commonly use is matchlocks at the front, bows behind the matchlocks, and infantry behind the bows (And obviously, heavy cavalry at the flanks). This way, both the bows and matchlocks can unleash devastation on the enemy, and when they get too close, I tell my matchlocks and bows to pull back and my infantry to charge. And obviously, if they try to flank me, I'll just run them down with the cavalry.The campaign is pretty damn awesome too. Everything from the diplomacy, to the technological tree, to the city and army management, it's really well made in my opinion. Honour is also taken much more seriously in Japan as well. I wouldn't recommend sacking or razing cities, or any other dishonourable actions, no matter how raging you are because you were betrayed. The thing is, horrendous actions like that lowers your Daimyo's (Faction Leader) honour significantly, and this causes many problems, such as relations being strained with other clans, even if they're your allies. Your subjects and generals will take a disliking to you and become less loyal.Shogun 2 has alright graphics, and runs pretty smoothly most of the time. But I suppose it all depends on what computer you have. Shogun 2 runs on pretty high settings smoothly enough for me though.Aside from the gameplay, I really love the atmosphere of the game itself. The soundtrack reflecting the bloody and terrifying times of the sengoku jidai period in Japan. Especially during battles, the soundtrack gets a bit scary. It just makes you think about how terrified the soldiers must've been, because not all of them were samurai just wanting to die, a lot of them were just civilians levied into the army.I love both Total War and Japanese history, that's why I love this game. If you love Total War and Japanese history, then I would definitely recommend this game.Fall of the Samurai: Normally I don't review DLC but FotS deserves one anyway. Fall of the Samurai is more like Napoleon Total War but 60 years later. This is exactly what I love about it. Why? Because all manner of weapons are much more deadly. From sabres, to rifles, to artillery. This naturally means the battles are much more fast-paced, adding more tension while you're commanding your army. Damage, accuracy, range and reload speed are all increased dramatically.Also, if you've never played the ""Line Infantry Genres"" of Total War, this expansion will force you to adopt new strategies, while under heavy tension.

												THe last TW I played to death was Medieval 2. I played Empire and NTW briefly but got bored. That being said, here's a few reasons why I think this game is a winner.It looks amazing even 4 years on. Not just the battlefield graphics, but the effort they put into music and aesthetics which makes Shogun 2 really unique and immersive. The campaign map is a serene mix of handrawn maps and little 3D communities and towns, forests that change colour in the autumn, fields that freeze over in the winter.  Everything is represented as drawings and paintings. Units communicate in Japanese. It's polish like this that shows CA went the extra mile.On the battlefield it also looks amazing. The individual choreographed fights among thousands of detailed soldiers is incredible, I've never seen anything like it before in a strategy game.AI is decent. Not amazing, but not brain-dead either. They use cavalry quite well to surround you and get behind your lines. They know when to attack vs. defend on a hill, and support weakened units with reserves. However I've found they're too quick to charge into battle even when they're at a disadvantage. EIther way I get a good challenge.There are very clear advantages/disadvantages between unit types, terrain, weather etc. so you can quickly formulate tactics and strategies.Campaign-wise, I find it's the same old as previous TW games. Attrition and seasons add a nice strategic layer: you can't always afford to starve out cities but storming them will always be costly.I really can't think of any major problems with this game. 9.5/10.

												To review this game we must do so in isolation, ignoring complaints from Amazon reviews and many other areas that claim the excessive Steam download times are unbearable. It is of course frustrating to purchase a new game only to have to wait many, many hours for it to download, but we must accept that the era of disc based gaming is coming to a close and the more cost effective method of direct downloads from the net will dominate the coming decades of gaming. To clarify, I agree that waiting long download times SUCKS completely, but it would be ridiculous to pan a game based on such a development as many fans of the Total War series have seem to of done.Now that aspect has been discussed, we can focus on the gameplay itself. This is a stripped down, back to basics Total War experience, doing away the global theatres of Empire: Total War and also the multiple trade continents that spanned the earth. This far more manageable, niche setting of Shogunate Japan provides an authentic, raw and beautifully brutal backdrop for the Total War series, enhancing the original Shogun instalment and roaring it into the modern era. The aesthetics of the game, the soundtrack, images and unit appearances, all feel genuine and carefully crafted. We truly feel part of the period. Although Japan does not provide the largest of operating theatres for multiple warring factions, this adds to the relentless feel of warfare during this period, as you will be vying for provinces constantly changing hands, battling for strategic strong points. The politics of Empire have been done away with and trade simplified, many will point towards a sense of ‘dumbing down’, but I would argue the developers have changed the game effectively based on the period. Politics, trade theatres and revolution suits Renaissance colonies perfectly, yet by slightly simplifying this edition of Total War we are fully focused on the aspects that made gamers fall in love with the original games, warfare. Battles are large, numerous and chaotic, while the graphics and sounds are Total War at its atmospheric best.As your clan develops (which it will through a streamlined technology tree) you will gain access to powerful units that feel powerful, that you can use effectively in battle. You will also have to choose between foreign temptations and domestic devotion, choosing to gain new weapons and religions from the West or choose to remain loyal to Japans heritage. Both options have their advantages and bring diversity to the gameplay and also provides an historically accurate backdrop. Options for choices such as these are not as numerous as we may like them to be, but they do at least convey the sense that we are head of a powerful clan.Diplomacy is still far from perfect, however Shogun 2’s diplomacy has the fewest faults as opposed to previous instalments. Clans will still turn on you despite alliances and military access can be cancelled at a moments notice for no apparent reason. It would be a welcomed edition to include many more options in the diplomatic relations panel helping to add depth to the diplomatic process, which hopefully we will see in future editions of Total War.Unit types are accurate yet they are not as diverse as previous games. Rome: Total War provided such a high standard of diverse unit type that every game since then has not quite matched it for its unit variety. Most clans have the exact same unit types with only skill bonuses based on clan type that fully distinguish them. Although this may be partly due to the time period, it means that replayability is not quite as enjoyable as many of the clans feel the same. That being said, many hours of gameplay are still available here, its only the miscellany of the hours that is an issue.Sea battles are far more engaging than in Empire, yet withmedieval Japanese warships, the battles were always going to be limited in excitability. They don’t pack the punch that naval battles had in Empire, but they are easier to control and maintain which is an essential plus during large scale battles. They look fantastic however, becoming a staple of the Total War genre. Generals can now gain experience through such sea battles, allowing you to improve certain traits of your commanders  in a basic RPG element that works in tangent with the main game seamlessly.Shogun 2 goes back to what made the original games fantastic. Fast, ferocious and tactical battles supplemented by strategic considerations in the theatre of war. This is Total War back to its brilliant best. There are still issues with the game of course, many of which can be altered and changed through a certain DarthMod, however the vanilla game is still extremely playable. I would fully recommend.Where should the series go next? Empire 2? Ancient China? The Great War? What are your thoughts on Shogun 2 and Rome 2? Any comments are welcome whether you agreed or disagreed with my review. I’ll be sure to reply to all comments when I can. Thanks for reading.			"

												I've played Napoleon, Medieval, Rome, Empire, and now Shogun 2Shogun is 100% better, and i will explain why.The gameplay, is very challenging, such as the campgains, even the multiplayer.In this game, you will learn much more, than the previous games.In this total war title, you need to be an agressive player, and to learn faster, troops qualities, and troops skills. Shogun is 100% the hardest total war i've ever played. I'm still trying to understand how to play it, because it's to hard for me, wich is a good thing.Btw, the graphics, the soundtracks, the atmosphere... etc, are an important thing in this game, and you will understand why, i dont think i can explain more, this total war is a piece of art, try it, you will love it, and love it, and love it!a big tip for multiplayer: if you dont have the fall of the samurai expasion, it will be very hard against other playersIncredible Game.

												Total War: Shogun 2 is a Turn based strategy game based on 16th century in Japan. Time that most people call the ""Edo Period"". Period with mainly only wars, destruction, pain and sorrow. A time when almost every bigger clan was battling to gain their place on the ""throne"". Every clan wanted their Daimyo to become a Shogunate.In Total War: Shogun 2 (I'll just say Shogun 2 from now on) your objective is to rise your fame by conquering other clans and province, make alliances with other clans and to get big and strong enough army to face the Shogunate himself. In case that you do not know, Shogunate was like a ""king"" in Japan. ""The ruler of them all"".In Shogun 2 you can chose almost any of the strongest clans that existed in the Edo Period.  And if you ask me, Shogun 2 is a great way to learn what was happening in Japan in 16th century. Maybe you even start to like one clan so much that you'll know almost everything about them! For example, I'm a huge fan of Date clan because they were masters of the sword ( Katana ). My dear June is a big fan of Takeda clan because they were best cavalry in that time. She likes horses. She even has two horses at home!Each clan in Shogun 2 has their own boost at the things that they were good at. As i stated before, Date has boost in sword fights and Takeda has strongest cavalry. Clan named Chosokabe has a boost in bow damage and so on and on. You chose your clan by how you want to play, and what kinds of tactics do you want to use in battles. You start off on the part of land which was owned by your clan from the very beginning. Then you need to start making armies and start conquering.Shogun 2 is not like any other turn based strategy games. In this game you do not have many buildings to build. There are, but you can't chose where you want to put them. And you can't really even see them in battle (unless you battle on the terrain where that building is). You can only build the amount of building as your owned area allows you to. For example if your ""fortress"" (sorry, i don't know how were those buildings called in that time) is on level 3, you can only build 2-4 more buildings on the area. As you upgrade the ""fortress"" to level 4, you get another more building spot for some other building such as stables, archery school or any other combat or non-combat oriented building.In Shogun 2 your goal is to become a Shogunate. You have few years (i think that 25 is on easiest) to do so. 1 Year has 4 turns - Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter. One great thing about Shogun is that if your army is on enemy territory during the winter (or enemy's army is on your territory) your army (or enemy's ) will get slightly smaller in numbers due to deaths because of colds or lack of food or something. Very realistic indeed!Unlocking new, stronger units is easy in this game. Just build few new buildings and you get samurai units such as ""Katana Samurai"" or ""Yarri Samurai"". But even those stronger, Samurai units can fall easily if your opponent uses a good tactic against you. That's why Shogun 2's multiplayer is very hard and tricky. You can't just plan your attack two days before you have a battle and then just do it. You need to plan it within the fight! Because there is always something that goes wrong.There are also three different game types in Shogun 2. Naval battle, Land battle and Siege mode. I am terrible in Naval battle and thus, I really can't tell you anything about it. Land battle is a battle where your only objective is to eliminate your enemy, with any units that you have. You can put your Bow Samurai on the top of a hill and Katana Samurai at the bottom of it so nobody else could kill your Samurai and BAM! Your victory is almost granted. Unless your enemy has cavalry which means that your Katana Samruai  might die very fast. In Siege mode you can either be an attacker or defender. Defender needs to kill the attacker and hold the fort for as long as they can, while attacker's mission is to get into the fort any way they can (either with bombs that destroy gates, or climbing over the wall) and either kill all the defender or grab all the spots in the fortress. Sounds easy but it's actually very hard. People usually tend to use Ninjas a lot on this kind of missions since they think that Ninjas are better in stealth or better climbers then samurais. Sure, they are, but Samurais are bigger in number, and in my opinion Samurais are better fighters.   I only say that because I like Samurais more :PIn Avatar battles you make your own clan, which is awesome if you ask me. There are various ingame signs that you put on your flag, you put your own custom colors and chose which weapon will they be the best with. I didn't play too much of Avatar combat because people that usually play it are all higher rank than me and thus, they have much better and more trained units then me. That doesn't mean i can't win thought. In fact, i won quite a few games! And all were versus people on 8 + higher level! You can even do more then 1 versus 1. You can get into group battles. So call your friends, ready your horses, swords, bows or spears and go into battles together!One commentator asked me to write some battle tactics. Honestly i'm not good at deciding tactics. I do tactic while i play. But in single player, i usually put all my army into the forest and i put my katana users in front of bow users. So in case that enemy gets closer, i pause the game, grab each unit ant point each onto their own enemy. I do the same with bow users. So the enemy can't come near my bows who actually kill everyone and everything. That's my normal, very easy to learn and master tactic.Pros:- Wonderful fraphic.- Massive battles with over 20 units per player.- Various terrains to chose from.- Make your own clan in multiplayer.- Unit customization in multiplayer.- Make your own story and become the next Shogunate!Cons:- Requires a very strong computer.- Has way too many DLC's which only means more cost.- Loading on beginning of the game lasts very, very long.- Character's mouth don't move when they talk (yea, very unneeded detail.... But it's a detail!)Now when you rode this whole review, its up to you to decide if Total War: Shogun 2 is a game for you or not! To be honest, it's currently one of my favorite games. I was playing it a lot with June over summer (we sat together, one beside another. She would build armies, conquer lands, and I'd be her war general. I'd win all the battles) so it's kinda boring now when i play it alone.But if we forget that, I love this game! It's absolutely great! If you're as big Samurai fan as I am, and a strategy fan, this game is a MUST GET!Thank you for reading my reviews! Don't forget that I'm usually posting new reviews on my blog weekly and you can check them out here:[/b] http://midnightwolfie.blogspot.comThank you![/b] "

												I don't like this game much, admittedly, but does that mean it is a bad game? No. It's just not for me. So, Shogun 2 is yet another installment in the Total War series. That is going to scare some people off already, and understandably so. It's set in the era of the Shogun and the Samauri, which unlike Empire and Napoleon, I have absolutely no knowledge or, nor do I have any intrest. The game itself is quite mixed in it's good and bad qualities, and in my opinion, the pushing factor either way is whether or not you actually care about the era in which the game is set. The interface is rather offputting to say the least, or so I found it to be. Multiplayer battles were hidden behind this useless avatar conquest thing that has been added, and I still have no idea what the point was. It's rather a waste of time, and just makes it harder to find the multiplayer battles list. The campaign is quite big, to my understanding. There are a lot of options from upgrades in military and infrastructure, and government management has changed a bit I think. Again, I do not like the overcomplicated interface that they added to do this. Was the simplistic, yet effective style of previous games not good enough? I personlly don't like the feel of the campaign, and so I never play it. Battles are it's strongest point, perhaps, with a rather diverse selection of factions to play as and many units within those to chose from, it does make it quite intresting. Graphically, I do not like the game at all, the maps look like plasticine and the battle doesn't feel realistic at all. This game really let me down. I was quite excited to get it, but rarely play it as there is practically nothing to like about it. They did a much better job of previous titles such as Empire and Napoleon, and that's sating something because Empire was badly made. Overall I think personally the only way one could truly like this game is simply through intrest in the era, otherwise, I'd move on from this title. I'd give it a feeble 3/10 - and even that is probably because it has decent cinematics. Of course, the game doesn't look that good... "

Posted: December 27, 2015
												Overview:Firstly I love total war games. This game is one of the weaker ones in my opinion and I'll get onto why I think so, bearing in mind that Medieval 2 is my favourite and I also love Rome 1 and even quite like Attila - all games with Europe as the campaign map. However, it's still a good game overall, but it's just not a great ""total war"" game.BattlesFirstly, the main thing I liked about this total war was that the battles are fast paced and quite fun. The cavalry in particular feel great to use when charging in: they literally send units flying. The battles do have a more ""arcadey"" feel compared to other total wars, but the fast pace is one of the unique things about this game and depending what you prefer might be worth the price alone.However, there are a few gripes here when you compare this game to rome 1 and medieval (without being nostalgic). Every single clan has almost exactly the same units which made me get bored of the battles very quickly compared to every other total war. Siege maps are uninteresting, literally being a single circular wall, as opposed to actual castles, villages, towns or cities. Everything about the battles seems to be geared towards making it a more ""balanced game"" for humans to play vs each other as, instead of fun.The CampaignFrom the ground up this game seems like it was geared for multiplayer. Playing the campaign feels like a board game, in which there are only 5 ""real"" players and a host of insingificant clans which exist solely to be taken over by the main 5-8 players clans, all in close proximity. The map of Japan was dissapointingly small and controlling the sea and trading feels more like a chore than an interesting aspect. It's probably a more balanced map for playing multiplayer campaigns but this leaves the single player campaign feeling very shallow compared to other games, particularly against CA's trademark awful AI.The campaigns in pretty much every other total war game have reasonably varied factions, starting positions and rosters which gives the game a massive replay value. Comparitively, I've completed one campaign in this game and I feel no need to ever play another campaign again: not only is there little to no variation and the map is too small to be interesting to replay, but the actual progression of the campaign feels almost scripted, because everything seems to progress in a linear way. To me this kills a lot of the fun of the game.Finally, the diplomacy in this game is probably the worst in the series. It's never been a real strong point of the franchise, but here it is almost completely pointless - and after realm divide, it truly is pointless. The only thing the diplomacy is used for in this game is to create trade agreements, which, I should add, give far too much income in this game. It's almost like they didn't even test the diplomacy.ConclusionIt was hard to choose whether to recommend this game or not, because it's still a decent game that's probably worth a play through. But in my opinion it's one of the worst total war games, probably because CA prioritised the wrong things in development and forgot what made total war fun. I would definitely recommend getting Medieval 2 or Rome 1 instead, which as well as being more fun on the first playthrough, keep you coming back for more. This game is too ""arcadey"" and monotonous for me to think of it as a real total war game: it seems like an experiment in making a very ""balanced"", multiplayer-friendly total war, and this is overall why I can't recommend the game. Ultimately, CA really need to go back to their roots. From empire onwards, the games lost a lot of what made them great - attila's taken a slight step back towards the right direction, but it's still far from as fun as medieval 2, which still I go back to even despite the fact I have all the others. The last few total wars just don't feel as rewarding to play.			"

												Total War Shogun III usually love the Total War games. However, Shogun II is not that good. Primarily the unit upkeep costs are very high. This allows the AI clans to overrun each other and become huge early in the game. Usually a nearby clan will have 10+ provinces while I have 3. Also, citizen unhappiness is a real problem, forcing me to keep large forces in newly occupied towns until the citizens are happier. Meanwhile the huge clans just get larger.I guess things my get better as one plays but currently it is not that fun.Medieval II, Empire and Napoleon Total War games are much more fun.Shogun II has potential but is just a little shy on being fun. I do not hate the game but there are better games to spend time on. This game is almost good.Also, the game has older graphics and is difficult to get running. Adobe Flash player 11 is required forcing the user to uninstall Flash 19, currently needed for the internet. Many players have great difficulty getting Shogun II to even run.I recommend Total War Empire or Medieval II over Shogun II.			"

												This is by far the best out of the series i played TW: Rome 2 and had to come back. Things that make this game great are the fact that you can create your own Daimyo avatar for multiplayer games, along with that, this game never gets old. I can storm Kyoto a million times with all the different clans and still be just a satisfied each time. The only thing that could be wrong with this game is that a large portion of the game is siege battles if you plan on playing the single player that is but with the economy system and tech tree at least you can choose which way you decide to storm Kyoto. Should i make a bunch of crap spearman and rush or sit back and wait to get some good samurai that never let me down The diplomacy is kinda useless unless you want an ally that will eventually betray you but thats pretty much every game a computer should never be allowed to run a country. . another reason why i prefer this single player overr TW: Rome 2's is because Rome 2 is just too big. Infact everything is just bigger from the campaign maps to the battles everything just seems way too big. I like the arena deathmatch feel they put in Shogun 2 opposed to the Conquer the world and get lost amongst your own provinces you own in Rome 2.The multiplayer is great a nice map or japan that you and your created army must take over. i love the effort they put in the multiplayer. you can edit you units uniforms and your Daimyo entire outfit along with his horse. aside from that there is also a mulitplayer campaign where you and a buddy can either conquer japan together or fight each other to the death. This game is great i alsp suggest getting the fall of the samurai too goes nice the this game.			"

												If you are into Japanese history, this is the game for you! You can fight for the Imperialists and assist them in reforming Japan, or you can go against history and fight for the Shogun and keep the military control of Japan.The gameplay is a little different when you first start off, but soon enough the controls and hotkeys become second nature. The graphics are absolutely stunning as well.On the flip side, if you understand how the battle engine works, you can beat the computer a majority of the time. So, when this happens, ramp up the difficulty and see how far you can go.Ganbatte!			"

												This game is the epitomy of what a Total War game should be; it has a great AI, awesome graphics, stellar battles and an exceptional ""atmosphere"". The community maps in the workshop make for endless battle options and the multiplayer contains an Avatar system that allows you to create a general and work your way up in the online battles, unlocking new items and better soldiers. The only real difficulty is the finances on the campaign, but if you like a challenge, this game is for you!			"

												The Total war series is one of the only games that I would say I follow 'loyally'. Epic scale, historical simulation, beautiful graphics, and even RPG elements for your generals; this game truly is a 'story engine'. More in line with the feel of M2TW, as opposed to the minutae of Empire TW, what it lacks in scale and cultural differences it makes up for in immersion and strategic nuance. 10/10, and not a game to miss.

												So yeah, only took a few YEARS to own a machine capable of running this (great work sega -.-) and really?...I love it and all, favourite period of history and all that but at times the gameplay feels really rushed and finishes too quickly. Maybe I'm just too used to medieval total war, but either way I'd reommend this definitely. Just only buy it when it's cheap, don't spend out plenty to find your machine, which should be more than capable to run it, simply...NOT run it. (Seriously Sega, you f***ed up this one)			"

												Right up there with Civilization V and XCOM: Enemy Unknown as one of the best strategy games in the last ten years. This is truly a thinking man's game, requiring good use of every soldier you have and real life tactics. There is truly no better feeling then to march to battle with a smaller force and decimate an enemy horde because you out-thought them. Forget Rome and Empire, this is the best Total War to date.

												A wonderful return to form for the Total War series. Every game in the Total War series since Rome has been rushed, buggy, and had horrible AI and spotty decision making, reeking of an unfinished game. No longer. They have finally broken the mold with this game.There are problems. Don't get me wrong. It's not perfect - but it's complete. Your units follow your orders to the death. There are few movement bugs. The AI is competent enough to challenge you in strategic warfare, actually raising armies and attempting to take territory. They will not shy from engaging you. Nor does the campaign hand you the keys to victory as every other Total War game (since Rome) seems to.Buy it. For the love of god. Vote with your wallet. Show Sega that the only thing they have to do is SIT BACK AND LET THEIR DEVELOPERS WORK.			"

												I love this game! Clan packs are worth it! Game has amazing visuals at maximum video quality, although I only recomend higher quality settings if you own a computer with better than recommended qualities. Custom battles are fun to play around in and campaign is amazing. You can chose the length of your campaign which is a good feature. City managing is good and despite complaints I heard, diplomacy works fine but is very simplistic. Enemies will wage war on you and some clans do expand and become roughly the same size as your clan late in the campaign. Enemy armies usually contain many units and are powerful. Agents are useful and I use them a lot. Upgrade trees for agents, generals, and clan development are organized and make hard choices to choose which upgrade or research. A good thing is massive armies and navies will greatly impact your income so having less units that are better is a good strategy. Real time battles are fun and I always look forward to them, especially when they are between massive armies. AI is good, although it does some questionable things. I had this problem only once though. The AI's calvalry unit ran in circles instead of charging my ranged unit who was firing at them and eventually broke them. Sea battles are fun, although I don't have them often. Despite minor bugs, the game is excellent. I recomend this game to anyone who likes strategy.			"

												I love this game! Clan packs are worth it! Game has amazing visuals at maximum video quality, although I only recomend higher quality settings if you own a computer with better than recommended qualities. Custom battles are fun to play around in and campaign is amazing. You can chose the length of your campaign which is a good feature. City managing is good and despite complaints I heard, diplomacy works fine but is very simplistic. Enemies will wage war on you and some clans do expand and become roughly the same size as your clan late in the campaign. Enemy armies usually contain many units and are powerful. Agents are useful and I use them a lot. Upgrade trees for agents, generals, and clan development are organized and make hard choices to choose which upgrade or research. A good thing is massive armies and navies will greatly impact your income so having less units that are better is a good strategy. Real time battles are fun and I always look forward to them, especially when they are between massive armies. AI is good, although it does some questionable things. I had this problem only once though. The AI's calvalry unit ran in circles instead of charging my ranged unit who was firing at them and eventually broke them. Sea battles are fun, although I don't have them often. Despite minor bugs, the game is excellent. I recomend this game to anyone who likes strategy.			"

												This is by far the most entertaining Total war game made. The game can be played in a way that is entertaining for the casual and hardcore audiences. The Campaign presents a truely dynamic experience that presents hundreds of hours of entertainment just by itself. The campaign can be played in co-op with a friend which only bolsters the experience. it was fairly rare that i experienced any latence, drop outs or de-syncs within the co-op and the same can be applied for the adverserial multiplayer, which provides a rich and deep experience in of its own. The games additional content is well above par. (rise of the samurai can be a little bland, but that is a personal opinion) and will provide even more entertainment for your money. It would of been nicer to see a more in depth diplomacy system, but past that i dont have many quells with this game. Shogun 2 will present you with that ""just one more turn itch"" that i seek in a strategy game and is a must buy for any PC gamer.			"

												A wonderful return to form for the Total War series. Every game in the Total War series since Rome has been rushed, buggy, and had horrible AI and spotty decision making, reeking of an unfinished game. No longer. They have finally broken the mold with this game.There are problems. Don't get me wrong. It's not perfect - but it's complete. Your units follow your orders to the death. There are few movement bugs. The AI is competent enough to challenge you in strategic warfare, actually raising armies and attempting to take territory. They will not shy from engaging you. Nor does the campaign hand you the keys to victory as every other Total War game (since Rome) seems to.Buy it. For the love of god. Vote with your wallet. Show Sega that the only thing they have to do is SIT BACK AND LET THEIR DEVELOPERS WORK.			"

If you're new to Total War, don't worry, the game is very newb-friendly. The gameplay is solid and addicting, even though the A.I. was a bit slow at launch. And the music! It is perhaps the greatest soundtrack for any strategy game. Also, there is a ton of community support for this game, releasing mods to help augment your experience. In my opinion, Total War: Shogun 2 is the best game in the Total War franchise.			"

												Shogun 2 is hands down one of the best RTS games I've ever played and, in my opinion, one of the best RTS games period. The gameplay, meta game, mechanics, and overall feel of the game just tie together so well. And the MUSIC. OH MY GOD. You feel the pain of your troops dying, the tension of your ninja sneaking into an enemy fort, the overwhelming swell of victory as you charge through their lines of yari samurai. This game is not only fun, it shows you a rich period of history not commonly covered in textbooks and gives the player the understanding of the great sacrifices and strifes associated with war.Play this game.10/10I wish multiplayer campaigns could be played with more than two people. But this is otherwise a perfect experience.			"

												While I am not a fan of the Warscape engine in terms of the management of settlements, this is still a fine addition to the Total War repertoire. With beautiful scenery and units only disrupted by the brutality of the combat, this is a visual feast. There is also fantastic small details in the combat, I love me dem Samurai duels! The game lacks the epic scope of previous campaigns due to its setting but it is still slick and the battles are the most rewarding yet.			"

												The first Total War game I ever played was the orginal Shogun (many years ago) and I've played the series ever since. The orginal Shogun is quite simplistic and rather dated now, in terms of the things that newer Total war games have to offer, however my love for that game did lead me to buy Shogun 2. And I've not regretted that decision. Shogun 2 is by far one of the best Total war games I've played. It takes everything that is good about TBS games and adds to it;~ Weather conditions play more of a factor in battles, adding realism. Thus players need to adapt better strategies when deploying troops. ~ Naval battles have been expanded and mechanics are much improved from Empire. ~ The overall feel to the game is improved. Clans and Generals seem to have different personalities which enhances your intrigue for the game. ~ The Campaign map on Empire, I felt was too large and I personally seemed to get bogged down with watching things such as finances and overseas settlements than actually trying to dominate the map. Shogun goes back to focussing on the ""War"" element, that made Rome and Medieval 2 so popular but it adds more in depth realism where it's wanted most; battles. ~ Creating an avatar and unlocking units on online multiplayer keeps your drawn once you're through with campaign.By far one of the best games I own. Must buy for TBS gamers and Total War fans.  "

Its fun unlocking the next units and capturing the provinces.The music really helps building up the atmosphere of the game, the taiko drums are amazing, it's not surprising that Shogun 2 had one of the best OSTs of 2011.Other things that are not much, but it means a lot for me:-The inspiring speeches of the general of each battle in singleplayer, for example: 我々の目的はただ一つだ：この城を落すことじゃ！-Random lines, like: まだ風がありますよ！			"

												A huge improvement from older Total War games. Shogun 2 has a great design and creative layout. Once you get past the (not so hard) learning curve it is very hard to stop crushing your enemies, and trading wifes to save alliences.       If you havent played any of the total war games they essentually play like this, its composed of a strategic map view where you build your armies, manage your empires economy, organized your generals, and engage in diplomacy with other diamoes in futal japan. The other part of the game is when two enemy armies meet on the campaign map, they will engage in a real time tactical battle which will display thousands of soldiers engaging in ranged and hand to hand combat. All of this with really impressive combat animation. This game has come a long way from the original offering in Total War Shogun back in the year 2000. Naval battles, siege battles, and even ambushes all add to keep it fresh and interesting. Campaigns can take a single day, or up to weeks depending on the perameters you set.Multiplayer:        So you can see how multiplayer has always been a really tough mode to include for the series. But Shogun 2 does a few things that makes it manageable. First you have the real traditional (and now) cooperative multiplayer campaign, a feature that Napolatin Total War lacked. This is where you can ally with a friend or even compete against them same as you would in a normal campaign with all the features. With each of your taking turns on the campaign map. And in battles you can even split control of armies just make sure you have plenty of time to go this full mode. However for people that like their gaming in shorter bursts you can now engage in a new mode called avatar conquest, where you can create your own general, create your own army and then engaege against other multiplayer generals. These wins and losses then apply towards a campaign map where your fighting for control of japan. WIth all these new features creative assembly has really found the perfect balance for legitimate multiplayer in this already epic game, extending its huge playtime already hundreds of hours to some ridiculous levels.Graphics:      The element aspect of this game is amazing, I usually rate the graphics of games by their water graphics. The way the water moves from the current and wind, the shine from the sun and other light objects. Well I am very happy that this game gets it right. In naval battles the ocean currents crash against your ship if your not facing the against the current, you must pay attention to the wind to see if it will be easy to sail, etc.. The huge battles that play ontop of big moutainus regions and hilly lands are amazing to watch and control. All of the soldiers have visible combat animations by actual sword master. and this takes up upon thousands of troops at a time. A truly remarkable game.            94/100        94% Magnificent			"

												Awesome Game, A few Crashes, Few Bugs, but it's totally different then the Rome Series, more isolated, there's no more landing from ships to land as so far which i haven't seen, making land positions pretty important, but so far it makes up with all the things, like ninjas, and having guns, and all the new other stuff that most of the other games would not have, exept napoleon, it's a 4.5/5 for me.EDIT: you can travel within ships, the difference from other Total war games, is that it's just not as important as other games so it barely happens.

												I love this game, but there has to be a clear warning that the game is not compatible cross-platform Mac and PC in multiplayer - I specifically bought this game on my Mac to play with a buddy on a PC, and it was really disappointing to find out after the fact from the community forums that they are not cross-platform. It would be another thing if there was a warning on the product page, but nothing on the product page indicates a lack of cross-platform functionality. This is an easy enough fix that was stated earlier in community forums, so it's unclear to me why it hasn't been done yet.			"

												One of the most beautifully crafted strategy games ever made. Aside from the great gameplay, limitless replay value, solid game mechanics, decent AI, and many other brilliant game features, I say this game is worth it simply for the music, art, and style which literally immerse you into ancient Japan. If you ever wanted to a feel like a mighty Japanese warlord – this game is for you! In 2015, I am still waiting for a TOTAL WAR game with similar immersive quality to be released. Its safe to say I will wait for many more years...  (I play this game out of steam.) "

												The game is enjoyable for those who like Total War strategy games. Very High graphics quality, but there are some tough mechanics. Seiges are so awful on troops trying to storm walls that I usually manual my seige defenses to make the computer take massive casualites just to storm one castle, and I just autoresolve attack seiges because the comp usually rounds nicely in your favor as long as you have 3:2 ratio or better number of troops. Ikko Ikki is fun for the religious conversion strategy, Oda clan can literally spam cheap, high morale ashigaru pikemen for the win on most difficulties. Against late-game samurai-heavy armies, you're either gonna need twice as many pikes, or you'll have to tech up. Veterancy and location specific upgrades like superior ironforged weapons are helpful for ashigaru units when the bot samurais come out.Oh, I see you brought seige equipment. Well, I brought 5 more units of spearmen for every seige unit you have, with even less upkeep. Get Rekt bots. Naval invasions hurt.			"

												Let's keep it simple, this game is nothing short of a masterpiece. In my opinion, one the best of the total war serie, second only to fall of the samurai wich is suprisingly different, more than just an expantion. I would change only the endgame mechanic wich gets way too hard after you reach a tipping point. Game goes from fairly easy to crazy hard in one turn as the whole remaining npcs turn against you, even your closest allies.			"

												Alright where to start, I own every total war but Rome 2, I also own shogun 1. Now i've only got about 50 hours in shogun 2, but it is most definetly my favorite total war. It has the best optimization by FAR. Also the graphics are stunning and the blood pack is really nice. The Sengoku Jidai period of time is an amazing setting and make sure to purchase Fall of the Samurai. The animations are stunning, the battles are intense, you actually feel like♥♥♥♥♥♥when your best general dies in this total war. The map is also rather large. The only downside is vanilla Shogun 2's naval battles, they are rather dull. FOTS has very good naval battles. The multiplayer is also amazing with the online campaigns and the avatar conquest. Drop-in battles are an awesome feature i like to use to ruin my friends' days. Shogun 2 is definetly one of, if not the, best total war. I enjoy every single total war game equally, but something about Shogun 2 really clicked with me and i fell in love with it. Buy it, love it, live it, let it ruin your social life.			"

												Do u like Samurai. Do u want to command a army of them this is the game for youHere are the good things:In campaign you have more control of your clan then in some other total war games or games in genrale, you can decide if your faction is pro-shogun or empirialist, while you may start out as one or the other you can change that.the agents are realy nice they dont always fail even thought the % thing says its a low chance 40% is likely to succed. Agents all so upgrade fast engough if used correctly.there are a wide veriaty of units to use by any caln (but tsu cause the crap) that also come with awide variaty of weaponsthe things in the technolagy tree are pretty coolNow some bad thingsTRAINS WERE ARE U. basicly u have to have 2 telagraph stations to upgrade to get 2 train stations why 2 cause tresspasing and that jazz. the problem with this is it takes a long time to get ur technolagy there cause u are consentrating on war tech cause there are a lot of wars going on and it takes for ever to get that tech. i spent a hole campaing trying to get troops on a train and still never got to that tech in time cause other people declared war on meBut other then train issues the game is great the naval combat is great and on a campign can help a seige.

												If you enjoyed the original Shogun total war, then it's likely you'll also enjoy Shogun 2. The campaign is an enjoyable and challenging experience that will have you plotting your path to victory in many ways, and enjoy yourself on the way there. The AI in combat is quite smart so be prepared for a challenge. I will sum up the good and bad to help you decide if the game is worth playing or not.Good: Beautiful music & graphics           A wide range of different units, allowing a diverse array of strategies in combat.           End turn wait times are relatively quick compared to other total war games.           Fully customisable multiplayer mode.           Multiplayer uses a ranking system allowing you to gain more feats and units as you finish a battle.Bad: Diplomacy AI is bad/unintelligent        Load times can be an issue.        Cavalry movement is unrealistic and doesn't obey the laws of physics. (Able to charge forward at full momentum and              stop dead in their tracks and turn the other way instantly.)        Multiplayer is ruined by DLC units making it unfair for those who do not wish to purchase extra content.        Morale system is stupidly broken, allowing you to rout units instantly if piling morale debuffs consecutively.On the whole the game is great if you enjoy total war campaigns, but it can get repetitive if you play often, and you may find multiplayer enjoyable albeit a little unfair and agrravating at times.7/10			"

												Best Total War title I've played so far. The game visuals are gorgeous both in battle view and world view. Battles are very diverse, there are dozens of options for stealth or ranged combat. Economy seems simple for a strategy game, being limited to trading which seems pretty much automatic and planning of building upgrades in key provinces. However, given the amount of warfare and strategy, there's just the right amount of economy in this game.Playing with AI on Hard is very competitive. Spent a lot of time on multiplayer and it works well - creating a match, saving and resuming is not a problem at all, and we had little connectivity issues.I recommend it if you enjoyed other Total War games, or if you like strategy games focused on battle more than economy.

												Another really fun game in the Total war series. Great graphics. Good AI. However unlike total war you have a very small map (japan) and cant be any nation but one of the clans in Japan. The multiplayer campaign was alot of fun as well as singleplayer.I named myself shogun and everyone declared war on me. I saw some people compalining it was impossible once you made your self shogun but its not. Just have a large army ready if your going to do that like I did.1. Great Graphics2. High replay value3. CO OP for the grand campaign! Finally!4. small map9/10 stars			"

												Most of the time strategy titles come in one of two flavors, real time or turn based, both which have their merits and draw backs, Shogun 2, like other games in the Total War series blends both into a solid and satisfying mix. From the campaign map you run your clan and make decisions regarding what is built in your lands, how much you tax those living under your rule, building your armies in a strategic Risk like manner, and in battles you have the chance to either auto-resolve or personally take command of the battle yourself, of the two options I highly recomend the latter. The battles are large, epic and quite a sight to behold and the fact that you cant replenish troops mid battle means more focus on actual tactics rather than simple zerg rush style tactis. Plus there are few things more satisfying than overcoming a larger army through good strategy and tactics. The fact that you can zoom in for a close view of the clashes as they happen and the pre-battle speeches by your generals add to the feel and presentation of the real time battles and because of that it' all the more worth it to take control for yourself. Other things that add to it is your troops fatigue, the morale that is effected by the flow of the batle and the presence of the general and even weather condition that can help or hinder.Things are slower on the campaign map of course, much like chess thats where more than anything you will be thinking and planning, with your armies and agents being represented like game pieces on the map which you can move from place to place. Expanding, and growing is something that cant be rushed, or else you will be crushed under the weight of a clan that simply cannot be supported, whether it's because the army is simply so large it costs too much to maintain, food shortages across the land, or just large scale public unrest, it's better to be methodical and take it slow, picking the right moves for the right time. Diplomacy between clans has features not seen in other games that add to your immersion. Your clan's daimyo (ie: you) is not some disembodied presence giving orders, but an actual unit that is a powerful general, not only is he represented but also his family tree, with sons that will one day become generals, and take his place when he dies, daughters which can be useful in forming diplomatic ties to other clans and various other relatives. Another thing to keep an eye on is our generals and their loyalty, a disloyal general can turn on you and tke his troop with him so keeping them loyal is a good idea.  Aside from that there are the standards like trade agreements and alliances.Overall Shogun 2 is a must have for fans of the strategy genre.			"

Buy all the expansion packs ""Rise of the samurai"" and ""Fall of the samurai"" You dont need the orginal game of Shogun 2, if you are only gonna buy ""Fall of the samurai"" You can play Shogun 2 online, if you want.

												A huge improvement from older Total War games. Shogun 2 has a great design and creative layout. Once you get past the (not so hard) learning curve it is very hard to stop crushing your enemies, and trading wifes to save alliences.       If you havent played any of the total war games they essentually play like this, its composed of a strategic map view where you build your armies, manage your empires economy, organized your generals, and engage in diplomacy with other diamoes in futal japan. The other part of the game is when two enemy armies meet on the campaign map, they will engage in a real time tactical battle which will display thousands of soldiers engaging in ranged and hand to hand combat. All of this with really impressive combat animation. This game has come a long way from the original offering in Total War Shogun back in the year 2000. Naval battles, siege battles, and even ambushes all add to keep it fresh and interesting. Campaigns can take a single day, or up to weeks depending on the perameters you set.Multiplayer:        So you can see how multiplayer has always been a really tough mode to include for the series. But Shogun 2 does a few things that makes it manageable. First you have the real traditional (and now) cooperative multiplayer campaign, a feature that Napolatin Total War lacked. This is where you can ally with a friend or even compete against them same as you would in a normal campaign with all the features. With each of your taking turns on the campaign map. And in battles you can even split control of armies just make sure you have plenty of time to go this full mode. However for people that like their gaming in shorter bursts you can now engage in a new mode called avatar conquest, where you can create your own general, create your own army and then engaege against other multiplayer generals. These wins and losses then apply towards a campaign map where your fighting for control of japan. WIth all these new features creative assembly has really found the perfect balance for legitimate multiplayer in this already epic game, extending its huge playtime already hundreds of hours to some ridiculous levels.Graphics:      The element aspect of this game is amazing, I usually rate the graphics of games by their water graphics. The way the water moves from the current and wind, the shine from the sun and other light objects. Well I am very happy that this game gets it right. In naval battles the ocean currents crash against your ship if your not facing the against the current, you must pay attention to the wind to see if it will be easy to sail, etc.. The huge battles that play ontop of big moutainus regions and hilly lands are amazing to watch and control. All of the soldiers have visible combat animations by actual sword master. and this takes up upon thousands of troops at a time. A truly remarkable game.            94/100        94% Magnificent			"

												Most likely the apex of the Total War series, Shogun 2 manages to hit almost every high point the series has had in previous installments. Shogun 2, despite trimming down some features like town management, manages to capture the previous games' glory without sacrificing much beyond excess tedium. Despite this, it still has a steep learning curve as in the previous installments. The more focused scope of the game allows for a much easier time of getting into the series, placing Shogun 2 as the first game that one should buy if they are interested in the Total War series in this reviewer's opinion.Strengths:Preserves the depth of the franchise without getting lost in the tedium.Beautiful, engaging visuals with some heavily stylized artwork.Preserves the culture of feudal Japan, doing it great justice.Good mod support.Focus on Japan ensures you understand every unit's purpose.Weaknesses:Relatively steep learning curve, despite having been more simplified.Discouraging to new players, as the game can take some time to truly start in force. (Not exactly a con for veterans)Small focus on Japan, disallowing unit diversity.Overall numerical rating: 9-9.5			"

												For anyone wanting to play a total war game set in the 1600 Japan then this is without a doubt a Total War game set in that time in Japan. Buying the GOTY or Total War shogun 2 that includes DLC might be a better idea rather than buying them seperatly as usual with these kind of games. Rise of the samurai and Fall of the samurai aren't that much of ""need to get"" dlc:s but they do add some stuff that I personally liked (Fujiwara that mentions Chinese traditions, or in Fall of the Samurai my typical ""live by the blade"" playthroughs).So buy this on a sale with all the dlc and it will have great immersive battles for those into this kind of game and setting.Too bad steam don't track the hours I play this offline.

												The first Total War game I ever played was the orginal Shogun (many years ago) and I've played the series ever since. The orginal Shogun is quite simplistic and rather dated now, in terms of the things that newer Total war games have to offer, however my love for that game did lead me to buy Shogun 2. And I've not regretted that decision. Shogun 2 is by far one of the best Total war games I've played. It takes everything that is good about TBS games and adds to it;~ Weather conditions play more of a factor in battles, adding realism. Thus players need to adapt better strategies when deploying troops. ~ Naval battles have been expanded and mechanics are much improved from Empire. ~ The overall feel to the game is improved. Clans and Generals seem to have different personalities which enhances your intrigue for the game. ~ The Campaign map on Empire, I felt was too large and I personally seemed to get bogged down with watching things such as finances and overseas settlements than actually trying to dominate the map. Shogun goes back to focussing on the ""War"" element, that made Rome and Medieval 2 so popular but it adds more in depth realism where it's wanted most; battles. ~ Creating an avatar and unlocking units on online multiplayer keeps your drawn once you're through with campaign.By far one of the best games I own. Must buy for TBS gamers and Total War fans.  "

Its fun unlocking the next units and capturing the provinces.The music really helps building up the atmosphere of the game, the taiko drums are amazing, it's not surprising that Shogun 2 had one of the best OSTs of 2011.Other things that are not much, but it means a lot for me:-The inspiring speeches of the general of each battle in singleplayer, for example: 我々の目的はただ一つだ：この城を落すことじゃ！-Random lines, like: まだ風がありますよ！			"

												In Total War: Shogun 2 you play as a daimyo on a quest to conquer all of Japan. Manage your provinces, beat back rebellion, train troops, and march against your foes in countless battles. Slowly you learn the in depth AI strategy, hill camping. The AI will surrender many men for their 1 troop of yari ashigaru to camp a hill. Fear not though, CA have provided the AI with money and no fear of rebellions, ability to gain the best agents without the need to train them. If you are looking to get into the Total War series then Shogun 2 would be the best entry next to Rome, just don't expect all too much from the enemy AI, if there is a hill, they will camp it. Over the course of playing you will start to understand how the AI reacts to different situations and game things that way. The next bet would then be on multiplayer but I'm too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to get into that part of the game.			"

												Shogun 2 is a fun, fast paced and exciting game to say the least. The multiplayer is great, the campaign is great, the units are great and the varying factions are all great. Shogun 2 is the second version of the shogun series and one of the newer Total War games. It is unique in the use of its DLC to expand on the base game and features other great unique features that older Total War games lack. Now, although medieval Japan is not my variety historical period I loved the look of the game and got into lots of information about it before buying it finding it to be worth it. Sadly my system is not the best at running it but in playing it I've enjoyed it, especially the multiplayer for what I could run smoothly. With co-op systems, avatar general and army building combined with leaderboards that can be attributed to Steam groups the system is a great improvement to the Total War games before it. I personally stuck to the multiplayer for most of my playing period with the game unlike in previous games where I stuck to the single player nearly the whole time. Multiplayer alone would still make this game good. Unit choices are another really great aspect which works with the varying factions too. Their is even one on the president! I won't give you any clues on what its called though. The other great thing about the game not mentioned yet is the graphics. The general look of the game is great despite my poor specifications which shows that it is great beyond what I considered already good as higher specification computers will have an even better sight. To summarise the good points-- Improved multiplayer- Good DLC that works well improving on the base game- Great graphics- Interesting and varied number of units- Unique and original factions- Great Campaign- Great Historical battles with huge clashes and great explanations to themNow to the bad. The game is hard to run for me and since my system is alright I would say it may be an issue for some others out there. Lowering the quality of the game helps, but the single player can lose the nice look due to the game struggling. Also, from what I saw, the early mulitplayer battles are awful if you don't have riflemen as they are incredibly over-powered.  The DLC, although improving on what the game offers greatly is a bit unfair at times to those without it. Without DLC its hard to beat armies who have them and since most players have already got high in the rankings late entries may find the first ten to twenty matches a bit of a slaughter on them. I got some riflemen and soon found I was the one slaughtering others which became fun though, so it worked out! To summarise the bad points-- Over-powered DLC at times- Specification is slightly too high for some lower specified computers.So the game is great despite its obsession with paying more on upgrades in and out of the game to make your experience more pleasing in combat I would easily score this game a 4/5, 8/10 or 80%. It shows Total War games to be improving in many aspects and is definetly a great strategy game overall.			"

It looks amazing and the naval battles are far better and more fun then in the previous games.			"

												This video game is not only historical and informational, but its really fun!!! It's a game that honestly, for an RTS, is fairly easy to learn and get the hang of, especially if you play it with the excellent tutorial. I also highly recommend getting the blood pack additionally with this game, since now the game becomes this visceral experience of clouds of misty blood and limbs being detached in every direction if you zoom into your units. Buy this game! Or wait until the next major steam sale when this game is only $10. BUY THIS GAME!			"

												Of all the Total War games, this is my personal favorite. It is the most polished TW, and also proably the most balanced. The graphics are spectacular, even compared to ROME 2. The unit detail is superb, and the animations are also the best of any TW game. You can watch two warriors have a sword fight in the midst of a battle, while arrows fly by. You also have the option to watch the game in slow motion, or speed up the game up to 3x. The campaign is good, although not the best TW campaign I have played. Naval combat is a welcome addition, although the amount of ships is rather limited. Units are balanced very well, and the hero units feel as powerful as they should. There is plenty of replay value in this game, and like all TW games you can create custom battles.If you've never played TW before, Shogun 2 is a great place to start! With great graphics, balance, and superb animations Shogun 2 is possibly the best game in the series!			"

												If you enjoyed the original Shogun total war, then it's likely you'll also enjoy Shogun 2. The campaign is an enjoyable and challenging experience that will have you plotting your path to victory in many ways, and enjoy yourself on the way there. The AI in combat is quite smart so be prepared for a challenge. I will sum up the good and bad to help you decide if the game is worth playing or not.Good: Beautiful music & graphics           A wide range of different units, allowing a diverse array of strategies in combat.           End turn wait times are relatively quick compared to other total war games.           Fully customisable multiplayer mode.           Multiplayer uses a ranking system allowing you to gain more feats and units as you finish a battle.Bad: Diplomacy AI is bad/unintelligent        Load times can be an issue.        Cavalry movement is unrealistic and doesn't obey the laws of physics. (Able to charge forward at full momentum and              stop dead in their tracks and turn the other way instantly.)        Multiplayer is ruined by DLC units making it unfair for those who do not wish to purchase extra content.        Morale system is stupidly broken, allowing you to rout units instantly if piling morale debuffs consecutively.On the whole the game is great if you enjoy total war campaigns, but it can get repetitive if you play often, and you may find multiplayer enjoyable albeit a little unfair and agrravating at times.7/10			"

Maybe I'm just too used to medieval total war, but either way I'd reommend this definitely. Just only buy it when it's cheap, don't spend out plenty to find your machine, which should be more than capable to run it, simply...NOT run it. (Seriously Sega, you f***ed up this one)			"

												Shogun 2 keeps up the tradition of the fine Total War heritage.  Modern graphics, beautiful menu and art style, incredible real time battles and in-depth macro strategy.  This iteration came with a little more polish than Empire, and harkens back to melee combat which, in my opinion, makes the franchise shine.  It's been on sale a few times and is no longer full price; that makes this title one to pick up if you are a TW fan.  The multiplayer is also a treat, with your co-op player's ability to command part of your troops during battle.			"

												Do you like Samurai?Do you love HONORABLE fights?Leading your Ashigari (common, foot soldiers) into Battle to Unite Japan. Under the Banner of your Clan, you fight for Honor and Glory!9/10The Grand Campaign is more or less about the BIG armies or SMALL at the beginning, fighting for supremacy over the Land. The most focus is actual combat and RTS in the armies fighting, you can possibly win, with your Army in a Blitzkrieg tactic with just Ashigari troops alone. Or build up a strong army, having lots of up-keep costs.The only downside for me, personally, is that it lacks the Family Managment, like in TW:Rome 1 - there you could build up an Family Dinasty. Here this is impossible you have no chance of having influence on making a strong Clan as it means to be a clan. You only Rule like an Absolute Ruler - there are no intrigues in your Clan or similar Stuff which makes Sengoku a game that has the features of what this game is lacking. On the other side, if you could combine Sengoku and Shogun 2 into one game - this would have been a Game that the world would love to see.			"

Its fun unlocking the next units and capturing the provinces.The music really helps building up the atmosphere of the game, the taiko drums are amazing, it's not surprising that Shogun 2 had one of the best OSTs of 2011.Other things that are not much, but it means a lot for me:-The inspiring speeches of the general of each battle in singleplayer, for example: 我々の目的はただ一つだ：この城を落すことじゃ！-Random lines, like: まだ風がありますよ！			"

Also theres plenty of Multiplayer options including 2 player co-op campaign.( which I can't wait to find someone willing to try one of those,...)warning tho this game is taxing on your rig, unless you have a powerful PC you may have to upgrade to get it to play well,... the low settings may help a bit but take away so much of the details you really want a good PC to get the most out of this game.

You feel the pain of your troops dying, the tension of your ninja sneaking into an enemy fort, the overwhelming swell of victory as you charge through their lines of yari samurai. This game is not only fun, it shows you a rich period of history not commonly covered in textbooks and gives the player the understanding of the great sacrifices and strifes associated with war.Play this game.10/10I wish multiplayer campaigns could be played with more than two people.

												This is the highest quality game in the Total War series, even after the addition of Rome 2. This game shines in the battle sequences, where employing different tactics and strategies can give you the upper hand, even in battles that would otherwise be lost if auto-resolved. You feel in absolute control over every aspect of battles, and when you lose you feel like it was because of something you did, not due to some mechanic of the game. The game is fantastic in single-player, but there is also a multiplayer meta-game, where you create a general and battle against others for more money and different troops. This mode isn't as popular, but is still functional, and entertaining to fight friends with.Play this game for the battles and military strategy. Do not play this game for diplomacy and nation building. While those are somewhat important for the grand campaign, they only tie together each battle.			"

												While I am not a fan of the Warscape engine in terms of the management of settlements, this is still a fine addition to the Total War repertoire. With beautiful scenery and units only disrupted by the brutality of the combat, this is a visual feast. There is also fantastic small details in the combat, I love me dem Samurai duels! The game lacks the epic scope of previous campaigns due to its setting but it is still slick and the battles are the most rewarding yet.			"

												The gameplay is brilliant. The Campaign mode is equally great. It even features it's own wikipedia, very useful if you want to know a bit about the units.If you like strategy or you're a control freak, this is a great game to pick up. Pros: Great at educating a newbie to japanse culture. for instance I didn't realise that samurai were such loyal servants. even commiting suicide to make up for a dishonourable act. Getting to replay battles that actually occured, and actually think similarly to the daimyo (leader) was pretty cool.The tips feature is amazing. It teachers you what's what, instead of leaving you bewildered by complex amount of actions. The most diverse strategy game I have ever played. You can battle in an inumerable amount of ways. sneaky, outloud and even bait them (best thing to do).Cons: When I find any I'll update it.Best thing, i would say is killing everyone and not losing one solider. That is the greatest feeling. 8.5/10			"

												Shogun 2 is a worthy successor to the original game.  Graphics are of a high standard and consistent through out all the DLC including Fall of the Samurai.  This is certainly a game you can sink many hours to if you give it time to get it's claws into you and playing with a friend through the campaign is an added bonus.  I would like to see the ability to have more than two players in a co-op campaign in future.  The only big improvement that is needed is to the naval battles as they don't seem to work very well, or that could just be me.Buy this game and crush the old Shogunate.			"

												This is an awesome game. However, here are some tips to give you the full experience:Get good sound system, preferably head phones, with great bass and depth. I swear I can feel an earthquake whenever I start a three thousand man charge and my enemy initiates a charge of the same scale.1080p is not bad, but I imagine a 4k monitor would be so much more noticable on a game like this compared to a FPS or RPG. Frankly, this is one of the few games where a 16k monitor would be worth the investment. Obviously, this is expensive and not necessary, I'm just making the point that in a battle involving 14000 men, it would be nice to see the whole battlefieldThe AI is both incredibly smart and very stupid at the same time. For instance, during naval battles, if I was severely outmanned, I could play ring around the rosey around an island and watch their ships get caught on the island, where I can pick off the single ship that managed to keep up with me. On the other hand, and this really amazed me, the AI reciprocated this tactic against me. I had attacked an enemy fleet with brute force as I had an equal or superior fleet, and I set ablaze or otherwise forced surrender of all but one enemy ship. This ship then literally kited ME and very nearly picked off 2 or 3 of my ships. All the while, I was chasing him expecting him to make some stupid illogical AI mistake, and it never came. I noticed he was circling and it seemed he was not about to make a mistake, so I sent a ship infront of his path. They collided and he lost all his momentum, and then I was able to box him in and finally kill him.The large scale land AI seems to be fine and doesn't act very different than I would. They tend to put archers on hills, and even try to redirect my melee force and make pockets where calvary is to be sent in to crush my archers. However, they tend to be impatient if they are on the offensive and put themselves in chokes that I've set up with the land around my armies. I don't suppose there was any way around that though, that was the only way to get to me and as my archers were at higher elevation he couldn't pick me off with his archersSmall scale AI, as in a unit by unit basis, could have room for upgrading.My final thought: Great game to have and experience. Brings strategy to a whole new level			"

The setting really makes for aweome gameplay and the landscapes are beautiful.This game is extremely challenging but extremely rewarding for the time invested. It is fun to watch the game unfold and see what each clan does. Very unpredictable.In addition to the reguly RTS and TBS elements there are a lot of politics at play as well. Allying with one faction can turn 2 more against you. You really need to weigh every decision carefully.I have not played any of the previous Total War games but this one is extremely deep and satisfying. I lost several days playing this non stop and enjoyed every minute of it.			"

												The game is enjoyable for those who like Total War strategy games. Very High graphics quality, but there are some tough mechanics. Seiges are so awful on troops trying to storm walls that I usually manual my seige defenses to make the computer take massive casualites just to storm one castle, and I just autoresolve attack seiges because the comp usually rounds nicely in your favor as long as you have 3:2 ratio or better number of troops. Ikko Ikki is fun for the religious conversion strategy, Oda clan can literally spam cheap, high morale ashigaru pikemen for the win on most difficulties. Against late-game samurai-heavy armies, you're either gonna need twice as many pikes, or you'll have to tech up. Veterancy and location specific upgrades like superior ironforged weapons are helpful for ashigaru units when the bot samurais come out.Oh, I see you brought seige equipment. Well, I brought 5 more units of spearmen for every seige unit you have, with even less upkeep. Get Rekt bots. Naval invasions hurt.			"

												Let's keep it simple, this game is nothing short of a masterpiece. In my opinion, one the best of the total war serie, second only to fall of the samurai wich is suprisingly different, more than just an expantion. I would change only the endgame mechanic wich gets way too hard after you reach a tipping point. Game goes from fairly easy to crazy hard in one turn as the whole remaining npcs turn against you, even your closest allies.			"

												Shogun 2 is my first experience to the Total War series, and I'm happy to say it's a good one. For those unfamiliar Total War combines a Turn Based Civilization-Style world map macro strategy with a Real Time strategy game when units meet on said world map. There are loads of strategies to be successful in both departments.A standard campaign game will take several hours at minimum, and will follow a classic 4X style of gameplay. Key decisions about what units to field, what buildings to build, and what research to undertake will dictate the game going forward. The real time strategy section is only moderately deep compared to a dedicated RTS but has a fabulous graphcal engine Total War is known for. Watching soldiers crumple against a hail of arrows, or get bull dozed by a calvary charge is a thing of beauty. The 3D models and the Japanese aesthetic for the menus and HUD make for a very attractive presentation. I have some minor complaints. As the game takes place only in Japan and features Japanese clans exclusively, unit variation is poor. Turn lengths get very lengthy toward the end game with lots of AI moves taking place. Seiges are not as exciting as they would be in a Medievel type of game. The game adopts a simplistic scissor-rock-paper with respect to unit types. A game mechanic that always causes all the AIs to ally against you at the midway point may be off putting for some players. Despite the in-game encyclopedia, tool tips, and audible tutorial advisor, game mechanics will still require a lot of internet help to sort out. But for my first exposure to the series I'm happy.

You will be gaining friends on the way, betraying or be betrayed.  Trading routes, vanquish pirates and bandits alike.

												The first Total War game I ever played was the orginal Shogun (many years ago) and I've played the series ever since. The orginal Shogun is quite simplistic and rather dated now, in terms of the things that newer Total war games have to offer, however my love for that game did lead me to buy Shogun 2. And I've not regretted that decision. Shogun 2 is by far one of the best Total war games I've played. It takes everything that is good about TBS games and adds to it;~ Weather conditions play more of a factor in battles, adding realism. Thus players need to adapt better strategies when deploying troops. ~ Naval battles have been expanded and mechanics are much improved from Empire. ~ The overall feel to the game is improved. Clans and Generals seem to have different personalities which enhances your intrigue for the game. ~ The Campaign map on Empire, I felt was too large and I personally seemed to get bogged down with watching things such as finances and overseas settlements than actually trying to dominate the map. Shogun goes back to focussing on the ""War"" element, that made Rome and Medieval 2 so popular but it adds more in depth realism where it's wanted most; battles. ~ Creating an avatar and unlocking units on online multiplayer keeps your drawn once you're through with campaign.By far one of the best games I own. Must buy for TBS gamers and Total War fans.  "

												This has become a strong favorite of mine in the RTS genre. One of the best! This game truley casts you as a leader giving you decisions only a leader can make. The addition of objectives that randomly appear that help guide you towards your next move. Cant imagine what else they could do with the next Shogun. The DLC is also phenomenal!			"

												Shogun 2 keeps up the tradition of the fine Total War heritage.  Modern graphics, beautiful menu and art style, incredible real time battles and in-depth macro strategy.  This iteration came with a little more polish than Empire, and harkens back to melee combat which, in my opinion, makes the franchise shine.  It's been on sale a few times and is no longer full price; that makes this title one to pick up if you are a TW fan.  The multiplayer is also a treat, with your co-op player's ability to command part of your troops during battle.			"

												Ever wanted to be the Shogun of Japan? If yes, buy it! Awesome hand to hand combat. Buy ""blood pack""  watch your soldiers bleed to death, while the others try to survive in the battlefield. Awesome strategy game, and you will learn alot of history. Buy all the expansion packs ""Rise of the samurai"" and ""Fall of the samurai"" You dont need the orginal game of Shogun 2, if you are only gonna buy ""Fall of the samurai"" You can play Shogun 2 online, if you want. Hope you buy it, and enjoy it. ;)			"

												A huge improvement from older Total War games. Shogun 2 has a great design and creative layout. Once you get past the (not so hard) learning curve it is very hard to stop crushing your enemies, and trading wifes to save alliences.       If you havent played any of the total war games they essentually play like this, its composed of a strategic map view where you build your armies, manage your empires economy, organized your generals, and engage in diplomacy with other diamoes in futal japan. The other part of the game is when two enemy armies meet on the campaign map, they will engage in a real time tactical battle which will display thousands of soldiers engaging in ranged and hand to hand combat. All of this with really impressive combat animation. This game has come a long way from the original offering in Total War Shogun back in the year 2000. Naval battles, siege battles, and even ambushes all add to keep it fresh and interesting. Campaigns can take a single day, or up to weeks depending on the perameters you set.Multiplayer:        So you can see how multiplayer has always been a really tough mode to include for the series. But Shogun 2 does a few things that makes it manageable. First you have the real traditional (and now) cooperative multiplayer campaign, a feature that Napolatin Total War lacked. This is where you can ally with a friend or even compete against them same as you would in a normal campaign with all the features. With each of your taking turns on the campaign map. And in battles you can even split control of armies just make sure you have plenty of time to go this full mode. However for people that like their gaming in shorter bursts you can now engage in a new mode called avatar conquest, where you can create your own general, create your own army and then engaege against other multiplayer generals. These wins and losses then apply towards a campaign map where your fighting for control of japan. WIth all these new features creative assembly has really found the perfect balance for legitimate multiplayer in this already epic game, extending its huge playtime already hundreds of hours to some ridiculous levels.Graphics:      The element aspect of this game is amazing, I usually rate the graphics of games by their water graphics. The way the water moves from the current and wind, the shine from the sun and other light objects. Well I am very happy that this game gets it right. In naval battles the ocean currents crash against your ship if your not facing the against the current, you must pay attention to the wind to see if it will be easy to sail, etc.. The huge battles that play ontop of big moutainus regions and hilly lands are amazing to watch and control. All of the soldiers have visible combat animations by actual sword master. and this takes up upon thousands of troops at a time. A truly remarkable game.            94/100        94% Magnificent			"

												This is a excellent entry in the Total War Franchise. It offers a perfect combination of real-time and turn-based strategy, that will keep you playing for hours.Pros:-MODS!!!!!! (don't like how the vanilla game plays? then you will probably find a mod that suits you) I personally found the vanilla game to be good, but with certain mods installed my experience improved drastically.-Amazing Animations-Very authentic-Amazing Graphics (Soldier, enviroment, building, ship model/textures)-Competent AI in Campaign-Decent AI in Battles-Good amount of units (It is less than other Total War games, but you have to consider the fact that this Total War game is set in only one country)-Campaign is straightforward and very easy to understand.Cons:-Requires a very good computer, (this can crash often if you are at minimum specs)-Individual soldiers fight one-on-one-Moving units in Groups doesn't always work too well. You'll have to micro-manage them.-Too many siege battles in Campaign-Naval Battles are not very fun-AI can be pretty stupid, but it is not broken.-Unlike other Total Wars, the campiagn can get repetitive. However this could be the fact that I play 500+ hours.I highly recommend this game!			"

												Shogun 2 is hands down one of the best RTS games I've ever played and, in my opinion, one of the best RTS games period. The gameplay, meta game, mechanics, and overall feel of the game just tie together so well. And the MUSIC. OH MY GOD. You feel the pain of your troops dying, the tension of your ninja sneaking into an enemy fort, the overwhelming swell of victory as you charge through their lines of yari samurai. This game is not only fun, it shows you a rich period of history not commonly covered in textbooks and gives the player the understanding of the great sacrifices and strifes associated with war.Play this game.10/10I wish multiplayer campaigns could be played with more than two people. But this is otherwise a perfect experience.			"

												Now when I saw this game, I was expecting just another total war, no big changes. But I was absolutely shocked and suprised to see the work Creative Assembly had put into this game. It was stunning and kept me into the game for a good long while, until Rome II came out. Even then, I went back to this game because Rome II was an utter piece of garbage. This may be the last good total war game ever made on this planet. At this time, it looked Creative Assembly actually had a clue about what they were doing. The game was very well optimized and every little bit of detail looked like hours was spent on it. A leaf on a tree looked like a designer spent 4 months working on it straight (well no, but you get what I mean). Definitely buy this game, especially because it is old, it should be pretty cheap, so buy it, and trust me, you will get your money's worth. Also, another good thing to do, it to purchase the Fall of the Samurai. It is an incredible expansion to the game! Good luck out there gamers and may you conquer Japan and become the next shogun!

Shogun 2 sees us feud in the sengoku period of Japan, during the time of great leaders such as Takeda Shingen & Tokugawa Leyasu.The gameplay is fantastic, graphics are great and all the strategy you could hope for is all in place (Especially on Legendary).My only real gripes are that there isn't enough unit variation, however this is to be expected considering that all factions are the same culture, and there is suffucient units per faction to not make it a major disapointment.Would recommend 9/10			"

Rise of the samurai is my favorite campaign, set 400 years before shogun two your goal is to create the first shogunate of japan. follow history or create an alternate past.			"

												Great strategical games, both RTS and Turn Based. It's really challenging even for an expert (especially that fame system). You must pay your attention in all aspect, from diplomacy, naval, city dev, tax, and others. Otherwise you'll lose your game (especially in legendary difficulty). So for you who look for great strategical games, I'd highly recommend this game. 10/10			"

Domination campaign feels intimite and generals do have personalities and abilities. I would recomend all other DLCs to this game but not 'rise of the samurai' witch was huge letdown, it only gave new skins to units, shrink the size and said ""This is now 200y before"". If you are interested in history and epic realistic battles you are already playing this.			"

												Although it lacks the complexity of some of the more recent Total War games (there are no army stances) and the building trees are mostly the same for every faction (since it all takes place within roughly the same culture), Shogun II and ESPECIALLY Fall of the Samurai is/are still my favorite Total War game(s). The music is great, but can get a little repetitive. The combat is excellent and you can do a lot with different tactics, unit types, etc. The addition of naval bombardment and the modernization mechanic (in Fall of the Samurai) helps to make the Meiji Restoration come alive.I'm a huge fan of Warhammer and think that the setting is perfect for a Total War game, but I still believe that if you can only buy one Total War game, get Shogun II + Fall of the Samurai.

												As far as I'm concerned, this is the height of Creative Assembly's time with the Total War series. Shogun 2 takes the ideas and lessons they've learned from the previous games, including the mistakes of Empire and Napoleon, and have ironed them out to a playable level. In fact, it's more than just playable, it's absolutely amazing. The base game pits you as the leader of one of many clans during feudal Japan who are all striving to become Shogun, the military ruler of Japan. You have to balanced your budget while making sure your people are fed and expanding your territory by conquering your enemies and making allies. Each clan has their own unique traits which you can use to your advantage while taking on the current Shogunate which adds a lot of depth and complexity to the strategies that you can use. Where this game falls short are in a few bugs and one of the two dlc expansions. The biggest complaint that I have about the A.I. in this game is that, being a Total War A.I., it is a bit on the derpy side. Enemy armies will randomly break formation and mill about from time to time, the enemy general will occassionaly try to take a heavily defended settlement with a tiny force, and cav units will always turn and fight if even just one of them gets caught in melee while trying to disengage. It's little bugs like that can make you get frustrated at the game, but not enough to make want to stop playing.As far as the dlc goes, The Rise of the Samurai was massively underwhelming. All it really added was some new unit types and some new abilities for agents. Otherwise, it was essentially the same map as the base game and didn't change up the gameplay all that much apart from siege battles no longer always being in a castle and being a bit more like sieging small towns in the older games. Despite that disappointment, however, Fall of the Samurai is fantastic. It adds in ranged units, such as line infantry and better variations of it, while still allowing you to build more traditional armies comprised of katanas, yari, and bows. The different time period and different kinds of units completely changes up the gameplay and the strategies of the game, and is arguably more difficult simply because of just how different units can be from faction to faction based on their allegiances.I would highly recommend that anyone should get this game.

												This with shogun 2: fall of the samurai make together one of the greatest if not THE greatest total war game. You might think that the setting is kinda boring because of the lack of a large variety of units (we are in one country after all) but the game is so well made, so balanced, so well produced that you don't care that you don't have as many different looking units. A bunch of balanced and diverse units are better than hundreds of different looking brigades variety *cough*Empire Total war*cough*.Also the Avatar mode is in my opinion one of the best additions in recent total war games and one that instead of removing should be improved and expanded.

												Now when I saw this game, I was expecting just another total war, no big changes. But I was absolutely shocked and suprised to see the work Creative Assembly had put into this game. It was stunning and kept me into the game for a good long while, until Rome II came out. Even then, I went back to this game because Rome II was an utter piece of garbage. This may be the last good total war game ever made on this planet. At this time, it looked Creative Assembly actually had a clue about what they were doing. The game was very well optimized and every little bit of detail looked like hours was spent on it. A leaf on a tree looked like a designer spent 4 months working on it straight (well no, but you get what I mean). Definitely buy this game, especially because it is old, it should be pretty cheap, so buy it, and trust me, you will get your money's worth. Also, another good thing to do, it to purchase the Fall of the Samurai. It is an incredible expansion to the game! Good luck out there gamers and may you conquer Japan and become the next shogun!

												Total War shogun 2 is a masterpiece, Out of all the total wars this game is THE best package from release, all the other total wars even rome 1 I have ended up getting mods for since the vanilla game gets boring, yet shogun 2 with its relatively basic unit roster is so perfect I haven't and don't think i ever will need to get mods for it. My personal favourite thing about it is every clan/faction has a similar unit roster yari ashigaru, samurai etc but every clan specialises in a specific unit type and playstyle. This makes for incredible replay value.The graphics are wonderfull even on a high/ultra meh resolution setup on my hoopty laptop, the game is one of the best optimized totalwars to date.I could go on and on about all the things I love about this game but all i can say is if you are expressing interest in it pick it up its worth every penny.

												This is my favourite strategy game of all time - maybe you can guess by the number of hours I've racked up on it! The turn-based strategy compenent has all the depth of Civ, while the real-time battle element is just as challenging as any out there. The graphics are still beautiful 5 years after it was released and honestly, I haven't seen a game which has improved on them yet. TW Attila, for example, has graphics which are equal - not superior - to TW Shogun 2. The DLC are fantastic. ROTS and FOTS basically are two whole new games for a fraction of the price of one. Definitely recommended.			"

												For anyone wanting to play a total war game set in the 1600 Japan then this is without a doubt a Total War game set in that time in Japan. Buying the GOTY or Total War shogun 2 that includes DLC might be a better idea rather than buying them seperatly as usual with these kind of games. Rise of the samurai and Fall of the samurai aren't that much of ""need to get"" dlc:s but they do add some stuff that I personally liked (Fujiwara that mentions Chinese traditions, or in Fall of the Samurai my typical ""live by the blade"" playthroughs).So buy this on a sale with all the dlc and it will have great immersive battles for those into this kind of game and setting.Too bad steam don't track the hours I play this offline.

												Good game, good performance and graphics. Game have much higher framerate then Atilla or Total Rome 2.Sadly it does have less fetures then Alpha Centauri from 1999(!) - so its still quite limited.Game is quite hard and lack (like in CIvilization or Alpha Centauri series) precise difficulity options to disable/enable certain things.For sure the best game from whole ""Total War"" series. Especially when it comes to tactical battles. 7/10			"

												In this review I will be going through the base game and the two other expansions individually to make you decide what products you should get. First I’ll start with Shogun 2.Shogun 2Total War: Shogun 2 is the Seventh game in the Total War series, and the Sequel to the Original Shogun: Total War, which was the first game of the series. Taking place in Feudal Japan following the middle Ages, you can play as one of several warlords, or factions, whose job it is to take over and unite Japan under one ruler. Each faction has their own strengths and weaknesses, Economic, Political, and militarily. There are several DLC's for Shogun 2, including; Rise of the Samurai, Fall of the Samurai, The Dragon War Battle, as well as several downloadable clan packs. Unlike previous games in the series, Shogun 2 takes place only in Japan and not Europe or the overall world as a whole. SHOGUN II offers the best polish, balance and innovative multiplayer system of all Total War titles, arguably the best in the series. The immersion created by Shogun 2 is far greater than any TW title. In the battles, each soldier looks and acts like a real person: they walk and charge with different animations, and they all die in different ways. The stylized UI and player cards, beautiful scenery, and music add so much to the feel of the game. It's just so good. A perfect score composed using many Japanese instruments to convey the mood. Overall the soundtrack is very enjoyable. It makes you feel that you actually in that time period fighting against other clans in Japan. I really enjoyed the hours I spent in this wonderful game. Though shogun 2 is more in depth than the original it is just as addictive game, and it’s a lot more stressful than Civ5, but just as hard to walk away from. If you like grand strategy, giving orders to your regiments on a tactical level mixed with historically accurate factions, environments and equipment, this game is definitely for you! The battle AI is much improved as well. I can't really use Empire:TW as an example because I don’t own it, so I'll use Med2. The battle AI attacks head on without delay when on the offensive, defends smartly when on the defensive, and knows when to pull back and regroup. One small complaint I've found in the battle AI is from time to time the AI knows when I tell my cavalry to attack a bow unit and the bow unit starts’ running before my cavalry even gets there. It's like it detects the attack ""click"". When I tell my cavalry to move to behind the enemy bow units instead of clicking on them to attack I get the surprise attack I wanted to begin with. Another flaw is the AI that is not too amazing (Not awful either though) are some of the lesser points of the game The AI is very keen on plundering your lands, which ends up being more of a pain in the...Rear end than entertaining as you have to repair -yet another- farm and hunt down another four units of spearmen that ran past your defense and just keeps running away from you. It does mean that you can't really sit in your fort all the time and let the enemy come to you, but in the end you don't really gain anything aside from a headache from hunting down all the little armies running through your land. Luckily there are river crossings and mountains you can stand by to block most of the enemy from getting through. Although it can be improved with DarthMod which I recommend to anybody who wants to buy this, and they use cavalry quite well to surround you and get behind your lines. They know when to attack vs. defend on a hill, and support weakened units with reserves. The Great Avatar conquest system in multiplayer is a great touch and is SIMLAR TO NOTHING CREATED IN ANY OTHER TW GAME. All those faction systems are not even a bit as deep as Avatar conquest in Shogun 2. Nothing can compare with this. Yes it is really rough to new players. But if you have enough patience eventually you will enjoy Avatar conquest like nothing else before. Also I really like coalition system as you grow strong and everyone else are turning against you even your vassals and allies. This feature is UNIQUE TO THIS GAME and makes you plan your strategy really carefully trying not to overextend too much. And that's great because for example in Rome 2 you just pierce through your enemies like a knife through butter and no one can stop you in the late game at all, so in the mid game you simply lose interest to game process because of no challenge what so ever.Almost every aspect of the game is done the way it should be, battles, sieges, clan system, agents, diplomacy, heck even naval battles. You will have plenty of choices and options for your empire and they are all meaningful in some way. You can embrace the new western technology and get yourself some guns, take on Christianity or stick to the old ways, eventually becoming the ruler of Japan. All of this comes with you being able to manage your entire clan - Build your holdings, expand them, train units and send your military to where they're needed and command the battles yourself. Naval battles of ancient Japan (Floating castles and archers which adds a UNIQUE TOUCH) are an interesting thing, with entirely new tactics to learn - Which you can do yourself. You can lead your clan from humble beginnings to glory, personally commanding every battle on the way there. Watch those forts though - They may look simple, but they are not to be underestimated. Attrition and seasons add a nice strategic layer: you can't always afford to starve out cities but storming them will always be costly. I also like the weather mechanics like fog which greatly reduces visibility, while heavy rain diminishes the effectiveness of missile troops, such as archers or gunners, thus requiring the players to adapt their strategies. Also, as in Napoleon, armies standing on enemy provinces during winter season or fleets far from the coast suffer attrition. The campaign mechanics, such as the family tree and events you can encounter, really make you connect with your leaders. I also like the idea of generals being used more to help other units on the battlefield compared to them being used more as cavalry. Now on to Rise of the SamuraiIn rise of the samurai players take on a brand new and independent campaign for Total War: Shogun 2 set in 12th century Japan. Set 400 years before the dramatic civil war depicted in Total War: Shogun 2, the ""Rise of The Samurai"" campaign is based on the Gempei War, a conflict between six legendary clans of the Taira, Minamoto and Fujiwara families. One flaw I have is that I don’t like that the first towns you get don’t have castles in them which makes them harder to defend, but that’s more of my problem just being used to some sort of castle like in shogun 2, and not so much a dig on CA. Also I thought the agents were perhaps a touch too powerful, Sou's in particular can unleash some devastating rebellions while I also never seemed to lose any agents (apart from Monomi) to failed attempts? New agents are hired through such new structures as the barter house. To unlock these, Rise of the Samurai specific arts trees must be climbed. Creative Assembly has thoroughly Genpei-fied almost every aspect of the game. I enjoy how this game adds the UNIQUE prequel story that’s not in other TW gamesNow on to fall of the Samurai  It’s the 1860's and Japan has opened its ports to the outside world such as the United States, France, and Great Britain in to heavily influence the game which is UNIQUE. The play off between traditional sword and bow unit’s verses the emerging gunpowder technology creates an experience that is UNIQUE to the Total War series. I also like that in this expansion happiness seems more like a problem to me because some buildings increase modernization which citzens hate which is UNIQUE. Overall a very enjoyable game 9.5/10			"

												For someone who enjoys strategy gaming and commanding large armies that maul eachother to bits this game is surprisingly addictive. The only thing I can really say about it is that the amount of DLC being pushed out to compliment the game seems a bit demanding on the part of the publisher given the overall simplicity of the original campaign and lack of diversity among factions.If you want a deeper diversity among factions then perhaps look elsewhere but as far as battle command is concenred, this game is quite enjoyable and pleasing to the eyes.All in all the game is a pleasurable experience with a good feeling of authenticity although the city design and campaign design takes a back seat to the architecture of the battle events. The naval battles could also use some serious work as they feel quite tedious at times.			"

												  Quite fun, the blood war pack is a nice addition for extra giggles though. I'd reccomend getting the Otomo and the Ikko Ikki clan packs over the Hattori one because they are ""more"" than the Hattori clan considering on how the Hattori is just your vanilla clan with ninja skills.   But still the new graphics, smoother UI design and the overall better atmosphere is a significant plus even if you liked guns better. But hey that's what the Otomo clan pack is for! 8/10, great game, would have 9/10 but less 1 point because they are selling the blood war DLC isntead of having it come in with the game by default lol.

												My experience with the Total War series has been a largely good one, recent developments aside. I've put several months worth of hours into the series as a whole, and out all the Total War games- Nay! All the games in my library! This one is my favorite.But enough mindless praise, lets cut this one open. Firstly, the BAD. Overall, there is a minuscule unit pool. Sure, you can say that this is due to it all being set on a relatively tiny bit of land compared to the rest of the world, but that was still a hurdle that had to be faced when playing this game.Secondly, the AI cheats like crazy. Every warlord in japan must have been a mathematical genius, because there is no other explanation for how they can guess the range of my siege weapons down to a few feet. Thirdly, the AI is hard as hell, even on the medium difficulties. This became abruptly clear to me when I tried to introduce my friend to this game. He's not an avid rts player, so the steep learning curve kicked all the enjoyment he could have gotten from this game right out the door.So why do you want to buy this game?Firstly, the balance of units across factions puts a greater emphasis on battlefield tactics than the more recent Rome II. Despite having a fraction of the units, the game offers a deeper strategic experience because it levels the playing field and forces players to think rather than just rely on which unit has the higher numbers.Secondly, the game is very rewarding. Upon breaching the learning curve, you find yourself filled with delight at your newfound victories, at the levels your generals are gaining, at the growth of your empire. By making the goals more challenging to reach, the game makes it feel all the better when you finally reach them. Thirdly, the expansions to the game give it extraordinary longevity. Fall of the Samurai offers a while new experience for veteran players of the vanilla game, and though Rise wasn't nearly as well made, it still had its own merits. One of the things to keep in mind when debating upon buying this game or not is just how much you like a challenge. If you enjoy trial and error, learning from mistakes, and visibly seeing a measure of your improvement, then this game is for you. If you're not in the category I mentioned above, go play something else because chances are you won't like the early game beatdowns this game will give you.			"

												Do you still remember Total War: Shogun? That was an awesome game!And Total War: Shogun II ? Well, it's double the awesomeness!Like its predecessor, Shogun II is a magnificent turn-based strategy game that everything is artfully presented. With a huge variety regarding skill trees customization, worthy generals that can lead your troops during mass battles and numerous combinations when forming your troops; you are called to prove your strategy against an improved A.I. or challenge your luck and skills with other online players.

												Greetings, noble warrior. Yellow, serious men with tiny hands from the other side of the island have come to ♥♥♥♥ with your♥♥♥♥♥♥and its up to you to show them what for. Its a step forward for the Total war franchise, and at the same time it feels like a step back. They went big with empire. Too big, some might say, though I think 'big' gives it more character, and Shogun feels like a scaling back that strips some of that character away, but tightens up the very loose game mechanics that empire had. Yeah, the AI is still silly, some of the starting games are horribly unbalanced and initally its just a Rock/Paper/Scissors game (especially in Rise of the Samurai), but stick with it and you'll be pleasntly surprised by how well the game chugs along.Right until you get to the end game when every John and Jane Nippon throw on their rice hats, grab their Katana's and make a B-line for your dojo.  Fall of the Samurai fixes that.			"

												Loved the avatar campaign concept, though the battles are a bit too fast compared to other total war titles.1st person view cinematic camera is also one of the best improvements, makes infantry battles feel totally awesome.Since this total war is solely about the history of Japan you only have japanese units which means most of the armies you build are pretty much the same with the exception of specific units who are stronger based on the clan you're controlling like the elite Shimazu Katana Samurai unit.Overall an awesome game which can be enjoyed to its max by players who love japanese lore.10/10 recommended			"

												By far my favortie Total War game to date, I've logged around 700 hours and have all dlc. The beauty of Shogun 2 lies not only in splendid graphics, but also in gameplay not seen in many other Total Wars. Unlike alot of the other games Shogun 2 presents a rather uniform recruitment roster with the exception of one or two unique units for each clan (excluding special factions like the Ikko Ikki in Vanilla and Aizu in FOTS). This likeness between factions really puts an emphasis on actual battlefield tactics rather than just having statistically better units (looking at you Rome 2). I would also have to mention that Fall of the Samurai is by far my favorite campaign (and dlc) Total War has yielded and is one of few dlcs in the series that actually adds mechanics not seen in other games (like naval bombardments). Overall I would give Shogun 2 a 9.5/10 with just vanilla and dlcs, but the mod community bumps it up to a 10 with a wide variety of campaign tweaks, unique units, graphic enhancements, etc.			"

												Best game i have ever played on steam.  Its highly addictive compared to the others in the franchise and also has a lot better battle realism.  In this version of the game they had ruined the naval battles however the land and siege battles have done nothing but improve.  It has some high specs which is an issue for some but apart from this i would say it is a work of art that i would recommend to anyone interested in the total war series.			"

												Easily the best Total War game since Rome and Medieval II (and it may be better than both of those), Shogun 2 takes the franchise back to where it began: Japan's Sengoku Era. You play as one of the great Daiymo lords struggling to unite the country. This is not the easiest of tasks, and it is one that inevitably involves a great deal of violence since ultimately there can only be one Shogun. Unlike previous TW games, once you reach a certain level of strength in the campaign, all of the other factions unite to fight against you, leading to an intense mid-late game. Since past TW games tended to get far too easy once you conquered enough, this is actually rather refreshing to see since it staves off boredom. Overall, the gameplay is similar to all other TW games, except here it is more polished, more focused, and altogether better than previous installments.It also has a rather unique and well-designed multiplayer system which, while unfair at times if the matchmaker puts you up against vastly more experienced foes, at least manages to give a player reasons to keep playing it. I'm not sure if anyone still plays the multiplayer, but i'd hope so. Besides, i've been given to understand that Creative Assembly made a mess of Rome 2's multiplayer (among other things), so Shogun 2's is probably a superior experience.There are flaws in this game though. The AI here is much better than in past TW games, but it still has its dummy moments. People who have crazy-good PC's may be irritated to find out that this game at its maximum settings might be too much for their computers to handle. The larger your empire gets the more micromanagement you have to do, which, although no different from previous TW games, still can be annoying for those who just want to fight the battles. Lastly there are bugs and crashes that, while not too frequent, are still frustrating when they happen.If you have an interest in this franchise but have yet to try it out, Feudal Japan in general, or really just well-made games, then this is worth checking out.

												This is just what I had been waiting for. In a way, it brings me back to the old days when I would play the original Shogun: Total War for hours upon hours. Sadly, no service will ever be able to jot down exactly how much hours I spent on the game, because my own words will never do it any justice.This is, by far, the best Total War game I have ever played. Medieval II is right up there as it was my favourite for so many years, simply because I could conquer Europe using my homeland, Scotland. I am a quick-learner of this period of Japan from only playing the Warriors Series developed by Koei (Samurai Warriors, to be specific) and playing Shogun 2 using my favourite army, Takeda, is more than exciting.I'm stuck for any more words to write, I just want to go back and play it, now! This is just the Total War game I've been waiting for. A true homage to the original, and a great improvement to previous installments of the series.A must-OWN if you haven't played it yet, and love the series.			"

												I love the Total War franchise, but its always a gamble for me when I try out new ones. Some, like Rome: Total War, are great, with a continous development and a possibility to actually conquer most of the ""world"". Others, like Empire: Total war, are too difficult and slow, making expansion take forever and always leaving you exposed no matter what you do.Total War Shogun 2 has the perfect combination of continous development and difficulty. At the easy setting, you can more or less steamboat through the entire campaign, and at the hardest setting you have to plan your every single move. Personally I mostly play at the normal difficulty, where you get some opposition and have to be a bit tactical, but still see some development and progression in every other turn.As with any Total War game, there's a high replay value, as each faction offers you a new challenge, with only the end-game becoming seemingly similar. Once you've played through this game a couple of times, I recommend getting the expansions: Fall of the Samurai & Rise of the Samurai, as these will further change the gaming experience and tactics that you have to use, without changing the difficulty (as did the expansions to Rome: Total War, which made that game unplayable).Great for casual gaming, as I usually watch some tv-series or standup, with the game volume turned off.

												Shogun 2 is an epic game, where the goal is to conquer Japan. Its a shame military conquest is the only way to win, compared to a game like Civ where you can also win by technology, culture or diplomacy. But the military part of Shogun is superior to anything I've played. As I write this, I've played through one campaign, and I feel like I've only scratched the surface of its tactical depth. But at the same time, as a new player to the Total War series, I never felt overwhelmed or confused. You move armies around on the campaign map, as well as managing economy, food, religion and technology. Then you fight enemy armies on the battlefield, where success depends on tactics, unit strengths and weaknesses, experience, formations, terrain, weather, morale and special abilities. The scope for replayability is immense. There are ten clans to play as, my short campaign took 13 hours, there are also long campaigns, historic battles, and multiplayer. Ignoring this would be a SHAMEFUL DISPLAY !!			"

												This is probably the best of the Total War games and a must-buy if you don't already own it.It is the most tasteful and attractive visually of any of the Total War games.The scale of the regions in the campaign map make more sense than what you encounter in Rome 2 and Attila.  Rome 2 and Attila have an unfortunate and totally unrealistic game convention in which only the largest city in a region is fortified.  You're often left making bizarre defenses of towns that in reality had extensive and effective fortifications.Not only do you get none of that in Shogun 2, but what fortifications you do encounter are much more convincing than their Total War European counterparts.The game is set in three different periods.  The medieval version of Japanese history is interesting, but is something of a curiosity for when you get tired of the main game.  The big surprise is the Meiji restoration game (Fall of the Samurai): it's very different from the regular Shogun game, and a lot of fun to play.   I resisted getting it for a long time, but once I'd played around with the historical scenario a bit, I was hooked.			"

												i dont recommend it to anyone anymore since they took out the ability to continue battles after the enemy routs in multiplayer campaign coop.... takes out the immersion realism and is a game breaker......UPDATE 1/14/2014However after playing Rome 2 Total War, this is the game that all total war games should aspire to be.Rome 2 was 5 steps back And broken in logic and game mechanics.... Honestly a bunch of monkeys put that game together.Gamers everywhere can only hope Medieval 3 Total War does not fall victim to the fateRome 2 Total War did at the hands of the of the same bunch of monkeys.

												The game Total War: Shogun 2 is awesome. I currently have 40 hours logged, and those 40 hours have just flown by. Total War: Shogun 2 is a strategy game where you are a lord and have to conquer Japan, along the way of becoming Shogun or Emperor you will make allies, enemies, and trade routes. The combat system is great as it has been in all Total War games. Strategies and analyzing and reacting to situations are key to winning. The new castle sieges add a new element to this franchise. Storming the walls is more tricky then one might think it would be with archers picking off melee units, it turns into a ranged battle until one side gets weakened enough for your melee troops to take to the walls. Another element Total War introduces is a co-op campaign. You have the option of trying to unite Japan with your Pal or going against him and fighting to the death till one of you end up on top. Now with the cons, I wish to co-op campaign would have supported more than two players. Another con is that the expansions aren’t as balanced as the original game. Other than those two cons I would recommend this game.			"

												Greetings, noble warrior. Yellow, serious men with tiny hands from the other side of the island have come to ♥♥♥♥ with your♥♥♥♥♥♥and its up to you to show them what for. Its a step forward for the Total war franchise, and at the same time it feels like a step back. They went big with empire. Too big, some might say, though I think 'big' gives it more character, and Shogun feels like a scaling back that strips some of that character away, but tightens up the very loose game mechanics that empire had. Yeah, the AI is still silly, some of the starting games are horribly unbalanced and initally its just a Rock/Paper/Scissors game (especially in Rise of the Samurai), but stick with it and you'll be pleasntly surprised by how well the game chugs along.Right until you get to the end game when every John and Jane Nippon throw on their rice hats, grab their Katana's and make a B-line for your dojo.  Fall of the Samurai fixes that.			"

												I acquired this game because I wanted a Samurai: Total War game. It fulfills that requirement and more. The campaigns can be tough, especially since you seem to be beset by enemies, and you have a limited amount of time to fulfill your ambition of ruling Japan. This is especially true if you are at the far end of Honshu and need to march all the way to Kyoto to secure the Shogunate.And that's just the base campaign. There is a Rise DLC which puts you in the same situation about 400 years before the base one. And then there is Fall, which adds a LOT of gunpowder weaponry and modern tactics, and deals with a short period that lead to the modernization of Japan (and indirectly to the Japanese Empire of WWII).There is also a multiplayer game that can be fun, though challenging in a different way. As hard as the AI can be, other players are often craftier and less prone to being trampled underfoot by cavalry. And since those with Fall can use their weaponry it can sometimes lead to quality versus quantity matchups.			"

												HOLY ♥♥♥♥ING♥♥♥♥♥♥NIPPLES THIS GAME IS GOOD. I have played almost ALL the total war games and this is by FAR the best. You play one of the clans in japan and u must capture Kyoto and hold it to become the shogun.Now to the best bit of the game. the battles. First of the battles look amazing on high setting and still look prettu darn good on medium. The anommations on the infantry are amazing as they where motion captured by people who could use swords. The interface is the best and very easy to use.The campaign map is also very good and easy to use. I found it very hard to find out how to build units and buildings in ther earlier games but in Shogun 2 it is so simple. You select the city u want to build something in. You go to the tab you want and u select the building or unit you want.In summary this game is ♥♥♥♥ing epic and a must buy for all total war fans. One thing i must say is you need a quite good pc to run this game on mediuem to high settings and my old pc still struggled on low so make sure u can run the game before u buy it			"

												This is my favorite game in the entire Total War series; it is very polished and provides huge replay value. The game is set in the height of the Sengoku Jidai period of Japan. You may choose between a selection of well-known clans/domains (Oda, Tokugawa, Takeda, etc) and proceed to conquer the surrounding provinces, with the ultimate goal being to overthrow the Ashikaga Shogunate and then consolidate your own rule.The game's community is still decently sized, multiplayer is active, and has a steep skill curve.Shogun 2's multiplayer allows for large strategic variation. Terrain, precise unit control, special abilities, multiplayer character leveling, even individual unit stat customization is all there, and delivers great fun.Unlike more recent Total War games, all of the DLC is worth the money, especially Fall of the Samurai.Did I mention that the soundtrack is awesome?A must have for any Total War fan.

												I'm grateful that the Fall of The Samurai DLC is available as standalone; if the game had just been about running at each other with swords, I wouldn't have been so keen. As it stands, the FoTS campaign covers a pretty interesting bit of history that I would otherwise not have known about/cared about/wanted to spend several hours reenacting. The artillery (historically accurately or not) is intensely overpowered. Although I can't decide whether this is good or bad, prepare yourself for an extreme, pinpoint-accurate gorefest as chunks of Japanese people fly all over your screen. The game is stable, a tonne of fun, and will give you genuine blood lust as you pretty much discover, build, and perform extensive ""market research"" with the gatling gun.			"

The balloon thingies (used long ago irl) keep arrows of the horsebacks, in case you're wondering.Yari Ashigaru (spear peasants) on impenetrable war formation vs samurai (lesser-nobles) results in destruction of the samurai, if the yari can hold out long enough.BUY THIS GAME on SALE, or the complete collection.

												This with shogun 2: fall of the samurai make together one of the greatest if not THE greatest total war game. You might think that the setting is kinda boring because of the lack of a large variety of units (we are in one country after all) but the game is so well made, so balanced, so well produced that you don't care that you don't have as many different looking units. A bunch of balanced and diverse units are better than hundreds of different looking brigades variety *cough*Empire Total war*cough*.Also the Avatar mode is in my opinion one of the best additions in recent total war games and one that instead of removing should be improved and expanded.

												After purchasing this game, I immediately downloaded the game so that I can finally test it out. I have been hearing good reviews of it from my friend which keeps asking me to purchase it so that we can play Co-op in this game. So eventually I succumbed and purchased the game... and here is my review.The game is not a bore even for new players of the Total War series. Although it is not easy, but still, I went back for more. I keep on playing until I got the hang of the game. This is were playing with your mates makes a huge difference. I usually play co-op with my friend and the experience that TW: S2 provided was immense! It is really a finely tuned game although with a few faults that you can overlook since the game is really that good.One of the things that I noticed are the AI patterns that usually took place. But this is just a small smudge in an otherwise awesome masterpiece. The game is deep and engaging enough that its replay value is high. The sound is superb and it provides a good ambiance on the war that is about to happen or is already happening. The speeches, although in Japanese, gives it better Role-playing value since of-course, this Era is during the Shogunate in Japan.All in all this game is worth your money even in Full price. go buy it now specially if its on sale!Review on a specific DLC: Total War: Shogun 2 Blood Pack DLCThe game is good as it is. but what will make it better specially if you like to go up close and personal? Blood of course! This pack will add blood splatters and the will turn the realism up a notch with blood being shown during the battle.If there is a DLC with TW: S2 that you should buy, this should be it. The price is decent and will not leave you feeling ripped off. This should be on the top of your list if you plan on playing this game.Worth it.			"

												Easily the best Total War game since Rome and Medieval II (and it may be better than both of those), Shogun 2 takes the franchise back to where it began: Japan's Sengoku Era. You play as one of the great Daiymo lords struggling to unite the country. This is not the easiest of tasks, and it is one that inevitably involves a great deal of violence since ultimately there can only be one Shogun. Unlike previous TW games, once you reach a certain level of strength in the campaign, all of the other factions unite to fight against you, leading to an intense mid-late game. Since past TW games tended to get far too easy once you conquered enough, this is actually rather refreshing to see since it staves off boredom. Overall, the gameplay is similar to all other TW games, except here it is more polished, more focused, and altogether better than previous installments.It also has a rather unique and well-designed multiplayer system which, while unfair at times if the matchmaker puts you up against vastly more experienced foes, at least manages to give a player reasons to keep playing it. I'm not sure if anyone still plays the multiplayer, but i'd hope so. Besides, i've been given to understand that Creative Assembly made a mess of Rome 2's multiplayer (among other things), so Shogun 2's is probably a superior experience.There are flaws in this game though. The AI here is much better than in past TW games, but it still has its dummy moments. People who have crazy-good PC's may be irritated to find out that this game at its maximum settings might be too much for their computers to handle. The larger your empire gets the more micromanagement you have to do, which, although no different from previous TW games, still can be annoying for those who just want to fight the battles. Lastly there are bugs and crashes that, while not too frequent, are still frustrating when they happen.If you have an interest in this franchise but have yet to try it out, Feudal Japan in general, or really just well-made games, then this is worth checking out.

												Global Strategy: Great, there's everything you would wish for: Resource management, town-building, army-composing, upgrades, even the RPG elements that perfectly fit to the game's overall atmosphere.---Field battles: Awesome. Pretty fast-paced and on-the-run tactical combat where each your decision really matters, while still being quite realistic and will please even the most hardcore strategy fans. ---Style: No words. From the user overlay, to menus and sound-effects, it is well-kept to. Your units speak in fluent japanese, real quotes of the proud samurai on the loading screen to entertain yourself, unit and ability icons made in the traditional japanese artistic style. You won't be dissappointed.---Difficulity: Highly-adjustible. Strategy fan? -Check. New to the genre? - Check. Hardcore Total War fan? -Check! Everyone will find a challenging difficulity to keep themselves playing.---What i really mean, is that you should just go and buy this game, you will like it  whether you love the genre or not.

Overall, the gameplay is similar to all other TW games, except here it is more polished, more focused, and altogether better than previous installments.It also has a rather unique and well-designed multiplayer system which, while unfair at times if the matchmaker puts you up against vastly more experienced foes, at least manages to give a player reasons to keep playing it. I'm not sure if anyone still plays the multiplayer, but i'd hope so. Besides, i've been given to understand that Creative Assembly made a mess of Rome 2's multiplayer (among other things), so Shogun 2's is probably a superior experience.There are flaws in this game though. The AI here is much better than in past TW games, but it still has its dummy moments. People who have crazy-good PC's may be irritated to find out that this game at its maximum settings might be too much for their computers to handle. The larger your empire gets the more micromanagement you have to do, which, although no different from previous TW games, still can be annoying for those who just want to fight the battles. Lastly there are bugs and crashes that, while not too frequent, are still frustrating when they happen.If you have an interest in this franchise but have yet to try it out, Feudal Japan in general, or really just well-made games, then this is worth checking out.

												Such a great game, I have almost 100 hours on it and I still have plenty more to go. It has that addictive ""one more turn"" feel to it, and can be incredibly deep if you want it to. The thrill of the battles and the satisfaction of the overworld management works together flawlessly.			"

												This is one of the most successful strategy franchise of all time, and for a reason. I absolutely love it and recommend it even now when Attila and Warhammer are out.However, one thing that I can suggest is improving the Diplomacy options, options like to ask allies to defend cities, either our own or theirs, support us in attack or defence, attack the enemy city or support us in our attack or siege.

												BUY THIS OR EMPIRE TW NOT ROME 2. ROME 2 IS BUGGED SH!T.The Shogun 2 campaign is awesome and challenging on legendary difficulty. Battles are a lot of fun with good AI, nice fighting animations and overall balanced when it comes to units, spear against horses, bows to pick off advancing foes and swords against infantry etc. The General system was my favourite part with this game. You can make your general into this living samurai buddha on the battlefield becoming your armies most powerful soldier if you dare to gamble and use him so or you can have the clan revere him as a living treasure raising morale, taxes and happiness with just his presence (recommended to use a nice mod to give your generals cooler portraits and its perfect).Multiplayer is cool, except for when they added Ashigarus (peasants) with swords and now the peasants can overcome the samurai even though samurais should dominate the battlefield.Some cons with the campaign is that you will have to go through a lot of sieges, every province has a castle and it does get annoying after a while climbing the walls of so many castles.Finally: Why could they not take all that was good with Shogun 2 and implement it into Rome 2?!?!

												This may be my favorite Total War game ever.  It captured the feeling the the original Rome: Total War created for me, but much greater running at modern standards.  The art design is absolutely stunning, creating a very realistic setting and staying to true to beautiful Japanese culture.  The vibrant colors and tranquil nature appeal to me more than the pastel-like palet of Total War: Rome II.  The textures are slightly inferior to Rome, but it is hardly noticeable which is very satisfying considering its age.The original Grand Campaign is excellent.  Boasting several prominent clans at the height of feudal Japan, each clan has something unique to offer depending on the player's style.  Generals are linked through a family tree and you must work through diplomacy to solidify your clans status.  This was the first time the game utilized a 'realm divide' system to keep the player in check from steamrolling the AI once they got their strength up.  The payer is labeled an enemy of the state once their power get's too high and nearly all other factions will make an effort to attack you.  This is a welcome challenge to previous Total War games; in prior games once you got to a certain pount you were nearly unstoppable and could conquer the world one opponent at a time.  This impacts your campaign IMMENSELY as you need to constantly plan for the oncoming civil war whilst you expand, ever thoughtful of the consequences of over expanding or failing to mainatin adequate garrisons in your back lands.The AI for Total War games has never been a standout, but it gets the job done.  Experienced players like myself should have little trouble on Legendary but must still make conscious efforts to win.  Siege battles actually play out and you'll seldom have to wait for the battle timer to run out to win a battle.  The range of difficulties offer a different challenge to players of different skill and I find Legendary difficulty extremely satisfying to play.The battles themselves play out like live-action chess matches to a degree.  Each unit has strengths and weakness to other units and excels at their role while suffering when placed outside their niche.  Eg. spear-armed units excel at defensive formations and against cavalry while being vulnerable to sword-armed units.  Missile units can extract a toll on all units, particularly ones with light armor while units of heavy armor can absorb fire with minimal losses and all missile units are extremely vulnerable to melee combat and cavalry.  Seeing as the game takes place in only Japan, the unit roster offers little diversity between factions, with certain factions yielding slightly better variations of their specialty unit.  However, this makes the game all the more strategic as each faction can field the same armies as you, with it's strengths and weaknesses.  Recent DLC has also added many unique units that add some flavor to the game and I would defnietely recommend a few of them.Lastly, the multiplayer experience is by far my favorite in any Total War, much more so than the lacking Total War: Rome II MP.  Players create and equip their own personal general with weapons, armor, and retainers that act as their avatar.  You can also join global clans to coordinate battles and create your own clan banners.  Your avatar will appear on the battlefield leading your armies.  You move your avatar on the campaign map and each battle you win will offer new bonuses depending on the province you conquered.  Units that excel in battle will be promoted and you can then customize them to stand out on the battlefield and upgrade them as they get better.  The whole system comes together nicely and several battle options and match-making options allow players to play the battles they want with other players of appropriate skill.Overall, the grand package of Total War: Shogun II was astonishing.  CA went back to its roots and pulled a nearly perfect game together.  I can say this with confidence as I have over 1,000 hours total logged into this game and only 1/2 of that in Rome II.  If you've never played Total War, this is the game to start with.  I would highly recommend it to strategy fans, historical buffs, and novices alike for the experience this game is able to create.10/10			"

												A polished experience with attention to details and immersive gameplay. Shogun 2 is a serious upgrade to the Total War franchise and for sure the best iteration so far.At first the Sengoku Jidai historical period might seem confusing, with lots of names and places true to the Japanese medieval setting, but after some time the essence of TW games surfaces as strong as ever. The campaigns might get long but never boring.The art and design is impeccably well presented, and the music is top-notch, even if somewhat repetitive when playing long sessions. The graphics are good and adaptable to a wide range of PCs. The interface is clear and beautiful, and I never encountered a glitch or bug in 70+ hours of gameplay.The new mechanic of Realm Divide brings freshness and challenge to the stalled and/or boring mid-to-endgame, and is a very welcome feature that will divide the weak and inconsistent from the true strategists. The AI is really not that smart, and makes very illogical decisions---many times downright stupid---when playing the lower difficulties. The best experience comes playing on Hard and above, and of course the light RPG-like multiplayer avatar system.Shogun 2 can entertain you for hours. With high replayability and infinite options, no campaign is ever the same. All DLC is worth having.If you liked previous Total War games, this is a must own. Highly recommended.			"

												After purchasing this game, I immediately downloaded the game so that I can finally test it out. I have been hearing good reviews of it from my friend which keeps asking me to purchase it so that we can play Co-op in this game. So eventually I succumbed and purchased the game... and here is my review.The game is not a bore even for new players of the Total War series. Although it is not easy, but still, I went back for more. I keep on playing until I got the hang of the game. This is were playing with your mates makes a huge difference. I usually play co-op with my friend and the experience that TW: S2 provided was immense! It is really a finely tuned game although with a few faults that you can overlook since the game is really that good.One of the things that I noticed are the AI patterns that usually took place. But this is just a small smudge in an otherwise awesome masterpiece. The game is deep and engaging enough that its replay value is high. The sound is superb and it provides a good ambiance on the war that is about to happen or is already happening. The speeches, although in Japanese, gives it better Role-playing value since of-course, this Era is during the Shogunate in Japan.All in all this game is worth your money even in Full price. go buy it now specially if its on sale!Review on a specific DLC: Total War: Shogun 2 Blood Pack DLCThe game is good as it is. but what will make it better specially if you like to go up close and personal? Blood of course! This pack will add blood splatters and the will turn the realism up a notch with blood being shown during the battle.If there is a DLC with TW: S2 that you should buy, this should be it. The price is decent and will not leave you feeling ripped off. This should be on the top of your list if you plan on playing this game.Worth it.			"

												I love the Total War franchise, but its always a gamble for me when I try out new ones. Some, like Rome: Total War, are great, with a continous development and a possibility to actually conquer most of the ""world"". Others, like Empire: Total war, are too difficult and slow, making expansion take forever and always leaving you exposed no matter what you do.Total War Shogun 2 has the perfect combination of continous development and difficulty. At the easy setting, you can more or less steamboat through the entire campaign, and at the hardest setting you have to plan your every single move. Personally I mostly play at the normal difficulty, where you get some opposition and have to be a bit tactical, but still see some development and progression in every other turn.As with any Total War game, there's a high replay value, as each faction offers you a new challenge, with only the end-game becoming seemingly similar. Once you've played through this game a couple of times, I recommend getting the expansions: Fall of the Samurai & Rise of the Samurai, as these will further change the gaming experience and tactics that you have to use, without changing the difficulty (as did the expansions to Rome: Total War, which made that game unplayable).Great for casual gaming, as I usually watch some tv-series or standup, with the game volume turned off.

												Total War: SHOGUN 2 is nothing short of a (slightly flawed) masterpiece.It is a remake of Creative Assembly's Shogun: Total War with vastly enhanced gameplay mechanics. The Total War series has been know to consist of turn-based real-time tactics games with a focus on historical authenticity. Total War: SHOGUN 2 does just that.Campaign:The campaign does not follow a certain group or faction throughout history. The game lets the player decide on which faction to chose from and allows the player to change history as he or she feels. The game does not restrict the player to any historical event so it lacks historical authenticity in place of player choice.Gameplay:The gameplay is very smooth. Animations were well made and the graphics are extremely detailed. The game uses the flawed Warscape engine as its backbone to run the animations and gameplay mechanics. The engine limited the game (units could only fight in 1 v 1 combat). Luckily, the engine does not ruin the game unlike the games before and after Total War: SHOGUN 2. Multiplayer:The multiplayer utilizes a new multiplayer campaign map where the player has to win matches to unlock a map regions which in turn unlock new unit types and bonuses to aid in online matches. Unfortunately, the multiplayer scene has depleted to the more recent Total War games.Summary:Overall, the game is very robust and can still stand the test of time.DLC:The best DLC to get is the Rise of the Samurai Campaign. It unlocks a whole host of units and buildings that require the player to plan new tactics and strategies. All other DLCs contribute minorly to the game (e.g. hero units and new starting locations).			"

												Shogun 2 is the greatest Total War game ever, and one of my favorite games of all time. If you don't own this and are into strategy games at all, I very highly recommend it.Shogun 2 offers a more refined and polished experience than any other Total War title. The base game is set in the Sengoku Jidai, beginning in 1545. Shogun 2 examines warfare in fuedal Japan more closely and accurately than any other game, with an array of samurai, ashigaru, monk, and European units.The DLC campaign, Rise of the Samurai, takes you back to the Gempei War, beginning in 1175. Units unique to this time period are used, including early samurai, levies, and sou. Most noticeable in this earlier form of Japanese warfare is the complete absence of gunpowder, the relative newness of the samurai class, and the loose unit formations. Rise of the Samurai is an experience unique from that of the base game's campaign, and is definitely worth purchasing.Fall of the Samurai, the standalone expansion to Shogun 2, is set during the Boshin War, beginning in 1865. The explosive rise of the modern era in Japan that began with the end of its isolation ignited a civil war between those dedicated to the cause of restoring the emperor to power, and those who remained loyal to the Tokugawa shogun. Warfare during this time period features extensive use of rifles and artillery, as the time of the samurai class approaches its end. Traditional units are still available, and useful, to recruit however.All three campaigns for Shogun 2 offer unique experiences that warrant multiple playthroughs. Shogun 2 also features excellent multiplayer progression, through experience unlocks and a unique veteran unit system, and features multiplayer matchmaking, as well as two player online campaigns. All of the DLC for Shogun 2 is worth purchasing, though some may wish to pass on the unit packs. The faction packs offer unique factions unlike anything else found in the base game, and are definitely worth purchasing. I, myself, would recommend all the DLC, as the units included in the packs are fun, unique units.Shogun 2 is a masterpiece RTS/TBS hybrid, and showcases epic, historically authentic samurai warfare unlike anything else.

												This is a story, about me and the Mori.Once, two great nations lived at peace with eachother, and though they waged war against all around them, quickly rising in strength, their alliance was strong. The Mori, masters of the sea had access to many resources, and would gladly trade those resources in for military support. The Hattori, with a booming economy and vast armies needed the resources to help build up their strength even more, and so, both nations prospered. Untill one day,  the Mori broke their truce, invading the Tsuitsui clan, a vassal of the great Hattori kingdom. And so the Hattori marched on, into sovereign lands, capturing three cities until the Mori had begged them for mercy. The Mori posed no threat to the powerfull Hattori, yet still, the latter found it in their hearts to let the traitors live. The Hattori formed an Alliance with the Takeda, and the Mori did so with the Shimazu. Though the Mori still owned 12 provinces, with the Hattori owning only 8, the Hattori's swift guerrilla attacks made sure there was no lord, no daimyo, and no heir left to the monarchy. The Mori were cut down like dogs, and the Shimazu would soon join them, As the Hattori marched on the Capital, taking it all in under a day's work, the Takeda and Uesuegi tried to stop them, but it was all too late. I was victorious, and declared the Mori to be royal♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Seriously♥♥♥♥ you Mori, you're all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.			"

												Addictive, engaging, and absolutely stunning in its art direction and gameplay, Shogun II: Total War is a masterpiece in the Total War franchise that combined most pleasing aspects from previous Total War games without becoming tiresome. A player will always find oneself challenged by choice of sword or musket, lance or sabre, stone or cannon. Although the game is seperated by two seperate products, ""Shogun II"" and ""Shogun II Fall of the Samurai,"" it is impossible to enjoy the experience with solely one. The multiplayer mode ""Avatar Conquest"" was a novel addition that added an RPG element to the franchise that makes the player feel more connected to one's avatar. Matchmaking is much improved as the server tries its best to pit you against the most competitive player at your level. All in all, a masterpiece by the Creative Assembly!			"

												+ Huge-scale warfare on so many levels.+ Excellent graphics and combat interface.+ Good co-op & multiplayer support.+ Samurai are awesome.- Painful loading times, even my high-end system.- Multiplayer crashes for no obvious reason (save often!).- Naval warfare could be better.- Tutorial is worthless, the game was clearly made with Total War veterans in mind.The funny thing is, I don't even like the other Total War games, but this game is nothing short of excellent (technical issues aside). If you're not a Total War veteran, I suggest you try the demo to get a feel of how the game is played.			"

												Good game. Has a steep learning curve compared to previous Total war games but it's worth it. Lots of playability, it's pretty hard on the tougher settings. Graphics are great. It’s also quite different to previous versions and has a lot of depth. The usual total war problems remain thou in that auto resolving a battle (I have a massive fleet of cannon and normal ships vs a couple of fishing boats) can cause huge losses which, when you play yourself it’s impossible to lose a single person.

												Didn't like this game at first, a lot of seemingly random events that didn't have a clear reason why.  The game had great reviews though so I figured it was just me being new.  So I did some research, read some guides, and I got better.  Now I think Shogun2 is a great game, that really captures the atmosphere of the orginal Shogun game while giving everything you'd expect in a modern Total War game.  I recommend it, but this game is difficult to just jump in and play without know what you're doing.			"

												Total War: Shogun 2: ReviewIn this game, you are a power hungry warlord climbing the ladders of leadership set in Feudal Japan. This is a very good game for people who like Civilization as well as Age Of Empires. The graphics, the mechanics and attacking and grouping of units are all superb. When grouping many units, there are attack formations which are a bit confusing to learn. Once you master them however, you can use them to your advantage during battles. You can learn these, along with many other important aspects of the game in the tutorials, and I would highly recommend doing them. If you are fearful of not being able to play with friends, have no fear. You can play campaigns against friends for the race to become the Shogun of the land. One thing i've noticed is that Shogun 2 is slightly intensive, but I'm sure if you have a decent rig you can play it just fine.Final: 8/10			"

The only mod which I would consider quite necessary is the No Realm divide mod for the Rise of the Samurai and main campaigns.

												Total War: Shogun 2 is a was a solid move of CA, bringing the beloved total war formula to Feudal Japan is a great idea and it makes for a fun game. You can sink in a lot of hours planning your way of conquest towards the Capital, Kyoto. Fight other clans on bloody battlefield or play sneaky and hire ninja's to assassinate your enemies. A Fun, Simple, Great strategy game and a real must have if you like the way other Total War titles are.			"

												I have Total War: ROME II & Total War: ATTILA. Those games I mention have excellent graphics but shallow gameplay, dumbed down and streamlined features. I tried to love those 2 games, even my hours playing is on 100 hours for each. I have played Total War since the original Medieval back in 2002 (14 years ago) and those 2 above are really boring and I regret purchased them.Then..I bought Total War: SHOGUN 2. Just 6 hours and can say that this is the best Total War title Warscape engine-based to date. Much much better then even Total War: ATTILA. Very deep, challenging and have family tree as well. Simply, this game stand in the same elegance as ROME: Total War & Medieval & Medieval 2: Total War. "

												Shogun 2 is an epic game, where the goal is to conquer Japan. Its a shame military conquest is the only way to win, compared to a game like Civ where you can also win by technology, culture or diplomacy. But the military part of Shogun is superior to anything I've played. As I write this, I've played through one campaign, and I feel like I've only scratched the surface of its tactical depth. But at the same time, as a new player to the Total War series, I never felt overwhelmed or confused. You move armies around on the campaign map, as well as managing economy, food, religion and technology. Then you fight enemy armies on the battlefield, where success depends on tactics, unit strengths and weaknesses, experience, formations, terrain, weather, morale and special abilities. The scope for replayability is immense. There are ten clans to play as, my short campaign took 13 hours, there are also long campaigns, historic battles, and multiplayer. Ignoring this would be a SHAMEFUL DISPLAY !!			"

												Good game. Has a steep learning curve compared to previous Total war games but it's worth it. Lots of playability, it's pretty hard on the tougher settings. Graphics are great. It’s also quite different to previous versions and has a lot of depth. The usual total war problems remain thou in that auto resolving a battle (I have a massive fleet of cannon and normal ships vs a couple of fishing boats) can cause huge losses which, when you play yourself it’s impossible to lose a single person.

												This is a story, about me and the Mori.Once, two great nations lived at peace with eachother, and though they waged war against all around them, quickly rising in strength, their alliance was strong. The Mori, masters of the sea had access to many resources, and would gladly trade those resources in for military support. The Hattori, with a booming economy and vast armies needed the resources to help build up their strength even more, and so, both nations prospered. Untill one day,  the Mori broke their truce, invading the Tsuitsui clan, a vassal of the great Hattori kingdom. And so the Hattori marched on, into sovereign lands, capturing three cities until the Mori had begged them for mercy. The Mori posed no threat to the powerfull Hattori, yet still, the latter found it in their hearts to let the traitors live. The Hattori formed an Alliance with the Takeda, and the Mori did so with the Shimazu. Though the Mori still owned 12 provinces, with the Hattori owning only 8, the Hattori's swift guerrilla attacks made sure there was no lord, no daimyo, and no heir left to the monarchy. The Mori were cut down like dogs, and the Shimazu would soon join them, As the Hattori marched on the Capital, taking it all in under a day's work, the Takeda and Uesuegi tried to stop them, but it was all too late. I was victorious, and declared the Mori to be royal♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Seriously♥♥♥♥ you Mori, you're all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.			"

												This is in my opinion one of the best if not 'The' best of the Total War series. The changed building interface may put off some because of the limited scope but once you have your strategy in mind for what you want to build then it becomes second nature and even on low settings to work on low end machines the game is still playable without taking you out of the fun. The first time you pan the camera down to the battlefield and the ""camera"" is shaking as a unit passes by only helps the immersion and combat is fast, brutal and more realistic looking than previous TW titles. Do not let this games age fool you, it still holds up to more modern games in graphics and sound, and if you have a rig powerful enough to have all graphics on high or ultra then you can spend a lot of time just sitting and looking at the scenery.If you are at all interested in playing a great game set in feudal japan, are interested in japanese history or culture or are just a gamer looking for something to kill some time, then you have to play this.

												Twice the ShogunCreative Assembly revisits the Sengoku period of Japan with Shogun 2: Total War. The game feels like an extension of their previous title Napoleon: Total War with the faster paced movement, morale effects, and some AI elements, but in the end delivers a fresh new Total War game you’d be more than happy to sink your teeth into.GameplayThe heavy focus on melee troops will kind of throw you off if you have been playing a lot of Empire/Napoleon, but the same rock/paper/scissors tactics will apply here. Typically there are three types of units you’ll see in a battle. Spear/Sword units who do all of your fighting, Ranged/Archer units for supporting your battle lines, and Cavalry units that can flank and take care of the supporting units behind the front lines. These types of units are then broken down into quality (Ashigaru or Samurai), and unique versions (Matchlock, Cannons, Bow Cav, etc). Combined with a standard set of battle maps to play on and plenty of castle sieging, things will start to look and feel the same after your initial play through of a short campaign.Sieging in this game is also handled differently. Do you know how Japanese people got past a Castle’s walls in the 16th century? Ladders? No. Grappling Hooks? Nope. Siege Towers? Uh-uh. They scaled the walls with their bare hands and climbed that♥♥♥♥♥♥like a man. All units are able to scale the walls. Troop disposition and location of attack is more important here since your men will suffer casualties getting to the wall (archers), climbing up the wall (falling off), and then fighting garrisoned forces inside. Burning down a door presents a more direct way of getting inside, but also a nasty choke point for the defenders to trap you in. Also, Castles can be upgraded to provide more tiers of walls to go through, elevation changes, little moats with a handful of places to ford across and Towers to help fend off attackers.Castle Sieging brings out a fault of this game early on, since there’s only one battle map per Castle tier. So if you fight a Tier 1 castle in one province and then go next door and siege another Tier 1 castle, they will look exactly the same. Standard battle maps are also limited in selection and you will start to recognize them early on. This is kind of disappointing since this has been an issue in the past games. You think they would introduce some sort of map generator/randomizer by now.Elevation plays more of a factor now since units charging uphill not only move slower, but suffer a penalty to attack doing so. This means battles are mostly focused around or on top of a defensible hill. Shock units (units with a high charge value) are also more effective in this game, able to decimate and route units within seconds in some situations. Battles play out faster so you’ll have to adjust your lines quickly and use your General frequently to provide morale boosts. Babysitting troops will make it hard to watch the awesome new highly detailed units and brutal fighting animations.The naval stuff isn’t as good as the old Empire or Napoleon ship battles, mostly because you’ll be fighting with arrows. Essentially, there are boarding ships with a greater amount of Samurai to board with, Ranged/support boats with faster ships, and unique gunpowder ships that toss grenades and mines. There are a few canon ships in the game and the dreaded “Black Ship” with 60 cannons but it’s mostly just alot of boarding and surrendering, nothing very explosive like a proper 18th century ship battle. Not exactly a fault of the game, just the time period.      GraphicsSpeaking of which, the graphics engine is reminiscent of Napoleon: Total War. There are prettier fire and smoke effects, but the big push was made in the detailed units and fighting animations. You can see units intricate armor and weapons they’re equipped with. The fighting animations are exciting to watch (alot of dudes get stabbed through the face). The lighting and shadows are done very well and weather effects do not look cheesy. There are alot of fog effects and clouds sailing through the skies which adds a nice atmosphere to the setting.The 3D Campaign map with a moveable camera is a welcome addition, but not necessarily needed or useful. Using it just makes me lose orientation of the map, so I hardly bothered rotating the map at all. It was only useful selecting some troops hidden behind some one else’s flag.MultiplayerA heavy focus was put into multiplayer for this game as there are plenty of features to choose from, a customizeable and persistent character you can level up with, and best of all, a Co-op Campaign mode! The latter is fully featured and plays out like you would expect, essentially a single player coop with another person. The battles can be fought between you and your partner, you can gift him units on the battlefield to control or if he is the reinforcing army, he will take control of his own forces. There is an adversial campaign mode as well. I experienced a steady flow of glitches and bugs during an online coop relating to the campaign map and not being able to finish my turn, and also not being able to join a coop game at all. I hope that these will eventually get ironed out.AIThe AI have been improved some since the last Total War game, but you'll still witness the random cavalry unit charge all by itself straight into your lines, awkward unit placement, and little focus on out manuevering your lines or flanking period. I was happy to see that the AI can form proper battle lines for the most part and it is also able to determine the best defensible hill to perch upon. You'll be glad to hear that the General doesn't charge into certain death as much as he used to, but he'll dismount and siege a castle's walls if he is the last unit left for some reason. I guess honor before death right? With that said, the AI has made some noticeable improvements but not all is perfect. Although having the option to have Drop-in battles is nice, it's just an excuse for poor AI to be present in the game. It would be nice to have an AI that would try and flank you every once in awhile.As far as the Campaign Map goes, the AI does a decent job there as well. Allies are involved more when attacking an enemy, the AI does a good job on moving armies together for support, and also not sending in smaller sized armies to attack you. On the higher difficulty settings there is some noticeable cheating going on with the AI being able to afford lots of Armies even with only a few provinces.Shogun 2 is a solid release for the franchise, no game breaking bugs, a nice change up in the style of gameplay, and a different setting besides war torn America and Eurasia to fight in. I'm glad they chose to revisit Shogun and implement what they have learned as well as new technology into it. If you're looking for a new Grand Strategy game, give this one a try. And if you're already a Total War fan, why are you reading this instead of conquering Japan?			"

												*Disclaimer*This review is totally biased, if you want an honest review go to a proper critic, well of course you should but you know what this means basically right?*Disclaimer*This is the best Strategy game in the total war series, I have played Rome 1, Medieval 2, Empire, Napoleon and Rome 2. so I think this is enough evidence to prove which game I prefered. However if you don't like Samurai or Medieval strategy you probably might not like this game.This does not mean that the game is terrible, it's just if you want the full atmosphere of the game, you must embrace it's culture and society. you don't have to only take my word for it, these games are the best for their combat.So I would really consider picking it up if I were you.

												Twice the ShogunCreative Assembly revisits the Sengoku period of Japan with Shogun 2: Total War. The game feels like an extension of their previous title Napoleon: Total War with the faster paced movement, morale effects, and some AI elements, but in the end delivers a fresh new Total War game you’d be more than happy to sink your teeth into.GameplayThe heavy focus on melee troops will kind of throw you off if you have been playing a lot of Empire/Napoleon, but the same rock/paper/scissors tactics will apply here. Typically there are three types of units you’ll see in a battle. Spear/Sword units who do all of your fighting, Ranged/Archer units for supporting your battle lines, and Cavalry units that can flank and take care of the supporting units behind the front lines. These types of units are then broken down into quality (Ashigaru or Samurai), and unique versions (Matchlock, Cannons, Bow Cav, etc). Combined with a standard set of battle maps to play on and plenty of castle sieging, things will start to look and feel the same after your initial play through of a short campaign.Sieging in this game is also handled differently. Do you know how Japanese people got past a Castle’s walls in the 16th century? Ladders? No. Grappling Hooks? Nope. Siege Towers? Uh-uh. They scaled the walls with their bare hands and climbed that♥♥♥♥♥♥like a man. All units are able to scale the walls. Troop disposition and location of attack is more important here since your men will suffer casualties getting to the wall (archers), climbing up the wall (falling off), and then fighting garrisoned forces inside. Burning down a door presents a more direct way of getting inside, but also a nasty choke point for the defenders to trap you in. Also, Castles can be upgraded to provide more tiers of walls to go through, elevation changes, little moats with a handful of places to ford across and Towers to help fend off attackers.Castle Sieging brings out a fault of this game early on, since there’s only one battle map per Castle tier. So if you fight a Tier 1 castle in one province and then go next door and siege another Tier 1 castle, they will look exactly the same. Standard battle maps are also limited in selection and you will start to recognize them early on. This is kind of disappointing since this has been an issue in the past games.

												For the Shogunate !Total War : Shogun 2 or Shogun 2 : Total War ReviewThis is my first (or third total war game , if you count empire and the original shogun demos) . Suffice to say I'm rather new to this type or Turn-Based Strategy with Real Time Tactics game. And yet this game is able to capture my attention for the first time I played the tutorial. Perhaps its because I'm new to this genre, the addiction of seeing my armies tactically win a skirmish because of good position attacks is strangely satisfying. Taking a severe loss can be heart brokening especially if you had the advantage. Outnumbering the enemy that has 2000 troops defending a castle with 6000 troops has it... tingling feeling (and the evil thought of the enemy army being obliterated) and some goosebumps as well. Those are the feeling that I have when playing Total War : Shogun 2. Now onto the review itself.For the new user experience (new to this genre) , it can be... quite the game depending on what happens. For me it was literally a giant puzzle, the tutorial explained well, but was painfully slow to listen to , its skippable, but too much inportant info lies there. Your first few battles would be... okay if your not a complete retard who throw archers into melee mode while your samurai hangs at the back. For those who are experience with this genre (those who played previous titles) it should be nice to see an upgrade in its combat refinement or rather its simplicity but still provide enough factors to blow your mind as usual.For casual players its pretty fun, it will take up at least 1 hour if your going thru the campaign casually (with the RTT battles of course) . By this point simply understanding of tactics should come  into play and the amount of exploration for units, technologies, buildings, and faction is a lot which can keep you pulled in for a long, long , long time. After all just... 1... more... turn... In multiplayer I cant say... I never found a match so far so its blank here.For the 'PRO' I wont say much as Im not pro yet, but it would seem that large scale micromanagement would be need to effectively win against the hardest of AIs. The most minor of details such as weather, unit stats and levels, the options available to you ( fight this guy or both ) is a lot to take in. But it should not be a problem. For ODA !!!Now graphics wise this aint the Witcher 3 , so dont expect world renowed graphics, however the details generated on High settings is very nice to see, each plated armor's reflection, the arrows that hits and object , the waving grass as your army marches , very nice. However particles (like fire) and water the (looks and feels) needs a lot more fine tuning, but neglegible.Music, hohoho very... Japanese-sy (I know that's not a word), still its pretty good to hear, calm when its peaceful and exciting when you are fighting, but its getting boring real fast for the battle map music..Price : Hmmm... I never ever , ever , ever recommend any games paid in full (when release or after 10 years) , but I will say it totally worth the price when its 75% off during sales.Progress wise, there isnt any... unless you counting the progress system of your campaign game. For multiplayers or the 'Avatar Conquest' there is progress, but I dont really play it , so from MY experience , the progress in this game is pretty non-existant.Now I know this game has SinglePlayer, Co-op and Multiplayer, so Im not sure what kinda of main theme they are focusing on since I didnt play co-op (yet) and didnt play multiplayer a lot. But if its singleplayer focused, then they did a great job, a very good job at it. They stuck to the Japanese theme quite well, called the unit correctly, maybe.. kinda.. (Yari Ashigaru and not just 'Spearmen"") for the Sengoku Jidai era. But I kinda wish there were more... options for the faces of the Daimyo.Community, uh.... no comment , since i have little to no interaction with them, but the community mods, dayum they are good , sooooo guuuuuuuuuud.Its it fun YES and NOO, if you like spending quite some time, willing to brainstorm, love this genre, love to watch littlemen poke each other, love the feel that you won the battle by using your brain (finally something my brain and do without failing , unlike my Maths test) , then this game is for you. If you dont like waiting a lot, suck at micromagement completely, or just plainly hate this genre, then dont touch this game. But in MY OPINION, this game is FUN and worth getting.Serious score (with severe nitpicking) : 60. 77%Normal  score (casually thinking)        : 84. 54%			"

												Shogun 2, in my opinion, is one of the greatest grand strategy games that the world has to offer.You need a good, fast computer if you want to run this game at full settings, but when you can, the gameplay is breathtaking!         PROS- AMAZING GRAPHICS- You can always switch gameplay up by taking on the roles of different clans or objectives( so it never gets old)- custom battles ( you can fight massive battles with over thousands of soldiers in each army( may lag a bit if too many soldiers)- game uses invisible hand type controls to guide troops( best type of controls for these types of games)- tons of units to mix and match in armies( for custom and in campaign.- historical accuracy (although units dont have scabbards for swords)- this game is BEYOND realistic.    CONSThe game tends to lag if you top 3000 troops for battles.It takes a while to learn all the controls.THIS IS A BIG ONE! There are a lot of DLCs (downloadable content) You can download additional clans, units, and campaigns.However, you tend to ask yourself, didn't I pay 30 dollars for this already?As I said, Shogun 2 is one of the best grand strategy games you can get. If you are looking for realistic, action packed, combat/strategy games, and you don't mind going old school, SHOGUN 2 IS FOR YOU!GOOD JOB SEGA AND CREATIVE ASSEMBLY! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!!			"

												This game is ******* amazing!From the strategic battles to the awe inspiring castle sieges this game continues to amaze me almost 100 hours in. This game uses actual strategy and takes it to the max, for example once I had 400 men less than the other team (Tokugawa) I still manages to win the battle even with the very visable disadvantage due to me going around the enemy and trapping them in while attacking them from all sides with infantry and archersThis game has crashed on me twice and after I'm done playing a long session it won't let me play any different games because it says Shogun 2 is still running.I still reccomend this game through and through. Overall amazing game			"

												The best Total War game in my opinion, although being very different compared to pre- and post Total War titles. The campaign feels challenging but you have alot of options to choose from when coming up with your strategy. The battles are fun as always even if the AI can be very questionable at times. If you're a fan of the Total War franchise you'll have a blast with this game.			"

												Total War Shogun 2 is one of the greatest strategy games I have ever played, as well as quite simply the best Total War game in existence.This game sets you in Sengoku Jidai, the warring states period of Japan, when Daimyos ( Lords ) battled for power to become the Shogun ( The De Facto Ruler of Japan. ) The game is filled with a rich, unique history and culture, perfected mechanics for battles, as well as a materfully tuned economy and diplomacy system - however, don't expect the depth and of CK 2 or EU IV when it comes to diplomacy. It's not built around that, but it certainly gets the job doneThe Single Player can draw you in for many playthoughs ( my playtime speaks for itself ) and the Multiplayer has a very deep system that gives a lot of room for customization of your own Daimyo and Army, allowing you to sink many hours into that as well. On top of all of this, there is also a fully fleshed out coop system if you'd like to play through one of your campaigns with a friend.I'm going to put this in to simple terms. If you like Strategy games, then you need to get this game. It's simply one of the greatest stategy games ever made and it is a game that no strategy gamer should ever miss.			"

												Peace is a state of mind where you are asked to put aside your fear to lose that empty shell that you call a body. If you want to survive in a country torn by politics you must cut through everything that stands in your path. Cut through what you value the most, even the Buddha himself. Hesitation will lead you not only to your own defeat but to the defeat of those who depend on you and the one you serve.Rating:9.0			"

												Another success of the Total war series. I really like the way siege battles works in shogun 2: there are now multiple walls (in bigger citties) attacker must breach in order to win. No siege engines required as all units can climb the wall. Second great improvement to previous titles is able to fight navy battles at last. This game also serves as an excelent history lesson for 16th century Japan, witch was huge turning point in Japan historyStill i didn't have the ""one more turn"" -syndrome i had with rome: total war- and medieval 2: total war games. Main cause of this is probably the fact that I find classic antiquity and medieval europe more interesting themes than medieval Japan. Nevertheless i consider Shogun 2: total war being the last great game of the Total war series.10 - Perfect game9 - Excelent game, best of the genre8 - Good game, worth your time7 - Average game, nothing really special6 - Bad game, avoid5 - Painful to play, completely waste of time4 - Failed game, unpayable			"

												Overall, the game is great. However, the developers seem to have forgotten about the game soon after the release. Glitches and bugs reported just after the release haven't been fixed yet and will not be. Furthermore, the game in multiplayer co-op mode is painful to play because every once in a while there is some glitch corrupting the saves (probably a desync between host and a second player) - a problem that hasn't been addressed from the day one. Shame really,  the game is great in single player but if you wish to play the campaign with your friend you may have a hard time with reloading save from 20 turns before in order to fix an issue. BTW: for some reason reviewing the DLC - Fall of the Samurai is unfeasible, and one thing worth noting is that the base game is much less glitchy and buggy as the expansion is.			"

												For the Shogunate !Total War : Shogun 2 or Shogun 2 : Total War ReviewThis is my first (or third total war game , if you count empire and the original shogun demos) . Suffice to say I'm rather new to this type or Turn-Based Strategy with Real Time Tactics game. And yet this game is able to capture my attention for the first time I played the tutorial. Perhaps its because I'm new to this genre, the addiction of seeing my armies tactically win a skirmish because of good position attacks is strangely satisfying. Taking a severe loss can be heart brokening especially if you had the advantage. Outnumbering the enemy that has 2000 troops defending a castle with 6000 troops has it... tingling feeling (and the evil thought of the enemy army being obliterated) and some goosebumps as well. Those are the feeling that I have when playing Total War : Shogun 2. Now onto the review itself.For the new user experience (new to this genre) , it can be... quite the game depending on what happens. For me it was literally a giant puzzle, the tutorial explained well, but was painfully slow to listen to , its skippable, but too much inportant info lies there. Your first few battles would be... okay if your not a complete retard who throw archers into melee mode while your samurai hangs at the back. For those who are experience with this genre (those who played previous titles) it should be nice to see an upgrade in its combat refinement or rather its simplicity but still provide enough factors to blow your mind as usual.For casual players its pretty fun, it will take up at least 1 hour if your going thru the campaign casually (with the RTT battles of course) . By this point simply understanding of tactics should come  into play and the amount of exploration for units, technologies, buildings, and faction is a lot which can keep you pulled in for a long, long , long time. After all just... 1... more... turn... In multiplayer I cant say... I never found a match so far so its blank here.For the 'PRO' I wont say much as Im not pro yet, but it would seem that large scale micromanagement would be need to effectively win against the hardest of AIs. The most minor of details such as weather, unit stats and levels, the options available to you ( fight this guy or both ) is a lot to take in. But it should not be a problem. For ODA !!!Now graphics wise this aint the Witcher 3 , so dont expect world renowed graphics, however the details generated on High settings is very nice to see, each plated armor's reflection, the arrows that hits and object , the waving grass as your army marches , very nice. However particles (like fire) and water the (looks and feels) needs a lot more fine tuning, but neglegible.Music, hohoho very... Japanese-sy (I know that's not a word), still its pretty good to hear, calm when its peaceful and exciting when you are fighting, but its getting boring real fast for the battle map music..Price : Hmmm... I never ever , ever , ever recommend any games paid in full (when release or after 10 years) , but I will say it totally worth the price when its 75% off during sales.Progress wise, there isnt any... unless you counting the progress system of your campaign game. For multiplayers or the 'Avatar Conquest' there is progress, but I dont really play it , so from MY experience , the progress in this game is pretty non-existant.Now I know this game has SinglePlayer, Co-op and Multiplayer, so Im not sure what kinda of main theme they are focusing on since I didnt play co-op (yet) and didnt play multiplayer a lot. But if its singleplayer focused, then they did a great job, a very good job at it. They stuck to the Japanese theme quite well, called the unit correctly, maybe.. kinda.. (Yari Ashigaru and not just 'Spearmen"") for the Sengoku Jidai era. But I kinda wish there were more... options for the faces of the Daimyo.Community, uh.... no comment , since i have little to no interaction with them, but the community mods, dayum they are good , sooooo guuuuuuuuuud.Its it fun YES and NOO, if you like spending quite some time, willing to brainstorm, love this genre, love to watch littlemen poke each other, love the feel that you won the battle by using your brain (finally something my brain and do without failing , unlike my Maths test) , then this game is for you. If you dont like waiting a lot, suck at micromagement completely, or just plainly hate this genre, then dont touch this game. But in MY OPINION, this game is FUN and worth getting.Serious score (with severe nitpicking) : 60. 77%Normal  score (casually thinking)        : 84. 54%			"

												This game is difficult, its rewarding, and its ♥♥♥♥ing fun. When you are taking the heads of your rivals. Fighting off armies on all sides and storming your way up (or down) Japan to Kyoto is awesome. I took Kyoto with so many more men then I needed that the game lagged. Using some small boast to distract the black ship and then using the emperors flagship to sneak up and board it, resulting in capturing the black ship itself.  This whole game is super fun. With lots of replay-ability I haven't even delved into yet. Worth the money especially on sale, and worth the time. Have fun and make sure to take the emperor's head.			"

												Terrific, great game. 4/5 Stars. I would personally give it 5/5 stars- if the game itself was a little more in-depth. Theres no story mode- but imagine every fight at an overview where you may control each unit and watch it literally fight, thats what gets you this game! This game is not for people who want a storyline, but for people who love free-play. I have owned the game for a few months now, played it on two different laptops(a 5year old and a Month year old). My 5-year old laptop does NOT run it as well, but I am able to play it just fine, so long as I do not try to speed it up, I encounter little to no lag issues. With regards to my month year old laptop, I was able to run it perfectly, and the detail that the units get is 100% worth getting the game. Individuality is a huge aspect.			"

												In Japanese, they are usually referred to as bushi (武士?, [bu.ɕi]) or buke (武家?). According to translator William Scott Wilson: ""In Chinese, the character 侍 was originally a verb meaning ""to wait upon"" or ""accompany persons"" in the upper ranks of society, and this is also true of the original term in Japanese, saburau. In both countries the terms were nominalized to mean ""those who serve in close attendance to the nobility"", the pronunciation in Japanese changing to saburai. According to Wilson, an early reference to the word ""samurai"" appears in the Kokin Wakashū (905–914), the first imperial anthology of poems, completed in the first part of the 10th century.[1]By the end of the 12th century, samurai became almost entirely synonymous with bushi, and the word was closely associated with the middle and upper echelons of the warrior class. The samurai were usually associated with a clan and their lord, were trained as officers in military tactics and grand strategy, and they followed a set of rules that later came to be known as the bushidō. While the samurai numbered less than 10% of then Japan's population,[2] their teachings can still be found today in both everyday life and in modern Japanese martial arts.Following the Battle of Hakusukinoe against Tang China and Silla in 663 AD, which led to a retreat from Korean affairs, Japan underwent widespread reform. One of the most important was that of the Taika Reform, issued by Prince Naka-no-Ōe (Emperor Tenji) in 646 AD. This edict allowed the Japanese aristocracy to adopt the Tang dynasty political structure, bureaucracy, culture, religion, and philosophy.[3] As part of the Taihō Code of 702 AD, and the later Yōrō Code,[4] the population was required to report regularly for census, a precursor for national conscription. With an understanding of how the population was distributed, Emperor Mommu introduced a law whereby 1 in 3–4 adult males was drafted into the national military. These soldiers were required to supply their own weapons, and in-return were exempted from duties and taxes.[3] This was one of the first attempts by the Imperial government to form an organized army modeled after the Chinese system. It was called ""Gundan-Sei"" (ja:軍団制) by later historians and is believed to have been short-lived.[citation needed]The Taihō Code classified most of the Imperial bureaucrats into 12 ranks, each divided into two sub-ranks, 1st rank being the highest adviser to the Emperor. Those of 6th rank and below were referred to as ""samurai"" and dealt with day-to-day affairs. Although these ""samurai"" were civilian public servants, the name is believed[by whom?] to have derived from this term. Military men, however, would not be referred to as ""samurai"" for many more centuries.[citation needed]In the early Heian period, during the late 8th and early 9th centuries, Emperor Kammu sought to consolidate and expand his rule in northern Honshū, and sent military campaigns against the Emishi, who resisted the governance of the Kyoto-based imperial court. Emperor Kammu introduced the title of sei'i-taishōgun (征夷大将軍), or Shogun, and began to rely on the powerful regional clans to conquer the Emishi. Skilled in mounted combat and archery (kyūdō), these clan warriors became the Emperor's preferred tool for putting down rebellions; the most well known of which was Sakanoue no Tamuramaro. Though this is the first known use of the ""Shogun"" title, it was a temporary title, and was not imbued with political power until the 13th century. At this time (the 7th to 9th century), the Imperial Court officials considered them to be merely a military section under the control of the Imperial Court.Samurai on horseback, wearing ō-yoroi armour, carrying bow (yumi) and arrows in a yebira quiverUltimately, Emperor Kammu disbanded his army. From this time, the Emperor's power gradually declined. While the Emperor was still the ruler, powerful clans around Kyoto assumed positions as ministers, and their relatives bought positions as magistrates. To amass wealth and repay their debts, magistrates often imposed heavy taxes, resulting in many farmers becoming landless.[citation needed] Through protective agreements and political marriages, they accumulated, or gathered, political power, eventually surpassing the traditional aristocracy.[citation needed]Some clans were originally formed by farmers who had taken up arms to protect themselves from the Imperial magistrates sent to govern their lands and collect taxes. These clans formed alliances to protect themselves against more powerful clans, and by the mid-Heian period they had adopted characteristic Japanese armor and weapons, and laid the foundations of Bushidō, their ethical code.After the Genpei war of the late 12th century, a clan leader Minamoto no Yoritomo obtained the right to appoint shugo and jito, and was allowed to organize soldiers and police, and to collect a certain amount of tax. Initially, their responsibility was restricted to arresting rebels and collecting needed army provisions, and they were forbidden from interfering with Kokushi officials, but their responsibility gradually expanded and thus, the samurai-class appeared as the political ruling power in Japan. Minamoto no Yoritomo started the Kamakura shogunate in 1192.Kamakura Bakufu and the rise of samuraiSamurai ō-yoroi armour, Kamakura period. Tokyo National Museum.Originally the Emperor and non-warrior nobility employed these warrior nobles. In time, they amassed enough manpower, resources and political backing in the form of alliances with one another, to establish the first samurai-dominated government. As the power of these regional clans grew, their chief was typically a distant relative of the Emperor and a lesser member of either the Fujiwara, Minamoto, or Taira clans. Though originally sent to provincial areas for a fixed four-year term as a magistrate, the toryo declined to return to the capital when their terms ended, and their sons inherited their positions and continued to lead the clans in putting down rebellions throughout Japan during the middle- and later-Heian period. Because of their rising military and economic power, the warriors ultimately became a new force in the politics of the Imperial court. Their involvement in the Hōgen-era Hōgen Rebellion in the late Heian period consolidated their power, which later pitted the rivalry of Minamoto and Taira clans against each other in the Heiji Rebellion of 1160.The winner, Taira no Kiyomori, became an imperial advisor, and was the first warrior to attain such a position. He eventually seized control of the central government, establishing the first samurai-dominated government and relegating the Emperor to figurehead status. However, the Taira clan was still very conservative when compared to its eventual successor, the Minamoto, and instead of expanding or strengthening its military might, the clan had its women marry Emperors and exercise control through the Emperor.The Taira and the Minamoto clashed again in 1180, beginning the Gempei War, which ended in 1185. Samurai fought at the naval battle of Dan-no-ura, at the Shimonoseki Strait which separates Honshu and Kyushu in 1185. The victorious Minamoto no Yoritomo established the superiority of the samurai over the aristocracy. In 1190 he visited Kyoto and in 1192 became Sei'i-taishōgun, establishing the Kamakura Shogunate, or Kamakura Bakufu. Instead of ruling from Kyoto, he set up the Shogunate in Kamakura, near his base of power. ""Bakufu"" means ""tent government"", taken from the encampments the soldiers would live in, in accordance with the Bakufu's status as a military government.[5]Ashikaga ShogunateThe Samurai Suenaga facing Mongols, during the Mongol invasions of Japan.

												This met the Total War standards. However this game had  fallen to the DLC rush and that is a SHAMEFUL DISPLAY. Here the $2 blod packs had started. The base playable factions are plentiful DLC is more for people wanting to see how a campaign would go for a certain faction in a terrible position. Extremely fun but Outdated with ROME II and ATTILA replacing melee combat and WARHAMMER replacing Melee and Ranged combat			"

												One of the best strategy games out there. No other game does it this well like the Total War franchise and Shogun 2 just takes it to the next level. The game has outstanding graphics (if you have a good enough rig to run them on max). Every little thing has detail to it. Shogun 2 also offers a good multiplayer excperience and not just by improving multiplayer campaign (which can be played both cooperativley and competetevly) but adds an interesting Avatar Conquest that lets you create your own general make armies, level up and battle against other players.And once the battle begins....everything just feels epic. You MUST play this game if you are a strategy fan and if you are not it will make you into one.Recomend it to everyone with a good PC.i promise you you wont be disapointed. Now if you will excuse me ill go back to playing.			"

												I loved this game and have recently gotten back into it but all the Total War games eventually get ridiculous. Let me explain.So me and my friend are dominating Japan, we have 40 provinces, and there are only a total of four factions left (me, him, hojo, takeda). It's me and him vs those two. We're pushing and doing very well and the fights are beginning to get bigger and tougher as we enter their deeper lands... Okay, no problem. Then it gets to the point where my armies, even though they have just as good units and more than the enemy, will all of a sudden ALL run away at the exact same time. This happened first to my friend who was destroying the enemy army and then all of a sudden everyone panicked. We thought he was flanked, we thought something actually happened. Nope. This happened to me 3 times after that and him again. We are very frustrated that the PC cheats like that. To make matters worse, the more recent TW games have gotten even worse than this one. Rome 2 took the PC cheating to the extreme where no matter how good your strategy was or how well your soldiers were doing, some battles... you were losing no matter what. Then Attila came out and that game is almost impossible to play because you're constantly losing ground. You have better units and you outnumber the enemy but who cares, it's CA so ""♥♥♥♥ you!"" All your units throw down their weapons, pull down their pants, turn around, and bend over for the enemy to come and have their way with them.I'm done with the Total War series.			"

												Huge battles, legions of soldiers, artillery, samurai and ninjas. to date, this is definitely the most action packed total war game. It's the perfect balance between military strategy, and the all out brutality of war, 10/10			"

												Love the game. Suggest it for any strategy fans who dont mind suffering minor loses for a massive victory, a must have for any sensible stratician and remember to get the dlc's as well adding a new varity to the game and improving any strategies that you developed while playing civ ten fold. Seriously one of the most challanging yet entertaining and skill improving games ever made. Note to new players stay off of multiplayer until you have beat the single player campaign at least once or be utterly wreaked and devastated in your first online battle. 10/10 One of my favorite games of all time.
