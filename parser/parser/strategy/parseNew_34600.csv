												Before i start - keep in mind that many reviews have been posted before Multiplayer was abandoned by the developers. Anyway:Order of War is a game of deloying units and taking flags - there is no base building. It has some good features:*There is a certain level of tactical gameplay. This is pretty much simply decision-making about which reinforcements will be needed to counter your enemy's deployments.*The units have a solid WW2 feel if not a little aged in graphical quality. *There is a good variety of units with various infantry, motorised and armoured units to choose from. Adding to this there is a limited selection of air units available that can be countered by anti-air units.*There is satisfaction to be had from breaking through the enemy front line and advancing to the next objective (objective meaning 'flag' because the game is essentially 'capture the flag').Order of War however also has some issues that in my opinion stop this 2/5 game being rated maybe a 3/5 or 4/5.*There is no Multiplayer any longer. By lack of Multiplayer I also mean no LAN either. This is a major show-stopper as the game seems almost geared towards Multiplayer than Single player. I can see the potential that Multiplayer would turn the routine flag stealing from a tactically-naive AI into an epic struggle of egos.* The campaign feels a bit routine and by the numbers. It is a fairly monotone experience of basically capturing and defending flags.*So with no Multiplayer at all and a join-the-dots campaign we need a good skirmish experience to compensate.The Skirmish option allows some limited customisation but simply borrows campaign maps, uses them as a blank canvas and asks you to capture all the flags - a victory theme we are getting a little too used to in this game. And to limit things even further the developers offer you only a handful of maps.Don't get me wrong. If you like WW2 RTS games you will still have some fun with elements of this game, but it will only be a temporary distraction from games with more replayability.I would highly recommend the game if the developers simply:Added more skirmish maps and make skirmish more customisable.& Re-implemented LAN and/or MP capability. Why, when developers shut down servers, do they not replace online Multiplay with LAN is beyond me.It's thumbs down until they restore at least LAN to the game and add some more content. The game feels half-baked.			"

												With all my sincere respect for the developer of this WWII strategy game, Wargaming-dot-net studio, I'm having a hard time with actually recommending this game. At least there, on Steam, with its current unpatched state. You see, this game heavily suffers from the memory leakage bug, which ends up in crushing after every mission or even during the long ones (especially when they interrupted by videoclips). There is a cure, sure, but you have to look for it yourself, and it will not be a quick search. So I clearly understand some of the people, who wants to buy that game, but Not-On-Steam, considering the fact Steam is really, really Slow with updating non-mainstream games, even if it's obvious gems like Fallout 1&2, which was unplayable on Steam (with modern system) for several years!Now, when I said that, let's get on with an actual review. Order of War is an interesting approach on the field of modern strategies, when everyone knows one-two games, three at most. So, generally, no, it is not like the Company of Heroes, totally another scale, more like in the Total War... quite different in details, but close at feeling out of the game session.For many people, Order of War is looking like World in Conflict... well, yeah, there are some common points, like lack of many core elements of ""classic"" strategies, like building units, push-pull struggle for resources and other ""micromanagement"" - all gone. You have some regiments under your command, and for successful operations, you'll be gaining some ""points"" to upgrade your troops (for better attack, defence etc.) Sometimes there will be small tasks like to conquer 2-3 AA-guns or bunkers, and 1-2 squads for you, and sometimes you'll be ordering full front assault for dozens of tanks, managing large scale army successes. And all that according to history books: paratroopers landing and storming the coasts in Northern France, stalemate at Bulge, and all other noticable operations - all there. I've seen some whinings from people who trying to play for Nazies, like ""upgrades costs too much, there are less reinforcements and resources for Germans, that's not fair!"" Oh, yeah, it's fair. Here's a short morale lesson: it is always easier on Bad side at first, and miles-harder at finish. And in the year 1944  it was almost the end end of Nazi conquest, their numbers were greatly diminished at East, their productions were at pieces thanks to Allies bombardments... no doubt it is Hard to play for Germans at 1944! Well, think of it as of challenge: a hardest level of it. Save every soldier possible, maneuver like Mars himself, and fight like Leonidas to secure the borders of Vaterland... and postpone the unevitable.Other than disbalance between sides (which Was really nerfed in skirmishes, BTW), the only real blame I've seen from people about Order of War is that by terms of gameplay you just gotta send your troops straight on frontal assault, every time. That remark shows really how far those critics moved into the game... as that tactic works in first mission, and partly in second. They are kind of tutorial, see - so the player get the flow, such as effective distance of fire, grenade throws, effectiveness and weak points of artilliry and tanks... First mission is forgiving the errors, but if you can't catch the drift, you'll be lost very quickly (maybe the easy setting is different, but who's playing strategies on easy?)Okay, in the end, I recommend Order of War to all people who have any interest in real-time strategies. There are not enough of them now, as you know... This game provides real battlefields of WWII, with realistic maps of battlefields and ability to resize the view from very close one, where you notice projectiles flying over the ground, to the mile-high-observation post, to see the whole town at once - and your units sieging it from all sides, for example. Also, there are quite enough background info to sink in, as usual in the games from Wargaming, so think of it as of history discourse of sort. The level of challenge is raising from mission to mission, so, even when you see all the map from the start of mission, that certainly doesn't mean you see all on it. That means the game is not simple as it seems at start, when you don't notice ""fog of war"" and shouldn't count the reinforcements. It's all comes later, when you presumably learned the basics.The only real downside is that that game has no particular reason to buy it through Steam. If you'll find another source, where you'll be knowing that memory leak problem is already taken care of - maybe it would be better choise to get it there.Mark 7.2/10.			"

												The original Order of War was released in September 2009 bij Square Enix, having been developed by Wargaming.net. It's a game typical for its age: back in 2009 the real-time strategy genre was still at its peak, with the World War 2 setting being particularily popular. The game that had started this high, Blitzkrieg, dates from 2003, and the original Company of Heroes from 2006, and it's fair to say that an impressive number of games surfed on the succes of these blockbusters, Order of War being one of them.Actually, Blitzkrieg and Company of Heroes both defined a sub-category in this genre. While Company of Heroes follows the more traditional rts-approach, complete with base-building, managing resources and fine-tuning the production of your units, Blitzkrieg was more revolutional by getting rid of all that and just focusing on the combat and the strategic/tactical positioning of one's armies/units. Order of War clearly follows in the Blitzkrieg-tradition, and in doing so it irons out several problems those games had. The number of units under the player's command is reduced quite a bit, and the maps played upon are much more manageable than in the Blitzkrieg games, while still delivering a good feel of being wide and (mostly) open. Order of War also adds a nice feature known by fans of the games developed by Relic (Warhammer 40.000 & Company of Heroes 1 & 2): by controlling a number of strategic points, the amount of available resources gets bigger. Those resourses are used to call for reinforcements, which are almost always essential in succeeding in a particular mission. Deciding when to call it which kind of unit/equipment is often a game-deciding factor.So far, so good. But despite its sound concept, Order of War fails to impress me, at least in its present form on Steam. First of all: the two campaigns, one for the Allies and one for the Germans, just feel like a number of skirmish sessions against the pc strung together without any real storyline or other feeling of continuity. Every mission starts with a new bunch of troops, so units don't get experience for fighting and there is no urge at all to keep them alive: they are just cannon fodder. There are no upgrades for your units except for some rather generic improvements in armor, firing rate etc which can be bought between the different missions. Secondly, almost all of the missions (nine in each campaign) develop into one big grind-fest, where waves and waves of fresh troups need to be hurled at the enemy in order to succeed. Some tactical tricks like using paratroopers (if available) to capture strategic points can speed things up a bit, but especially in the later missions there are not that many different options to fulfil the objectives. On a positive note however: the game does use the well-tried stone-paper-scissor concept very well. Tanks are good against infantry and other tanks, but get slaughtered by anti-tank guns or tank destroyers, while infantry and artillery make minced meat of those AT-guns in no time, to give just a couple of examples.But the biggest downside to the game is its current lack of multiplayer options, and a major technical issue: a nearly game-breaking memory leak. Almost in every single mission I got an ""out of memory"" message, so I needed to save often mid-mission in order not to loose too much progress. Actually, the presence of such a major technical problem is unforgivable, and made me give up on the game before finishing the second campaign. The lack of multiplayer is somehow to be expected for a game of this age, but a good skirmish mode which could alleviate that problem, isn't present either. There is one, but it is hardly interesting with far too less options to customize one's army and only some of the campaign-maps being recycled.Sadly, only recommended to those who want to play every single World War 2 rts-game and who don't mind to put up with some serious technical problems.

												Order of War is an awesome WWII strategy game, it has decent graphics giving you a better feel for the game. This game puts you in command of the American, Soviet and Nazi German war machines. Its simular to the Company of Heroes series but in a wider scale. Its a real test for your skills in strategy and over all its an awesome game which I definetly recommend!			"

												Played it long ago, good and bad game. Was considered a flop by companies but most still held it as a fun time killer. Good graphics for a old game and fun units, annoying slow painful turtling through the entire game. Your units sit around and get shot at when they try to fight and make NO effort to evade.			"

												5/10 for the gameThis is an ok game, has some nice touches in it with a lot of unit variety. It's basically as another reviewer said Company of Heroes but a big scale (for example your tank units come with 5 in each section) so you feel like a real General rather than a company commander. It's also in my opinion more realistic in some ways - infantry get slaughtered, tanks get knocked out pretty quickly vs the right defences like anti tank guns or tank destroyers and artillery really does play havoc when it lands accurately. You can play as either the Americans invading Normandy or the Germans fighting on the Eastern front in the campaign. In Skirmish mode you can play as America, Germany and the USSR (Russia) which gives nice unit look variety.However there is still a lot to be desired - the gameplay does become easily boring as it's pretty much the same. You call in reinforcements using credits you earn from capture points (no base building) and can win every map just by dominating in artillery if you plan it right. In some maps I only needed one tank unit and the rest was anti tank guns and artillery destroying everything that moved. Units like infantry are basically obsolete and they will be wiped out the second anything fires so it doesn't allow many tactics apart from tank rushing in my opinion. The units are pretty much identical however for all nations - I've not noticed any special tactics or way of playing myself.Overall if it's on sale (around half the asking price now) it is certainly worth a buy and you'll get a good few hours out of it. I also have read that the multiplayer has gone offline - while this doesn't bother me personally that would be a downside for most. The option still is in the menu though so I'm not sure what is going on with that.			"

												When I bought this game I thought it will be similar, or identic, to Company of Heroes, or Men of War. Happily I were mistaken. The way Order of War handles some features is unique. I like the unit size and conflict size which is completely new thing to me when it comes to world war II strategy games. It reminds me of tabletop miniature games like Warhammer 40k, or Flames of War, where whole unit of tanks or vehicles is controlled.On the other side there are some things lacking on physics and the game system. Vehicles and infantry could cooperate bit more. Another thing I would like to see is mechanized infantry using halftracks and stuff like that. Also the role of normal infantry is a bit lacking, as Infantry automatically starts crawling as they approach the enemy.When it comes to my final opinion... I like this game. There are definitely ways to improve it, but I give it a good mark.			"

												Really all the game is about is throwing units at the ai or a player opponent. No real tactics or strategy. Just how many flags you can control to pump out endless streams of units. The units look nice I suppose, and the music is excellent. Infact I'm pretty sure the soundtrack is done by Jeremey Soule, because it sounds almost exactly like Supreme Commander music to me. Unit control wise, it's bad. Tanks will often turn around for no reason to present their rear to the enemy (if the game even has any sort of armour modeling in the first place, i honestly can't tell as there is zero feedback or way to figure out how effective my weapons are against any particular enemy).Strong points can be taken by sending two or three infantry squads against them frontally. Not sure what the point of trenches or garrisoning units even is as an infantry squad in the open has about the same chances of survival. Honestly I can't recommend it. If you're going to go for an older, cheap tactical rts without base building, pick up one of the men of war/faces of war, company of heros, or even older games like btlizkrieg over this one.			"

Infantry is just a liitle neusance that bugs tanks, Those who liked Blitzkrieg, Sudden Strike and Men of War shouldn buy it. I got bored on the second mission.

												This is one of the best WW2 strategies made to date!!!  I think this game can be closely compared to R.U.S.E although I think it is superior in every way. I mean it has amazing multiplayer which we have been playing over the years with few of my friends but also two VERY deep campaigns. Now, while American campaign is good - it just reminds me of COH, it does the same things, it is in the same theater etc...German campaign is AMAZING, probably only game that offers all battles from final year of the Reich, so each fight is a desperate struggle.Graphics is dated by now but this is a 2009 title which still playes very well - how many games can say that?Another amazing thing for such an old title - this natively supports surround resolutions making battles a lot of fun!

												Without Online Multiplayer, it's such a small game. The 6 skirmish maps you have are dull after a while and the AI is easy to beat on Hard mode, with high/low resources in either case.It could be fun as eye candy if you could LAN, but I could not find a way to use the same copy of the game with Library sharing or Ctrl-Alt-Del'ing. (Why worry about piracy issues if you've killed your game from the Multiplayer genre anyhow?)Overall, nope. You could get a small thrill when you first get the game but you'll just be bitter later on down the track.			"

												There is really nothing remarkable about this game at all. It's World In Conflict without the amazing story, fun gameplay,  and stellar graphics. The cinematic camera is a neat feature, but only helps to emphazise the tactical depth of this game. Click here, click here, hit the camera button, and watch the action unfold. One campaign chronicles the done to death Invasion of Normandy, and adds nothing of interest to the table, unlike Company of Heroes. The other campaign is the defense of German held territory on the Eastern Front from Soviet forces looking to push them all the way to Berlin. Still, the game is so mind numbingly dull and unoriginal that I did not even bother seeing if the second campaign had any more redeemable quality than the first. Just avoid, and check out Company of Heroes or Men of War instead.			"

												Easy learning curve.  Graphics are quite nice.   Faithful to history.   Just not entirely enough freedom to try battles with your own strategy.  One is very guided by HQ orders.   For those where history is a pleasure,  the game puts campaign progress in close to chronoligical order and links it geographically with map progressions.   Helps make sense of similar battles seen in other games and not knowing why we otherwise jump around and why and how battles purposes were linked.			"

There can literally be up to a thousand units on screen at any one time, and tank battles are so entertaining to watch. Even features a cinematic camera mode, so after youve issued your orders you can sit back and watch the carnage in style. Graphically I dont think its aged that well over the five years its been out, and the gameplay has been outdone by the likes of CoH in the RTS genre since but at the price its currently at I think its well worth for an RTS to check this game out.

The game play itself is very engrossing and it gives a fresh point capture rts that unlocks units and allows you to gather resources instead of building a static base then building you're army. The action is none stop you might think your about to win then the enemy just kicks you in the teeth out of nowhere its rather fun and keeps it interesting. I give this game 5 ot of 5 for price, gameplay, and general replayability. Hope you find my review helpful. Sincerely Lust.			"

												I only play this game 48 minutes, but game crashed two times. Many other people has same problem and looks like Wargaming.net won't fix it. This a good game, but IT CAN NOT RUN!			"

												This is a fun WWII game. Love the fact that you don't need to build a base for building units. All you need to do is capture points collect resources. This allows you to go straight into battle. Battles can get really big due to the fact that units(including tanks) are deployed in platoons. On this point if a unit has been damaged or has taken causualties there is no way to repair or reinforce said unit.			"

												A ""stunning game"" if you exclude the fact that it's unplayable due to bugs. 6 core + crossfired 5970 ATI's, this game is borked.			"
