												It seems (from other reviews - either ""recommended"" or ""not-recommended"") that players really don't get the concept of the game. Let me get this clear.If you happen to know the game called ""State of war"" you just know how ""Oil rush"" would be played. Sort of...What is the difference between this and other RTS?You don't build anything, you capture the pre-set buildings on the map. Enemy does the same. Buldings can be recaptured infinitely.Every building (factory) you have under control produces specific unit (for that factory) once at the given time (ie. 1 scout unit every 10 seconds). More factories of the same type = higher maximum limit of specific unit + making of the unit on more places -> faster.Factories can be defended by turrets.Turrets are made from oil.You get oil from oil wells which you have to capture just like factory. Oil well can be recaptured too and cannot be defended by turrets.So far it looks almost like State of war. Here come the changes:You can't control every single unit. You can control only groups of units - be it the same type of unit or multiple unit types. Group like this can be sent ONLY to platform (factory, oil well, ...) of yours/of your enemy/neutral one. You cannot move units around the map the way you are used to from ""normal"" RTS.If sent on your platform: Units circle around and defend the platform. You prepare attack/invasion this way -> get more units on one place before launching attack.If sent on enemy platform: Units try to kill enemy (units and turrets) and then start to recapture platform.If sent on neutral: just like enemy (neutral units may be present that defend the platform)There are some upgrades and special abilities and so on...This is not ordinary RTS and many ""players"" don't get it. This game really reminds me of State od war which is probably totally forgotten these days. But it was just like this - something new.I still have to go through the whole game and try multiplayer (and get PWNED), but I would recommend this game. You have to be prepared for it though. It is fast-paced, challenging, doesn't give you any rest when you play it.And just like with other reviews from me - guess what? :-) It runs on Linux without any single problem.			"

												This game is quite pretty with very nice graphics. Unfortunately, the graphics and building defensive turrets around the bases is all the main screen is used for. Gameplay itself is pretty much restricted to moving units from one base to another via the mini-map. All you can do is select 25%, 50%, or 100% of a base's units or select individual kinds of units rather than individual units themselves, limiting your tactical options. No sending sentries or guards in the middle of a channel. Additionally, each base only constructs one kind of unit. If you lose the one base that makes the cheap anti-unit guys, you are SOL. And no constructing your own bases either, you're stuck with the ones already on the map.One of the biggest irritations is that units don't engage enemy units en-route unless they sail right on top of the unit, and even then they don't chase them. So a massive enemy force can sail right by your front-line bases with only a couple shots exchanged. So much for a defensive line. The story is amusing if only because of its ridiculousness. Definitely not worth playing it for. In the end, the game is just a grind of sending units forward, watching them die, building more units, sending them forward, and then back to retake a base, then forward again. Much better RTSs out there. (Also, for those saying it includes TD elements, sure if a couple pot shots as the enemy drives by counts as defense...)			"

												TLDR – Oil Rush is a graphics intensive version of what I would call a “virus game” similar to the Galcon series. Technically it’s real time strategy, but it’s all about moving your troops between map “nodes,” protecting your own while capturing your enemy’s when his troops are away. The game maker took a simple gameplay concept and prettied it up with modern graphics and a campaign story.   7.5/10The game takes place after global warming has flooded the Earth and left humanity living on ships and small floating towns in the middle of the ocean. The most precious commodity is now oil, used not only for keeping the navy ships moving but for producing electricity and other necessities. You play a young navy commander named Kevin who is fresh out of school and ready to kick raider♥♥♥♥♥to protect your people (and grab oil supplies while you’re at it).Game play is simple in Oil Rush. You usually start with a factory that automatically builds units until a limit is reached. You can send these units to any other “node” such as another factory or oil derrick. If the node belongs to an enemy a fight breaks out and whoever has more units will win and gain/keep control of the node. You cannot send your units into the middle of nowhere, they can only be sent to another node. And since the max limit of units is pretty small, the action is pretty fast paced (it’s hard to build up a massive army and crush the enemy because they’ll probably have the same size army as you). The more factories you control, the higher your unit limit is, so if you strike fast and capture factories early you’ll probably win the round. There are a number different types of factories since every factory can only build a single type of unit. Additionally, there’s a tower defense element to the game because your factories can be “upgraded” to have automated defense bunkers to back up whatever units are there to defend. If your factory is heavily defended with bunkers you can feel safer sending all your troops out to attack. Oil derricks function as nodes on the map (you can send troops to them) but they cannot be defended with bunkers and they only produce oil, which is kind of like mana for your special powers. The special powers aren’t especially awesome but they can turn the tide if you have almost enough units to conquer an enemy node. Pros:+Simple gameplay where you’re really limited in what you can do. Don’t go in thinking it’s a real time strategy game like Starcraft, this game is all about capturing and holding map nodes.+The graphics are very good for an indie game. My video card fan was spun up the whole time. +Unlike the Galcon games that I’ve played, Oil rush has an actual story campaign. You follow Kevin’s progress through hardships and an increasing number of enemy factions.Cons:-The simple gameplay may turn some people off. As you progress in the campaign you get access to a lot more units and more special powers, but the core gameplay remains the same.  Capture and hold as many factories as you can until you reach your unit max, then send them to attack an enemy node. -The gameplay may be simple (moving troops around), but the game itself can be extremely difficult. Even on easy mode, some of the campaign missions are against overwhelming numbers of enemies. Overall, if you like virus type games you should enjoy Oil Rush. It’s like playing Tic Tac Toe with high end graphics on a bigger board. A simple concept framed with modern technology. "

												From the tutorial missions this seems like a pretty simple yet good RTS, but then you start the real missions and you find out that this game is terrible. For one thing it seems the only way to move units around is after they have reached their destination so if you send a unit on a long trip you will not have control of that unit until it is done moving. Secondly defensive lines mean nothing. If you try to set-up a defensive line the enemy AI will just roll right through it and start grabbing a territory behind your defensive line. Or better yet the enemies will just simply spawn at the very edge of the map way past your defensive lines and grab the last territory they would logically go after. The whole thing is just an absolute mess. This game gave me a headache and only deserves 1 speedboat out of 5.			"

												Could have been decent, but the cheating AI and annoying difficulty make it tedious and frustrating. Every time you attack an enemy base the enemy will do the same and attack one of yours. By the time you've gotten back to defend that base the enemy will already be attacking you on the other side of the map. This constant cat-and-mouse goes on forever making missions very tedious.It's not enough to defend the borders of your territory since the enemy can sail right past those and go straight for your undefended bases in the middle.Taking over enemy factories doesn't matter since the AI will cheat and spawn new units at the edge of the map. The enemy also sees through the fog-of-war, attacking bases as soon as you move your fleet away.The graphics are fine, but that doesn't matter since you spend 90% of the time looking at the mini-map.

												I own this because of Humble Bundle 8.Incredibly simplified RTS.  You can tell it was designed for mobile and just adapted to PC.  You don't control individual units, you just send units to a station, and then from that station you can decide to send 25%, 50%, or 100% to another station.  Attempt to capture all the stations from the enemy.  Certain stations generate resources, others may generate units, and you can build defenses on stations. That seems to be about the entirety of the gameplay.  It's a mash up of RTS and tower defense, leaning more towards tower defense.The campaign is 15 missions.  I did about 4 of them in half an hour and really found no reason to continue.I could probably see this being fun on a phone or a tablet if I had nothing better to play, but I do, so...			"

												Oil Rush at its heart is a simplified RTS similar to Z series, in that the resources are gathered automatically by ""capturing"" oil wells, and there are fixed ""factories"" for unit production that you or the enemy can capture. All that is done in a post-apocalyptic naval warfare backstory where the the nuclear war had melted the polar ice caps, flooding almost everything and the massive loss of technology lead to battles between factions that fight over oil derricks (that are always captured, rather than destroyed). With light, medium, heavy, and air units, each with different types of weapons good against certain types of targets, and ability to place up to 5 defense towers around each platform, this RTS aims to look different and simplify things to faster action, There's no research other than some extra perks you can activate in battle depending your kills thus far. And those are almost too tedius to deploy as they are usually speed bonuses like ""speed up construction"" or ""make this unit go faster"" and so on. Graphics are quite good though frame rate could be better. All in all, Oil Rush is not a bad RTS, the background is interesting, and its simplified RTS has certain levels of charm to it, but but it's a bit of MOTS (more of the same).			"

												Oil Rush is a bland and repetitive RTS game where you do not actually control individual units, but control groups of units that are produced from pre-placed production buildings which both sides are fighting for. All you do is fight for control points that either create units or produces oil for towers or upgrades. With this simplistic approach, strategy options are lacking and become frustrating because units are difficult to control and give orders. You can only command 25%, 50% or 100% of units around a certain control point and then you send them from control point A to B. It becomes a huge chore trying to command different units to defend or attack multiple areas; after a few levels the game really shows how shallow and repetitive it is with no real options of giving the player to use strategy.

												An odd hybrid between RTS and Tower Defense. Past the first missions the difficulty spikes aggressively. The voice acting and the script are ludicrous, specially when it comes to pop culture references and the character of Zhuang, some sort of derp Confucius. Its graphics are very impressive, the omnipresent water is a delight to look at.  All things considered, Oil Rush can be an enjoyable, if sometimes infuriating, experience.			"

												Despite my appreciation for their support of Linux, I would not by any means recommend Oil Rush. The mechanics of the game are extraordinarily simple, and the control of the units so coarse that any sort of ""micro"" control is entirely absent. Despite this, the game manages to become quite obnoxiously difficult a few stages in -- the irritating factor being that numbers are nearly the only determinant of strength, and yet the AIs can produce units at exactly the same rate as you, and so the game quickly enters a deadlock state where you're throwing units to capture one node while the opponent simply recaptures the last one you captured, that you HAD to remove forces from in order to actually stand a chance of capturing this new one; so the game quickly devolves into an incredibly boring series of ineffective node trading.Then, the game is barely interactive at all. The combat, as I have said, has no micro whatsoever (so you just watch as two guys on jetskis shoot SMGs at each other while circling a building), and the ""macro"" involves simply capturing nodes and then building several highly ineffective turrets so you can pretend they're better defended. Most of the time you're just sitting there watching, to the point where I have to wonder whether it started development as an automated Unigine demo.The world's okay, though there is nothing particularly interesting to draw one in. The characters are forgivably cheesy and forgettably uninteresting. Overall, it's pretty forgettable, though it looks about as good as endless water and some utilitarian oil platforms can look.Overall, it's not something I would recommend, even when compared only to other Linux games.

												After watching Totalbiscuit's quick look at Oil Rush the development descisions start to make more sense. Check out his video on youtube for an accurate description of what the game is like. Pros:- Great graphics- Interesting mix of strategy and tower defenseCons:- Cheesy, imbalanced, repetitive campaign- Not much variety, one race/set of units for everyoneRating: 2/5So Oil Rush is a game created by a Russian company called Unigine Corp specifically to promote their engine coinsidentally named Unigine. Promote the engine it certainly does as it's a beautiful game to look at. As for the gameplay, Oil Rush is lacking.First some things I did like about the game. The graphics I already mentioned are great. The water effects and texture detail stand out as being very good for a smaller engine like this. The music is decently catchy but the quality is poor. Probably the best part of the game is the interesting mix of strategy and tower defense in an uncommon way. In Oil Rush you don't base build, you capture bases (zones, if you will) that spawn specific types of units or provide you with resources. You also don't control your units individually but rather as a group and send them off to attack and capture. Killing enemies also gets you command points you can use on upgrades. They're all very straightforward but they again add just a bit of variety to make the game more interesting. You use the resources you collect to surround your bases with towers preventing an easy capture when your forces are away or on some of the command point powers. At first this all looked straightforward and a bit boring to me but after playing with the mechanics for a few hours against a hard AI, the system actually does provide for some very tense fights and strategy in which bases you fight harder over to get the units you want and how you split the forces you do have to cover several sides of the map. After awhile you're thankful you don't need to control individual units so you can focus on the map as a whole. This isn't an entirely new idea for a game, building up forces until you have superior numbers and capturing nodes I've seen before but Oil Rush does do it with just a little bit of spice to keep it interesting.-------------------------Now for some of the bad parts of the game. It's cheesy and it shows, especially in the terribly voice acted campaign. I couldn't actually test the multiplayer since of course the game is deader than dead by now so I was restricted to the campaign and AI skirmishes. The campaign follows a very linear story arc, which is fine for a strategy game if the missions were fun but in this case they're really not. Several of the missions are artificially difficult with enemy units 'magically' appearing out of the side of the map and attacking your weakest base the very second you leave it. Other missions mix up the game completely and turn it entirely into a tower defense game with you controlling platforms that only allow turrets to be built while you watch enemies slowly move along a set path through them. If these levels were good it'd be a welcome addition to mix up the pace but they're not. There's none of the tenseness of a tower defense, none of the mayhem or strategy, you can literally spam any tower you want and win these levels UNTIL the last wave or so when they throw super enemies at you which you aren't ready for since the last 19 waves had nothing like that. That's the kind of stuff that makes those levels more frustrating than fun. Overall it's not an entirely terrible campaign, just tedious and uninteresting enough that I certainly wouldn't want to play it more than once.Also to note is there's only one race and set of units in the game with a select few only being accessable in the campaign. This makes sense in the context of the gameplay since bases can only spawn one type of unit for everyone but it doesn't help the variety of the game. It's not a terrible design overall it just offers little in replaybility and makes the game much simpler and shorter than it could be.-------------------------I was torn on recommending this game or not for awhile since it's really not terrible, just not memorable. My final verdict for Oil Rush is NOT recommended. There are much better games out there that do all this game does and more and does it better. For a similar but superior game check out Divinity: Dragon Commander.			"

												Oil Rush is a good example of a game that is solid and well-thought out, but not necessarily fun. Yes, it's an indie. No, I'm not going to hold back. Bad is bad. Period.The game takes place on the sea, with the occasional land objects (such as large rock pillars) and of course the RTS-bound structures. With that in mind, you generally shouldn't expect any framerate drops. Although lengthy gameplay does, for some reason, give me a frame hiccup from time to time.It doesn't look bad, but it doesn't really stand out either. There's little compelling about the troops you build and the structures you defend. At this point, it's easy to disregard them as grunts or cannonfodder, which they often end up to be anyway. On top of that, it's not always easy to discern which troops are yours, as they only have a few stripes on them with your team's color.The story is a typical slogan to how we are treating our planet badly. Global warming has flooded everything, and the planet is one now a huge ball of water.While the voice actors  have been recorded with proper gear, they seem utterly incapable of getting me engaged in the story. But their handling is even worse. At times, the subtitles strafe away from what's actually being said (so far it's been details) and some parts have even been cut off at the end. Hasn't this been playtested before release?The gameplay starts out well enough. Instead of having freedom over the 'map', you now are limited to moving your troops between buildings. Select a building, select what kinds of troops you want to move, and how many. (you can only pick between 100%, 50% and 25%. Literally)Depending on who owns the building, they'll either defend the building with their very lives or kill every hostile around before they take it over.As for structures, you have a few, such as the  Oil Rigs. These provide you with a constant supply of oil that fuel the creation of defensive structures and the usage of skills.Then you have the military buildings, that constantly spew out their assigned troop until they are at their maximum. You generally start out with a building that spawns Jetski riders (with guns) and eventually move on to the more heavier stuff. Such as boats and heavy boats.These military buildings, and these alone, also have five small building points around them, where you can building defensive structures. Generally, these are several types of turrets for several situations. You have your typical weaksauce one that can fire at anything, your Naval cannon that's stronger but only hits boats and is more appropriate for medium and heavy troops, and of course something that makes the air less safe.Yes, there are planes. But their only real difference is that they're a little bit weaker than a boat and aren't bound to any natural barriers present. Meaning you can think of a few 'daring' tactics.The game starts out nice, holding your hand a little bit in the first chapter. But as soon as you get into chapter 2, you'll start to feel like the game is dicking you over. There is a fog of war, yet the enemy AI seems to perfectly know whenever one of your structures is upgrading all it's turrets at once. (upgrading takes a little bit of time and renders it useless for the duration) I've seen enemy troops run past my structures just to get to the 'one' that was vulnerable. There's no sensible reason how it should have quickly known that.Not only that, but you always get the feeling that the enemy starts out with an army, while you still have to wait until yours is built. If you aren't placing your first spawns just right, you'll eventually end up with a few lost buildings in minutes.The game has potential, but the lack of anything to engage me in the story and the mediocre system doesn't compensate for the rageful moments you'll have to endure. And with every battle being presented almost immediatly after a victory, you never feel very rewarded either.Personally, I'd avoid this game unless you have the patience of a Saint.			"

												Very well presented game, and a fantastic showcase of the UNIGINE engine. I think it's one of the best-looking games I own. Unit-based gameplay similar to titles like Galcon, but in a much more richly realized world. Really high production values here.Gameplay suffers a few limitations (you can't change the destination of a squad once you send it, for example), but overall it works well. The music is suitable, and quite good too. The top-notch visuals, sound design, and cinematic battles really help to draw you in; this is definitely a fun one to sink some time into.			"

												A solid mix of real time strategy and a game called Galcon Fusion. The goal is to capture platforms. With these captured platforms you generate units and 'powers'. In the end the goal is to capture all (enemy) platforms by splitting up your forces (while also defending them, of course), and kill the remaining enemies depending on the mission.The graphics are amazing, but the voice acting is a bit stiff though. Give it a try, you might be surprised.[Rating: 75/100]			"

												On the surface this is a very simple RTS. Factories auto-produce units, there's not really any resource gathering (aside from capturing oil rigs), and you can only command your units to attack specific points rather than move freely about the map. Once you get into the thick of it, however, it's a fairly challenging game. You have to decide which points to leave units at to defend and which ones to leave basically defenseless (aside from fortifications) so that you can capture more points. In the later missions this becomes a nightmare but I enjoy the challenge. I still haven't finished it (I'm about two missions away from the end) but I've enjoyed the ride thus far. The voice acting and script is slightly terrible as it is all translation (I still don't understand why game dev's don't just hand their script over to a native English speaker to proofread before they record the voice actors) but as it only occurs before and after missions in most cases it doesn't really take away from the game.

												It´s a fantastic game but the control can improve (including compatibility with gamepad) but the method for play is very simplifed and easy. You don´t need to know english (I`m am from Spain) (developers you can traduce the game to spanish please??). For system requisites are low an if you have de minimum requisites you can play 1h (moreorlees) and later start to lagged but you go out 10 mins and you can play again.			"

												The premise of the game and the story are great, but the execution falls behind by a great deal. While the first missions are engaging and fun, the game becomes more and more repetitive. The AI is cheating most of the time very obviously and bad KI is tried to be hidden by giving the AI an overwhelming advantage at the start of each map. Multiplayer is also lacking.			"

												What makes this game so compelling isn't the plot (which is fairly stereotypical) or even the environment (which is quite beautiful despite the post-apocalyptic setting). It's the careful balance between a remarkably simple interface and complex strategy. Unlike other examples of this genre, you don't need to consider eight million factors when planning a move, or gather fifty kinds of resources, or examine ninety different stats. Instead, your concerns lie with your units and, of course, oil.Full review // http://www.honestgamers.com/10326/pc/oil-rush/review.html "

												Oil Rush isn't really a RTS, but one of those send troops to capture points kind of games like Galcon Fusion and Eufloria. Because of the graphics you will think it's a real RTS from the screenshots. It feels a bit like a trick. If you compare it to similar games like Galcon Fusion and Eufloria it isn't great either. Capture points have a rather small unit cap that doesn't fit the type of game. You are better of playing one of the similar games.			"

												Ahem, OIL, mmmmYEEESsssss. We've GOT to have more OIL!           -The Boss-Man.This game takes what might be a neat premise for a book, and turns it into a mind-bogglingly simplistic throw your things at their things until you have more things than they do simulator RTS with a protagonist who seems to have been given a copy of 'Ten habits of highly succesful people' and eaten the book-glue. Mister I-can't-believe it's-not-margarine gets sent by General baldy-bald on a series of tactical missions to obtain the immensely-valuable unobtanium oil, at whatever the cost! Cue spunky damsel, lots of anti-imperialist political tripe, and you pretty much get the plot. The gameplay is pretty dry. The usual RTS-staples are watered-down to the point where unit construction is automated based on the buildings you control, and your main interest is in snowballing up your starting choices by constantly flicking your giant death-ball at the enemy facilities. There are hotkeys, but when an amalogous death-ball is the most reliable way to go you rarely use them. There's only one resource of any value, and it's Oil. can you guess what it is? The tech tree is the most irrelevant of 5% bonuses to stats your 'throw a big ball of stuff where it hurts' strategy couldn't care less for. Add onto this the fact that your camera seems to be stuck to the bottom of a bloated pelican and the fact that one of your missions is to escort a ♥♥♥♥ing balloon, and you're looking at a pretty washed-up variant of an already-diluted genre that ultimately fails to pass muster float my boat. Water puns.Which makes me wonder how its art (which gives us those snazzy screenshots) got the production value it did, considering that neither the level-design nor voice-acting nor marketing nor beta-testing are really worth half a salty biscuit damn. Someone must have really loved oil rigs, then thought 'let's make a game about that'.Also, will someone please tell the ♥♥♥♥wit who drew up the achievements that the '@' symbol does not mean 'and'?

												It's not bad at all, but there are a few gripes I have with this game. First and foremost, it really bothers me that sometimes what the characters are saying don't match up with the subtitles at all. Also, some of the voice acting is pretty bad, especially from Firefly. Also, controlling and managing your fleet can be a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥sometimes. Other than that, the game's not terrible, the tower defense missions were the most fun, even though there are only 2 of them in the main campaign. I enjoyed it, but it's not incredibly lengthy and the story isn't too great either.I would recommend this game only if the control was better and the price wasn't so high.			"

												Oil Rush is boring. At least that is the sense I had from playing it. While the setting is novel and the gameplay unique (and the graphics pretty!) I never felt like I was amassing my forces or making any impact on the game's AI enemies. You don't control your forces directly; rather, you amass them, decide on group composition and then send them into the fray or have them guard your bases. Cool concept, but it takes some of the fun out of it even though you can zoom in on the action and see lots of great details.After spending roughly half an hour on one level watching the balance of power go back and forth and realizing I wasn't doing very much to change it myself, I decided there was little here to keep me interested.While I give the game high marks for its world building, of a water covered post apocalyptic dystopia, the gameplay's strategy didn't have any appeal to me. There may be some armchair generals who appreciate this kind of tactical challenge that approaches more real world conditions, but it's not for me.			"

												Oh how long I had waited to get this game... The anticipation.... The excitement... The total disappointment.Ok, seriously... On how many ""Strategy"" games do you have 0 control over your units? Sure, you can tell a location to send all, some or a particular type of unit to go somewhere, but that's where your control ends. You cannot develop tactics on which unit should attack what, you cannot tell a certain number of units within a group (going to or coming from somewhere for example) to go to a separate location (you have to either recall the units or wait unit they reach their destination). This lack of control, while it may seem not so important at first, is where this game fails imo. Most of the time, your units end up being shredded because they focused their attack on the wrong unit or structure (i.e. defences).Oh, and the voice acting... Oh God, the voice acting... It's so monotonous, it sounds like a computer is doing it. No life, no feel, no reality... If they did hire people to do the voice acting, they either paid so little that the actors wanted to punish the devs by their poor performance, or they hired total amatuers for it. None of the voices sounded like they were in character: they were just reading off the script. Oh, and the script was either changed later on or the actors decided to go as they please because the subs (that appear automatically btw) are different than what they actually say (about 40 percent of the time).The only good things I can say are that the soundtracks were not so bad actually, and the graphics are appealing...All in all, not recommended.

												Standard top down RTS control of troop producing areas minus the micro-managingment. Gain oil platforms to increase your income, and get troop platforms to increase troop production. Platforms will produce on thier own once you control them. There's different kinds of troops, like small jetskis, medium boats, planes, and even a blimp, all with different abilities. You can upgrade your platform's defense, as well as apply realtime modifiers to select platforms, like increasing production rate for a short time. Good praphics, old school RTS feel.The only major critique I have is that pretty much everything important takes place on the mini-map, while the actual view of the war theater is kind of just for show, so the mini-map should really be most of the screen and the 3D view could be in a smaller window.

												Gameplay-wise, Oil Rush is a strange mixture of a real-time strategy game that does not require micro management of units (the ""attack part"") and a tower defense game (the ""defense part"") that does not provide enough feedback on enemy movements and troops encountered to be effective. This results in a product consisting of two parts that don't intertwine well and that leave the impression of a lack of gameplay development focus.			"

												Imagine any grid turn-based strategy game, but forcefully made into an real time strategy game. This is what Oil Rush attempts to do.Combat consist of moving units from one node to another. You can not redirect your units to another node if they have already been issued an order. You can however, cancel an order, but they can not be issued another order until they return to the node they came from.All unit production are automated, you can not tell any single structure to stop building. So, you are more or less forcefully fed units that does not go over your maximum unit supply limit.The campaign story is composed of predictable plot, with bland characters, and filled with stereotypes.The whole game just screams turn-based for me, rather than a real time strategy game. There aren't too many moments were you have to react to immediately, and very few micro-management of units or actions. You can't tell a weak unit to retreat, you can't tell a repair ship to prioritize repair, you're more less just hoping the AI will do its job. Most of the time I'm just positioning my units to just either ride the momentum of an assault, or just allotting the units between defense locations as I see the enemy units slowly crawl across the ocean.If you do like this game, I would suggest playing Eufloria instead. The controls there is much more refined.			"

I suppose, it's very simple, and I get my kicks off of watching AI fight eachother so, this came is pretty okay to me.Infact, in my books, if a game has a spectator mode so I don't have to fight at all, I give it more points.It's a very simple RTS, no micro, and not much macro either.Maybe get it if you have a friend who isn't good at RTS but wants to be, or, maybe  if you're a parent, you can pick it up for your kid. It's a very simple game.For the price I paid for it, I like it.But for 10 bucks?Nah.			"

												This is essentially a fancy tech demo of an incredibly basic game. In fact, I'd go as far as to say this is just Galcon in fancy clothes.While the graphics are certainly impressive, and it makes me wonder why more games don't use the Unigine engine, the gameplay is flat-out boring. Anyone that knows me knows that I'm far from a big fan of strategy games. For that matter, if I'm going to play a strategy game, it has to have a little more meat to it than simply choosing whether to send 25%, 50%, or 100% of my troops to a certain waypoint. You may enjoy it, and it's certainly a valiant effort for an indie game, but it's just not for me.ps the ""tutorial"" goes on entirely too long, and makes a point of being intentionally too rough at first, to try and teach you what not to do.Pass.

												After playing starcraft this feels like you have no control. The units move very slow and the strategy is simplistic. Just make sure you have some units around each base so they don't take it behind you. I just moved from one point to the next with plenty of units to take the node. If you don't have enough just wait and then send more over. Maybe I was supposed to send units to the nodes behind the enemy lines but it seemed like all the nodes were equally covered.The voice acting is not great and it doesn't match up with what is on the screen. The UI leaves a lot to be desired because you it allows you to take 25%, 50%, or 100% of the selected units but it feels kind of clunky. The upgrade tree is also very basic and I didn't seem to need any of the abilities to win.I applaud the effort but it's really missing the polish.			"

												At the start of the game if you just jump right into a quick match against the computer AI, you don't really know what to do. You can't highlight (like in most RTS games) over your vehicles/fleet that you control, it's mostly a right click RTS game (via the mini-map). You right click to send your vehicles somewhere to take over a base, production line, etc then you right click again to move them to a different area. You can of course put these vehicles into groups so that you can control them better, but that is still hard to do when you can't highlight over the vehicles as I stated. Once you get past the whole right click, the game is actually fun to play.Gameplay/graphics wise, the game runs and looks great for a 2012 published game. For those who want more out of the game, there is a single player campaign in which you can dive deeper in the storyline (which I haven't). If you play a quick match against the AI in gamemodes like Sabotage, the computer will always have nukes. The nuke has a huge blast radius in which it can destroy your whole fleet of vehicles if it's in that area (even out of the red circle vehicles can get damaged). Having the AI with the nuke 24/7 makes the gamemodes kinda boring, but more or less kinda intense since you always have to predict where the AI will put the nuke down. If you have enough skill points, you as well can get the skill trait of using nuke but that will take some time.For $8, it's a fun game to waste time.			"

												At the start of the game if you just jump right into a quick match against the computer AI, you don't really know what to do. You can't highlight (like in most RTS games) over your vehicles/fleet that you control, it's mostly a right click RTS game (via the mini-map). You right click to send your vehicles somewhere to take over a base, production line, etc then you right click again to move them to a different area. You can of course put these vehicles into groups so that you can control them better, but that is still hard to do when you can't highlight over the vehicles as I stated. Once you get past the whole right click, the game is actually fun to play.Gameplay/graphics wise, the game runs and looks great for a 2012 published game. For those who want more out of the game, there is a single player campaign in which you can dive deeper in the storyline (which I haven't). If you play a quick match against the AI in gamemodes like Sabotage, the computer will always have nukes. The nuke has a huge blast radius in which it can destroy your whole fleet of vehicles if it's in that area (even out of the red circle vehicles can get damaged). Having the AI with the nuke 24/7 makes the gamemodes kinda boring, but more or less kinda intense since you always have to predict where the AI will put the nuke down. If you have enough skill points, you as well can get the skill trait of using nuke but that will take some time.For $8, it's a fun game to waste time.			"

												Now, we're on a bit of a dry spell with real time strategy games, and I totally see why - it's a genre that requires refinement. I'm more than willing to give unrefined games a pass, because at times they are hidden gems with interesting mechanics (Submarine Titans come to mind) but this one is simply awful. The only thing it has going for it is beautiful water physics. Otherwise there's barely any strategy involved, it's like Euphloria with less nodes. Euphloria gives a pass with its abstraction, but Oil Rush on the other hand is simply infuriating for every RTS game fan out there. ""Why can't I click on this boat and move it out of the fire? Why won't you let me micro my units, game?"" Pass. 3/10			"

During the kyboard control tutorial of a very steep learning curve to figure out the comands the game kills you so that you can not complete the tutorial. You have no control over what you build or fight just follow the instructions and it kills you while you are reading what you are suposed to be doing. Dev's, This should never happen.			"

												I really wish there was an ""indifferent"" button.  Oil Rush is a RTS with a twist, or I suppose ""a circle""  is more like it.   It's a thought out system that just feels a little clunky, and that's the issue. You don't just build units and send them to stations.   You build units, then use the buttons on top to send particular pergentages of them to stations.  Unit types are of the Rock, Paper, Scissors variety,  and once you get the pattern down the game becomes very easy.  And not a fun sorta easy,  a tedious sorta easy that just never gets any better.

												It's a strategy game where you can't pick which units to deploy, you can't construct buildings and you can't command your fleet. The update tree is basic (+armor, +damage, a handful of active skills very easy to use).It tries to throw some twists in the map objectives and the maps themselves are alright, although often plain and empty.It's more of a ""cell"" game than anything else, à la Nano War or Phage Wars.

												I played this game a long time ago and hated it.  BUT, I saw I had a couple achievements left, and not being one to leave things half-done, I decided to give it another try.This game can get ♥♥♥♥ed.Just abysmal.  Jesus, not even enjoyably bad.  Like if this game was laughable, it'd have at least that, but it doesn't.  I remembered why I abandoned it years ago.Ok so what even is it?  It's like......regular 2D strategy mixed with tower defense......except terrible.  Yeah, that's basically it.  I mean, you barely control your units, and they can only stay around platforms so you can't move them freely around the map to....you know, BE STRATEGIC.  You can capture and fortify a line of platforms, but since units can freely travel to any platform at any time, there's nothing stopping enemy units from bypassing straight to your undefended ones.Oh by the way, the enemy AI is straight-up omniscient.  It will unabashedly send units to capture your platform the second your units leave.During the campaign, if you capture all the platforms on the map, enemy units will continously spawn outside the map.  That's fair, right?Gameplay is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ but the real cherry on top is the voice acting.  You don't know what bad voice acting is until you play this game.  Don't take my word for it: https://youtu.be/q3CYUO19uyc?t=16m10sHalfway through the campaign, they introduce a Chinese character, and his voice acting is so bad, it's actually racist.Visuals are A+ tho.Don't buy this.

												DO not get this game. Its a limited game, thats worse than Command and Conquers. You dont get to choose where to build anything, you simply click a building alraedy there and spam units, so there really is no ""strategy"" in this game. Then again, I dont know to much about the game seeing as how I cant get past Level 2 due to the fact that the game goes into window mode by itself, then forces  me to save and close it, where-by my save file is not there anymore.... Game is riddled with bugs, glitches, and a crappy setup all together.Edit: As of 1/11/2014 The game is still a spamtastic pile. However they did fix the bugs. However again, the game is still a pile of crap. The balance as a whole from mission to mission is just absuredly terrible. You'll go from beating a mission no problem on Normal difficulty to being unable to beat a mission on Easy. The AI ""cheats"" on a serious level as well from Chapters 2-2 and on, you'll find yourself going up against countless waves of enemies being spawned off the map, while the AI still has the same production if not more, than you. This isn't light ""reinforcements"" either, this is full time lines of non stop waves. You'll barely get time to make an offensive yourself even on easy. To add insult to injury on this, the AI cheats in other ways as well. It doesn't get Fog of War like the player, the second you call your boats away from a structure, the AI will launch simultanious attacks on that 1 structure. Causing you to call back ships to defend it, and crippling your attack again. The Game-play over all is extremely stale as it's more or less ships on a rail. You spawn them from structures where as they just sit there, until you tell them to attack an enemy structure.. In which case they make their own path to the structure to attack it. Pretty much like having Boats on train rails.			"

												Oil Rush is a very easy game to pick up and play for amateur strategy game players. The user interface and controls are very simple (you could probably play it on a mobile operating system). This may take away from the experience for some players, or alternatively, allow players to focus more on the strategy component of the game without the headache of overcomplicated gaming mechanics. Worth your buck if you like this type of stuff.			"

												A fantastic little indie title, I'd be hesitant to call it a strategy game, but more of an action strategy. I struggled at first, before I realised I was unconsciously adopting turtling tactics, which really don't work here. Of course, the clue's in the name, you have to push for territory from the start, which makes it a heavily action packed game. The campaign keeps you on your toes, by throwing the occasional pursuit map in, along with a couple of tower defence scenarios that are executed very well.The only real downside is the occasional quality issue, such as characters' dialogue sometimes being cut off, and the tech tree has one entry which incorrectly describes what it does.For me, it's most reminiscent of Sins of a Solar Empire, in terms of style and I'm sure fans of that franchise would find it as enjoyable as I did.All in all, it's an excellent game and I certainly hope there's a sequel!P.S. Bonus points for quoting Serenity. :D			"

Quote:“Oil see you in hell!!!”Discovery:Like a chess game where both players move at the same time, you learn more about movement, weaknesses, strengths and the like in beating your opponents in the battlefield.Intro:Best described as an unpolished gem, this strategy outing is rough around the edges but still manages to give you tough and enjoyable complex challenges.Good/Bad:It is hard to give the game a better score when all the common tropes are in place and taunting you with the bad voice acting. The plot is predictable, the characters are mind-numbingly simple, and the campaign ended too soon, for me (13 hours). Even the cut-scenes themselves were hard to enjoy because it was either skipped because I accidentally clicked during it or it was out of sync for whatever reason. Also, multiplayer is dead so don’t even bother. But even with all of these bad elements, it didn’t stop the single-player experience from being insanely challenging and fun!Strategy was the name of the genre and it definitely filled my cup. The naval units make sense and the upgrades truly matter in each stage you traverse. And let’s not forget the graphics which are amazing by the way. You can watch everything any direction you want and if you are feeling edgy, you can watch your battles in a cinematic-follow mode, all in your glorious PC rig graphics!Summary:Don’t mind the plot and just ignore the voice acting. Focus on the game mechanics and you will enjoy every minute spent.Worth: I recommend to buy it during a sale.Last Thoughts: That voice acting though…			"
