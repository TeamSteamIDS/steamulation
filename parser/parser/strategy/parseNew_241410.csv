												CastleStorm took be by surprise. If you ever played Swords & Soldiers, Angry Birds and any other tower defense game - and enjoyed them - CastleStorm is the game for you.What it basically comes down to, if you haven't played any of those games, is this: You're the good guy, you own the castle on the left (or right, depending on the mission). Your opponent owns the other, opposite, castle. You both own a ballista that can shoot about 9 or so different ammo types. The goal is usually to destroy the other castle. This can be done by shooting projectiles at it. Damage it enough and the physics will take over, destroying rooms in the process. These rooms are filled with troops, by the way. Destroy a room with a specific troop and your enemy can't summon those anymore.Troops can be send to help destroy the castle gate, after which they can then steal the flag. Capturing and returning a flag also results in victory. You can also send your troops to just distract your enemy.You also own a hero that can be spawned on the battlefield to slay the troops of your enemy. You can summon them for about 20 seconds; after that they disappear and you have to wait a certain amount of time before you can summon them again.Missions have secondary objectives, keeping the missions fun and varied, while also giving them replayability.Of course, a tower defense game isn't a tower defense game without upgrades. Thankfully, there are plenty of things to upgrade; projectiles, troops, heroes, spells, your castle, you name it.The sounds are funny and the textures are beautifully sharp and detailed. It's a gorgeous looking game, in its own way, of course. You can't compare it to, let's say, Crysis (obviously). That would just be silly... ...Like I said CastleStorm took me by surprise. It's been a long time since I had so much mindless fun with a game ♥[Rating: 85/100]			"

												Kind of like Swords & Soldiers (or other 2D lane pushers) but actually good. Pump out troops, cast spells, load the ballista with weird ammo and assume direct control of heroes to wipe the battlefield. The best bit is the artillery, lob stones to smash enemy spires to loose parts which then will hopefully crush the enemy army as they are leaving their castle. There are four factions (with DLC) with different troops/spells/artillery. You can either try to storm the enemy castle with troops, stealing their flag and bringing it home in a tug of war, or you can just simply smash the enemy castle with boulders until there's nothing left. It's just fun and the physics are meaty enough, who wouldn't enjoy breaking things? Lots of opportunity for amazing skillshots or stupid accidents when your ballista hits your own troops. You can also design your own castle, the room choices affect your troop loadout and bonuses.The four singleplayer campaigns were good enough, but when you enter multiplayer the game commits suicide. Local splitscreen can only be done in tiny windows, leaving lots of the screen unused and black. It was probably to preserve the FOV ratio but the end result is completely unappealing. Online multiplayer then is tied to playing ranked matchmaking, if you want to customize and upgrade your loadout playing with just friends doesn't earn you anything. I don't know why they went this way, did they expect to turn this into e-sports? Multiplayer seems quite dead even during sales...All in all a very enjoyable time, for some reason I'd compare it with Orcs Must Die even though it's a different type of defense game. The art, humour and design is somehow similar and very polished. There's a nice pile of content and game modes in the complete pack for singleplayer, however if you're interested only in multiplayer I'd say skip it and get something like King Arthur's Gold instead.

												Thumbs SIDEWAYS... the single player campaign is a fun mashup between a tug-of-war, tower defense, and scroller rpg. You play to ear credits to level up skills and can even build your own castle. Eventually you get all stars on all maps, and all skills, and you are still left with an onsluaght-style game which is chaotic and challenging. Single player? Thumbs Up!Multiplayer however, is a seriously broken, unfun joke. You are given 20k credits. Once you spend them, they are gone - you cannot gain new skills, you cannot reset your 20k to buy different items... EVER.  Playing against friends? You gain no credits, so theres no reason to play with them.The only way to get new credits is to play ""ranked"" matches which pit you randomly against other players (level 1 vs level 100 anyone?)- and in ranked matches you cannot even choose your opponents, so forget about ever playing with friends.Multiplayer is horribly designed and very broken, slow and utterly fail, and unless you get this game at a steep discount, or dont mind playing by yourself, I'd say ""avoid"" "

												Started to play this game and thought ""Ok its alright but not that good"",played it some more and ""THEN"" i changed my mind.This game is deceptively easy when you start and then just gets harder,if you dont upgrade your units and your castle then facing off against some of the later enemies and challenges is futile you will lose and lose again until you upgrade the units and also the castle you have chosen.The graphics are really nice and suit this game to the ground (some of the cutscenes are like watching a cartoon),the sound and music is also really good and suits this style of game.The balance of gameplay is really thought out and like i have said you either upgrade the units and other things you have (like i have said) or you will be stuck on the level you are for some time.You do have to grind a bit at times to beat some levels and challenges (DAMN TROLL) but when you do you feel like you have acomplished something and then the next challenge awaits you.When i finished the main game i was like ""AW IS THAT IT I WANT MORE"" so i went straight and bought the DLCs and again wasent dissapointed,its more of the same which in this case is certainly a good thing.Lets hope that they make a sequel soon and that it is as good as this game if not better.

												I like this game. I've been addicted by it straight away from the beginning. It's sometimes rare for a game that you start it and you don't want to quit it already after 10 minutes, because there is just something taken away your motivation. Actually, I would say that more than half of my library gives me this feeling not to continue playing after some minutes. But CastleStorm just does everything right you would expect from such an angry birds, Ballerburg, etc. mix. You can level up, the design is pretty, a lot of levels, you improve your skills, your tactics, etc... okay, the story part is redundant, but does not bother you further as you can easily skip it. So it is not annoying. I got the game for 5 EUR and I simply say, it has been the best 5 EUR I spent on this winter sale. I give it clearly 8 / 10 points and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys simple games with great ideas.			"

If you like games like the Worms series, or Swords & Soldiers or any kind of tower defense games, take a look at this masterpiece!Even my wife loves it and she's losing her feeling for time on a regular basis with this game.Singleplayer has four campaigns and it's not just ""destroy the enemy castle"". There is surprisingly a high variety of different mission types.Give it a try, it's worth your time and money!			"

												I still remember how few years ago 2D lane pushers appeared in form of free Flash browser games and got relatively popular. (If you don't know what I'm talking about - you fight opponent's fortress by spawning minions that want to do the hard work.) Zen Studios took this formula but added more to it, to make a great mashup of well-known subgenres. You don't just spawn minions to attack the enemy's castle, you also control the ballista of your castle to kill enemy minions, or to destroy the opponent's castle in Angry Birds style. But that's still not enough, your hero can also get off the ballista and go into fight himself. CastleStorm is a great combination that won't give you a rest, you'll still have something to do.So, it's always a fight between castles with last man standing, is that all? Definitely not, there are many objectives that will lead you to victory - behind every castle's gate is a flag that will also achieve you a victory if your army takes it to you. In other levels, you have to protect yourself against waves of enemies, or you just have to hunt wolves (or deadly bosses). There are always two specific objectives for each level - one mandatory, one voluntary being usually something like ""spawn swordsmen a lot"" or ""destroy enemy castle in three minutes"".The story revolves around a war between knights and vikings but there's nothing to be taken seriously since every cutscene have a gag prepared for you. That, with combination of nice graphics and sounds, make overall good comedy mood between the battles.The fact that you use ballista to attack the enemy doesn't mean that you would just have to stick with big arrows. There are plenty of ammunition types to choose from, each upgradable! That applies also for your army and magic skills of your hero. Members of your army and passive bonuses are decided by rooms in your castle which you'll build yourself. Of course, you can use a pre-made castle, but it feels great to build your own, with your personal selection of rooms for the best strategy.Conclusion:CastleStorm offers good amount of levels to keep you entertained for hours, especially if you will try to beat all optional level objectives and finish side quests. The gameplay keeps being dynamic, as you'll have to switch between ballista, your hero, and control of your barracks (to spawn your minions). There are also two DLCs which add even more levels. CastleStorm is worth buying.			"

												My thoughts on Castlestorm:You'll be playing the good guy knight who's charged with the heroic task to defend the king's castle from the evil attackers. To do so, you're given four tools: an army, a ballista, yourself and the castle.Let's start with the castle editor. You'll be given a set of pre-made castles that you can use or edit, but you can also build your own castle from scratch. To do so, you have several rooms, each representing a certain kind of soldier or creature that may only be used in battle if its room has been built into your castle. More rooms are unlocked throughout the campaign, and you'll have some sctructures for visual und defensive purposes.During the campaign (or multiplayer) you can now use all those units whose room you've added to your building to fend off enemy units. The are knights, archers, birds and dragons, rock giants and other cool stuff to throw at your enemies gates. The stronger the unit the more expensive it is, so summoning the right amount of them and the right composition is crucial.Speaking of throwing: Your ballista does not only shoot arrows but can also be equipped with rocks to damage the enemy castle, rainbow farting sheeps, exploding apples and several other things to defend your gates. At some point I felt like the ballista was too strong of a weapon because if used correctly it can kill some of the most expensive units by itself.If things get harsh you can summon one of several heroes onto the battlefield, controlled by yourself, to slash through the enemy troops. After a certain amount time or once your hero dies you'll be back to shooting the ballista and summoning units.The game is won/lost, once an army has managed to either break into the opposing gate and steal the flag, or a castle has been destroyed to the point where no room is left and thus no units can be summoned anymore.Throughout the campaign you'll have some limitations, like you'll only be able to use the ballista, or you may only use soldiers, but that's as far as variety goes. There are some levels with a special boss, and some where you have to fulfill a certain task, but that's it.Each level gives you gold depending on how well you perform, and you'll get some extra gold if you could complete a challence like never miss an arrow, let the flag steal by a certain kind of unit and so on.Most of the time, there is nothing special though. What makes the game so addicting is the joy of hitting a headshot with your arrows, the fun dialogues between the levels and the several unlocks like new rooms or even a new race (is exactly the same but looks different).Graphics are good and so is the music. Okay game for killing some time, not good if you plan on playing it for more than two hours at once because most missions feel the same.Buy it when on sale!			"

												When it comes to fun, pick-up-and-play games that keep you coming back for just one more go, Zen (the devs responsible for this game and Pinball FX2) really have got it sussed. By keeping the gameplay simple and fun and injecting a good amount of humour, Zen have turned what is a very basic game that plays similarly to Angry Birds into a great title that keeps the player interested throughout. A great game worthy of your money.			"

												A hybrid of castle defence and Angry Birds, and they mix really well. You get to send your army to capture the flag or even destroy the enemy's castle to win the match or round. Different items, castle layouts (you can even build your own, but it takes a bit of a learning process), and upgrades will be available to better suit strategies towards victory against the Vikings. (Let me axe you something!)The pinball equivalent on FX 2 is really good as well.			"

												I bought this game in the Weekly Humble Bundle not being aware of what the game is actually about.This game is a Worms-like real-time strategy tower defense, which brings u the kindness look of the worms series, with a 2D non-roundbased fightingsystem.After a brief introduction into the story of the game, its very easy to get into the flow of the first stages. You'll start defending your castle against a couple of bandits, that are real easy to handle.You'll learn all skills of your heroes, including different kinds of projectiles, moving out troops and even teleporting yourself onto the battleground while swinging your sword and using your bow.Moving further on, you'll be defending your castle against wolves, vikings and other shady characters.If u like the worms-series and are a fan of medieval games, you should defnitely purchase this game, even for 10 bucks, it's a great experience and very challenging in the later stages of the game.

Protect your castle, bolster the moral of your troops, oh and would someone please make sure there are enough privies. ;)All in all it is an entertaining game, one that you can pick up quickly. It does take some practice to get the best score, or fulfill the bonus achievements, but it's worth it. The game has an online high score table so that you can go head to head against your friends and see who gets the highest score.Back I go to try my hand at the next challenge, as long as my swordsmen stop jumping in front of my arrows at least.  :)			"

												11/10.  A fat friar asked me to polish his ""ballista"" with dragon excrement.Seriously, the only complaint I have about this game is that you pretty much have to complete the campaign to be viable in multiplayer.  This is because you unlock most of your weapons / troops / etc by playing campaign mode. If you watch TotalBiscuit's review of the game, he agrees that this is one of the main ""aggravations"" of the game.Overall the game is fun, but be prepared to spend 4-5 hours beating the campaign before stepping in to demolish your friends.  The campaign itself is written well, with a load of hillarious cut-scenes, and fun missions that give you a different obstacle to overcome each time (use different weapons, use only troops, etc).  The mix of gameplay is something pretty new to me.  At it's heart it is a castle-defense game, but it has parts where you'll be playing a hack-and-slash platformer too.  And during heated battles, it begins to feel more like an RTS than anything else.Here's hoping more people pick this game up, as the multiplayer is sort of under-attended and very under-rated at the moment.I look forward to playing vs you in the future.  Now, go buy this hidden gem.			"

												Pros:-Combines tower-shooter, 3rd party RPG, troop deployment/management, and does all three rather well.-Build and defend a castle while attacking the other, at the same time the enemy is doing the same.  Customize your castle.-Most quests can be won either by castle destruction or flag capturing.-Support your troops by firing on the enemy troops instead of the castle, juggling priorities on the fly.-Multiplayer; online, local, vs xbox, and in several different modes.-9 upgradable troop types, spells, rooms, and shots each.-Good music, good graphics.-Funny-as-hell comments from troops in-game.  also, the cutscenes are quite funny as well.-Full-Story plot.  The ending of the main plot is as epic as any viking tale and fits well with the DLC.-Campaign is split; 1st half is knights, 2nd half is vikings, so you get to know and love both sides.-Each DLC provides one additional campaign to add on to the end of the main campaign.  Each campaign giving a upgraded version of either the knight-side or the viking-side.-DLC campaigns have more focus on the hero and add more depth and closure to the main story line.-Moderate replay value.Cons:-Moderate voicing.  Not bad, but it's not full-speech animation.-DLC shot types are overpowered, particularly the Viking Elite.  Makes for rather unbalanced play.-Difficulty is a little low.....  Easy = Let my 5-year old play, Normal = Easy, Hard = Normal.-If you barrel through it, it's rather short.All this said:Good game for the price, even if you dont catch it on sale.I can see this being a ROCKING multiplayer game in VS mode.... if you can find anyone who knows the game exists.  I can see it doing very well on gaming-systems for this reason.Great game and type-combination but it needs an online community.... badly.			"

PROS:+ nice UI+ cool art style+ lots of levels in 2 campaigns (even more with the 2 DLCs)+ fun & easy gameplay+ tons of units, powers & projectiles+ nice story in campaign mode (and in both DLCs)CONS:- the multiplayer is almost non-existent- wobbly difficulty curve for levels- frikkin' turkey levels- some useless powers/projectilesComment:Got this game when I received a coupon for a discount. I knew nothing about it except that the art style looked nice. After several months I finally decided to install and play it ... and it was LOADS of fun. It clearly looks and feels like a port from a mobile version but for this genre it does not matter at all. The gameplay is sold and consists of level missions, usually knocking the enemy castle down or taking their flag. But there are some other mission too. Right off the bat I can tell you to play on Hard if you want to play the game as it should be played. Because if you want 5 stars for each level you gotta finish it on Hard. I personally really liked the story of the campaigns in both the main game and the DLCs. The problem with this game is that the mulitplayer is dead, the skrimish with AI is lackluster and there is nothing else after you finish the campaigns. So no real replayability. However it is a fantastic game that maybe won't be in your memories for a long time but it is fun to play. Also worth mentioning is that to get the 3 MP achievements you gotta find a friend to help you out. Overall I recommend this game!			"

												This game is a total blast to play. I don't even know how to describe it, except that it involves elements of side-scrollers, hack and slash, arcade shooters, tower defense and Angry Birds -- and somehow that all works together in a pretty addictive and playable game. The graphics are really colorful and well-done, and the interface is pretty smooth once you get the hang of all the things that are going on and switching around between the different modes (ballista, hero, troops, etc.). The story is one of those ""so cheesy it's awesome"" sort of things, but it's the gameplay that will keep you coming back for more.Loads of fun, totally recommend it.  Would love to try multiplayer because I bet it's just ridiculously funny to play with friends.			"

												Got it for the multiplayer. Multiplayer kinda.. sucks? To explain, Survival modes are both incredibly bare bones. You cannot make your own castle first off. Having to rely on presets in order to do anything. Secondly, enemies upgrade after every wave, but you can not upgrade anything during a match. In fact, you can't even upgrade AFTER a match either. You have to close out a match entirely, make a NEW one, so that you can now spend your gold to upgrade things. Then you have to invite your friend back to play with you.. But wait! Its not that simple. If they want to upgrade their hero, they have to do it seperately as well. Gameplay wise, the survival mode doesn't have anything honestly. Its just wave after wave of units slowly matching out of spawn to attack your base. Each wave has enemies getting stronger, but you staying the same. So much so that using units for anything but flag retrieval is pointless. Hero Survival is basically the same, cept without the base to defend. Heroes are pretty bland, with only the norse chars even having a different special attack, and it all feels like the blandest beat em up you could ever hope to play.Haven't tried the single player yet, but if you buy this to play with friends, I'd definitely give this a pass.

												This game deserves a 9.5/10 in my opinionTLDR; This game took me by surprise, it was so addictive that I spent 2 days straight completing the campaign. This game is a combination of many other games such as angry birds, army of darkness, Age of War and tower defense games. I would highly recommend this game if you have a couple of days to spare and have nothing to do.Gameplay The campaign was satisfyingly long and does not feel draggy at all since most of the mission has a different and unique objective. Coupled with the DLCs, this game will give you a solid entertainment for a couple of days. The storyline was very interesting and the characters are all very lovable. The substantial amount of humour in the dialogue was very entertaining. Besides shooting catapults trying to destroy the enemy's castle, you can spawn heroes which you can control on the battlefield. You can also spawn a variety of soldiers to aid you in the battle. Multiplayer support so you can play with your friends after you have beaten the campaign. However, there are not many online players at the moment. So you have to get a friend to play it with you.Music When I was playing this game, I heard a very familiar music on the background. As I went to research, in turns out that the music was composed by the same artist that created the music for the flash game Age of War. The music was indeed a remastered version of the Age of War theme music. I used to play that game alot during high school and I delighted to hear that music again in this game. The other music was very fitting to the game and its quirky characters. Although it does get repetitive sometimes, but it is not really a problem. "

												This is a very decent little game that looks like it's suited to mobile platforms, but has far more depth than that.Castlestorm is a mix of real-time tower defense and sidescrolling hack'n'slash, but the former is much more prominent when you actually play the game. The gist of it is that you need to prevent enemies from walloping down your castle gates and taking your flag back to their own castle - everything is on a 2D plane, a straight left/right path. You can do this in multiple, often very creative ways - but the three staples are using your castle ballista to shoot enemies manually, sending out your own soldiers to die valiantly in the line of duty, and controlling your own powerful general out on the battlefield. While the latter is fun, the castle projectile system is what you'll be using the majority of the time.You'll be using your array of projectiles to deliver more headshots than Liebovitz, but it isn't just limited to bog-standard ballistas. Yes, you can fire a potion to turn that enemy griffin into a harmless turkey, and yes you can shower that viking brute with a barrage of kitchen utensils. The options are surprisingly varied and most of them have their uses, with different factions having differing projectiles available. You unlock these, the soldier classes and other spells/buffs by accumulating gold throughout the campaign and skirmishes, which are then used to upgrade your wares. These also include castle rooms - ballistas can fire at the opposing castle as well as enemy units, and if a room in the castle is destroyed, then whatever benefit it gave to your forces is immediately gone. This can include your army, of course...The campaign is a good length, and the missions are reasonably varied although it might get slightly wearing towards the end. I would say that the DLC is worth it if you enjoy the game, as it's pretty cheap but opens up two new campaigns and factions to play around with. The story is pretty standard questing fare, although it plays around with tropes in good humour. Multiplayer is almost completely dead, so count on a single player experience only.On the whole, Castlestorm is a good game that defies expectations. It looks like a kiddy iOS game, but actually gets quite difficult at points and utilises its own game mechanics well. I'd recommend it to most people who fancy a somewhat casual 2D tower defense. Also, Freia is awesome.'They've smashed ah rhume in yer cah-sull!'			"

												Castlestorm is a very fun game well worth your money. I picked it up for $3.39 and wouldn't regret spending $10. Many people compare it to Angry Birds but don't let that turn you off, this game is more interesting, fun, and worth your time. The story is pretty silly and so are the cutscenes and I personally enjoy both. You can skip them if you'd like, however.As you progress through the story you earn all sorts of weapons, troops, and spells. You decide how you want to play by leveling whatever you choose and editing your castle how you see fit.I was surprised to find my laptop run this game so well since it typically cannot run games that look as good as this.

												It's hard for me to place this game into a genre. Parts tower defense, strategy, RPG and action. This game strives to achieve a hefty goal. I can say it achieve that goal on many levels. Despite the story and what some may consider short campaign mode, this game offers plenty. There are many modes to it, the art style is very eye catching and the humor kept me in. I loved that you could upgrade magic, projectiles, soldier types and the castle itself (It isn't ""CastleStorm"" for nothing). The balancing one has to do to achieve their own gameplay style is unique with the castle building. I won't go into detail, but it is a nice and fresh take on it.*If I could make any improvements, longer campaign, more variety in soldiers or at least a 3rd faction.All in all, I found this game a wonderful time had. Glad I purchased it. I needed a fix like this that I didn't know I wanted.** They may have added some in the DLC for the game, which is very cheap and probably worth it, but I had not purchased it as of this review, I wanted to review what I had played.

												CastleStorm is a rather fun mix of a 2D lane pusher and Angry Birds.The core gameplay is quite enjoyable. In most missions your goal is to either capture enemy flag with your troops or completely destroy their castle with your ballista. The campaign does like to mix things up however, and many of the missions have special victory conditions or restrict the tools available to you.While on the whole I enjoyed the campaign, there were a few annoyances. First of all, controlling heroes is rather clunky. This can be especially frustrating in the few missions where you are stuck just controlling the hero.I wasn't a big fan of the way the game ranks your mission performance either. Two out of five stars are earned through ballista accuracy. I didn't find this focus on perfect accuracy much fun, so for the most part I just ignored these stars and simply completed the primary and secondary objectives for the missions.The castle designs could have used bit more depth as well. While you can create your own castles, there really isn't that much variety. It would have been nice to see more options for customizing the defenses.Despite these issues I felt that CastleStorm was an enjoyable if rather shallow experience. I'd recommend it, just be prepared for a somewhat casual game.The good:- Fun gameplay- Campaign has a nice variety of different mission types- Lots of different troops/projectiles/spellsThe bad:- Story is pretty bad- Controlling heroes is clunky- Star rating system isn't particularly fun			"

This review is a little lengthy, so if you just want a quick summary of why I recommend CastleStorm skip to Results and read from there.Zen Studies hits gold with Castlestorm the epic 2D strategy game. Castlestorm offers a brilliant game that combines strategy, hack ‘n slash, castle design, and action. This brilliant game offers DLC packs which add two additional campaigns. Story:The two Teardrop Gems, blue for the knights and red for the Vikings, offer each army protection and have created peace across the land. Out of nowhere the terms of alliance have shifted as the princess has been kidnapped. It is the job of Sir Gareth, a knight for the Kingskeep, who must fight the forces of evil who kidnapped the kings beautiful daughter. With obvious plot twists and simple but amusing dialogue CastleStorm really offers a beautifully playful story. As you work with Friar Vic, Lord Rufus (who everyone hates), and eventually the heroine Freia you fight your way across the land to defeat the Viking lord and restore peace to the land. Gameplay:CastleStorm is similar to a 2D tower defense game where you control the tower; although, CastleStorm has the added twist where you can jump in as a hero and turn the game into a 2D hack ‘n slash game. With a total of nine weapons, nine spells, nine troops, and nine special rooms you get the option to outfit your army to your own unique play style. You can choose a total of five weapons, five spells, and five troops each battle although you can outfit your castle with as many rooms as you can fit. There are unlockable castle layouts you can get by beating missions. But, in all honesty the unlocked castle designs are completely useless as you will find you can build your own that allow you to better utilize the optimal layout (allowing you to get all the special rooms and troops you desire). Campaign:The original game includes two campaigns: Kingdom Quest and Welcome to Vikingland. Kingdom quest includes ten levels each averaging about four missions. Each mission allows for new unlocks, obtaining gold, and garnishing new information from the story. In Kingdom Quest you play as the Knights army and you fight against the Vikings. Welcome to Vikingland includes four levels each averaging about six missions. In this part of the campaign you switch sides and play as the Vikings, but you also fight against Vikings and occasionally on bonus missions you fight the evil knights. This completes the campaign to CastleStorm, with about 1/3 of the missions being bonus missions gives a great amount of variety and twists to the campaign. Each DLC pack adds an additional campaign with two semi-new teams.From Outcast to Savior:The story picks up where it left off as you play Sir Gavin, son of the traitor Sir Gareth. You take up the job as head of security for the kings’ guard in order to restore your fathers honor. The campaign totals six levels averaging about three missions per level. As you fight your way through the depths of evil you must defeat the evil villain who started this whole crisis. From Outcast to Savior runs hand in hand with The Warrior Queen in that the final mission is essentially the same in both campaigns but rather is how it would play out if Sir Gavin fought instead of Freia.The Warrior Queen:The story picks up where it left off as you play Freia, daughter of the great Viking rebellions leader. It is your job as Freia to free the Vikings and reunite the Viking rebellion to thwart the evil that had claimed the land. As you fight your way through seven fun packed levels averaging three missions per level you unveil to story of how it all began. The Warrior Queen runs hand in hand with From Outcast to Savior in that the final mission is essentially the same in both campaigns but rather is how it would play out if Freia fought instead of Sir Gavin. Results:CastleStorm is a fantastic game, which even at full price is not a bad buy. Although, CastleStorm does go on sale often and if you can get it for over 60% off then I wouldn’t hesitate for a second. If you are a fan of 2D tower defenses, where you control the tower, then this is CastleStorm is the game for you. If you like to 2D hack n’ slash games then this is the game for you. CastleStorm offers many features: designing your own castle, building an army, upgrading fortifications, manning defenses, and running around as a hero slaying the armies ahead. This game has a lot to offer and with two DLC expansions CastleStorm offers a story that doesn’t quit, keeping you laughing and wanting to see what happens next. Pros:+Castle builder, which lets you customize your own castle and test out if it would stand an onslaught.+Simple, non-offensive campaign that offers good laughs and cute story.+Two DLC packs which offer two additional campaigns.+Versus mode (although I never tried it so it may be terrible).+Unit upgrades which make you focus resources and keep you playing.+Summoning hero to battlefield which lets you play as a hero and destroy the enemies ahead.+Decent graphics, not too much detail but enough to make it look clean.+Decent video settings allowing windowed mode with various resolutions. Cons:-To get perfect 5-star ratings you need to grind your castle, there is no way you could do it without spending time grinding up your castle a little bit.-The earned castle layouts seem almost worthless as you will find yourself almost always using custom layouts because you will want an efficient castle rather than a good looking castle.

												This is another one that sort of blurs the lines between genres. In addition to defending your own base, or castle in this case from enemy assaults, you also have to attack their castle. It's similar in concept to Tower Wars, which Gold Plate Gaming covered, and I think does the idea better, but not flawlessly.Vikings, as vikings are want to do, have invaded your kingdom and stolen the magical gem contained within. The only thing to do is chase them all the way back to their kingdom, destroying everything in your path. Barring some special ones, every level has your castle, their castle, and a path between them. Your arsenal consists of a ballista, an assortment of troops you can send down the path, various spells, and summoning a hero unit you take direct control of. You generally win by either your army busting into the enemy's castle and bringing back their flag, or destroying the place outright with your ballista. I found the second a lot more practical than the first, as the enemy can deal with your guys about as easily as you can most of theirs. Friendly fire is also turned on, making it hard to support your soldiers without killing them accidentally. So far my castle, which you can either pick from an allotment of pre-made ones or make yourself, is also usually better than the enemy's.It's a good thing then, that smashing up castles is pretty fun. You get a large amount of weapons to do it with, and watching a big tower collapse when you smash its supports is really nice. There's also a mechanic where you gain a brief period of your projectiles having no cooldowns if you can kill enough enemy troops quickly, which is quite cathartic. Toward the end of stages it can drag, though, as you'll often end up with just one room left that you need to bombard, and since destroying certain rooms prevents them spawning troops that super mode is harder to use. If you're playing multiple stages in a row I could see that getting a bit repetitive too. Not to say the game doesn't try to mix things up; every level has some optional objective you can try for that can range from easy to heavily changing your strategy, and some levels have goals that have nothing to do with smashing the enemy castle. I'm only partway through the campaign at the moment, and apparently the vikings have their own, which seems like a nice level of content. There are also two smaller DLC campaigns for three dollars each. The game touts multiplayer, but I haven't tried it, and other reviews seem to say it isn't the best.While Castlestorm's obviously kind of aping Angry Birds, it's colorful and the campaign has enough funny moments that I can't really knock it for that. If you want to wreak a different kind of destruction and don't mind that style of gameplay, I'd recommend the base game at least.			"

												This is surprisingly well-done for a physics projectile shooter. I am quite impressed by the quality and effort put into it. Will add more later. The main premise of the game is to destroy you opponent's castle by either smashing it to smithereens or grabbing their flag. There are a few other variant objectives like grabbing a flag from the centre island, controlling a gold mine, grabbing the most gold bags and The feeling is very similar to Dota. You have a powerful hero, different creeps and spells. Zen Studios make decent games. Castle Storm is not a super amazing game but it is 100% a decent game. A good 6 hours or less to finish, I was a bit slower than average.PROS1. Pretty smooth experienceVery simple to pick up.2. Different styles of playa. You can play as Gareth, the Protector of the Realmb. You can fire the balistae and all the different variations of weapons.c. You can spawn an army to fight for youd. You can cast spells3. Different Modes of PlayCapture the Flag from the middle of the Island or capture the enemy flag or destroy all their rooms.4. Golem BattleExcellent. I loved how it worked out. Killing a boss midway through the game was most refreshing.CONS1. It's a Dead GameThere aren't any players playing multiplayer anymore. So, this is mostly for the lols.2. Troop SpawningI do not want to right click to spawn troops and then press 12345 to alternate the troops. Preferably, I have another little bar with the faces of the troops and I LEFT-CLICK on them when I want to spawn them. Use Right Click for the spells.NEUTRAL1. Viking Land is kind of too similarI was kind of hoping for the Viking Resistance to be drastically distinct in their abilities. However, they are pretty similar in gameplay mechanic but covered with a different skin. E.g. Harpoon is the Spear. It works the same way as the Spear but it has a different skin.2. Reminds me of other Projectile GamesThe abilities are just too similar. While other Projectile Motion Games copy from other games, you can see the similarities off the bat.a. The normal oneb. The spreads-into-3 onec. The exploding oned. The accelerating piercing oneI was half-expecting the air bomber one.SUGGESTION1. Time to make Castle Storm 2 and advertiseFirstly, I believe your main flaw was probably your lack of marketing. No budget? Secondly, it's too similar to Angry Birds. People might think it's just another projectile physics game. That's what I thought too.Thirdly, it might be better served on the mobile market. Your game is very similar to Clash of Clans Duels. You might want to automate troop spawning though.2. Dissimilar RacesI was hoping that I wouldn't see too much of a similarity between the Vikings and the Knights. The wolves are a nice touch but I would want more variety like a War Elephant. 3. Charged Abilities - SpellHow about a charged fireball? E.g. Hold left-click and a big ball of fire gathers, release left click and a fire ball hits either the troops or the castle.4. Piercing Shot - BallistaeSpear can't go through units? Upgrade the Piercing shot to go through multiple units and form a kebab.5. Big Rolling Boulder - SpellJust to squish everything.6. Flame/Burn status effectsIt would be fun to look at little Vikings burn and go ""Ow! Ow! Hot! Hot!""7. Upgradeable / Customisable HeroesCurrently, all the heroes are the same. Hack and Slash and shoot. How about a Mage hero? Or a Strength Hero? Or a Stealth Hero? Or an Aura Hero?8. Elves, Demon, Orcs, Dwarves RaceSince Vikings and Knights are common tropes, why not go through the whole shebang? Elves, Demons, Orcs, Dwarves. They can be cobbled together for a decent game.9. UnitsBomb Carriers that run into the buildings through the gate. Knights that charge through the first units.10. Gattling/Mini Gun - BallistaeStart experimenting on miniguns.			"

Fun game using a great mix of castle destruction ala Angry Birds style along with some Tower Defense elements thrown in with a little bit of beat'em up sprinkled in all combined with a great art style.The campaign tells an enjoyable tale where each mission (of which there's even optional side missions) allows you to play a level a couple of different ways.  You can win a level by destroying the enemy castle completely in an Angry Birds style where you lob various types of ""missiles"" from your ballista/catapult.  You can also win by breaking down their castle door and sending troops in to get their flag and deliver it to your castle.  There's a few other missions here and there where you also play the main here ala a hack'n slash, beat'em up, brawler.Each of the styles are entertaining and no level is very long, and there's many many different levels so it remains an entertaining, changing game.  Very well done.In the typical level, you can focus on destroying the enemy castle using your ballista/catapult and it's various artillery it throws from the single spear, to the multi-spear throw, to exploding drums, to large rocks, etc.  You select which types of missiles to equip at the start of each level, and also which to spend earned gold on upgrading them.  So if you favor a particular missile, you can upgrade that one up to 10 times so it does far more damage.  Generally the more damage a missile does, the longer the cool-off period.Another way to win the level is by sending your troops toward the enemy castle -- breaking its door down, and bringing that castle's flag back to your castle.  So instead of upgrading missiles, you can upgrade your wide-variety of soldiers by making them do more damage and have more health, etc.So while you are using your ballista to knock the enemy's castle down and break down the door for your troops and also sending your troops to capture the enemy flag, the enemy is doing both of the same to your castle.   If they destroy the room in your castle that allowed you to send forth your Archers, then you can't send out any more archers, etc.  So each room in your castle has a function.  Lose the room, then you lose that function or bonus.Both styles of defeating the enemy are entertaining, and all done in a comedic story and appropriate artwork.  Every level has a (skippable) video introduction, progressing the story along.All this, and I haven't even mentioned the ability to design and create your own castles, or mentioned the various spells used to defeat the enemy troops, or placing yourself (ala the hero) onto the battlefield and fighting first-hand, or the many types of troops that you and the enemy have.The Good:+ Fun, entertaining game+ Multiple play styles supported -- Angry Birds castle knock down, and Capture the Flag ala Tower Defense+ Variety.  Many variety of missiles, troops and enemies+ Nice length.  The campaign took me 8.3 hours and while each level is short, there's many of them in a wide-variety of missions and goals.+ Artwork and style.+ Well polished game.  Animated intros on every level.  Nice.+ Design your own castle.  So you can customize and protect your most valuable rooms the way you wish.+ Castle rooms determine troops available.+ Upgrade, Upgrade, Upgrade!  You can upgrade, missiles, troops, rooms and their abilities, your spells, your ""hero"" character.The OK:~ No narration.  The videos, while animated use text boxes for all speech.~ The DLCs.  The DLCs seemed to change the balance a bit and use much more of the hero fighting.  Which is okay, but I prefer knocking down and storming castles!  :-)The Bad:- Nothing comes to mind...Overall:  This is a great little family-friendly game where I found it highly entertaining to knock down castles along a lengthy, well-paced and varied campaign .  8 out of 10.

												Remember all those Flash games where you own a castle on one side and your enemy owns the castle on the other side, and you spam units until one castle blows up? Mash that up with Castle Crushers where you catapult things at physics castles and you get Castle Storm, a surprisingly fun game that combines the sort of Castle Siege Genre with Angry Birds. The single player campaign allows you to construct your own castles and unlock and upgrade it as you go through (more campaigns available in the DLCs). The multiplayer allows one player to play as a hero while the other controls the castle ballista.There's a ton of troops and weapon upgrades to unlock as you go, and not a lot else to say other than, really, it's a mashup of Castle Siege and Angry Birds. If you like those games, you're going to like Castle Storm. It does exactly what it says on the tin.			"

												This game had a lot of promise for me. The strategy elements with troop management and castle development sounded like a lot of fun. They might be fun, but not in single player. I finished the two campaigns that come with the main game, but I didn't enjoy them all that much. Some levels are extrememly easy, a few are frustratingly hard, and the hard ones aren't always later in the campaign. The missions should be balanced much better. The hero fights, which are pretty much a click fest, don't belong in the game, they are boring. Unfortunately the DLC is suppose to have even more of these than the main game, so although I bought the DLC I didn't bother playing it. Not recommended for single player and I never played the multi-player.			"

												Yet another Zen game intended more for pure fun than any huge strategic depth, Castlestorm achieves its objective without breaking a sweat and, as a result, what we have here is a game that is great fun and doesn't require too much deep thought. It is perfect as a lightweight break from more serious gaming and that is reflected in everything from the cartoonish graphics to the lightly humorous dialogue between campaign missions. I haven't delved too much into castle construction at this point but that can only add a layer that improves rather than hinders the quality of the game. I also imagine that it's a blast in multiplayer. As expected from Zen production values are high and this is another great game in the ridiculously cheap Indie Legends 5 bundle on bundlestars.			"

												Anyone who has ever played and enjoyed 'Age of War' should take a serious look at CastleStorm.  The basic premise is the same; you and your opponent control castles on either side of the map, and the goal is to send troops across to capture your opponent's flag. Each castle is also equipped with a ballista which can be loaded with all kinds of interesting ammunition, like javelins, stones, potions, and sheep.  The ballista can be used to kill enemy troops, or to destroy rooms in their castle (a la angry birds).There's a host of different units, ammunition, castle rooms, and magic spells to choose from, and lots of stuff to upgrade.  And if you like, you can design your own castle to fit the rooms (and by extension bonuses) that you want.It's all presented very well, with excellent graphics, great sound design, and a fantastic soundtrack from Waterflame (who incidentally created the song used in Age of War as well).  There are a lot of levels to play through, with bonus challenges to keep you coming back, and a scoring system that encourages you to find the most efficient way to complete a level.The gameplay itself is also surprisingly deep.  Building your own castle lets you choose what types of units you want to use in the upcoming battle, and you can also swap out your ballista projectiles and magical spells to find the ones that suit your needs.Definitely recommended, I've been having a lot of fun with this one.

												Thinking of buying CastleStorm?Check out   Wandering Wizard's Video Review	Read my review here and then check out my video review where I go into more detail and walk you through the gameplay. The game is pretty casual. I spent about 9 hours with the game, and I think that's about as much as most players will get out of it. Those 9 hours were fun, though, and mildly addicting.CastleStorm is a fast paced Castle Defense game with a fun, quirky story line. There are two main campaigns. Each campaign is split up into levels where you need to defeat waves of enemies and destroy the enemy's castle. You have access to multiple types of weapons, spells, and troops. You can also design your own castles to use in the game. The level of strategy in the game is light but pleasing and adds to the feeling of progress as you make your way through the campaigns and build your army.The biggest downside of the game in my view is that it can be a bit of a clickfest where you just need to click your mouse over and over again to fire your main weapon and beat levels. The game is also fairly short, and you probably will only get about as much play time from it as I did. The strategy of the game also isn't so in depth or compelling that you'll want to do a second play through unless you really love castle defense games.As I mentioned, the story line of the game (told through cut screen dialogues every few levels) really is quirky and fun. I usually hate cut screen dialogue, but the story line in CastleStorm is highly entertaining in a silly, tongue-in-cheek sort of way. The story line is the best part of this game. I actually found myself disappointed whenever a level went by without a cut screen scene. All in all, the game is fun. I would recommend that you put this game on your wishlist and grab it when it comes on sale again.			"

												It plays like a really well made phone game. It's like Angry Birds meets one of those 2d army battle games. The production value is really good, the cut scenes, tho simple, are charming and fun to watch. For what it is, I was impressed.Basically, you try to either smash the enemies castle or use your soldiers to bring their castles flag back to your castle while preventing them from doing the same to you. I thought it was fun. :)			"

												The norse class is underpowered with no reason to play them, while the kingdom class exists. Most units are pointless, they exist to give the enemy super attacks that destroy your castle. Gold from single player does not transfer over to multiplayer, only your custom castle does. Earning gold to upgrade multiplayer items is a pain, so if you upgraded the norse before you knew they were bad then you are out that gold since upgrades are class specific.  Very little content.It is a fun game to play a quick round vs a friend.			"

												Castle Storm is a great game for any sort of gamer, with elements of tower defense, strategy, building, and action. The game features a unique style of play, allowing you to shoot down your enemies from the walls of your castle or teleport into battle and fight them directly. As you progress you can unlock several new projectiles, troops and magic spells as well as progress through the storyline. It has a colourful art style, and lively characters. Overall it is a fun game with a wide variety of play styles and offers hours of gamelpay, especially with the two available DLC packs.			"

												Fun game for relaxation. It's not that challanging whenever you have any difficulties with a mission you can just repeat previous missions to get more gold and upgrade your units/spells/keep. Campaign is actually easy even on Hard mode, however you need tons of upgrade thus tons of gold + there are 2 factions to upgrade which adds up even more playtime if you wish to have everything upgraded.PvP might be challanging - never tried it though (it should be the best aspect of end-game experiance)For other players - if you like to chill, have some fun slaying opponents casually it's a game for you.If you're looking for hardcore experiance maybe PvP can give it to you - i'm not convinced though.

												CastleStorm is a mix of a bunch of different game genres - and the mix really works.  It is kind of repetitive after a while, especially if you play through the DLC's.  The DLC's add a lot of new content and storyline to the campaign, but unfortunatley it feels like the new factions are all just reskins of each other when it comes to the combat.  The game isnt as balanced as I would like.  I find myself in higher intensity situations resorting back to strategies I feel are all around better than other strategies (guys that throw rocks >>>).  But overall Castlestorm is an awesome game, with above average replay ability, and a fun online gameplay experience to boot.			"

												An easy to approach arcadish Tower Defence/RTS, with a lot of content for the price.The game should only be played for the fun of it, and not for serious strategy gamers.It's basically a mix of Swords and Soldiers, Angry Birds and the typical tower defence game.Positive:- Story mode with variety, different SP and MP modes including co-op.- Replayable levels, giving extra coins and stars to spend, the better cleared.- Upgradeable weapons, armies, heroes and castles.- Fine easy going humour.- Nice cartoonish graphics.- Good music and sound effects.- Achievements, leaderboards and steam cards.Negative:- Seen before, but this one has great production value, compared to fx. older flash games.- For serious strategy gamers this might lack some elements, and may be too straightforward.Score: 8,5.

You can replay levels at will .The gameplay of this awesome game, its really fun , and sometimes hard to shoot (and not shoot youre troops) manage your soldiers, and cast spells. You can also go in to the battlefield, wich is really fun too.The main thing is the strategies , each levels makes you do a different one to get 5 stars, wich can be quite challenging and fun.			"

												It's quaint, and somewhat enjoyable, however the castle editing system is tedious and frustrating to use, and really detracts from an otherwise above-average game. The base mechanics of game do pander out into repetition after a while, and the AI units could be improved to add more to the game, ie have them attack the castles. Being able to summon and control a hero is nice, but ultimately a waste of time as he does very little extra than a normal troop or ballistae could do. Lacklustre in execution.Castle design itself is flawed - there's no incentive to build anything more than a functional place to set down rooms. The towers serve no purpose besides catching shots, and the walls are restrained by the sheer crudeness of the engine (ie packing walls with rubble, strengthening and reinforcing via engineering? Not happening.)A good *casual* game. Worth a few dollars. It'll kill a few hours before you get inevitably bored of it.			"

												Do I reccommend this game? Yes and no...I love the single player campaign - although very short it is very fun However...The multiplayer is a problem for me, you cannot reset any upgrades you make the first time you play and thus as a newbie (Went straight into multiplayer before playing to campaign) if you made mistakes and want to change things you cant. You also dont earn any gold in multiplayer mode thus limiting you to the original upgrades you made.Another issue I have with multiplayer is that you cannot use the DLC classes against people who have not purchased the DLC - this to me is very irritating and unfair - I paid for the DLC I should be able to use them...I also have an issue with the castle editor - its just not clean enough for meAll in all this could be a five star game if the multiplayer issues are fixed - but as it stands now to me its only 3.5 stars purely because of multiplayer			"

												The game is enjoyable but the ""challenges"" take away from the fun of it.Single player progresses by earning yourself up to 5 stars per level  Stars are awarded based on how you performed.  Up to 2 for difficulty, up to 2 more for accuracy and the last bonus star is whatever the level doesn't want you to use, troops, ballista, magic, etc.The bonus and accuracy takes away from the fun of it, you limit the weapons and I can't sloppily spam my shots?!  Would have been nice if they included something like time as part of it, and the star system based on a score system, so that if you reached X amount of points it would give you credit for X amount of stars, so that if you're lacking in some categories, like accuracy, you can make up for it in others like quickly beating the level.All in all with the grindy nature of the game, it just seems like a big time sink and unenjoyable.  I have to replay these levels over and over again just to earn some points to upgrade my characters, very little of which make it skill based.  Rather they try to enforce the skill option by forcing you to be accurate.I would give a neutral if I could, but I can't recommend this game at $10, I think I got it for something like $2 which seems appropriate.Edit:Also, the castlebuilding part is very glitchy/buggy, and NOWHERE near LEGOs like the description is implying.

												A fun little game to pass the game. I'm a teacher and I was looking for a game which would keep me entertained during the recesses. This game is awesome for such short gaming bursts. In short, you try to destroy the opponent's castle or capture their flag. You have different kinds of projectiles that you shoot with the ballista mounted on your castle gate, and you have different kinds of soldiers, including infantry, cavalry, siege units and monsters. You can either go for destroying the opposing castle room by room (the game has a very good physics engine, so if you somehow manage to destroy the basement of a castle, all of it comes tumbling down), or you can upgrade your soldiers and go for capturing the flag. There are two steps to capturing the flag, first you must break the castle gates, then you must escort the flag bearer to your castle.You can design your castle in any way you can. You have only two limits while designing you castle; spatial limits and a limit of 5 different barracks at most. Other than that, you can create your castle however you want. If you don't feel like it, there are also ready castles that you can use, but I think they are inferior to what you can achieve yourself if you personalize your castle.I've encountered no bugs or glitches throughout my gameplay. The loading times were also very short.There is almost no voice-over (just some generic sounds used many times) but the game never feels like it lacks it. The music also fits the game like a glove. It can be epic, funny or brooding depending on the mood of the moment.The graphics are very cute and also hugely appropriate for a game of this kind. They are very, very reminiscent of Warcraft III, which I liked a lot. This game clearly proves that the most important thing in a game is gameplay, not the graphics.Don't expect miracles from the story. It's mediocre, and at times it really feels like it was written keeping children in mind. However, it at least manages to make you feel curious about what will happen next. The game also ends in a somewhat cliffhanger, so expect a sequel.The only criticism I can make is not about the gameplay but the story:You beat the Rogue Knight, Sir Brutus, and he pledges to serve you, but where does he or his army go? You just continue using the Barbarians' army-set like it never happened.Also, all throughout the story, it was hinted very, very clearly that Lord Rufus is a traitor and Sir Brutus is actually working with him. What happened to Lord Rufus and Friar Vic when we were separated because of the cave-in? What happened on the other side of the mountain while we were fighting in the Barbarian lands? And what about the ending? What was the monster that we saw at the end? The developers could have at least described where it came from and why it appeared just after Ramhorn's death. And the ending roll says peace ruled the land but (as I've said in the previous paragraph) what happened with Lord Rufus, the traitor? These are not answered and I must say, it really bothered me.Other than these reservations, I think this is a very good game and it definitely deserves your money. Recommended.			"

												Very fun game. Can be both enjoyed in single player and multiplayer. Altho you must be good at multitasking. Keep spaming your spawn unit button. And keep shooting your arrows/canon at the enemy's base.9/10ENjoy ^-^			"

												It's a common online flash game genre but polished up and with a very nice aesthetic. It's like what Trials HD did with ""tilty bike"" games but with the castle attack/ 2d rts genres mixed together and with a few new idea and a lot of of borrowed ones. Like the one projectile that splits into 3, the projectile that speeds up and the one that explodes on command. Like I said a lot of this is borrowed but games are iterative by their very nature. So all in all, I'd say this is definitely worth the 5 bucks I paid. Also apparently there's mp but I haven't bothered, sp is enough for me.			"

												A very nice Tower Defense and Offense game. Many different castles give you other units, spells and things to shoot at the enemy. It has a hero mode too, in some levels you play only the hero. So do not forget to level him up. Earn gold to buy upgrades for buldings, units, spells. If you like TD games, buy it!			"

												I got this on sale earlier this week and I've been addicted to it ever since. I've seen this game on the Wii U Store, XBL and Steam and I've been thinking about getting it for awhile now. I purchased the complete package for only $5 and after playing it this week I think the game is well worth full price. I'm still enjoying the main game and haven't gotten to the DLC yet. The campaign is broken up into battles which are fairly short and quick to play through (at least on normal difficulty). The game offers the ability to have a quick match but sucks you into that ""one more battle"" mentality and before you know, it's 2 in the morning. The game progression has been fairly steady, the game is constently unlocking new items and upgrades to use and there is plenty of upgrading to be done throughout the campaign.Overall, I can't recommend this game enough			"

												This is a fun game to play and even more fun messing around and playing against friends. One thing that would make this game even better would be to incorperate a spectate feature in the verses game type. This would allow friends to watch matches while waiting to play. I could see this being very fun and a much better way to kill time between matches with friends. Also, I could see this as a kind of learning tool to many new and even seasoned players. It would allow them the oppertunity to see how someone else plays so they can learn different techniques and stratigies to help improve their play without being caught up in the action of the battle.

												The poor user interface killed this one for me. The mouse-based gameplay in the hero-mode is just unnecessarily frustrating, due to some poor design. When you're targeting, you often need to fire and move. That's good. But if you do, the cursor disappears entirely, so when you need to fire again, you have to find it, get it back on target, and then shoot. Also, the cursor disappears when you get hit, or release the button for whatever reason. To top that off, the screen scrolls around, making it difficult to tell where your enemies are. Normal mode ended up being way too easy, and hard mode would've worked, had it not been for the poor mouse control.Maybe I would've eventually gotten used to it. Still, I'd rather have fun with the design, rather than in spite of it.			"

												Great game. Its half tower defense, half strategy/action. Very addicting right off the bat, the first time I turned booted it up I played 5 hours straight. You get a castle with a ballista that has different weapon types, which you can aim manually at the enemy soldiers and castle. You also have magic spells, a hero character, and an army which marches forward attacking whatever it comes across. The basic objective is to destroy the enemy castle or capture the enemies flag, however, the campaign offers a bit of variety apart from ""destory this castle"".All in all, I would reccomend this game every time, especially if you can get it in a bundle or on sale! $10 is a great deal for this game and there is a lot of fun to be had. The art style is really quirky and reminds me of a fairy tale or a comic book. Actually, now that I think about it, the graphics are very reminescent of world of warcraft.The only downside is that the characters don't speak very much dialogue, the majority of the story is text only, but don't let that sway you.

												I never gave this game a lot of thought ... until now. It was on sale for $4.99 and I decided I would give it a go. For the price I paid for it, I had a lot of fun playing (although not a lot of game time as yet). But this game will give me many more happy gaming time. The graphics is nicely done in a cartoon drawing style. During the cut scenes you need to read the dialog but then there is not that much to read. You get coins for completing the objectives and unlock weapons as you go along. You destroy castles (angry bird style) and built and defend your own castle. If you’re looking for a fun little game that does not need continues concentration, has humour (the background characters does all kinds of stuff) and that’s different from everyday games and a game that relaxes you then try this game. It supports multiplayer (so you may have fun with buddies) although I did not try it since I’m not into multiplayer. All-in-all I think the game is worth it and I didn’t regret buying it for one second.			"

												Castle storm is a smart and funny mix of Tower Defense, RTS, platform/fighter, and Angry birds, with RPG elements.  Build your castle, arm your hero, send forth your troops, and blow the utter hell out of your enemy's castle with assorted weapons ranging from ballistas to weaponized sheet.  There's plenty of challenges, lots of options, and a good sense of humor (including humor about games).  Great fun - and you can't beat the price.  Only quibble is some of the ways controls and timing function, but that's minor.			"

Keep in mind that it's a side scroller but you and your enemy each have a castle and you have a hero, units, and a crossbow with various ammunition. There are several different units and heroes. The story isn't bad either but nothing to get excited about.			"

												A little gem of a game boasting very appealing cartoon graphics and a fascinating mix of gameplay styles. The main game is using your ballista, Angry Birds style, to launch various types of projectile at incoming enemy troops and the distant destructable enemy castle. You are also able to spawn ground troops yourself, though you have little control over them. You can however cast spells in and around them to influence the ground war. Finally, you can spawn a Hero unit and get involved in the ground war manually. Almost everything can be upgraded in power, giving a good sense of progression. For the price, it's a steal. 8/10			"

												It feels odd to not recommend a game that I picked up for less than the price of two 20 ounce Mountain Dews and banged out a day of gaming on, but I realized that I was essentially playing Angry Birds with some tacked on elements that really don't mesh well in the core experience.Given that the visuals campaign are absolutely exceptional for a sub-$10 game - this very much is a well-thought out world design and art style - I kept expecting to unlock a ""fun"" button instead of reskinned upgrades as I proceeded through. Nope. After the first couple of hours, you really want to give this a chance. because it's apparent a lot of love went into making it. Sorry, but there's no ""aha"" moment where the added subsystems like hero mode, spells and the castle editor bring anything good to the table. Then you realize you were just playing Angry Birds mixed with a crappy tower defense game and wishing you had your afternoon back.If someone at Zen had had the courage to say after the art assets and world rendering was done, ""Y'know, this game is kind of crap, let's hire a couple emo kids out of the corner coffee shop to write us an adventure game to go with it instead,"" it probably would have been a $20 game and a top seller.

												This game is pretty fun for the first half of the story mode, but then very boring the second half. It's almost like angry birds, but with a few extra features.Overall, I believe at anything greater that $2.50, this game is NOT worth getting or spending your time on.			"

												Decently challenging, but tough not to become grindy/repetitive.If you are a tower defense player, the firing element(you control weapons shooting from your castle) added into troops is nice, but the singular left to right map ends up being kind of boring.  One strength of the TD genre is the adaptability of maps.  Castlestorm falls short as far as reinventing/creating within the genre.Troops seem to either be extremely OP or weak AF, there is little incentive to use most troops at a certain point.Everything revolves around getting kill streaks to get rapid fire to end the level.There just feels like a very lacking element to this game, and I got bored of it and probably won't ever boot it again.

												No--just no.I bought this game thinking that it'd be an awesome, fully-fleshed-out version of Age of War, a game I spent hours on as a kid, but this game is absolutely unplayable at a fundamental level.  It's not buggy, it just has awful base gameplay due to one glaring error: you can hit the enemy castle with your castle's turrets.  Every single ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game that I've played has had both of our units in a stalemate while our turrets just shot each other until one castle fell--it was completely broken and boring.  The turrets are so nausiatingly overpowered that you feel no need to deploy units.  Even your heroes get wrecked.  Absolutely no fun to play.			"

												You'll probably get a realistic idea of whether or not you will like this game from the videos, screenshots and game description supplied on this page.1 player mode is good.2 player mode is fun but it has issues. Primarilly you cannot construct your own castle. Instead there are presets. What this means is that you have to choose a preset castle which determines your summonable units. These presets are not balanced, basically they just get progressively better and you have a couple of choices at each ""tier"".This by no means destroys the multiplayer mode. You still have quite a bit of choice with spells and projectiles.If you're buying this for the multiplayer mode I'd wait untill it is on special.			"

												Only buy this game when it is on sale. It is not worth $10. The $5 I bought it for is about right. This game could have been great, but instead is merely mediocre, and all because of the poor unit mechanics. The storyline is fun and engaging, but any actual control over your hero is close to imaginary. The response time to shield against attacks is laughable, you can only see 3 feet in front of you, and you give up control over your best weapon (the ballista)Ground based unit fights are done in an unusual style. each unit stops to fight only one other letting all other enemis past. For example, if you have 2 soldiers against 1 enemy one of your soldiers and theirs will engage and your second will walk right past.This might not seem like much until you get larger units with splash attacks. Trolls and the like can kill several of your units will one hit but only one of yours even gets to attack.This combat is even more poorly implemented when you add in the ballista and flying units. The ballista shots damage your own units, and it can easily become impossible to fire without hitting your own unitsThe flying combat is even more disjointed and tacked on. I have never had a single ranged ground unit take out a flyer. You have to shoot them down yourself.Coupled with said flyers ducking and bobbing randomly, as well as dealing splash damage attacks (and one hit killing most units), this is a huge oversight and in many cases ruins and otherwise fun game time.The organization of the game is foolishly repetative. In both kingdom/royal guard, and Viking/viking elites factions the units are almost interchangeable, but upgrades must be bought separately. Separate upgrades must be bought for all of the support buildings as well, even though these are exactly the same across all classes. This is true of some of the Heros/Heroins too.Too long; Didn't readThis game could have been great, but the lack of testing and poorly implemented ideas make this mediocre. Only buy when half off (it's not worth the full $10).			"

												Highly amusing and fun; in the same vein as Angry Birds: destroy the enemy and their castle. I've only played single but being on sale, I bought for a friend, so look fwd to testing co-op out. It is fun even just building castles and testing them, smashing them into oblivion. It is simple and straightforward.I play it with the controller, so not sure how well keyboard controls are, but controller is straightforward, just gotta remember to  use the other buttons to switch up who/what is sent out.If anything, get it just to smash castles like when you were a kid and made them out of wood blocks, lincoln logs, and such and the proceeded to figure out the best way to destroy it (besides acting like Godzilla XD LOL)Definately worth it, whether on sale or not.

												Angry Birds + RPG?  Overall, it feels pretty mediocre.Friendly fire.  Okay, just be careful, right?  Every time you do well, you get a kill streak, which makes your ballista (castle projectiles) shoot like an uzi.  Oh, and zooms out so you can see the whole battlefield. Just one problem with that: your mouse is then typically over top of your own army.  BOOM!  So glad I got that killstreak, I just killed my own guys because I did well?  Now I'm paranoid about getting kill streaks.Run around as a hero?  Sounds great.  Except the camera is too zoomed in, so you commit to a melee attack animation then get hit with enemy projectiles that you never had a chance to defend against.Mechanics like these make it frustrating.  My brother and I bought it because we thought a co-op castle defense game would be fun, but little things like that at every turn spoils the experience.  We've played it for 10 minutes at a time and quit repeatedly.  We kept playing it thinking ""surely it'll get better"". A little over an hour in, I'm now uninstalling it.			"

												It keeps resetting/changing my castle after nearly every campaign mission that I spent a lot of time building so the game is unplayable. ♥♥♥♥ing stupid... why would they do this? Nobody wants to redo something like that. It happens after every mission that only lets me use a specific troop because for that mission it resets your castle to fit the specifications of that mission. I may have to have two separate save slots and leave the very first slot for the single campaign but it does not at all tell you this, ever. So I end up going back to the castle builder and it shows that the game forced my castle to be that way for the mission and if I want to have it how it was again for a mission that lets me use any troop, it's back to the castle builder for an hour. What a idiotic game breaking design flaw. And on top of that, the game is just generally not good enough for me to even worry about trying to find a solution to the problem because I have a plethora of other much better games installed. If Steam ever lets us sell games cheap, this one will be the first to go for me. And good riddance, five dollars wasted.			"

												A creative, brilliantly executed game with a charming story, great characters, and fantastic gameplay. The games only real weakpoint is that the castlebuilder is counterintiutive and not as user friendly as the ads for the game make it out to be. the games physics based castle smasher is fun, though the dlc adds bigger, badder projectiles. prefer a tower defence style game? It does that too, and pretty well. finally you can enter the battlefeild yourself as one of several heroes and beat the tar out of enemy troops yourself. its great fun, doesn't take long to learn, and I would highly recomend it.

												After having bought Castlestorm on my mobile and having played it through 3 times and having almost all upgrades on maximum levels I was getting bored of this game and didnt play with it for several months. Some day I decided to give it a go again. I noticed some new updates like survival and highering the maximum upgrade level from 10 to I dont know, havent reached it yet.:) After having played in survival mode like 20 hours I was interested in how far others could survive and decided to google it. I clicked on the first search result in youtube and noticed right away, that the whole design was different than to mine, so I figured out that there is gotta be a PC or console version as well. When I found this game on Steam I instantly purchased it from a 3rd party seller for a few keys. So after having played the mobile version for a few hundred hours and having played the PC version as well I decided that I should write a review on it to help others decide whether or not they should PURCHASE THIS VERSION ON PC OR STICK WITH THE MOBILE FREE TO PLAY VERSION. So here is the summary of my impressions and opinions:MOBILE VERSION-/+ free to play, but partly pay to win-/+ due to the pay to win part, some ammunition types, units not achievable/upgradeable ---> game more difficult in general, especially in survival mode- less game modes (ONLY campaign and survival, NO multi-player/coop)PC VERSION- game has to be purchased for money+ no pay to win aspect, everything is achievable/upgradeable through playing the game+ a big variety of game modes (f. e. campaign, hero survival, coop hero survival, versus (your ballista, units, castle against someone else), coop survival (you have control over your units, ballista, magic spells, your friend controls a hero of his choice)Overall this game is a great little mix of different game types and definitely worth its price and offers a lot of hours of great entertainment and fun, especially if you have a friend to play it with. (With funny voices and comments of the units like ""Let me axe you something!"", ""I wish I would have a hammer. Oh, I do!"", ""What am I? Cannon fodder?"".Unfortunately the online part of the game is as good as dead, searching a game can last up to several hours...I hope this review helped you in making your decision about purchasing this game. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS LEFT ABOUT THIS GAME FEEL FREE TO LEAVE A COMMENT AND I WILL TRY TO ANSWER IT AS GOOD AS I CAN! "

You even have wizards and magic to use in the battles.Castle destruction, trops fights, archers, knights, heroes... everything is there!.HIGHLY ADDICTIVE.Graphics are really good (deceptively kiddy).

												A pleasant surprise. CastleStorm didn't strike me as appearing particularly unique, but it proved itself to be a surprisingly compelling game, with tons of content and charming visual style. It plays like a well-developed evolution of the classic games that seem to have inspired it and everything it tries to do is done solidly.There is no difficulty to finish the game but that doesn't mean that it's not fun. You can customize your own castle and pit it against others online. You are as busy as a Korean playing StarCraft 2 with this. Whether you are shooting from your canon, or controlling a hero on the field. I highly recommend this game, and can be picked up quite cheap (as always) from Steam.Check out more reviews on http://completingthebacklog.blogspot.co.uk/ "

												Average game with some cool moments...When i first played this game i found it enjoyable, but after a while this  samey game becomes repetitive and boring. The visuals are ok and there are lots of things to do, but you just battle another castle (hence the name) and other enemies through the use of a turret and your seemingly small army. You can also use a hero who is not that great. Now i know you should not expect much from a game like this, but it just feels slow and boring. You just get constant waves of enemies with no real challenge. This game is really fun at first and shows much promise with its apparant range of modes, but quickly becomes boring. Maybe this game gets better, but i do not feel llike playing much longer to find out.4/10			"

The game feels insanely broken on a controller, expecting you to flip back and forth between a thumbstick and d-pad constantly for aiming.

Steam should do one of the following:1) Force developer to deliver their promise by fixing the splitscreen mode.or2) Ask the developer to remove the ""splitscreen"" from the game description page.

												A fun distraction, but ultimately not worth your time.  Multiplayer modes are pretty sparse, and there are some mechanics (headshots turning into rapid-fire, namely) that completely shut down the others.  The campaign really loses its way in the second half, and the castle building is actually not fun in the least due to poor documentation and no leeway for the faux physics.			"

												What a great little surprise! It's hard to describe it. It's part castle building (on the simplest level), part Angry Birds type of game, similar art and humor as Orcs Must Die...  You progress through the campaign or with friends...in the style that you want. Use your hero and fight like a side scroller...create and send yuor armry to capture their flag (while defending yours), use spells to destroy their army or protect/enhance your own, use your ballista and its many ammo types to destroy their castle or at least the enemy's capabilities (troops, bonuses, etc...).Get it! It's a lot of fun.			"

												I feel decieved with this title. It comes across like a lego-style castle builder in the trailer, and while there is that element, most of your play time exists in the space between the two castles where you are waging war. The whole game feels a bit tedious. The storyline is forgettable, and nothing is really that fun. To be honest, I never came across a tutorial or even did much of the castle building in my whole time playing it. I must have gotten through half of the game, too. Another thing that is hard to describe, but needs to be mentioned, is that this title doesn't feel very 'indie'. I normally wouldn't care about that kind of stuff, but the whole thing feels sterile, or corporate. I don't get the vibe that this was somebody's love project that they tediously crafted and tweaked. Overall, it just wasn't much fun. A great majority of my time was spent launching projectiles Angry Birds-style into enemies and castles. Even though this was not what I was expecting, it was not a pleasant surprise.			"

												Let me start by saying: I'm a total sucker for a good indie game. In my opinion, indie games are TRUE video gaming. None of this 50GB, HD, 1,000FPS, DX50, PERFECT GRAPHIX 'N SOOPUR AWSUM CINIMATICZ! The moment I saw CS for sale, I could of sworn it was a steal. I jumped into its wacky, colorful world that left my sides splitting with laughter and the time of my life in gameplay....but something went wrong about half way through; the game lost it's charm almost immediately by a few blantantly bad ideas and campaign design.Plot 10/10I love the idea of the story. 2 kingdoms in seemingly endless war were destroying one another. The goddess of the game's universe was so distrought, she cries, but - intead of tears - 2 gems were crystilized from her eyes and fell to earth. These strange metals seemed to sate the bloodlust of the 2 kings that held them and there was peace. However, someone has tampered with the gems, and war as again surfaced. Quite the creative setting, if you ask me. It has a few twists and is told well. Can't ask for much more out of a story in a simple game as this. You'll also be laughing thoughout at the zany writing and character design. It has a humor that is rarely tapped into nowadays.Graphics 10/10Just by looking at the screenshots, it's easy to tell this game is delightfully beautiful. With a wide palette of colors, Zen Studios truly made a charming world. The visuals remind me of an old Disney movie. Character models, level design, art; across the board, the visuals are at zenith.Sound 10/10The sound is up to par with the best of full budget, AAA titles. Voice cast is also well done. Most notably, the game's soundtrack is legendary! It's made by a young man that goes by the pseudonym WaterFlame89 on Youtube. Don't miss out on tracks like ""Donkey Island"", ""Title Theme"", ""Happy War"", ""Storming Castles"", or ""Long, long ago...""! Remember old songs like the Goof Troop theme? They were so catchy, uplifting, and always made you smile; even during your toughest days. WaterFlame89 has ressurected that long, lost art of music composition. I almost cry when I hear them. ;~;

Gameplay 6/10Many will note the influences taken from Angry Birds ( or if you really want to go back, ""Crush the Castle). This is a good example of ""inspired"" not ""ripped off"". You custom build your castle, or take presets to battle, adding rooms that each buff your viability. If a certain room is destroyed, it's contribution ceases i.e. if you have a barracks room destroyed, you can't train your grunts. There is a ballista that you can control to launch a variety of projectiles either at the enemy castle, or at the enemy troops. There's also an option to train troops of your own and smash the front gate of the castle; revealing their flag, or even spawning a hero that you control temporarily. Capture the enemies flag with your troops, or annihilate the castle to win. I was completely hooked by the gameplay and it's bronze/silver/gold ranking, challenge system. With great replayability, visuals, engrossing sound track, and humorous, intriguing story, what could possibly go wrong? CS gains momentum as you fire it up and play, but somewhere near the mid point of the game, it changes which faction you play as. The first mission of this new faction was dreadful! The game starts taking a bunch of cheap shots on you. You're forced to play a hero class and kill a certain number of enemies without dying. However, the controls as a hero in the first place are utterly terrible, clunky, counter-intuitive, and worst of all, you die fairly quickly. I had to change the game to EASY just to barely squeeze my way past this debacle. Worse yet, when you reach this point of the game, it's out of new features. You've already seen all the weapons, all the new troops, and all the new rooms. The rest of the game is playing the same mission against a fairly cheap AI whose troops 100% of the time STOMP on yours, forcing you to use your ballista on enemy troops while the enemy ballista takes free shots on your castle. Another annoying thing is your heros talk EVERYTIME they attack. One girl shouts ""MAXIMUM DAMAGE"" when you use her alternate attack, then shouts ""Oh, no!"" EVERYTIME she's hit. ""MAXIMUM DAMA- OH NO! MAXIMUM DAMA- OH NO! MAXIMUM DAMA- OH NO! MAXIMUM DAMA- OH NO! MAXIMUM DAMA- OH NO! MAXIMUM DAMA- OH NO! MAXIMUM DAMA- OH NO!"" Just from that quote, you can see how hero gameplay works; it's almost unplayable entirely. The VerdictCS has a lot of incredible things going for it in terms of music, gameplay, sound, visuals, and story. The issue is that it runs out of fun before it runs out of content with bad level design and cheap AI in later missions. It was even enough to make me quit the game. I'm on the fence of whether I should recommend or not. Final score is 6/10. It's terrific!...until those few missions ruin it. Then Castle Storm becomes nothing but a slightly above-average game. It really pains me to talk about this game that way.			"

												Talk about a game that you can sink 30-40 hours easily into and not even realize it.  I picked up Castle Storm on a Steam promotional sale and glad I did.  This game is simple yet so addictive and fun.  Your goal is to protect your establishment as you take down the opponent's castle.  You have to build your castle and choose which units and rooms you will put where.  These rooms dictate which units you can spawn in the air or on the ground to fight the forward battle for you to either tear down the gate and take the flag, or bring down the castle in destruction.  The castle's launcher has different weapons you can use and also various upgrades for not only the weapons but units/passive abilities as well.   The storyline is also pretty basic but it has a decent art style and music. Recommended!			"

												Been looking for a tower defense that has a different element to it or multiplayer, I haven't spent much time with it yet but I can see this being one of my favorite go to games when I just want to destry things. The environment and 3 d aspect of it gives it a visual kickstart too, some scrolling TD games start to look the same to me even though the concept is addictive. Edit: been playing for a couple of hours, the upgrades and gameplay is getting better and better, upgrading castle to support stronger troops and more of them, upgrading weapons, armour, there is magic.. Great game, wish I had heard of it earlier. Going to spread the word on this one!			"

												8/10Its such a weird game, its like a... Castle defence RPG ?You can build your own castle, and how u build it determines what kind of units u can make, or what kind of perks you get as u fight.The gameplay is basically you have a castle, and at the entrance u have a ballista that shoots various things(18 different things, 9 per tribe) you have 18 different spells to cast, and about 18 different units u can summon and you get gold to level all these things up. The objectives are usually to destroy the enemy castle, or capture their flag or something of that nature. Whats super cool is if a specific unit cause's problems, u can focus that part of their castle and it will stop them from devoloping them.			"

												It's basically straight up Ramparts + Angry Birds + Rescue Raiders.  So, yes - of course it's totally derivative and nothing particularly new, but they execute it really well, besides which it's not like the world was flooded with Ramparts or Rescue Raiders clones anyhow.  The only real drawback is the asinine enforced campaign progression (geez I get it guys, shoot the things) but if you can power through the first few boring toy-starved missions it gets good pretty quickly.

												Please read the last line first!A nice 2D physics defend the castle style game with an ok story line.  Some my get some in game chuckles from it's cheesey humor and line taken straight out of other movies like Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  However, even if there are 4 different types of ""classes"" you can choose from and the game does try to mix it up a bit at times where you do play as a hero, be wary of very repetative combat and lack of online community, making it impossible for some to get the last 3 achievements.  I'll ONLY recommend getting this while it's on special.			"

This is your chance to replay those past battles again ! Castlestorm is a fun little game with a light-hearted storyline about knights, princesses, monsters, traitors & vikings !Pros: - cartoony & colorful graphics- suitable funny sounds & music accompanying the visuals- small quick sessions of battles & castle sieges- many chapters- watch huge pieces of castles come down !- lead the assault or defend with your heroes !- replay chapters for better results and/or more gold- upgrade your heroes, units, castle, magic & attack weapons- 4 long & connecting storylines with all DLC installed- your units don't like to be shot at !- just one more go feel ! Watch that clock ! Is it already that late ? Oh well . . .Cons:- lack of speech in movies between chapters, breaking the game experience a bit- quite some gold grinding required in certain chapters to make further progression possible- some initial hard battles prevent upgrades, which can make it a bit more daunting for inexperienced players			"

												I bought this game in a bundle almost exclusively for the local multiplayer. It turns out that you have to play the game extensively in singleplayer in order to earn coins to buy new/better units that you can then use in the multiplayer. I have no interest in the singleplayer game, so the very limited starting equipment for local mulitplayer makes the game overly simple and dull. This is a trend in modern game design that I really can't stand. Don't make me play through dozens of hours of the things I don't want to do in order to get any enjoyment out of the thing I do want to do.			"

												I enjoyed playing this a lot more than I thought I would.This is a unique take on tower defence where you try to take down the enemy's defences before losing your own. There's a great blend of capture the flag and good ol' catapulting fun by launching boulders, arrows, and living sheep into your enemies and their castle.Pretty fun and laid back; a bit like ""medieval Angry Birds"" - fair amount of content, would recommend.

I would recomend this game to you if you enjoy simple yet still challenging games. Easy physics to understand. Although the controls take a little getting used to, you can adapt pretty quickly and punish your enemies swiftly! Ugrades that are further explored in the castle development aspect definitely adds more depth to the game! Having a blast playing and I'll probably buy the expansions.  =)			"

												Fun game with simple objective and controls to destroy your enemies castle.  Upgrades to your arsenal and star ratings for each mission gives it some replay value too.  Plot is as stereotypical as they come but its surprising it even has one.			"

												I really like this game.It's very simple in terms of story, with nice cartoonish graphics and sily but fun humor.But then, the technical aspect of the game is perfect in every way.Excellent mechanics allow to play the levels with different strategies and keeps you on and on unlocking new stuff all over that makes the game change and improve all the time.Really, there's so much goodness in this game that the list would be too long.Just try it, you won't regret it!Highly, highly recommended!

												A nice game that will bring you several hours worth of strategic/gunnery fun.What you have here is a game that is a mix of a few elements.A 2d strategy game where you build units that then run automatically towards the enemy to do some killing and looting.A physics shooter (Like Angry birds).A base builder.And a mini platformer.You win by destroying the enemy base with your ballista or invading it with your units to capture his flag.How does all this work? Pretty inituitively actually.Just hold down the left mouse button to fire a stream of javelins from your ballista, whilst you click the other mouse buttons and the number buttons to perform your other duties. You can headshot Barbarians, build knights and cast spells all at the same time!But that does sound like a heavy brain toll, aiming can be intense alone, but making troops? Triggering special attacks? Alternating ammo types? With all this variety comes an interesting amount of customisability.When you build your castle, you need to set up protection for the building components that influence your gameplay, theres troop structures that enable your units, upgrade structures that strengthen your defenses and units, and then jusr raw materials that you place to protect those important elements.Exactly which parts you pick will heavily influence your game, if you dont like to maintain troops then you can forego them nearly completely (the campaign does require you to have a little of everything), and spend all of your resources on upgrading your ballista. If youre not too sharp on constant ballista vigil and would rather lead and command an army, you can upgrade the troops and even your own ""hero"" unit, which you can summon to the field to fight on the frontline. Thse elements then click together interestingly, a ballista focused player can develop a few key units to protect his front gate that then when the gate is clear shoot the enemy caste in tandem with your ballista bolts. Alternatively you can go for the other victory option that is ""capture the flag"", where you build frontline units to storm the enemy caste, and then cover them with hero summoning and ballista attacks. Another strategy is to focus on the special munitions available to ballistas, these munitions often have poor rate of fire, but you can make up for that by going into hero mode between cooldowns.Included is a mildly entertaining campaign with a variety of missions that challenge you to use the different elements of the game in concert or seperately. It wont win any prizes for originality story wise but what did you expect from a game with so many unique gameplay mechanics?In other words, this rather simple looking game has a deceptive amount of depth to it, allowing the player to develop his own brand of strategy.If youre a fan of strategic games, and want to play something completely different from the norm for a while, this is a game you will enjoy. Gameplay: 5/5.Surprisingly deep strategy and a large pool of options to pick from. Several interesting mechanics.Art: 4/5.For an underdog company, the game is exceptional. The sprites are easy to read and iconic, there is a lot of animations and a fair amount of agreeable classissism in the designs. its got nothing on the industry titans of videogaming, but for an indie game it is well above the minimal acceptable threshhold.Story 3/5.Average. Lighthearted comedy mixed with a standardised plot of ""Bad things happen, hero saves day, goes on journey to find source of bad things, hero saves the day again."" The plot was just charming enough to get an average score for being ""Classic"".Sound 3/5.The background music is nearly entirely ""light action-symphonies"". The music is constant but not distracting. The very basic soundract and the simple voice-acting was enough to set the mood and setting, mission accomplished.Accessibility 2/5.A found that this problem deserves a notice here. I found myself clicking a lot of unnessesary buttons, especially in menu's and the castle builder. There is no auto save for the castle builder that I know-off.Total score: 68.Pick it up, play it and enjoy it for the mechanics and the strategy. I can even reccomend the DLC's for some extra challenges and charming character interactions, its worth a few days of fun for sure.			"

												If you're looking for a Castle demolition physic game, with a strategic part about how to structure your castle, this IS NOT the game for you. at least not in the single-player mode.Unfortunately you'll have mostly to shoot soldiers and send out troops, and use spells (on troops), and go into the battlefield with an hero and fight with your sword (against troops). and then eventually quickly shoot a bomb to the enemy castle when you have a micro-second where you're not going crazy doing other stuff.the structure of your castle won't make the difference as well, as in the first part of the story the enemies will shoot once every  age, and in the second part they'll focus on killing your tropps with bombs, rather than destroying your castle, just to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off and force you to focus on making new tropps rather than shooting at their castle.in addition to this, in the first part, the enemies are super dumb, and in the second part they are just normally clever, and kinda stronger, but the problem is that you're weaker than before! not only you'll have to start over with stupid missions made just to introduce you to the new viking units, rooms and weapons, but then you'll have to fight using troops who totally sucks and weapons which even at level 5 they lands on the enemy castle like if they were just cupcakes thrown on a wall.and finally, the game has one of the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat interface and keymapping I've ever played in a modern game. the zoom of the map changes automatically driving you crazy and changing the position of your pointer, so you'll find yourself moving the mouse out of your desk during the tense moments. Many times trying to get the right angle to shoot the castle, you'll end up clicking the icon which drives you to your (or the enemy) castle, and I'm still trying to understand why that icon should be useful at all..and when you use the hero, those issues become just insane. it reacts so slowly that you'll be clickng and pushing and asking yourself why the hell is not doing it, at least 3 times before he will do the first thing you've pressed. and throwing weapons is so annoying that you'll probably give up if it wasn't that half of the mission has a bonus for the headshots (that the hero can make only with the bow or launch axes).and this drives to the conclusive issue. more than 3 quarters of the missions are made up to force you to DON'T play shooting the castle. you'll have to shoot to the enemiy troops before they get money, shoot troops to cover your mates escape, shoot troops to make your troops occupy a mine, shoot troops because there is a freaking muntain blocking your view of the castle, etc..then in some other mission you'll have to fight using only your hero for a reason or for another, or use another different hero for the sake of something else.oh, but don't worry, you'll have many other mission in which you'll have to kill turkeys, or boars, or wolves, or whatever else.and the castles battles? I told you at the beginning. forget about them if you're going to play this game in single player.and if you play it in multyplayer, this will be basically only about shooting-shooting-shooting to the enemy castle, using mostly arrows while you wait other weapons span, and eventually arrowing troops as soon as they appear. All you have to hope is that the enemy is a noob and it's not shooting-shooting, or it has weak weapons, or its castle is badly structured and it will fall before yours.			"

												This is a great casual game which is satisfying to kill time with. Slightly addictive, if you're the slightest competative and want to beat everything with a perfect score.The gameplay itself is very simple, sadly I must admit it just feels like an upgrade to ""Castle Defender"" (the old flash game) since the core of the game have the same setup. But the humor and goofy graphics still make it into a more proper and nice game. if you're unsure if it's your type of game just go try ""Castle Defender"", which feels a bit like an alpha to this game... but I recommend it nonetheless. I really enjoyed the casual strategical thinking of it with the silly humor always close. This is as said a few times now, like a massive upgrade from that addictive olf flash game.The soundtrack of it is also a big bonus; relaxing, goofy and cheerful. Perfect elements for a casual game.Price: Personally I'd say they ask for a bit too much, especially since there's a ""free alpha"" in flash online... but if you get a discount for it then I'd say it could be fun to try at least.

												A fresh new look into the Tower Defense genre given that it's not a complete tower defense game.  This is a side scroller action game mashed up with a physics engine game mashed up with with a tower defense objective.  Grab this when it's on sale for less than $15 and you've got yourself a great game.It plays pretty well, it's an addicting time waster, and it definitely falls on the generous side of the hour : dollar ratio.

The campaign is goofy and challenging if played on hard and there are only a handful of levels which are frustrating, but because you can repeat levels you can always come back to them to get all the stars.

												Hell of a fun game with good challenges and has some decent replay value and while the single player mostly rehashes the same units for each campain it still changes them up slightly and it works well. This is easily one of those games that will give you 20-30 hours of gameplay or more so at its normal price of $10 its worth it.  Also if you like the game i HIGHLY recommend you to buy the two expansions since Outcast takes place after the first two campaigns and Warrior Queen is the 4th campaign is helps tie up some of the story.Overall its a very well rounded game with good replay value although ive yet to try the multiplayer or the co-op.Two big tips for those who want to get and play this game.....When you play the game make sure to go into castle editor and setup your castle before starting the next mission since they game doesn't inform you that the castle editor is a necessity to using new units and also the way to upgrade the castle walls/gate.If a level is kicking your♥♥♥♥♥like the hero missions where you don't get to use your castle or units just beat it on casual and ignore the bonus requirement. Doing that you can unlock everything later and upgrade all the stuff after beating that campaign you can go back and replay that mission with fully upgraded abilities and units on harder difficulties.

												A great mixture of genres make this game incredibly fun and satisfying. You have a castle that sends troops and projectiles to the other side to either take their flag or destroy their castle while they attempt the same. It is simple in concept, but so much more complex in practice. You can design your castle, choose which soldiers to take, choose which rooms to add to your castle, choose what projectiles to use, and choose what spells to take. The story is cute and silly which I appreciated. I put a lot more time into this game than I originally intended and am really grateful I picked this up as part of a bundle. 9/10 Amazing ideas that come together beatifully. I want more please!			"

Watch that clock ! Is it already that late ?

												I heard the developpers were inspired by childhood memories of creating lego castles then destroying them. And it's as awesome as you think.You can build a castle (the system is simple, you add pre-built room and pre-built small decoration to fill the gaps between the rooms or to solidify it), wich is a little bit tactical, but mostly esthetic.You hire troops to defend your castle or attack your opponnent's.And most of all, you control manually a balista that can shoot from simple arrows to propelled fist and boars.The physic is funny, the story actually decent, the flaw of the game comes from the factions.Knights and Viking are similar, with small deviation, like in old RTS games. Where every unit is an equivalent, but not the same (cheaper and weaker, or faster and less resistant).However... The dlcs add two faction wich are complete ripoff to be honest. Knights and viking are different in visual, castle and stats. However, the two other factions are basically ""knights with lighter colors"" and ""vikings with more spikes"".The game is great, easy to learn, has a decent depht to it and a really cool story, but it's only flaw comes from those terrible factions in DLC. Especially because it's the only big flaw.			"

												Holy crap. I expected this game to be a turd, but it's quite addictive. I just finished all of the single player content for this game (including DLCs), and it was a lot of fun. A lot of people are ragging on the story. I found it to be cute/funny. It's not serious at all and is quite ridiculous, in a good way. The style of comedy is similar to Swords & Soldiers if you've played that. In this game, you shoot hordes of enemies with a ballista, summon troops to attack the enemy castle and keep enemy troops away from your castle, all while blasting at the enemy's castle to destroy rooms which represent each combat bonus or enemy type the enemy has. Don't like their dragons? Shoot the dragon's nest off the top of the castle; problem solved! The castle-blasting is like Angry Birds, which I actually don't like, but I enjoyed the way it's done in this game. Oh, and you get money when you complete a level and can replay levels for more cash, upgrading everything from heroes you spawn and control zoomed in between the castles, the troops you spawn, your combat bonuses, etc.TL;DR Get the complete pack for this game with all its DLC whenever you see it on sale for just under seven bucks. I had a great time with it. A diamond in the rough.			"

												CastleStorm is a great game, it pretty much took Angry Birds and did something interesting, innovative and purposeful with the concept. The game is very well presented with colorful art and a progressive unlock system and a ton of missions that change up the tower defense formula. Sometimes you use your troops to defend your castle, somtimes you use your ballista, sometimes you jump into the frey as a knight with control over movement and attacking and other times your managing all of these modes at once to your best abilities. The game also includes a nice upgrade system after you unlock various forms of attack and defense. You can also customize your castle choosing which rooms and defense structures to build that actually affect gameplay. This game is a little gem.			"

Sadly, the second half is maybe 4/10 with glaring design issues. The second half also seems to be cut short, maybe due to deadlines? I'm also not pleased that the game ends without a proper conclusion and is pretty much a ""BUY DLC TO CONTINUE STORY KTHX."" Not completely ME3 level but almost.So, consider is it worth your money or not.			"

												I think I could describe this game as a more complicated version of Angry Birds. Instead of birds vs pigs you have cartoony fantasy castles with ground forces, flying creatures, and missile weapons. I'd recommend this to people that enjoy casual games that have an element of strategy.			"

												Do you like Angry Birds? Forget about it, this game has everything you liked in AB but so much more fun. Nice design, good sounds and music, and really good gameplay that can easily make you addictive. It's not only about shooting the opponent's castle,  you can also use a range variety of soldiers, magic spells, you can upgrade your stuff and controll your hero in the battlefield. And don't forget about the story which is an excellent parody of the recent fantasy products like Skyrim and Game of Thrones. Strongly recommended.			"

												Awesome. I really did not think I would like this game.  I got it from humble bundle and wasn't even going to play it.  Then I was bored... saw its name... forgot what game that was... downloaded it... opened it. was like ""great, that game..."" ... ""well it's already open so I might as well play it."" .... ..... ......... *10 hours goes by* .... *beats campaign* ... It's addicting. Complex in its own right, but beatable your first time through even when playing only on 'hard' difficulty as I did. It's relatively short... easily beaten in a day...Also very sad no one plays multiplayer... so unless you have a friend with the game, it doesn't have alot of replayability- although there are a couple DLC packs that can extend the game.  Definately a fun experience that's worth the while.			"

												Very decent and impressive for a ""casual game"", I was pleasantly surprised.PROS :-You build your own castle layout-You can enter the battle directly as an heroic knight-Style is cartoony and charming-Funny character, dialogue and story-Diverse arsenal of troops, projectile weapons, powers and various upgrades-There's local co-op aka ""couch co-op"" (haven't tried it yet though).CONS :-Takes a while until it picks up and gets interesting or challenging-Gets repetitive, which is pretty much expected for a game like this.-The music can become pretty annoying-There is little incentive to keep playing for very longA very solid game. Highly recommend, especially for the casual crowd.			"

												This game is probably the best casual game I know.First of all, in terms of gameplay :The game has constantly three difficulty levels which you can switch to whenever you want. So if you're stuck because you're playing on hard since the beginning, you can switch to normal and then come back later to do it again on hard. Or you can farm previous levels. If you have that weird passion for farming, you should play this game. And yet, the game still offers a challenge if you want it to. This is a perfect example of how a casual game should be : You can finish the game easily on easy or you can 'beat' the game on hard.The controls are pretty OK, you can play with only mouse or you can use keyboard+mouse.Building your own castle is quite nice too but what really adds to the game is the fact that you chose what you will fight with, like in any good RPG (this game is not actually an RPG).About the narratives :I was surprised to actually laugh at some of the jokes. It's all very childish but actually quite nice. The scenario kinda makes sense and even though it's really not complicated or especially deep, it very much fits with the rest of the game.About the graphics :Look at the screenshots. All the game is like that, even the cutscenes. It's quite ok and it also fits with the rest of the game. Besides the graphics are generally effective, mechanically speaking (who you gotta shoot and who you gotta not shoot).Overall :Again, it's an excellent casual game. 11/10.			"

With a lengthly story mode spanning both factions mixed with great visuals and a goofy sense of humor its great not only for those of us who just want to kick back veg at the screen for a bit but its also catered towards the veterans amoung us with its higher difficulty settings brings new learning curves an pushes us to experiment with new units, spells and ballista ammo. I highly recommend this for just about any gamer out there.			"

												such a fun game ... its a tower defense with only one tower but its just so much fun with so many options that you don't notice that its only one tower ... the castle building part of the game is meh and I think they would have been better off just giving us pre built castles where you could choose which rooms you wanted to include ... The campaign is goofy and challenging if played on hard and there are only a handful of levels which are frustrating, but because you can repeat levels you can always come back to them to get all the stars.

												Hell of a fun game with good challenges and has some decent replay value and while the single player mostly rehashes the same units for each campain it still changes them up slightly and it works well. This is easily one of those games that will give you 20-30 hours of gameplay or more so at its normal price of $10 its worth it.  Also if you like the game i HIGHLY recommend you to buy the two expansions since Outcast takes place after the first two campaigns and Warrior Queen is the 4th campaign is helps tie up some of the story.Overall its a very well rounded game with good replay value although ive yet to try the multiplayer or the co-op.Two big tips for those who want to get and play this game.....When you play the game make sure to go into castle editor and setup your castle before starting the next mission since they game doesn't inform you that the castle editor is a necessity to using new units and also the way to upgrade the castle walls/gate.If a level is kicking your♥♥♥♥♥like the hero missions where you don't get to use your castle or units just beat it on casual and ignore the bonus requirement. Doing that you can unlock everything later and upgrade all the stuff after beating that campaign you can go back and replay that mission with fully upgraded abilities and units on harder difficulties.

Its a tower defence game with some fun twists,  Instead of several towers you create your castle which needs to be defended by spells, and npc that attack the castles.  Your castle  has a cattapult that fires diffrent types of projectiles, that do many diffrent things, and my favorite is the hero (its a spell) where you call a hero, once called apun you take control of the hero and devistate  the ememy troops  for a few seconds then return to manning the catapult (ballista).Over  all its a great game with verying degrees of difficulty, and one of my favorite games. 9. 5 exp points  (10 being max)			"

												CastleStorm was a game I picked up on sale for roughly £3 it was a real steal, never hearing of the game before, I watched TotalBiscuit's review, seeing his only major problem was the inability to create castles from the ground up (his fault due to him not seeing the ""clear castle button"") I picked it up.What do I think of the game?+Cartoon style, both in dialogue and in graphics, the games fantasy setting creates an opportunity for great light-hearted dialogue, from breaking the fourth wall, tongue in cheek humour and references, the atmosphere of the game is a refreshing change from the dark fantasy style we have been getting for so long, the enemies rrange from pretentious archers and cowardly soldiers to Boxing Golems and Idiotic Trolls. The game is lovingly wonderful (and isn't that just a bit sappy?)+ Strong gameplay, the game seamlessy combines spells, RTS and catapaulting together, the catapults vast array of weapons (from boulders, to conversion potions and homing exlpopding eagles) are bound to the left mouse button, the spells (summoning your hero for a direct control fight or summoning holy swords to implae your enemies) to the middle mouse button and your troops (catapult launching gluttons, pladins and donkey riders and more) to the right button, each form of combat featuring a hotkey and keyboard select system allowing for seamless combination of the trio)+ Destruction physics, speaks for itself really, nothing more satisfying then watching your ballista strike a javelin through your enemy or rocks smashing into the opponents castle and crumbling it away or even bouncing a battering ram sheep into the gate. It works great, and aside from the occasional glitched miss, its fluid, effective and satisfying, being the core part of the game it should be and certainly is.- Friendly Fire, I don't know who thought this was a good idea, so heres the situation, your troops are weakened by the oncoming plaadin, you fire your ballista straight for his head to give your troops a break, instead it gets sent smacking into your soldiers back and he dies, the enemies gain ground while you sent another squad to retake the ground you lost. Theres the problem, its almost impossible to use the troops and ballistae in tandem, they always get in the way of each other, there is no point using the infantry because despite the infantry being effective the ballistae is more effective and when your troops are LITERALLY BLOCKING shots for you're enemy, whats the point? putting in friendly fire just brickwalls the infantry and stops the fun, in a game like this, the realism of the firendly fire is all the more annoying.- Castle editor is pointless, don't get me wrong, its fun and all, putting your castle into action and creating an unstoppable design, but when the preset ones are already there, made by professionals, completely balanced, and tested for the most efficiency, theres no point in building your own where theres certain to be a gaping hole in your defense or not enough space for a troopers barracks etc. its the same problem as littlebigplanet, the created levels are fun but the ones made by proffessionals are almost certain to be better, less buggy and of a higher quality.Overview: despie its huge flaw of friendly fire, its good to remember it is the only serious flaw, and the editor is still there for those who want to tinker and the architects in us that could make great castles, so its more of a personal gripe but i think others would see the same thing, but that said its still a completely functuntional feature, so for its excellent features, great and realised ideas and wonderfully cheesy story, castlestorm gets a 9 out of 10, its only £7 and thats the price of most dlc for triple A games, which i guarantee you will probably won't be worth it, so give castlestorm a try, Its worth every penny "

												A great way to waste an hour.  After that it starts to get a bit mononotous.  The developers did a fine job finding ways to avoid that with survival and castle editor, but it still falls a bit short.  The colors and graphics are bright and sharp, along the lines of Torchlight 2.Gameplay is a good combination of strategy, building, and action.  A lot like Angry Birds, shoot until the tower falls, toss in different ammo for the level, and decide which troops you need to spawn.  Toss in a hero that takes you down to the action.My biggest complaint, the controls are a bit mousey.  When you're the hero, it takes a bit for him to change direction, or start walking a different direction.Pick it up on a sale, unless you're a fan of Angry Birds, then full price might work for you			"

												This is an incredibly fun game that is extremely underrated. It has an extensive campaign and multiple gamemodes of both coop and versus multiplayer that are really enjoyable. It may seem boring based on the screenshots or because it's a 2D game, but the gameplay is actually very fun, complex, and entertaining. It's more than your typical tower defense game in that you actually get to become a hero at the frontlines and fight with your troops or you can sit back and fire with various weapons.			"

												Blending 2D tower defense gameplay with catapult physics, this game feels like a cross between Tower Wars and Angry Birds (there are even some none-too-sly ""angry"" references in the game).  Like Tower Wars, CastleStorm expands the basic tower defense formula by giving each opponent a citadel to defend and troops to send against the other.In addition to sending troops, you can also fire various forms of ammunition, ballista/catapult style, against the opposing troops and their fortress.  By taking out sections of the fortress, you diminish the enemy's capabilities.  The physics involved are absolutely reminiscent of Angry Birds, and there's a great deal of satisfaction when you finally knock out that last section of wall and watch a huge tower come crashing down.This game had a lot of elements I was looking for.  As of this review, I've played just four hours of the campaign (about 2/3 through), and haven't played around with the fortress design mechanics or anything -- they look good, though, as does multiplayer (assuming one can find an opponent).  The cutscenes are hokey in the extreme, but I'm not finding myself annoyed by them -- it's just a bit of popcorn to tie the missions together, and it works fine.Definitely a good buy (especially on sale) for fans of tower defense, physics games, and artillery games (e.g. Scorched Earth, Worms, etc.).  Happy to see more games moving in this direction, moving past the basics of a single genre.  Probably the biggest downside for me is that the pacing tends to be a bit frantic, not leaving much room to contemplate one's strategy.			"

												CastleStorm is one of the best games i have ever played. It has a great mix of strategy,humor, and comical elements within the game. Very satisying physics,challenges, and story mode encourages the player to play this game more. Not to mention the High replay value, including existing and upcoming DLC's. CastleStorm is a must buy :)			"

I expected Angry Birds, but I got a cool Tower Defense, physic-based, action arcade game with a fairly large campaign and some multiplayer. It isn't quite KAG, but it's a lot more than I expected.

												CastleStorm is a great game, it pretty much took Angry Birds and did something interesting, innovative and purposeful with the concept. The game is very well presented with colorful art and a progressive unlock system and a ton of missions that change up the tower defense formula. Sometimes you use your troops to defend your castle, somtimes you use your ballista, sometimes you jump into the frey as a knight with control over movement and attacking and other times your managing all of these modes at once to your best abilities. The game also includes a nice upgrade system after you unlock various forms of attack and defense. You can also customize your castle choosing which rooms and defense structures to build that actually affect gameplay. This game is a little gem.			"

												Been looking for a tower defense that has a different element to it or multiplayer, I haven't spent much time with it yet but I can see this being one of my favorite go to games when I just want to destry things. The environment and 3 d aspect of it gives it a visual kickstart too, some scrolling TD games start to look the same to me even though the concept is addictive. Edit: been playing for a couple of hours, the upgrades and gameplay is getting better and better, upgrading castle to support stronger troops and more of them, upgrading weapons, armour, there is magic.. Great game, wish I had heard of it earlier. Going to spread the word on this one!			"

												It's basically straight up Ramparts + Angry Birds + Rescue Raiders.  So, yes - of course it's totally derivative and nothing particularly new, but they execute it really well, besides which it's not like the world was flooded with Ramparts or Rescue Raiders clones anyhow.  The only real drawback is the asinine enforced campaign progression (geez I get it guys, shoot the things) but if you can power through the first few boring toy-starved missions it gets good pretty quickly.

												Quite a nice little game, I got it on sale for like 5 bucks and it was definitely worth the asking price. Basically there's one of two factions, Kingdom and Norse, each have their own campaign which will take you at least 8 hours if you ignore all the side missions. Obviously each side has their own attacks, minions, spells, etc.The goal changes from level to level but most of the time it's you vs. your enemy, with the victory conditions typically being to either destroy your enemies castle (which is well done I might add) or capture their flag by breaking down their gate and sending a ground troop to snag it. There's a good variety in minions, attacks, and spells so you'll definitely be experimenting with your loadout to see what you like best. You get gold throughout the game and you spend that on upgrades for whatever you want.There's also 3 other gamemodes aside from campaign, Survival, Skirmish, and Hero Survival. Survival is a lot of fun but if you do TOO well it starts to get boring and you'll want to lose on purpose, but that's not exclusive to this game. Skirmish is more like a regular match where you can customize your experience a little bit. Hero Survival sucks dino dong because the ""take control of hero"" combat is incredibly basic.You can also customize your own castles which is pretty cool, although it's clear it was put in as an afterthought at the last minute. Still, it works and the game is better for it to be in the very basic state that it's in rather than not at all. There's two dlcs available for this game, haven't gotten them yet so I can't comment on how good or bad those are.Final, sad fun fact: This game plays more like a worms game than all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ modern worms game Team17 ♥♥♥♥♥ out nowadays.

												This game is pretty easy to learn but interesting to master. It follows the tower defense mechanics where you have a castle that needs to be protected. You are able to spawn units to attack the opponents flag, which is near their castle. You have a ballista that you use to shoot out different projectiles according to your level and current progress. There are heroes you can spawn for 10+ seconds to alter the battlefield a long with spells to control, aid or destroy your opponent.The core gameplay is a mixture of sending troops to the middle of the battlefield, using spells and heroes to control the flow and using your ballista to shoot out rocks or eagles or whatever, to destroy the opponents castle. Extra feature is the ability to upgrade your abilities, units, spells and heroes. You can build and design your own castle and put the rooms you need according to your strategy. If you loose a room in the battle you also loose its ability/feature while your in the match. So if you loose the archer room, you can't spawn archer anymore. So a very strategic aspect right there.In multiplayer you can unlock and play the other factions which opens up new heroes, units and method of play.			"

												Talk about a game that you can sink 30-40 hours easily into and not even realize it.  I picked up Castle Storm on a Steam promotional sale and glad I did.  This game is simple yet so addictive and fun.  Your goal is to protect your establishment as you take down the opponent's castle.  You have to build your castle and choose which units and rooms you will put where.  These rooms dictate which units you can spawn in the air or on the ground to fight the forward battle for you to either tear down the gate and take the flag, or bring down the castle in destruction.  The castle's launcher has different weapons you can use and also various upgrades for not only the weapons but units/passive abilities as well.   The storyline is also pretty basic but it has a decent art style and music. Recommended!			"

												This is one of those games that I wasn't expecting to be fun, and when I first tried it, I was getting frustrated at the game. With a mix of tower defense and Angry Birds, this game is a little more intricate than meets the eye.The game is set up with three main attack options: Ballista attacks, Troops, and Heroes/Magic attacks. All three of them can be used during battle, and knowing how to switch effectively between each attack can mean success or defeat. Resource management becomes a factor when playing in harder difficulties, but the game overall can be completed on a casual level without problems.While the game itself has controller support, there are a few areas where controllers are very ineffective. I wouldn't expect anybody to fully complete the game (getting all 5 stars on each level) with a controller alone; the way a gamepad interfaces with the ballista is through joystick, and so it doesn't offer nearly the precision as mouse does, as the projectile will move to where the mouse is currently at. By comparison, using the ballista with the joysticks is more-or-less trial and error, especially in Hard mode.Aside from a few unique areas where you are bound to a specific layout or playstyle, a lot of the game is customizable within each campaign. Each campaign has its own set of equipment, so progress does not carry over to other campaigns. However, gold (the currency used to upgrade your equipment) does carry over between campaigns, so you have the option to farm easier levels in other campaigns if you get stuck with low-level equipment in another campaign.I would recommend this game as a solo experience. Like many multiplayer games on Steam, there isn't much of a community left to play with. It functions pretty solid as a single player game though.			"

												Bought this game on a sale without many expectations, because I'm not that much into the casual/puzzle genre and at first I was expecting some kind of lousy tablet port/angry bird clone. After doing some quick research, I decided to give it a try anyway, given the low price and the favorable reviews. Luckily my initial impressions were very very wrong!Castle storm is indeed a game mainly based on the usual and widely known ""physics-driven destruction"" formula of angry birds and similar games, but it expands that very concept and adds many other elements such as real time strategy, puzzles, management and... platforming,  all backed by a nice story. I must say that, suprisingly, all this stuff is glued so well that it works like a charm, giving CS its own unique personality.The game flows smoothly, is never boring and the overall style is lovely and well designed, as are the characters.In the end I was so hooked by this game that after I went through the main campaign I was a little sad because... well, it was over, and trust me when I say that I never expected that. It still took me a good 12 h to finish the main missions + DLCs, so I think it's more than ok on the lenght side. Don't forget there are also freeplay and multiplayer modes, but I never tried them (and I should do that as soon as I can).So, what to say? Castle storm is a little gem, it's so much fun and and I highly reccomend it. It's worth the €9,99 price tag, it's even worthier on sale. Go for it! "

												Awesome game fun to play you can get it started relatively quick and the controls are easy enough for it to be a fun game without having to learn a lot of hot keys. Whenever you need a break from killing zombies with a B.F.G. or maybe you've been trying to take over the world, the day is almost over and all you want to do is just unwind, or you're just fed up with the T-72 tank that just keeps killing you every frekin time(not again…WHYYY!!!), or you just have a few minutes to burn, which ever it might be you can get bet this will be the game that takes your mind off of it all it's just plain fun.

												I recommend this game if you can find it on sale.  The multitude of levels for the price point is decent.  Castle making is boring/tedious, but thankfully not necessary to playing the game has there are many pre-made castles.  The different weapons, spells, and bonus room upgrades keep the game interesting.  Music is entertaining but not much variety.  Story is simplistic with  slapstick humor.  For a few bucks, though, it is a decent defence game			"

												This is an incredibly fun game that is extremely underrated. It has an extensive campaign and multiple gamemodes of both coop and versus multiplayer that are really enjoyable. It may seem boring based on the screenshots or because it's a 2D game, but the gameplay is actually very fun, complex, and entertaining. It's more than your typical tower defense game in that you actually get to become a hero at the frontlines and fight with your troops or you can sit back and fire with various weapons.			"

												CastleStorm was a game I picked up on sale for roughly £3 it was a real steal, never hearing of the game before, I watched TotalBiscuit's review, seeing his only major problem was the inability to create castles from the ground up (his fault due to him not seeing the ""clear castle button"") I picked it up.What do I think of the game?+Cartoon style, both in dialogue and in graphics, the games fantasy setting creates an opportunity for great light-hearted dialogue, from breaking the fourth wall, tongue in cheek humour and references, the atmosphere of the game is a refreshing change from the dark fantasy style we have been getting for so long, the enemies rrange from pretentious archers and cowardly soldiers to Boxing Golems and Idiotic Trolls. The game is lovingly wonderful (and isn't that just a bit sappy?)+ Strong gameplay, the game seamlessy combines spells, RTS and catapaulting together, the catapults vast array of weapons (from boulders, to conversion potions and homing exlpopding eagles) are bound to the left mouse button, the spells (summoning your hero for a direct control fight or summoning holy swords to implae your enemies) to the middle mouse button and your troops (catapult launching gluttons, pladins and donkey riders and more) to the right button, each form of combat featuring a hotkey and keyboard select system allowing for seamless combination of the trio)+ Destruction physics, speaks for itself really, nothing more satisfying then watching your ballista strike a javelin through your enemy or rocks smashing into the opponents castle and crumbling it away or even bouncing a battering ram sheep into the gate. It works great, and aside from the occasional glitched miss, its fluid, effective and satisfying, being the core part of the game it should be and certainly is.- Friendly Fire, I don't know who thought this was a good idea, so heres the situation, your troops are weakened by the oncoming plaadin, you fire your ballista straight for his head to give your troops a break, instead it gets sent smacking into your soldiers back and he dies, the enemies gain ground while you sent another squad to retake the ground you lost. Theres the problem, its almost impossible to use the troops and ballistae in tandem, they always get in the way of each other, there is no point using the infantry because despite the infantry being effective the ballistae is more effective and when your troops are LITERALLY BLOCKING shots for you're enemy, whats the point? putting in friendly fire just brickwalls the infantry and stops the fun, in a game like this, the realism of the firendly fire is all the more annoying.- Castle editor is pointless, don't get me wrong, its fun and all, putting your castle into action and creating an unstoppable design, but when the preset ones are already there, made by professionals, completely balanced, and tested for the most efficiency, theres no point in building your own where theres certain to be a gaping hole in your defense or not enough space for a troopers barracks etc. its the same problem as littlebigplanet, the created levels are fun but the ones made by proffessionals are almost certain to be better, less buggy and of a higher quality.Overview: despie its huge flaw of friendly fire, its good to remember it is the only serious flaw, and the editor is still there for those who want to tinker and the architects in us that could make great castles, so its more of a personal gripe but i think others would see the same thing, but that said its still a completely functuntional feature, so for its excellent features, great and realised ideas and wonderfully cheesy story, castlestorm gets a 9 out of 10, its only £7 and thats the price of most dlc for triple A games, which i guarantee you will probably won't be worth it, so give castlestorm a try, Its worth every penny "

												A great way to waste an hour.  After that it starts to get a bit mononotous.  The developers did a fine job finding ways to avoid that with survival and castle editor, but it still falls a bit short.  The colors and graphics are bright and sharp, along the lines of Torchlight 2.Gameplay is a good combination of strategy, building, and action.  A lot like Angry Birds, shoot until the tower falls, toss in different ammo for the level, and decide which troops you need to spawn.  Toss in a hero that takes you down to the action.My biggest complaint, the controls are a bit mousey.  When you're the hero, it takes a bit for him to change direction, or start walking a different direction.Pick it up on a sale, unless you're a fan of Angry Birds, then full price might work for you			"

												CastleStorm is a great game, it pretty much took Angry Birds and did something interesting, innovative and purposeful with the concept. The game is very well presented with colorful art and a progressive unlock system and a ton of missions that change up the tower defense formula. Sometimes you use your troops to defend your castle, somtimes you use your ballista, sometimes you jump into the frey as a knight with control over movement and attacking and other times your managing all of these modes at once to your best abilities. The game also includes a nice upgrade system after you unlock various forms of attack and defense. You can also customize your castle choosing which rooms and defense structures to build that actually affect gameplay. This game is a little gem.			"

												This game is pretty easy to learn but interesting to master. It follows the tower defense mechanics where you have a castle that needs to be protected. You are able to spawn units to attack the opponents flag, which is near their castle. You have a ballista that you use to shoot out different projectiles according to your level and current progress. There are heroes you can spawn for 10+ seconds to alter the battlefield a long with spells to control, aid or destroy your opponent.The core gameplay is a mixture of sending troops to the middle of the battlefield, using spells and heroes to control the flow and using your ballista to shoot out rocks or eagles or whatever, to destroy the opponents castle. Extra feature is the ability to upgrade your abilities, units, spells and heroes. You can build and design your own castle and put the rooms you need according to your strategy. If you loose a room in the battle you also loose its ability/feature while your in the match. So if you loose the archer room, you can't spawn archer anymore. So a very strategic aspect right there.In multiplayer you can unlock and play the other factions which opens up new heroes, units and method of play.			"

												its a very good and fun game unfortunatly the campaign is rather short (2hoursish) per faction and theres only 2 (4 including dlc) so it does have alot to play but each one is rather short and you finish when your half way through upgrading things on your castle. also the hero gameplay is alright but doesnt work to well, alot of the hero only things where hard just because they die so easily and when your hit can start a train of getting hit without being able to block. so overal a fun game but hero gameplay and length of campaign let it down.

												8/10Its such a weird game, its like a... Castle defence RPG ?You can build your own castle, and how u build it determines what kind of units u can make, or what kind of perks you get as u fight.The gameplay is basically you have a castle, and at the entrance u have a ballista that shoots various things(18 different things, 9 per tribe) you have 18 different spells to cast, and about 18 different units u can summon and you get gold to level all these things up. The objectives are usually to destroy the enemy castle, or capture their flag or something of that nature. Whats super cool is if a specific unit cause's problems, u can focus that part of their castle and it will stop them from devoloping them.			"

												Please read the last line first!A nice 2D physics defend the castle style game with an ok story line.  Some my get some in game chuckles from it's cheesey humor and line taken straight out of other movies like Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  However, even if there are 4 different types of ""classes"" you can choose from and the game does try to mix it up a bit at times where you do play as a hero, be wary of very repetative combat and lack of online community, making it impossible for some to get the last 3 achievements.

												Holy crap. I expected this game to be a turd, but it's quite addictive. I just finished all of the single player content for this game (including DLCs), and it was a lot of fun. A lot of people are ragging on the story. I found it to be cute/funny. It's not serious at all and is quite ridiculous, in a good way. The style of comedy is similar to Swords & Soldiers if you've played that. In this game, you shoot hordes of enemies with a ballista, summon troops to attack the enemy castle and keep enemy troops away from your castle, all while blasting at the enemy's castle to destroy rooms which represent each combat bonus or enemy type the enemy has. Don't like their dragons? Shoot the dragon's nest off the top of the castle; problem solved! The castle-blasting is like Angry Birds, which I actually don't like, but I enjoyed the way it's done in this game. Oh, and you get money when you complete a level and can replay levels for more cash, upgrading everything from heroes you spawn and control zoomed in between the castles, the troops you spawn, your combat bonuses, etc.TL;DR Get the complete pack for this game with all its DLC whenever you see it on sale for just under seven bucks.

Sadly, the second half is maybe 4/10 with glaring design issues. The second half also seems to be cut short, maybe due to deadlines? I'm also not pleased that the game ends without a proper conclusion and is pretty much a ""BUY DLC TO CONTINUE STORY KTHX.""

												This game is probably the best casual game I know.First of all, in terms of gameplay :The game has constantly three difficulty levels which you can switch to whenever you want. So if you're stuck because you're playing on hard since the beginning, you can switch to normal and then come back later to do it again on hard. Or you can farm previous levels. If you have that weird passion for farming, you should play this game. And yet, the game still offers a challenge if you want it to. This is a perfect example of how a casual game should be : You can finish the game easily on easy or you can 'beat' the game on hard.The controls are pretty OK, you can play with only mouse or you can use keyboard+mouse.Building your own castle is quite nice too but what really adds to the game is the fact that you chose what you will fight with, like in any good RPG (this game is not actually an RPG).About the narratives :I was surprised to actually laugh at some of the jokes. It's all very childish but actually quite nice. The scenario kinda makes sense and even though it's really not complicated or especially deep, it very much fits with the rest of the game.About the graphics :Look at the screenshots. All the game is like that, even the cutscenes. It's quite ok and it also fits with the rest of the game. Besides the graphics are generally effective, mechanically speaking (who you gotta shoot and who you gotta not shoot).Overall :Again, it's an excellent casual game. 11/10.			"

												Fair warning: I spent less than an hour with this game. But if you decide to play with a 360 controller as I have, be prepared for camera annoyance. Anyone with experience on sites like kongregate won't find much new, except for an aggravating camera which makes aiming a game of trial and error.			"

												Reminds me of the good old days of side-view castle-defense flash games, mashed with upgrading element, and light-hearted humor within the story. The difficulty is not too overbearing, but you cannot rely on swarming to win. With enough upgrades, earning 5-stars in missions isn't too much of a challenge, however some side-missions do require some thought on what effects to use and when to use them.			"

Brings a whole new outlook on tower defence tbh & i found myself helplessly addicted to it, right through til th end of the campaign.Decent graphics, Good controls and very easy game to pick up.Could probably of done with a bit more difficulty but still very enjoyable.Basically you have your castle on 1 side, the enemies on the other and you send troops whilst also slinging your catapault to both damage the enemies castle or stop their current flow of troops. 1st to lose their castle, loses..pretty simple but also a fun andmost importantly unique take on the TD genre.75/100			"

												CastleStorm is a good game overall. It feels a lot like an old popular flash game I used to play (some of you will know what I'm talking about). The mechanics in this game are pretty good, they're not perfect but they are good enough to make the game enjoyable and fair. There are a few things about this game that feel like they need work... first off the castle builder kind of sucks in its current state... Don't get me wrong it is a cool idea, but I just feel that it is done incorrectly and that it is hard to build on to the castle without completely starting from scratch.But as I said at the start, this is a good game and it will definitely keep you entertained for a while.

												Castlestorm is a semi-automatic tower defense game with elements from MOBAs and strategy games set in medieval fantasy world. You take control over one army and battle another one in a 2D Environment, Sending troops to do battle and supporting them with a full control siege crossbow.I had this game laying around for over a year I think before I started playing it. I regret not picking it up earlier. The main reason that drew me towards it, was it's graphic design. It has a colorful cartoony art style that reminds me of a more recent version of the Warcraft 3 engine while the gameplay feels a little like Orks must Die.After playing it first, it did not expect to like it. I usually don't dig tower defense games, as they bore me rather quickly. This one, I enjoyed however. The combat feels slick, theres lots of variety in both siege ammunition and troops and together with the DLC the campaigns are fairly long. When I stopped this game, it left me with a desire to want more. I was motivated to take on the campaign levels once again to get better ratings!Of course, this game is not perfect. You could argue theres too much focus on the crossbow combat, the multiplayer on the internet is practically non existent as of the date of writing of this review, the single player highscores are bloated with hackers and impossible to reach scores, the hero combat is a little simplistic and the castle builder mode is fairly hard to use.But if you overlook this, you get a decent game thats a load of fun and I have to say it has by far the best vikings I've seen in over 10 years. Blew my mind. Also, the music was made by the artist Waterflame, who produced a big deal of tracks for Castle Crashers.I hereby recommend this game for a purchase. Pick it up when it's on sale. Or just now if you like.			"

												Tower offense/defense + Angry Birds = pretty cool. It is a shame the minions don't really attack the castle unlike in Swords&Soldiers. Superminions(heros) segments give some welcome variety. Probably the best game in its genre (which isn't saying much). 2.5D graphics are alright, sound is good, cutscences are cringeworthy and skippable thank god. I recommend playing this with an Xbox gamepad.			"

												Hilarious, awesome and exciting :D One of the best games I've seen in ages!Worth looking at the community page before purchase, but this is a fantastic game. Unfortunately it's a bit dead (Online action I mean), so you really do need someone to pair up with if you want to try and do the one online achievement. Mainly single player based, though it does have a multiplayer option which you can do on the same console/screen. You'll need a controller for player 2 though and he/she only gets to control the hero. Mostly a aim and fire turret game, when you do spawn in as the hero it's still so much fun and a break from the ballista. Still one of the best games around in my opinion.			"

												I heard the developpers were inspired by childhood memories of creating lego castles then destroying them. And it's as awesome as you think.You can build a castle (the system is simple, you add pre-built room and pre-built small decoration to fill the gaps between the rooms or to solidify it), wich is a little bit tactical, but mostly esthetic.You hire troops to defend your castle or attack your opponnent's.And most of all, you control manually a balista that can shoot from simple arrows to propelled fist and boars.The physic is funny, the story actually decent, the flaw of the game comes from the factions.Knights and Viking are similar, with small deviation, like in old RTS games. Where every unit is an equivalent, but not the same (cheaper and weaker, or faster and less resistant).However... The dlcs add two faction wich are complete ripoff to be honest. Knights and viking are different in visual, castle and stats. However, the two other factions are basically ""knights with lighter colors"" and ""vikings with more spikes"".The game is great, easy to learn, has a decent depht to it and a really cool story, but it's only flaw comes from those terrible factions in DLC. Especially because it's the only big flaw.			"

I would recomend this game to you if you enjoy simple yet still challenging games. Easy physics to understand. Although the controls take a little getting used to, you can adapt pretty quickly and punish your enemies swiftly! Ugrades that are further explored in the castle development aspect definitely adds more depth to the game! Having a blast playing and I'll probably buy the expansions.  =)			"

It's not only about shooting the opponent's castle,  you can also use a range variety of soldiers, magic spells, you can upgrade your stuff and controll your hero in the battlefield. And don't forget about the story which is an excellent parody of the recent fantasy products like Skyrim and Game of Thrones. Strongly recommended.			"

												Great gameThis game is a combination of angry birds and kingdom rush. Let me explain why you must buy when there are in saleGraphics:Although the graphics may look cartoonish and outdated, it gives the feeling of warcraft 3 and dota 1. Additionally, the heroes and troops are well designed and very enjoyable to watch.Music and other sound effects:The background music and effect are a bit repetitive since you will be hearing the same music in the menu all the time when you select a chapter or level. Despite of the mentioned fact, the music in conjunction with the graphics will make the game pace very smoothly.Story:The stories of each campaign are very simple but filled with a lot of funny gags. That's the reason why I have skipped a single cutscene, they go to straight to the point. Therefore, all cinematics are fun to watch but aren't the strong point of the game.Gameplay:You are in control of a ballista that can throw spears, rocks, magic bottles to transform enemies in other animals, explosives barrels, etc. What's more, you can spawn troops to aid you, use magic, invoke heroes in the scenario and much more. On top of that, at the end of each level you will win some amount of gold coins, these will help you to upgrade all the mentioned things (projectiles, heroes, spells, and even some rooms that gives you bonuses).As for building your castle, I have found that mechanic a bit tedious. Maybe because I wanted to go straight away to the action and modifying the defaults castles options for certains levels can be a pain in the neck.DLC:In the DLC they add some story to the main campaign, some new units that mainly do the same as the old ones in the main story. However, if you loved the main story is a must to buy, it adds like 10h of gameplay.Summary:I give this game a 7.8/10 Is a must buy when is in sale (buy the version that comes with all de DLC they are worth it!)Is glitchless and well optimized as far as I can tellI hope this review can be helpful to everyone who has doubt whether buying or not this game			"

												Two opposing sides with a castle, a large crossbow, and troops. The objective sometimes changes from mission to mission, however, it typically involves destroying the opponents castle, stealing their flag, or surviving the mission for a specific amount of time. At its core, it is a tower defence game. I beat the main story as well as all the expansion missions. I enjoyed my time.			"

												Decent little game, dificulty isn't really there since you can basically out-gear most levels to get the 4-star rating, and the expansion is basically more-of-the-same with the upgrade names changed to force you to rebuy everything from the ground up... but for the most part I got my money's worth on this title.

												Lots of fun! That is if you like destroying castles. This has a 2D interface that still kind of feels 3D. I would recomend this game to you if you enjoy simple yet still challenging games. Easy physics to understand. Although the controls take a little getting used to, you can adapt pretty quickly and punish your enemies swiftly! Ugrades that are further explored in the castle development aspect definitely adds more depth to the game! Having a blast playing and I'll probably buy the expansions.  =)			"

												Game is amazing. Combines 2 1/2D tower defense, multiple modes of play and strategy with great graphics. Is good fun in local multiplayer split screen mode, although the default screens are smaller than they could be on a larger screen. Definitely one of the more polished titles of its kind on Steam. For more casual play try Cannon Brawl, but this game has a lot more depth.			"

												Great fun game, gave me about 15-20 hours of enjoyment on single player campaign!  Recommend that you start and stay on ""hard"" difficulty as it is too easy otherwise.  There may be a couple optional missions where you have to adjust it down if it gets too tough, but if you are a fan of this style of game, it was really cool.			"

												What a whole lot of fun this game is! It reminds me of the modernization of that ancient Flash game where you defend your castle from stick figures by tossing them into the sky, Defend Your Castle. (Which I guess was a precursor to the Clicker genre, though that particular comparison does not hold with this game.) I'm sure others have pointed to more recent antecedents. The video pretty much gives you everything you need to go on. Stuff if running toward your castle, and you need to keep your ballista firing at the enemy while you send wave after wave of your own troops and occasionally enter the fray with your own hero. There are basic RPGesque improvements to be made, troops and spells and projectiles to be unlocked, that sort of thing. You can also modify your castle to maximize bonuses and structural integrity, but that seemed a little clunky. There isn't really deep strategy at work here--it's much more about tempo management and, of course, your aim. The campaigns are very good, with three or four very different mission types interspersed at good intervals. Boss battles are interesting and require different tactics and so forth. I blew through the main ones in one sitting (~7 hours) on Normal difficulty (thanks, staycation!) and may go back and try them at higher levels. I just picked up two more campaigns as DLC, which I'm looking forward to. All of the bells and whistles are there--cutscenes look good, models look good, jaunty music sounds good. It's a very polished, straightforward kind of game!			"

												Best with a Xbox 360 Controller.The tutorial doesn't drag on like in some games.I like it where everything is upgradeable. you can even go back if you need it.The best part is, I got hooked on this game. (And that's Hard!)it's got great music, Effective graphics, And a great amount of weapons (Projectiles) upgrades for your charector, and, if your feeling like a 'just right' challenge, go for the casual gameplay. Or. Better yet, if you want a challenge, There's also a 'normal' and a 'hard' difficulty to each level.I totally recommend it. If you like tower defense, War and Music. i'd go for it. They really ourdid themselves.			"

												A fantastic little game! I always like it when a game like this takes the light-hearted appraoch. I mean, if you stop and think about it, having opposing castles all over the land seems like a terrible bit of planning for either team. Or maybe they rebuild the same castle everywhere they go? Idk but since the concept makes no sense I am glad they didn't try to take the game too seriously.This game is silly in the best of ways! That does NOT mean it's easy. A few levels were tough enough I had to read about them online before I could get past. The castle building is awesome but don't let that be a selling point. You basically never spend your time looking at your own castle and even when you build it you are forced to focus more on utility than aesthetics. The sound effects and music fit everything perfectly. The DLC: I felt like I got plenty of playtime out of the campaign and I was ready to put this title on the shelf by the end of the ordinary campaign.			"

												CastleStorm is a solid little game that is a derivative of Castle Crush -- that is, the game that Angry Birds' formula is based off of. Gameplay consists of 2 different castles pitted against each other, with an arsenal of projectiles, soldiers, and spells ready to crush the opponent's castle. It's more of a real time version; instead of trying to destroy everything in 1-2 shots, you continuously wear down the castle walls to eventually destroy rooms while also juggling funneling an army at their gates to steal their flag and shooting down enemy projectiles and soldiers to keep them from doing the same.For $4, I didn't expect much, but the gameplay is solid when playing against the AI, and the story can be humorous, although the missions jump all over the place. If you're looking for something akin to the flash game Castle Crush (or Angry Birds), I recommend giving this a go. It's not quite the same, but will definitely scratch that itch and is worth checking out on sale. I give it a 6.5/10.			"
