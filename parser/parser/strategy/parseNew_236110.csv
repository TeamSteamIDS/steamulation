Early Access Review
								So this is the squeal to the Dungeon Defenders series. let's start with pros and cons and give it an equal side.Pros+ LOOT, this is the life force of the game, there is SO much awesome loot.+ Fun game-play with multiple classes you can build or jump on you hero and smack things with a sword, or other weapons.+ Players can be creative with the classes and builds, so you can play your way.+ Large multi player base, Lot's of people playing and it's easy finding a group of people to play with for anything.+ Don't like Multi Player? With one of the recent patches/changes the game has been re-balanced for single players so you're not punished for wanted to play alone!+ A daily quest system that can hold 3 quests! This mean each day a quest will be given, the game will hold 3 for you so you don't have to play every day.+ Don't like a daily quest because it doesn't fit your play style? Or maybe you just don't wanna do it? Then you can re-roll!+ The monthly quest system introduces major rewards making them feel they are really worth doing.+ With how the new item system works alot of gear now introduces abilities and effects to your towers will gives way for more interesting play, frost towers being able to buff the damage of other towers, or having your harpoons explode on each and every target as they pierce the horde of monsters.+ Many maps and modes to play on, you can hit the hard maps for the godly gear or play the normal maps to relax and just bank up your coins and pets.+ Did I mention pets?!! You can find eggs during matches and then take them back to the tavern to be hatched! Pets can do multiple things for you from giving you a boost in stats, damaging the monsters you fight to having a an ability that assists you or damages enemies and there are lots of abilities.+ NO PAY TO WIN  at all Trendy has made it their goal to do this, all micro-transactions are skins for pets,heros and (planned) Tower skins! So towers will look different and have different animations, oh and bags let's talk about bags.+ Trendy has recently introduced a system where you can now Auto gather to specific bags and auto sort with them to keep your cache of loot neat and tidy! You can also customize your bags icons/names to what you want making organization a breeze.+ It may not seem like it, but the developers read every scrap of feed back people offer for the game, the forums are incredibly active and the developers do listen and will partake in the forums and chats, sometimes you may even run in to a white named person in a game and play with em!+ Every week they have a Developer cast on twitch to show case some of the new features, talk to the players, get feed back and improve the game, they will also answer various questions from chat and forums. The developers are really active in the community. + Vibrant art style full of colors and awesome effects.Cons every game has em.- The loved lobby system is no longer, we can no longer scroll through a list and see a list of players playing what maps and what levels they may be or modes they may be running, you just kinda go in to a tavern and go to the war map and join a game based on map and mode, and if there are others playing it will put you with them, if there isent any then it will create a new game for you.- No offline single player, this will effect some more then others.- The RNG in this game is heavy, some times you just want that one item with those beastly tower stats and all that drops is hero skill gear.-The game is currently in alpha, so bugs and other issues are to be expected as well as changes, this may include wipes or changes to the core of the game, so once you get a feel for the game you can lose everything you thought you knew due to the changes,-The pet skins the only negative thing about this is the fact you have to buy and apply a skin before knowing what rarity the pet will be so its a gamble and not a very good one.-There are some Anti Troll mechanics put in to place for the actual game, but while in the tavern they have almost free reign(can always make a private tavern to bypass this though)-4 classes at this time there are only 4 classes in the game so options can feel limited, however trendy has said they will release more heros(free)- NPC shop keepers kinda have nothing useful for sale, all the good stuff is out there in the monsters gullets! So get out there and get chopping--Pet hatching time is a bit long, as of now it's 8 hours for a single pet to hatch, that's real time, there is talk from the devs that the time may change soon.- Unlike DD1 the mana is sparse so you have to play more carefully so no more maxing out all dem towers and seeing all the pretty stars.- The current lack of content you can play on multiple maps on multiple modes which is really fun, but I just wish there was more raw content, I know they are working on it though.Over All I would recommend this game, please remember this game is in alpha, so if that bothers you then you may wanna wait or go watch some game play on twitch or youtube before you decide, if you're like myself and don't mind a few bumps here and there and get to watch the game grow then jump on it.

Early Access Review
								17.10.15 - I'm recommending it now and will replace the review below once it gets out of early access.--I loved Dungeon Defenders 1, I even loved the nightmare-gear gap that a lot of people struggled with. This is my opinion about DD2 on Day1/2.DD2, out of the box and eventhough it still is in early access, is a heavily gated experience. It forces you through an abyssmal grind while isolating you from the rest of the player base the higher you go. Personal skill isn't rewarded, but how many times you attempted a mission. You can win a campaign map but it doesn't unlock the next one - something I have never seen before - it's behind a ridiculous mechanic where you have to grind previous maps over and over for XP until the next one unlocks even if you wouldn't have any problems winning the next ones. You can't even attempt harder maps or harder difficulties. I know a fair deal of grinding, but I don't understand why a game won't let you progress even if you conquered all the maps you've previously played. The whole war table thing doesn't make any sense and should be abolished because a system where players are put into tiers is dumb.A lot of my fun in DD1 was figuring out placements, but it seems it has been completely thrown out of the window here.If you're too strong, the game just downscales all of your stats/towers and always attempts to put you on the verge of barely winning. It's good if you want that sort of challenge, but the game also forces you through this item progression grind. In DD1 you could perfectly well do maps below Nightmare if you knew how to play. You would also believe that finishing on normal would unlock harder difficulties for the map - it doesn't, you have to accumulate a ton of XP until the game decides you're up for 'hard' mode on specific maps. It doesn't make any sense, considering that the game limits your access of maps depending on your level. Most of the times you will not be able to even replay levels in the next tier. So the progression system actually regresses the options you should have available. WHY?I think this is all an effort to stop people from twinking and powerleveling, because otherwise selling gold or other services isn't going to be profitable in the future if it wasn't obstructed. Which is probably going to be a big deal because even upgrading your gear requires a lot of gold to a point where you waste more gold on a level 1 upgrade than you possibly get from finishing a map. That's completely bonkers. Though there are a few silver linings.The PC version is well done, as opposed to DD1 which struggled with a lot of port problems. Eventhough there are a lot of interface options, it's still lacking a way to disable ally health and enable that tower health is always being shown or at least if it's on low health. I like the concept of the chests at the end and that you don't have to complete all waves to still get a reward. Actually between finishing or failing a map there is very little incentive, aside from the possible higher rarity loot at the end and slightly more xp depending on the wave you were. All that matters in the end is that you've attempted it and you get your fair share of a reward. It turns everyone into a winner, behind a heavily grind/gated based mechanic. I can't recommend this to anyone who loved DD1, as it is right now. Wait for it to come out in 1-2 years and hope that they didn't turn this into a game on-par with a mindless cow clicker and with more substance instead. Also be aware that this game can only be played if you are online, it's basically a mmo.			"

Early Access Review
 Here, I am going to explain the Dungeon Defenders PC lineup to you in TL;DR fashion: DD1 (Dungeon Defenders - that's the first one) Base game is best value for money, boasts great replayability and lots of tower defence & hack 'n slashing fun and great to get your feet wet. DLC rather steep: Â£5 will get you a single map and a challenge, slightly less may get you a single character, less than that may get you a costume.  DLC price total is triple that of the original game. DLC controversy due to not only being overpriced but creating a divide in playerbase (People with DLC's couldn't play those without DLC's) and a heavy power creep in new gear making the late game shamefully easy for veterans and causing many newer players to hit a wall they could not surpass (say goodbye to winning any online PvP challenges!). Hacking became an issue - as of current has mostly died off though abuse of Steam Workshop has created massive Mana (Money) / EXP / Hacked Gear generation maps, as tempting as it is, don't do it. You'll ruin the game for yourself.Advise people interested in the series to start here - buy full package (That means game + DLC) on Steam Sale, Indie Bundle or otherwise where cheapest. DDE (Dungeon Defenders Eternity - the worst one) A rereleased version of DD1 - purported as the 'definitive' version, which is basically a glorified DD2 beta - testing out features of the new engine for the recent DD2 release, I'm not even going to list the features here - they are so insubstantial to what was lost and you just shouldn't bother even considering buying this one. No Local Multiplayer.  No Steam Workshop. Always (forcibly) online, with god awful connection - just trust me on this one. Ingame store with microtransactions despite already having paid for the bloody thing. This is the MOBILE PHONE version of the game ported to PC.Would not recommend to my worst enemy. DD2 (Dungeon Defenders 2 - What you're actually here for) I was incredibly wary of DD2 upon hearing of its release - having read other reviews I made the decision to take the plunge into buying Early Access, here's what I think, take it as you will: ~ Larger emphasis on combat, for better or worse depending on your own personal tastes: each class has had their number of unique skills increased from DD1 from 2 -> 3, however the total types of towers each has fell from 5 -> 4. + Combat, thankfully, feels better for the most part. + Animations are more lively than the previous game. + Skill spheres are a pretty cool concept. + Microtransactions ingame grant no play bonuses to those that pay for them (ergo: no pay-to-win), and Trendy have made the promise to keep to this. - ...But damn, ingame purchases are expensive: for a single Monk Ninja costume it will cost you 1200 gems - the equivalent of $12. - Characters are normalized across the board: no colour customization at the time of writing and the game has lost the RPG character development in favour of gear being the sole provider of stat boosts, along with Skill Spheres, which, depending on the size can increase stats by variable amounts or completely change the way a facet of your character works (such as a tower's mode of fire) though there aren't many of these at the time of writing either. - Characters feel somewhat imbalanced - Monk and Huntress have great synergy together (for those who have/n't played: Geyser Traps and Electric Aura can stun & damage for days) which writes off the viability of the Squire (my class) and the Apprentice - which is a shame because while tower synergy is really cool, the current designs indicate little synergy outside of the Monk-Huntress combo I mentioned - making them more popular for people who know of it. - Maps can feel claustrophobic compared to the previous game (we're only counting DD1 as a comparative: screw DDE). - It's always online - you can host a Private Game and play by yourself, but good luck: this game was NOT meant for soloing, and is significantly harder to do so alone, considering prior shady practices of Trendy in and outside of DD (look them up, and need I mention DDE again), it's worrying that once this game - as an MMO - gets out of Early Access, they may simply drop it if the money isn't good enough anymore, meaning people who have invested into the game will flat out no longer be able to play it (which is my biggest overall apprehension - but it can't really be avoided). Final Thoughts As surprising as it was, despite my skepticism I still really enjoyed (and am currently enjoying) my time playing DD2, and was impressed for what it offered, being pre-alpha.Do buy if you: Are crazy for another blast of Dungeon Defending goodness. Have tried it elsewhere and like it and can see yourself playing it in future (It's good value for money!). Or alternatively you're one of many Steam-goers who just likes wasting money on games they'll never likely play.Don't buy if you: Have never played DD1: try that first and THEN consider this game. Didn't like DD1 - at the time of writing it still currently stands as the best of the  three  two Dungeon Defenders games. Felt that stat allocation and creation of character builds was vital to your enjoyment of DD1 - as an MMO this game currently just doesn't boast the allowance for such individuality and feels homogenized as a result. Are on the fence on the matter - you can always wait rather than waste your student loan on an eventual F2P MMO. Don't have enough money in your Bank Account/Steam Wallet/Steam Point Card because Steam will refuse to let you purchase a game you can't afford and you'll just look like an idiot.All in all, I actually really enjoyed myself, and got the Collector's Edition on top of that to show my support: don't let me down Trendy.Edit: Steam completely destroyed my formatting for some reason.Most recent Edit: â¥â¥â¥â¥ dis grame "

Early Access Review
								EDIT: Made my points clearer, and fixed some of my horrendous grammar.EDIT 2:I've added some more points.DISCLAIMER:I have some 200~ hours as of the time of writing because I've been mindlessly farming stuff I hope to trade some day, not because there's actually this much content.Please read this, Trendy, for the sake of your game. Trendy saw, read and responded. I'm impressed. I just hope you'll take some of this to heart.They didn't.TL;DR at the bottom.It is a good game, right now a downgrade from DD1 sure, but a good game still.  I'd like nothing more than to change my review to a positive one, but It has some concerning flaws that makes me want to discourage the purchase of any dlc/gems until they are fixed though, especially since Trendy seems more intent on making more skins rather than adding content or fixing bugs. The game is still in alpha with alpha amounts of content, and its making me kinda nervous when Trendy is saying they're planning on releasing the game this year.They are as follows:Loot and loot customization/upgrading is completely shallow compared to DD1. Items have class specific traits though that make 99% of the loot you find without said stats useless, making it harder (read: not in a good way) to progress. In dd1 you could just grab near any piece of decent loot and upgrade theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥out of it. All gear say for some legendaries are now trash. There's no real achievement to getting legendary pets either, considering a single onslaught run up to 15 gets me on average at least one. Getting good loot used to be such a rush...Upgrading your loot nets you about one items worth of the single stat you want, whereas in DD1, depending on how much mana you had and the upgrade levels, the benefits could be massive. This makes upgrading to get a grand total of 300 tower health split across all your items such a letdown.The game has general lag and disconnecting issues for many players, even while playing singleplayer(!). The game runs over 60 fps, mostly, but never 144 fps, even on my gtx 970 and i7-4770k... And suffers frequent fps drops in certain areas, like the tavern. .  It runs better now. Still suffers a lot in the multiplayer hub area, but its much better.There are few maps, most of which not really that interesting, and no fun challenges like in the previous game (incursion is just more mobs and minibosses, onslaught is near pointless to do for anything other than golden egg farming). This, combined with the loot problems doesn't exactly encourage the progression into the higher nightmares.No trading (yet?) and no playershops. This was a really big part of the previous game for me and many of my friends who enjoyed DD1. Customizing your very own tavern with your items and having your achievements on display was a really neat feature.They keep using the words ""Play [the hero] your way"" in the devstreams, but in reality, there's only the four builds (dps, towerdps, waller and hybrid), and mostly just the same way of beating levels with the same ways of placing turrets.Trendy is adding more heroes as their first priority (according to what I hear on the devstream) and I think it is the wrong way around, they need to add more stuff to do with those heroes rather than the heroes themselves. Otherwise it just feels like doing the same over and over only barely different.The reason I list this bunch of cons and not recommending the game is because I have a blind hope that trendy can fix their game and make it live up to its grand potential. I'll thumb this review up in an instant if Trendy ever decides to fix some of these issues.TL;DR This game is good, it is a dungeon defenders game, but everything it has from DD1, it has less of.

								So the core DD experience is here. If that's all your looking for, than your good. However as someone who paid for the game before it went free to play and ended up buying a bit of the ""premium currency"". I didn't think that much into it because the currency was almost entirely for cosmetic stuff. Fast forward to today. I picked it up again after a lengthy break (almost a year). First thing I noticed was: Damn this game is STILL in early access?!. The second thing was the new characters locked behind a paywall requiring you to invest tens of hours into it just to unlock ONE, or fork over cash for them. I regret every penny I put down on this game. After investing all the money I did and hundreds of hours of play time I still have characters locked behind a paywall. That is unacceptable.			"

								This review is mostly addressed to the players of Dungeon Defenders 1 that have not probably experienced DD2 yet. I will try to save you some frustrationg, disappointment and money in the process. This is a copy/paste from my post at the official forums here: https://dungeondefenders.com/2/topic/131203/ with a few edits so that it makes more sense as a review. Hope it does not get deleted from the forums so you can always refer to it.Note that this is not a negative review because of bugs or early access status etc. This is due to design choices and the direction the game is taking.Dungeon Defenders II or ""Farming players for cash."" or ""How you go from a great game, to a mediocre one in order to increase revenue"". Take your pick.Everything that is wrong with this game is everything that differentiates it from Dungeon Defenders 1.Meaning:a)The Hero Deck. It is awful, restricting, makes it impossible to solo high difficulty if you need to do so, makes you go in and out on multiplayer as people join up who have what you need but..not in their deck. Hey we all left our purge monks out of the deck. The moment you decide to bring your monk, no one has whatever else is missing...b) The match creation/joining system. Old DD1 was just great. The current one is a mess.c) No bank, selling inventory space and generating content that clutters inventory space. Consumables are now in the game, yeah!! NOT.d) Loot went from huge amounts or interesting loot, item sets, etc (DD1) to loot that only allow cookie cutter builds (forget hybrids folks).e) Tedious monthlies. Seriously 50 pet affection levels? 600 waves? Leveling pets you don't need on maps that generate loot that you don't need. Yeah!! You're a casual gamer? Have a job? Family? Tough luck buddy.f) Timers on eggs. What for? Inventory clutter. Buy bags, buy gems.g) Did I mention separate pet inventory? Buy more bags and gems.e) Overpriced skins/models, yeah! 4800 gems to show your support and buy a new character model. Wait, I already showed my support with the collector's edition and the awakened pack. You obviously need even more support. Yet because I missed the ""promotion"" (which also required buying!) I can't be recognized as a DD1 veteran. Shows how much you support me, the player that's been loyal to you and already supported you with lots of money although they smelled the direction this was going for. I didn't want the gems that came with the promotion, I only wanted the title. It's the first game ever that I see requiring a payment for giving you a title recognizing you as a veteran from the previous game (and I collect games for over 25 years--1035 games 872 DLCs owned currently on Steam alone). Every game out there that offers such title, all they require is you owning the previous title (which of course I own, with all available DLCs). And I own 2 of copies with all the DLCs, not one. Because I played it with my other half.f) Overpriced skins for pets that you gamble your money on. Yes, I can't even buy the skin I like and apply it to the pet I farmed for. I have to buy/spend gems to transform eggs to get random quality that may or may not have the elemental damage I want. Ad infinitum.g) Here comes the carnival event. Offering a wheel that drops up to 700ipwr legendaries (at least not like the useless shops that cap at 550) with bad combinations of stats and..inventory clutter. Masks(see head skins) that you don't even get to keep, they're consumable and serve as inventory clutter. Either you use them up immediately/sell them or if you want to save them, buy even more gems/bags. While the good part of the event requires..gems again!h) We now know there will be many more heroes coming up! Heroes that you have to buy space for. And skins for. With.. gems! The perpetual carrot. You wanted a MOBA element to this game exactly for this reason, the community of old DD1 players said no and you backed off, yet you kept the MOBA carrot in the game, new heros every other week, new skins for the new heroes, new things to buy gems for. Ad infinitum. Yet, the existing heroes have useless towers, bad combinations and there are only cookie-cutter builds viable. But sure, lets get more heroes because strategy and tower defense is not the point. The point is having new heroes and new skins every month so we have something to spend gems on.I could go on. And I'm sorry for the sarcastic tone in my post but I feel that this way it gets the message across much better. We played DD1 because it was a fun game of tower defense with FPS elements that required strategy as well. This game is turning into the mindless perpetual money making machine that defines games like League of Legends etc. I have already deeply regretted that I supported this title but obviously the romantic in me, smothered the cynical critic and hoped that it would not go this way after all.I have already paid a lot for DD2, but from now on I will not spend another cent on it UNLESS it changes business model, or at least adds a SINGULAR pay-once-for-everything option and addresses the real issues with the game instead of creating perpetual carrots. Fix all existing heroes so that they all have viable tools with synergies with each other and provide content updates in terms of new maps etc that require strategy instead of things that constantly require gems or indirectly just cause an influx of revenue. EVERYTHING that was fun in DD1 is missing from DD2 or has turned into something that generates revenue.This report/review will go up on steam as well as my negative review, addressed to the players of DD1 that may have not yet experienced this, in order to perhaps save them from the frustration and disappointment that I personally experienced.

Early Access Review
								As of early access. I have to give this one a thumbsdown and here's why.First of all the positive:Graphics - Game looks a lot better than the previous in my opinion. It  doesn't look blocky, It looks smooth. Lighting's quite impressive and it is also colourful which is what I like about the game. Not to mention they actually manage to put a little bit of realness(if that's a word) to it by making trees sway, leaves on trees move and grass and other plantation have animation as well.Items - The item actually looks better in terms of quality. Like my squire for example I have a common, epic and mythical sword. By looking at the three the higher the quality the better than look of the weapon, I mean I played DD1 and a lot of the time, I prefer the looks of my supreme quality items than my ultimate quality ones which doesn't make sense since you want to make the better quality to look more epic, right?Character specs- Ok I like this on my squire since It got specwhere it would make my barricade have a chance to stun enemies after hitting and knocking them back which is good for a defensive structure.Now heres the bad part:Character specs- Even though I said good things about character specs, The fact of the matter is that, there's not many of them and some of them are just outright useless like the ""powerful spears"" on my squire. 18 im at lvl 13 with 18 spec points and If i use it on ""shiny spikes"" which makes my barricades stun, It gets a 47.62% chance to stun while If I use 18 specs points on powerful spears, I would give me 3% chance for my ballistas to do penetration do full dmg which is sooo low considering there's no stats to add when you level up to get more defense speed, these are all items based now. Im guessing to prevent people from using cheat engine like DD1 but that is just bad.Structure's Stats - Ok There's no way to increase your structure's range other than upgrade....Yep..you heard it right. Ok how does this affect the game you might ask? Considering that there's barely any green crystals(currency to build turrets and stuff) you are pretty much stuck with at most time tier 1 or tier 2 upgrade and not to mention that YOU HAVE TO PROTECT them for a round because 100% of time at my level, it gets destroyed because at the first round you get 230 crystals so for example i put in a ballista which cost 50crystals and upgrade it to tier 1 for another 50 crystal and tier 2 to make it decent cost 100 crystals and the best at my level is tier 3 which is 150 crystals. Now as you can see, at 1st round you can only go up to tier 2 and that is only ONE structure while the maps have several of these paths where enemies will spawn! so you are forced to almost not upgrade any of your structures at 1st round because you will NEED barricades to at least slow enemies down and 60% of the time, they get destroyed because of the fact that theres about 4 enemies on my level that would far outrange all my structures including the ballista which makes structures almost useless at my level. Firebomb chucking enemies, Dragon that fire fireballs from its mouth, spear throwers and flying dragons all outrange any structures from any classes that is IF you do not upgrade which is more likely what you are going to do because green crystals are soo limited. What the hell?Sort Button - No sort button considering you can easily get full inventory quite quickly unless of course you got the gold to buy more inventory spaces.Item/Stat Downscale - You get downgraded when you try and do low level maps which is just bad because grinding is much more tedious now considering the game is based on grinding for items and most of the time you get sweet (F word) all. I just don't like the way DD have changed from its previous predecessor. It feels more forced into you like you are forced to grind for level to unlock the next skill or map. The range enemies need nerfing and what the hell is up with the ogre? It can one hit kill my barricades with 8k hp (either this is a bug or intended I do not know). There is not much variety in terms of classes. You still have your base classes with almost the same structures as in DD1. The only good thing is your character's skills, it's more useful now and is actually needed in order to win the game such as the earthquake attk that stuns AoE for squire. However,  I really think they need to improve on this, I know it's only early access but I cannot recommend it at the moment in its current state. Wait for it till it goes free to play.Edit: Edited Structure Stats			"

								Even in pre-alpha, DD2 expands on what made the original Dungeon Defenders great. A better loot system, more customization, and an overall more rewarding feeling that the original, and well beyond what most games offer. If you were a fan of the original DD, this is a must-have.			"

Early Access Review
								tl dr: Not a tower defense game anymore. With the addition of a new enemy Siege Roller that can only be damaged by heroes, not towers and him being present everywhere the only way to win a map is to get 4 dps hero players, while towers are left with a little support role as any hero can hold off lanes on his own. Yes the new enemy is no problem for hero dps, but thats about the problem! this renders defenses pointles thus this game became an ARPG instead of a Tower Defense game.Oh and solo play? forget it, this enemy can come 2-3 lanes at same time, and you alone can only do one. Thus this new addition killed solo play.Oh and in a tower defense game it should matter ur wisdom of how to place towers right? well NO, only matters how much time you spend to farm equip to get the right rolls, oh and there are alot of rolls and RNG on top of RNG on top of RNG. First RNG is how much ipwr this item has, then what stats it has, then the stats range and then the passives and then the passives range! thats 5x chained RNG! This game is not about tower defense, its about farming gear and throwing out 10000 items till you find that one that fits your build. Oh and then next month comes with an update and trashs your build and tells you: farm again for new flavor of the month!There is no real space to place towers any way different then designed. The distance between enemy spawn and cores is the firing distance of towers. You have only this one option to build and no other tactical options. Only thing that matters are stats on items to make your towers stronger.This game has tower defense tag on steam. This is simply wrong, its an action RPG with small tower defense elements.And even as action RPG it fails, all heroes have 4 action skills and 4 towers, while gunwitch has 8 action skills and is supossed to be pure dmg hero. Well what does our lovely rollie do? yeah he simply is immune to all skills! The only way to kill him is hold leftclick down oh what a joy! autoattack! Gunwitch spells that perfectly fine work on all other bosses dont work on this one. And ofc to have the dps of leftclick you need items, see above lol. Example on huntress that has oilflusk and phoenix to set the oil ablaze(basically napalm), a nice combination of 2 skills right? well rollie ignores that completely. Leftclick for the grind!!!			"

								Edited, yet again.I'm not sure where to begin at the moment. Part of me loves this game and wants it to succeed so very much, and part of me is very bitter at the moment.I'll try my best to explain why, and you can make the call based on that, whether or not it's worth your time.Leveling, and getting to max level is not bad at all and in fact if that's all you intend to do, I say play it, you have nothing to lose really and things are quite fun especially if you have multiple friends to play with. The art is well done, the gameplay is quite smooth and it's a fun casual relaxed experience which I think anyone can enjoy really. Here's where it starts to get gritty, and you'll either hate it or love it for the most part. Once you're maxed level, and you want to start to improve your gear, there's really not much left to be desired. You'll play the same maps you were playing, only with higher HP monsters and higher damage. And you'll not see any variation from that at all. Allow me to reiterate:Onslaught, previously Survival in Dungeon Defenders, is â¥â¥â¥â¥. Literally. I'm not going to sugar coat it, it's a big steaming pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥. Literally the only reason people run it, is on a super low difficulty, so they can farm gold. Rewards suck. The time it takes to do sucks. Nothing special about it at all. Don't even waste your time, IMO. Incursion, a slightly different variation from maps, but really nothing different other than throwing mass quantities of mobs at you in each lane. Yeah I guess it's harder but it really doesn't bring anything new to the table. Nothing new, just more mobs, more HP and more damage. Sounds so fun right?Nightmare 1-4 is my gripe with the game, I suppose. In DD1, we had one nightmare mode and that was it. This game tried to change that and it's pretty much fell flat on its face. There is no difference between Nightmare 1-4 outside of damage numbers. So much engaging gameplay. So you farm the same enemies while you're leveling, to continue farming the same enemies through nightmare 1-4 only scaled higher. Absolutely nothing different, you'll run the same maps until your eyes bleed, and then more.Pets are bland. Seriously if you played DD1, you're going to be very disappointed here. Liked that mega chicken and it's badass DPS from DD1? Well sorry to say you're going to laugh when you see the pets here. Overall, this game lacks the fun that Dungeon Defenders 1 had in all aspects. No goofy weapons, no goofy pets, nothing fun at all. Defense speed and range are not a thing here, and I hope you like watching a tower fire slow as hell. Gear is boring in every since of the word, and you'll see what I mean if you play this in comparison to DD1. The same stats, and you'll be looking for 1% upgrades which is laughable to me. Don't even get me started on the â¥â¥â¥â¥ they've pulled with the latest update they had in which they threw a carnival at us when the game has been needing core changes for months, and what do we get along with it? A 40$ costume that's a reskin. Yes, you read that right. A frickin costume that's 40 bucks. I believe in supporting a game if you enjoy it, but they seriously overstepped their bounds on this. Every patch seems to roll out costume after costume and core gameplay changes that need to be made, have yet to make it into the game.Take a look at steamcharts and you can see what I mean. TL;DR: If you enjoy casual relaxed play and just shooting the â¥â¥â¥â¥ with friends and trying out a tower defense game to level to max level and not expect much more than that, check it out. If you want fun, laughs, and was hoping to see a sequal to the dungeon defenders name, and are expecting a hell of a fun time, avoid it. My two cents, take it or leave it. Obviously I can't cover every major gripe/perk of the game, and if you want a good view on what players think, check the forums out for yourself and you'll get an idea for how negative they are, especially after last patch.Obviously I want better changes to come, and I hope they do, I'd really like to recommend this game, but sadly in its current state, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

								I fell in love with the dungeon defenders franchise with the first game.. It was a wonderful mix of genres and I just loved it. Then in came Eternity, which had some improvements, but also made the game a bit less fun, due to the lack of local co-op (don't know if that was changed at a later date, but when I played, there was none).Then in came Dungeon Defenders II, and I was excited.. Bought it as soon as I had the money for it and I liked it.. I liked it a lot.. Just like many other reviews have mentioned before, you got some premium money (gems) when you bought the game when it first came to early access, and back then there was no talks about any other uses for gems aside from costumes & more inventory space. So I spent my gems and kept playing.. Then there wasn't enough new content to keep me interested, felt like updates came far too seldom.. Then I heard that there'd be a new character coming, the abyss lord.. and I got all excited about the game again.. Started my game up & tried making a new character aaaand then I noticed that the character costs gems.. or ""hero medals"".. That just broke my heart. The game series that I had loved and spent hundreds upon hundreds of hours playing, was just turning in to an early access f2p moneygrabber.. If you liked the original dungeon defenders, go play that instead. Or if you want to try this one, don't waste your money on it. I'm out 20â¬, and what I got to show for that, is a couple of outfits for my characters.. or I could've gotten a character unlocked, if I'd saved my gems for a year and a half. It's unfortunate, but this game series got ruined with the switch to a free to play model.. sure.. It's free to play, unless you want to get a new character & not have to grind for day after day to get your hero medals to unlock said characters with.			"

								A few months ago I would have recommended this.But then since their new Trials & Chaos update, it's been very downhill.It's essentially still the same game, but instead of tower defense with hero assist, it's the other way around with hero base defense with tower support.Every time the community comes up with an easy way to do something or a powerful item combination, the devs decide to patch it and nerf it until it is virtually useless.There is a lot of unexplained things related to progression that you have to check or ask on forums.  Most of the progression is gated by daily medals now because the gold you get from doing maps is so little, and you are required to spend these medals/gold to find upgrades.Microtransactions are mostly cosmetic, the exception being buying an alternative hero instead of spending a month saving up medals, and bagslots because boy do you need a lot of bagslots.  The new shards system uses up a lot of bagspace, duplicates do not stack, and some of them you may need a lot of.What with shards, there is a lot of grinding, so much so that even if you can complete Chaos4 or Chaos5 difficulties, you'll still be spending most of your time in Chaos1 for very rare & essential shards.  The higher difficulties also do not give proportional rewards, so it is still best to grind Chaos1 for exp, gold, and medals.In it's current state it is worse than it used to be and not even worth trying.  (I don't know how bad it might be to level from 1-50 right now, but I've heard transitioning from 50 to chaos1 is much harder than it should be)			"

								Dungeon Defenders wasn't great, but it had a lot of potential. Unfortunately Trendy seems to have gone backwards rather then forwards... Overpowered heroes sold at ridiculous prices, costumes with less variety at a high price and, in my opinion, poor enemy design that punishes players for not playing a certain way. Hopefully they can turn this around, since it's in ""Alpha"" but I wouldn't hold my breath.			"

								Defense Council Member, meaning I've played the game since like 2012 or 2013 when it was in pre-pre-pre Alpha as a Child's Play perk with no sound or anything, and I believe the first few days all you could just walk around in the tavern. I've played a lot, you can see the hours on record, and that's not counting any of the time before it even hit Steam. Played through every iteration, ""wipe-a-geddon"" last summer and beyond.The game is just not nearly as fun as the first and it is ******* prohibitively expensive. It's kind of hilarious that in DD1 people would complain that a new hero would come out and it was five bucks or a new map and it was two bucks and you could usually get them on sale for half off. Here, get ready to shell out a whopping $15 for a character, which is beyond insane. Look at the value in that vs something like Smite, where $20 or $30 (depending on the sale) would get  you every character and all future characters which is up to somewhere around 80 characters right now. Are you kidding me? And don't say they are optional, the Abyss Lord on his own is better than all 4 starter heroes combined and it's not even close. Everything in this game needs to realistically cost half of what it currently costs. But pricing structure aside, I have no idea why they got rid of the action wheel HUD for trap placement for controllers like the first game. It was basically perfect and now they have some weird layout that has taken almost 4 years to implement. Also, every time there is an update or a patch, the game will wipe out all your custom controls and you have to redo them every time. Neat feature. And finally, the only gear you equip that changes your appearance is your weapon. So if you find some sweet looking armor or helm, nah... it's not going to show on your character. That's kind of unforgivable in 2016. I used to really pull for this game but now I simply just don't care. I'd rather go back to the first one which is something I never, ever thought I'd say.			"

								I tried. I really, really tried.Ever since I bought this game in 2014, I continued to throw my time and genuine effort at it, hoping to get at the very least a decent sequel to DD1. I even ignored the very clear warning sign that was the release of DD Eternity  (DD1 was abandoned to hackers, then repacked and...sold again under a new name, wham, bam, profit). Today, with the game about ready to leave yet another developement stage, instead of having hope and tons of fun playing the game, I am disgusted and bitterly dissapointed.Let's put the issues I have with DD2 in a neat list, so that I can check myself for bad language after each point I make. Yeah I'm bitter, can you tell? :/ DD2 used to reward maps played with full 4 people team with better loot. Nowadays, it heavily punishes co-op with difficulty spike added with each player (why on earth would devs do that?!), often alienating players not willing to farm for days for equipment for a full set of builders and creating issues amongst people trying to play together yet failing. Oh and public games for higher difficulties? Pretty much dead, thanks to exactly that. Every update leads to massive issues, game-breaking bugs, giant lag spikes and results in the need to implement at least 1 (often more) makeshift patch. Updates are usually 1,7gb, patches are often just as big. While I enjoy a fiber connection, there are still people who sometimes need to wait 2-3 hours to play this game after every mess the devs try to fix. Out of all the games I have, DD2 has the worst update management I have ever seen. Yeah...part of the issue with updates? No real testing. Yep, that's right - DD2 utilises a remote testing group, with disastrous results. Rtg mostly consists of players waaay too devoted to the game to be objective (been there, done that, never again), hence their feedback doesn't represent the majority of playerbase. Has that ever worked well? No. Stupid overlooked things, like boots with a certain passive on a boost aura (that was actually years ago and it didn't teach devs anything), towers doing crazy damage or being suddenly broken, etc., that's the stuff those ""testers"" never find.  FUBAR hitboxes - from never updated tower hitboxes (remember when towers were smaller? no? no worries, their hitboxes remember! /sarcasm), to absurdly big hitboxes of environment (why are some leaves and twigs not simply textures, ffs?), oh and let's not forget the glorious moments where you see mobs pushing themselves over your barricades, where you can literally see how the outlines of crazy hitboxes push against other mobs. Such a fun away to lose a map. And why the hell am I constantly stuck on stuff I can't even bloody see?! Bugs take forever to fix. And by forever I mean years in some cases. YEARS. One of the bugs I reported in 2015 I think? is still there. I ended up thinking of it as my own pet bug and I named it Clarence. Our requests, even the most reasonable ones, also take forever to be even considered. With the light beams from loot littering maps, we whined and begged and asked for help with that for months. Rewards for early stage supporters? Still bugged. Guess we weren't all that ""valued"" after all. Bye bye, Grumpy. All the passives and most special weapons, that had their own history and were tied to the game's storyline and certain maps, were recently nuked and turned to shards. Yeah, makes sense - spend months developing special items and passives, get people to enjoy them and farm them enthusiastically, then...go to nuke city. Perfect logic. Response to tickets? Lol what? If your pet is suddenly gone, forget it. You can fill countless tickers, nobody is getting back to you - unless you're a streamer of a member of the forum suck...err, I mean, forum enthusiasts. If you're a streamer, you will get 2 dracoliches in mail without even asking (yes, that happened). No, I'm not bitter, I wanted to get rid of that perfect, expensive, fully evolved lil Betsy anyway /sarcasm. DD2 is NOT eye friendly. God forbid if you have epilepsy or headaches induced by flashes, because DD2 is a hot mess of special effects that no longer make any â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ sense and serve only to make things harder and more tiresome. If you ever have any doubts about the level of professional training and education Trendy has, just turn all the video options in DD2 to default. Enjoy the crazy excess of bloom and your complimentary seizure. DD2 performs really bad in terms of fps, fluidity of gameplay etc. I can easily run much bigger games and never notice any kind of issues, but DD2 tends to get choppy and laggy for no reason. Co-op sucks as well - in other games I can join servers on other continents and barely notice any lag, but with DD2 it's sometimes impossible to play with someone 2 towns away. For years now, we are being forced into a closed loop cycle of new content, patched mistakes, change of direction, new content. You either join the train and win new content with exploits and bugged towers/abilities, or enjoy being left behind (did I mention Trendy is NOT building a healthy and happy playerbase?) Let's leave this list at that, I'm just not sure I can write down the rest without resorting to really foul language and obvious jabs at the devs. I am thoroughly dissapointed with the state this game is in. And it's not just a current thing - it feels like for years with every tiny step forward, we took 2 steps back and were hit in the face, our daughter ran off with the gardener and someone kicked our puppy. Repeatedly.  TL;DR  version: it's terrible. I waited, I helped, and it still didn't matter...DD2 took every good thing from DD1 and....threw it out the window. It also flipped it a bird and went to drink toxic moonshine with terrible devs and fanboys.			"

								I bought into this game way back when it was a wee baby DD2. I loved so many aspects about it, and I was hooked on the progression. But this recent trials patch took everything I loved about the game (the progression, the loot drop rate, the ability to specialize in DPS or Tower, laid back and stress free tower defence if you wanted) and crushed it into everything I hate about these kinds of games (super slow progression, scary low drop rates, No ability to specialize in tower or DPS, No more time to relax).As a game design student, I would love to get my hands on a project like this at an internship level! Wish you guys had summer internships. xDTrendy, If you are looking over your reviews and community discussions, please take a good look at what your community has to say, and consider a re-design or a rewind. After reading some recent reviews, it does not seem that I am alone on this one.I will consider rewriting this review upon a redesign or rewind on the design of this game.			"

								If you played DD1, you will quickly see that this game is completely gutted. From the leveling to the gear to the social interaction. Leveling:-In DD1, leveling always was fun, at any time, you could pick which map you felt you were strong enough for, and you     were rewarded for completing more challenging maps. -In DD2, it doesn't matter which map you choose, it is much faster to just play the quickest (hard difficulty) map possible, and keep repeating the process. The difficulty is trivial at best, and it just feels like a chore.Loot:-In DD1, loot is very diverse when it comes to the stats on the items that are dropped. There is a continuous search on any map for those rare pieces of gear with the perfect stats for your character. Many times, there are pieces with negative stats, because other stats on the gear are over leveled, and it is up the player to decide if the loss in some stats, is worth the gain in others. This makes you want to see how far you can push yourself in each wave to find the most overleveled piece of gear possible, even if it means sacrificing all of your character health and damage, for a full tower stat item.-In DD2, all loot feels linear. You progress through the maps which have an indicator of what item level of loot will drop. You run the map and get gear that is slightly better than the previous map. You repeat the process, slowly getting better, but never standing out for pushing yourself. You never feel the need to push yourself.Social Interaction/trading:-In DD1, you get your own tavern, where you can place items on the floor of your shop, or in your personal shop. In your personal shop, you set prices on any items you wish to sell for mana(currency). Players tend to place the best items on the floor, in an attempt to barter with players that join their shop. It really makes you feel like you are selling something that has meaning, because items can have very unique stats. This makes the player WANT to go do more tougher and tougher maps to improve their shop. Having a personal tavern is one of the best aspects of the whole game, you can spend hours just setting your shop up the way you want it, and chat with customers who enter.-In DD2, trading is non-existent. You get a personal tavern, but can't sell or trade.Please Trendy, randomize stats on loot based on map difficulty instead of just increasing the gear by a percentage. Give us taverns that we can sell our items that we work for, and let us level up the way we want to, with more experience based on how tough the map and difficulty is.			"

								Yes yes yes.  The game is great.  Fans of the first game which is also good should enjoy this, and newcomers should as well.  Fans of Dungeon Defenders Eternity, well...we don't talk about that one, but you should enjoy this too.Currently there are 4 characters.  The monk, the squire, the apprentice, and my personal favorite, the huntress.  Each one has 3 different abilities (with the 4th always being a heal) and 4 different kinds of towers/defenses.  Use these to fend off waves of monsters and bosses who follow paths to try and destroy whatever it is you're defending.  As you play, you will get all kinds of loot drops.  Armor pieces, weapons, and eggs which can be hatched into a bunch of different kinds of pets.  There are quite a few maps, as well as higher difficulties and some different modes to play.  As you level up, you can also unlock special slots that you can place various passive buffs in.You can play solo, with 3 randoms, or a private lobby with friends.  You'll all be gathered into a cool little player HUB area before you start, where there are all kinds of things you can do.  I do believe however that you need an internet connection to play, so keep that in mind.  If that bothers you, stick with the first game or wait until this one is released and goes F2P.  Lots of fun, definitely worth checking out.			"

It has some features I like a lot that are not in the previous game, and while it is not as good as DD1 at this current time it is still in early access, and can be very much improved. I follow the game and look forward to when it is complete. Still a ways to go but I have enjoyed my experience so far, however there are some things I do miss that were in DD1, that being said the new things in DD2 are a welcomed changed.Note: I don't play anymore for now at least, so I won't be updating the review.

								First of all:Don't listen to those people who keeps saying: ""This is the worst game ever! It doesn't even look like DD1.""This is Dungeon Defenders. If you want  to play a sequel of games that are all the same, buy Call of Duty. They are right about one thing though, this isn't like DD1 but this is a good thing! This is only and pre-alpha and the work they did with it is just amazing. The graphics are amazing: just look at all the colour in the artstyle. Got to admit, not like the first Dungeon Defender which was, in my opinion, a bit low on graphic quality.Look at all the content!! So much new stuff in there! The new pet system, the costume system and much more. In only one patch, they doubled the fun I had the first time I played Dungeon Defenders 2. After 2 hours of playtime, I already bought the collector's upgrade because Trendy needs support for this amazing game.To those who keeps whining about the bugs and the crashes, etc. Don't cry in the comment section, send a ticket to Trendy! Plus, this is only Pre-Alpha, so there are still a lot of issues to be fixed. You need to remember one thing though. Don't buy this game expecting a fully developped game, it is a work in progress (which progresses like crazy!). I played over 500+ hours of Dungeon Defenders 1 on console and I am really satisfied with the sequel. I digged the first one and liked even more the second one. This is the kind of game that you can't get enough of.The only thing that scares me is the idea to go free to play. What will happen to the community? Will it get ruined? Will it be even better? I don't know.But the thing that I know is that I recomend that game to anybody who digged the first one and is looking for a Dungeon Defenders 2, not a Dungeon Defenders 1 HD.			"

								Pre-Alpha[08.12.2014][26 hours]I played the game for 26 hours now and I can safely say that this game is going in the right direction. It just needs content, changes and some fixes here and there. It runs surprisingly well for a game thatâs in pre-alpha. I did glitch through the map once, but I have yet to find another bug.At the moment it has only 10 maps that all feel unique and rich in detail, and difficulty selection is just like it was in the original. Monster variety is given but there are some monsters that have a higher range than your towers, and since you cant increase your tower range with stats anymore its pretty difficult to counter them. Also there are new monsters immune to physical damange, so squires are not OP anymore, as they were in the original. There are only 4 classes at the moment, with 4 towers and 4 spells each, and the max level cap at 25. Sadly, the game is quite difficult if you play it solo and it even gives you a disadvantage in the rarity of dropped loot. If you play with a group itâs much easier overall, and you get better loot for every additional group member (up to 4), so it seems to be clearly intended for co-op play.New:- Combining different elements to get bonus exp/gold is a nice addition to Dungeon Defenders, as it lets you experiment with the different tower elements (water + lightning, knockup + ice, etc).- There are sub-cores that can now be destroyed without ending the entire round. However, if you let them get destroyed, new enemy paths will open up and youâll have to build additonal defenses.- The cores are now unique level based objects that fit nicely with the surrounding map (doors, portals, generators).- New manually activated traps which do damage in an area, and can only be used again after a cooldown (Gas, Fire, Water).- Upgrading towers now shows visual changes, which is awesome.- There are now 2 kinds of mana, which I think is a good thing. (blue for spells and green for towers).- Items can gain levels by fusing other items into them, which will also reward you with skill points that you can spend on the tower/hero stats on those items.The graphics seem very minimalistic at first look, but upon closer inspection they are quite detailed close up, a clear and improvement over Dungeon Defenders 1. I personally enjoy the changes, but other fans might be put off. The new tavern looks fantastic and I can't wait to find out what theyâll add in later, as the game is currently in early access.All in all itâs a solid tower defense game as it is right now and you can have some fun with your friends for sure, but keep in mind that it will be Free to Play on release,  so you might want to wait untill then.The devs have claimed that the microtransactions will be purely cosmetic (costumes, tower skins, and tavern decorations ), but weâll see if they can keep that promise. Itâs sounds promising but other devs have changed their minds down the road. (Loadout, for example)There you have it, my first impressions. I will update this review if I encounter anything notable and as I play newer Early Access builds.Thanks for reading :)			"

								Ever since the item nerf last year I've had difficulty getting back into this game. I've tried time and time again with friends but I find the experience has become extremely tedious since, once you've capped your level, it's all about grinding for gear and the gear half the time didn't actually do the things it claimed it did, ie. Certain special effects were either bugged, non existent or simply worded incorrectly. Sometimes games have to rework their dynamic to achieve a longer lifespan at the risk of alienating those players who were already acclimitized. That may be me. I can only hope that the changes have in fact led to a more lasting and enjoyable experience for newer players. I find the hunt for better gear to be a flatout excruciating and nauseating experience since it typically involved high risk/difficulty and little or no reward should you fail to reach or beat the final round. If you challenge difficulties that meet your current item level you typically find nothing worth the hour of scrutiny it will take just to examine the whole lot just for a few measly points of extra damage, or crit or whatever. Tedious and distasteful.			"

								New update ruined the game for me. Some might like it, but i just don't like the new system. Range stat was removed (Only found in rare shards and as skill gambles) so aura and trap defenses are weak and useless. the Shard and medalion system means that a couple of stats will always be left out ( for example you can have def pwr, speed, and crit but no def health so your defense might do alot of dmg but gets hit a few times and gets destroyed as if you were a lvl 1 noob (and they will get hit because range isn't a factor you can control anymore). Ascension isn't even an ascension system, it's a grind more because the max hero lvl won't do you any justice. Gold consumption has been increased drastically which is good, but the items and upgrades you spend it on just suck. Defense speed stat seems to just be there to look pretty. Even if they were to fix all that i Just said the game would still suck because the whole rework of the game is just boring. Update: Player choice has been decreased even further by removing the ability of the player choosing which chaos map they could play in. But hey, tower skins that you can purchase are a nice addition though.			"

								I'll keep my review as a no, or a negative review until the problems I have with the game as of the recent patch are dealt with, or fixed in some way.Anywho, I haven't put as much hours as some people, I do admit but that won't really stop me from knowing enough for a decent review. I think well over 100 hours is perfectly fine for a game such as this one. Overall, I'd say my past 2 days roughly have not been very enjoyed. Honestly, this is a loot based game, and all loot based games generally boil down to the same point. Gear. This games content can run you about 200hrs for the highest difficulty. I had no friends to really play with, and I spent quite a bit of time dicking around. I got there about 125-150hrs if that, the other 50ish was spent again. Messing around, or playing with randoms.People can tell you that you have to play 1000hrs for a game such as this one, and its clearly not the case. I've played other games, that are more complex and they do not even take that long to understand, or even get to the highest difficulty. That being said, it takes about 100hrs, if you're actually 100% focused on getting to the highest difficulty, and maybe 10-25 depending on your luck to get the gear you need. This includes leveling every character. It just doesn't take that long as people seem to think it does.This is a pretty sweet game, ESPECIALLY for an ALPHA.. Man, it blew my mind on terms of how well optimized this game is, honestly I think games released sometimes are thrown out in alpha states.. Anyways. on with the Pros.PROS- Decent combat - Lots of variety in ways to play, and extremely customizable builds.- Well balanced between the characters, none of them really feel Overpowered (trust me, thats a +)- Nice pet system (actually pretty customizable too)- A tack to add on to variety in ways to play, You could honestly play strategy or go play it without any strategy in mind.- Music, its actually really nice. (Although, I think the most recent patch got me looking for positives to this game, and I can't believe I didn't notice how amazing the music was at times)- The few cutscenes in games were pretty nice, and slightly entertaining- Developers seem to listen, and quite fast. They seem to take action on it too. - Visually, this game looks pretty nice. I know some people will beg to differ on that, but I think this game has a nice     style, it doesn't look bad at all. I think it fits the game perfectly.- Harbinger boss fight is actually quite good, and not as stale as the other one they released. Giant thumbs up for that one.CONS- Gear/loot system is terrible now for certain builds, that are unattainable and didn't deserve to get nerfed. Everyone is about average like said in the pros.- Builds are tedious, and take more ""perfection"" (enter bad cell quote here) ""This isn't even my perfect form"" Although, this isn't really a con since more gear is ""perfect"".- Although not a bad for some people. This game is definitely a time soak. (Although still a time soak after recent patches, its a lot better than it was, guessing time frame would be 100 hours to get to final NM4 content if you're not as lucky as me)- Does have minor bugs (they get ironed out pretty quickly generally. Its an alpha lol)- Overall currency gaining in game, is horrible right now due to lack of drops, and drops being your money maker, even the trashy drops had use.- Definitely a game to play with friends, its a nice game but like most. It is definitely a lot better with friends.- Feels like uber spheres are generally useless, or not really any better than the original skill/tower if not weaker. Some Ubers are useful, just some are down right awful, and even questionable how it got through, and still hasn't been messed with.Its a good game, I just cannot recommend it at the moment. I honestly love this game, and I enjoyed it 170 hours. The farming isn't that bad anymore, still a bit of a time soak really not that much compared to other mmo-like games. Much better with friends and casual play in my opinion. Sorry for the long review. The game has been getting updates to fix the problems I had, but I feel as the damage is done, hopefully others can enjoy it. Its not a bad game, but I'm not going to reccommend it.			"

								Currently the priority of the developers and a lot of players no longer match.  The developers want to keep your engagement in the game by making it very slow and difficult to progress.  This has been done by:-Gear only starts to regularly drop on the third of five waves of enemies on a map. (Can still drop off Special mobs on the 2nd wave).-Shards needed to aquire power are given only for winning the map (1-3).-The only way to earn rarer shards is to do 1 of 4/5 random maps per Chaos Difficutly.-Each Chaos Difficulty seems to add shards to the possibility pool that you can earn, which mean as you go up in the difficulty the chances of getting rarer shards is more and more unlikely because the pool has increased.-Shards that you earn are completely random meaning you can get shards for characters you don't have/don't use.-Every piece of Gear has a random amount of available upgrades which means that higher quality gear can be worse than lower quality gear.-Gear is upgraded one of two currencies, one you can earn in limited quantities per day/week/maps (Medals) or a currency you earn constantly at a tiny amount that is less cost effective to upgrade with (Gold).-If your Gear stats are not high enough / you haven't leveled enough in the endgame you will not get gear appropriate to the difficulty level you are facing. (Essentialy you have to be so tall to ride but no way to know if your actually tall enough).Developers have stated on stream that they wish the final difficulty (Chaos 5) to be near impossible to beat at the moment... so their priority is to ensure that the majority of players can not reach that difficulty tier in the forseeable future... which leads them to prioritize increasing difficulty further and lowering passive damage sources like towers so that in this 'Tower Defense' game your towers can't effectively contribute to your damage... or they require so many specific pieces of gear/shards that it is unlikely you will have those combinations for months.Tl;DR : Find something more fun to play... there are thousands of other ways to spend your time that will feel less punishing and more fair.

Early Access Review
								Let me preface my review by expressing that even though my review is negative, I  do NOT  think DD2 is explicitly a ""bad"" game, but I  DO  think the game is built on flawed game mechanics (that I will get to later...), that haven't necessarily been touched on by the Developers yet, and that I can only see compounding and negatively affecting the end result of the game in the future. But before stating why I think that is so, I'll try to draft a quick list of  Pros and Cons :Pros:Appearence: I find the game's artstyle and animations very pleasing aesthetically-speaking. The cartoony feel of the land of Etheria and the heroes themselves works very well to convey a story-book type atmosphere. There isn't a lot of compelling storywork behind the heroes or campaign, but it's meant to be a Tower-Defense title with minor RPG-elements, and so I don't necessarily see that as a conPerformance: Optimizing game performance via the in-game preference menu works well. There aren't a ton of options available, but my 5yo, overheating-prone, piece-of-crap laptop can still manage 30+ FrPS with the settings turned down. The game itself isn't graphically-intensive, so this makes sense, but being one of the few games my laptop can still run, I figured I'd list that as a Pro for other players with less-powerful machinesPersonal Loot: Learning from their experiences with DD1, Trendy implemented a ""Personal Loot"" system for DD2, where you are free to pick up whatever items you see on your own screen, so that Players don't have to fight over dropped lootF2P; NOT P2W: Contrary to some of the less-informed reviews for DD2, the game is indeed ""Free-to-Play"" (F2P), but far from being ""Pay-to-Win"" (P2W). Everything except for cosmetics and bags can be bought with DD2's in-game currency (known as ""Defender Medals""). Unlocking new heroes is somewhat expensive at 10K medals, but Daily Quests award anywhere between 250-450 medals, while Weekly Quests award around 600 medals, so it's a fairly reasonable pricing system (unlocking a new hero comes with an extra character slot as well). An additional character slot is 2K medals, which I consider another reasonably priced item (and you'll only really need to buy a lot of extra slots if you want to create multiple builds of the same hero)Cons:Lag: The game does currently seem to suffer from a lot of stutter and general laggy-ness, which seems to be amplified when in a Public group. This can cause the dreaded ""character-teleport"" effect, where your active hero will sometimes pause for a moment, before teleporting many meters ahead -- often launching your hero off of the edge of a map. There has been discussion on the forums regarding this problem, that suggests the issue might be related to having multiple builders on the same map, in group play, whose visible defense ranges overlap (i.e. the large, blue, conical regions displaying the areas that your defenses can reach that appear when you mouse-over a defense). And there are also specific hero abilities whose animations are known to slow the game down (I've heard the ""Gunwitch"" hero referred to as the ""Lagwitch"" in the forums, to give you an idea...)""The Inventory Problem"": While the game is far from being a P2W title, there is currently no way to unlock additional bag storage space without spending ""Gems"" (which are only purchaseable with real money). The game is  technically  playable with the default bags, but unlike in DD1, dropped items aren't automatically sold at the end of a wave, so the current solution is to set certain bags to ""auto-loot"", but you still have to go through and manually sell the items that you don't want later, which wastes a significant amount of time. The only option to prevent clutter is to choose NOT to auto-loot items of quality below a specified rarity-tier, but then you miss out on the gold you'd otherwise receive from selling such items (Note: ""gold"" is hardly used, which is fortunate in this context, but unfortunate overall IMO). With only DD2's default bags, more time needs to be dedicated to manually selling items, as you'll fill up your inventory faster -- to the point where I personally considered the game unplayable until I spent some money on a few extrasInventory Management: Trendy has introduced some pretty basic criteria that you can set for each bag regarding what kinds of items they will ""auto-loot"" from the ground, and also how a bag's stocked items are sorted, but these features could still use some improvements. One of the major downsides is that you can only choose 1 of these criteria at a time.  ""Want to set one of your bags to auto-loot ALL item qualities less than Mythic?""  (Mythic being the 2nd-highest rarity, where anything lower than that is fairly worthless atm...). Well you can't. In order to accomplish that feat, you'd need 4 separate, dedicated bags, set to auto-loot the ""Worn-"", ""Sturdy-"", ""Powerful-"", and ""Epic-"" quality items, individually. Another problem is that you can't use the Sort feature across multiple bags. If it were possible, it would be easy to simply auto-loot everything, and then sort ALL of your bags (top-to-bottom) by ""Item Rarity"" with one button, so that it would be easier to sell off the lower-quality items. Instead, it seems the quickest way to sell items is to sort EACH bag by Item Rarity, manually drag the ""Mythic"" and ""Legendary"" items to an empty bag dedicated to NOT auto-loot (so that you can search through them for potential upgrades later), and then finally, you can hit the ""Sell-All-Items-In-Bag"" button on the low-quality leftover items that you know aren't upgrades. The quickest way to sell trash items is still far from being quickGear Stat System: In DD1, items would drop with the potential to include +/- stat contributions in ALL possible fields: the 4 Hero Stats (Damage, Health, Speed, Cast Rate), the 2 Hero abilities (Ab1 & Ab2), the 4 Defense Stats (Damage, Health, Speed, Range), the 4 resistance types (for armor), and various weapon stats (for weapons) (link to a DD1 item example) [images.akamai.steamusercontent.com]. Conversely, DD2's items have 2 stats that directly affect heroes  (""yes you heard me correctly... a whopping 2 stats!! And 1 of the 2 is always Hero Damage on weapons..."") , while the remaining are item-specific (like weapon speed / firing pattern)  (link to a DD2 item example) [wiki.dungeondefenders2.com]. This means that it is not possible to stack more than two primary stats on any given Hero.  ""Want to spec a Builder hero around defense damage, crit damage, and health?"" You can't. You'll have to forego one. In short, item stats are infinitely less important than item passivesAlas, I have reached the character limit =(Other cons worth mentioning:Mechanic-changing item passives lock character builds behind farmed items rather than Player customization. Rather than simply changing how a defense is used situationally, most passives are just better versions of the original defense. They also complicate hero balanceGear rolls for one specific class making sharing gear impossibleHero balance - some heroes are vastly more useful than othersNo real end-game progression systemOnly maps with guaranteed legendary passives are farmed on end-game. Once you get the guaranteed item with a good passive roll, there is hardly any replay value for that mapNot enough item qualities / raritiesYour character absolutely HAS TO BE lvl 50 in order to contribute anything on end-game. This both rushes the leveling process and makes it less fun. Starting a new character is painfulPets = non-usefulEndless Onslaught is boring "

								I started playing this game roughly 6 to 7 months ago. I have 5 lvl 50 heroes and have played every bit of content their is including the new carnival.I spend more time aggravated at the game than enjoying it. The game is filled with bugs that the devs don't seem to care about fixing. I'm probably alone in this seeing as most people who play games like this love to grind but I don't enjoy playing for 6+ hours and not get a single peice of gear worth a damn.To me, it seems the devs are trying to mask the problems with their game by producing these shiny new peices of content like the carnival in the hopes that you'll forget about them and buy more gems.In the end, it's just another broken early access game that cares more about milking your wallet than producing an enjoyable experience.

								i enjoy playing the game with other people, but there are issues with progression that have left the game difficult for me to play. when you get to endgame its fun but everyone joins random games to get carried through, so everyone is playing the toughest difficulty (NM4) but if you dont have gear for NM4 you are left to either 1) play solo... not at all why i downloaded this game2) scrub some carries off random people i have been stuck on NM3 soloing which is difficult for me because i get bored playing a co op game by myself. and if you bring someone along with you to NM3 after completing a weekly challenge together they will sabatoge your run because its not NM4 or just leave. it takes on average 2 hours to find one person willing to play NM3 in town. posting on forums is not any faster either. some posts looking for players just go unanswered, or have people saying they will carry me (to which i will always refuse). i can not recommend this game until the grind is better. no online co-op game should force you to request a carry or solo past 1/2 of endgame content. i have no problem grinding for the items other people buy with IRL money, but doing it by myself is just not fun.a suggestion i think would make this a lot better is if everyones itempower syncs down to the lowest item powered hero card in any of the 4 heros decks. so if i bring my level 1 apprentice card with no gear to NM4 then everyone in the party will have stats equivalent to their gear if it was level 0 but with the same type of rolls. or if i join a nightmare 4 game with my fresh level 50 to scrub some drops off people not paying attention they will get warned that their item power is about to drop down to 100 (which means they will wipe) if they dont boot me. that would force people to actually progress through the gear grind instead of jumping into NM4 as a fresh 50. the game has literally no middle class the way it is now. but meh il check back in a couple months to see if people are doing NM3			"

								farming shards in the new update is the worst. they take up space in the inverntory, they don't stack, they are hard to organize and there are way too much. it takes forever to get the few usefull ones, so you end up afk-ing chaos 1 which isn't fun at allsince the line about the bugs caused some disagreement from a certain personthe game has a lot of bugs (https://bugs.dungeondefenders2.com/) and it feels like every new patch fixes a few and adds twice the amount of new ones. some bugs like the stuttering hero movement have been there for years and can cause a lose if you fall off the map instead of running to a wall to fix it.the patches got bigger and bigger. they used to be a couple 100mb and now the are 1-2gbthe towers aren't balanced. you either use the few op ones to progress or just outcale the content with lots of stats. some towers like ballista or cannon ball aren't used at all exept from the campaign because they are too bad or just broken. ballist projectiles did okay damage but the tiniest amount of terrain is enought to stop the arrows, so they do 0 damage (like a little twig)towers are bugged. sometimes towers just stop doing damage or they don't do the intended effect like slowing mobs or the damage is just wrong. stuff like that happend all the timeskills and towers aren't explained in sth like a ingame-wiki (at least i didn't see one). you have to figure out what towers do or how they work by yourselfovercomplicated stats compared to dd1 (let's face it most players played dd1 before and they liked it) dd1 had 4 stats for towers and it worked finewipes all the time. adding shards to the game is the latest wipe. they said a couple time no more wipes but removing abilities from the weapons and raising the ipwr is an effective wipe. you can keep your items because of the models but they are pretty much useless right nowa huge amount of useless maps. last time i played, there were a few maps on every chaos-tier (4-5) and every other maps wasn't worth playing. they added incursions and boss maps in the past, but there was no reason to play them anymore (gray loot... yay)and last but not least. why is this game still early-access after 2+ years of development? they've got time to add sh*t like skins and towerskins and make you pay for it but the game isn't even done yet? i also bought some garbage from them to ""support the development of the game"" but when i look at it right now, it was just a huge waste of moneyi'll revisit the game from time to time but right now i can't recommend it to anyone. don't waste your time on dd2			"

								For starters let me say, that i played DD2 a little when the game became avaliable first and i did not like it at all.A lot of time has passed and DD2 is still in developement, but this long process has brought alot of the stuff i love to remember about DD1 back. Like a decently functional upgrading system for your items. A pet system. Alot more synergy between classes and the ability to have 4 heroes in your deck and alot more out of your deck.There's still alot of things wrong with the game.One frustrating bug i encountered was said to have been around for over a year with nothing done to adress it. But these are bugs and even if Trendy works slowly, they will be resolved and i am ALOT more confident in saying today, that i am happy with what Trendy has done with DD2 over the last year. Alot of strong updates to the game and i'm looking forward to seeing the full package.Not recommending because its still in alpha/beta (whatever its called these day) and bugs are a frequent thing. If you love the game you should wait untill its full release, when bugs wont frustrate you into abandoning the game.________________________________________________________________________________OLD REVIEW - OLD REVIEW - OLD REVIEW - OLD REVIEW - OLD REVIEW - OLD REVIEW________________________________________________________________________________Oh how i loved DD1..For me the only similarities, between this game and the original one are the graphical themes, the characters and enemies. The rest was apparently destroyed by Trendy and the Defense Council. Max 3 classes in a 4 class game? No thanks.Leveling down heroes? No thanks. Classes having synergy with only 1 other class, forces players to sit endlessly searching for multiplayer games, with a correct setup, though a system that tries to find sessions for you, but does utterly nothing to look for class balance at all.So try try again, and hope it finds a good session... No thanks Trendy. The lack of choices in this game makes me flee, but above all else, the utterly stupidly abysmal item upgrade system, realy just... No. I'm gonna go cry that this game turned out to be only a but a shadow of its predecessor.			"

								This is another of those times that I'm having so much fun with a game, that I feel the need to sit down and share why it is that I feel this way. I first tested DD2 very, very early on, before it was redone to be much closer to its predecessors, Dungeon Defenders, and Dungeon Defenders Eternity. Team Trendy was still deciding on the direction they wanted to go with the project. At the time it was PvP, and I for one am extremely happy that they went back to the tried and true formula that makes the series great. After trying the game again, post-redesign, I bought into the Defense Council, and it's not often that I feel thrilled to have paid $70 for a game. Here are the things this game does SO right: Dungeon Defenders at its finest:DD2, even still in alpha, trumps the first 2 games already. The tavern is bigger, better, and packed with things to unlock and discover as you play. The game features quests, NPC's, mad amounts of loot and items, a solid campaign, and once beyond that, multiple new game modes to dive into. For an Early Access title, there is a tremendous amount of content here already, with more updates pouring in every 6 weeks or so. I do look forward to plenty more maps coming in in the future, those are pretty limited currently, but not so much so that you get bored. Trendy!Trendy Entertainment, once again, shines in their interactions with the community, in addressing bugs and issues, and in building a great experience. These guys GET IT. I mean REALLY get it, when it comes to how to treat the community, and even in alpha they're right on top of things. You'll see them reply to nearly every thread, and for a game with around 14,000 concurrent users at the time of writing this, that's impressive to say the least. They've gone above and beyond the call, even compensating the community when issues arise which reset quests or cause the players to lose progress. This is an alpha, we will ALL lose progress at times, but these guys still know how frustrating that can be! ImmersionOne of the big surprises for me in DD2 was getting into the campaign and seeing more than just the same crystals to defend. There are interactive traps on the map, and other things to defend besides just the main crystal. In one case, there were even NPC's on the map, cowering up near the throne while you defended them and kept them alive. Tel ya what, having actual characters there made it feel so much more worthwhile! Who wants to defend an empty throne? I love the added depth they've brought to DD2, it brings so much life to the game! F2P done RIGHT!Trendy has done a perfect job with the cash shop. There is absolutely nothing pay to win in DD2, and never will be. It's a promise they made, and have stuck to like glue. You can buy costumes, bags, things like that, but never boosts, or anything that changes the way the game is played. You can't go to the cash shop and make your game any easier, or make it impact the experience. You can sure look great though! The costumes for each character are quite cool, and worth a spend for people looking to support the development of the game. Additionally, even with an already bustling community, I LOVE the option for private taverns/friends only gameplay. Let's face it, most people don't want to play with ""that guy"", who presses ready before the towers are even placed, or who afk's mid battle. There are plenty of players around, and getting into a public tavern/game is definitely easy to do, but if you want to chill alone or with the best friend, being able to do that is a huge plus for me. The game has taken the best of what makes a free to play game fun, and added in the way to play the way you want to play. To sum up: Pro's: -The game is already head and shoulders above previous games in the series-The development team is ROCKING this! -The game has depth, immersion, and a ton of fun, even for an alpha release-It's Free to play done beautifully rightCons:-It is an alpha, so you are going to find the hiccups and bugs that come along with an Early Access game -Maps are still limited this early on, but there are enough to keep you going for hours even now			"

								I do indeed reccomend this game, especially if you were a fan of DD1. The devs did a good job making this game similar enough to the first one, but added enough originality to call it a brand new game. This is NOT just a retexture of the first one, but so much more, there are now sub cores that if destroyed open a new spawn point for enemies, ability spheres, several levels, and much more. Also, unlike most other early-access games the devs are CONSTANTLY updating, the more you sign in and play the game, the more points you earn to vote on what they add into the game. These people truly care for their players.Pro's:- Better looking (Graphics, animations, enemys, tavern)- Tons more levels, items, and pets.- New types of equiptable items including vanity items.- New enemies and boss fights.- Item leveling requires other items to be enchanted into it, instead of just paying with gems.- Seperate tower gems and ability gems- I could freakin' go on forever hahaCon's:- ONLINE ONLY; This is one thing I don't really like, since a lot of times my internet is down or just bugging out, but there is a private lobby mode, and as long as you have a feint connection to the internet, you should be good.- The menu is somwhat complicated and progression is unclear, it's hard to tell what missions you have done on what difficulty, and which one you are supposed to do next.I was a huge fan of DD1 and I am really really exited for the release of DD2 when everything is finished up.

Endgame content is incredibly hard and takes a lot of thought and skill-Mostly friendly community looking to play together, not very toxic-Developers are constantly updating the game and communicting to player to fix issues-NOT AT ALL PAY 2 WIN. eÌ¶vÌ¶eÌ¶rÌ¶yÌ¶tÌ¶hÌ¶iÌ¶nÌ¶gÌ¶ Ì¶yÌ¶oÌ¶uÌ¶ Ì¶cÌ¶aÌ¶nÌ¶ Ì¶bÌ¶uÌ¶yÌ¶ Ì¶iÌ¶sÌ¶ Ì¶pÌ¶uÌ¶rÌ¶eÌ¶lÌ¶yÌ¶ Ì¶cÌ¶oÌ¶sÌ¶mÌ¶eÌ¶tÌ¶iÌ¶cÌ¶. With the release of the Coming all heros update you can also purchase the new class, but earning it ingame doesnt take very long.Cons:-Grindy (just the nature of this game)-Matchmaking issues, sometimes takes a while to join a game-Little depth. You can theory craft in this game and many maps are very difficult but until more heros are released, you're limited on optionsDungeon Defenders II has gotten a huge ammount on unfair, negative reviews that complain about the lack of endgame and content updates. The Developers at DD2 are focusing heavily on gettting the foundations of the game just right so it can support future content, for instance:loot changes, the way gear stats work and difficulty. Thats the reason this game is still in alpha, early access. So people can test the core of DD2 and developers fix any problems to create a refined game. Luckily, big content updates are being released giving DD2 more end game something to work towards.			"

								Before the ""Trials"" update it was a fun Tower Defense and Loot game.After the ""Trials"" update - Nope. This was basically a reset on all your gear and game mechanics.What once was up and down, black and white is now a mish-mash of I don't know what the hell I'm doing anymore.This game maybe fun for players starting out with a keen interest in micro-managing all gear aspects there are.It's just not DD2 i started playing with.I just can't finde myself motivated to start all over again. Maybe after a long break.			"

								Really liking the game so far.Got roughly 100 hours in this game of which most was in the first two weeks.That kinda goes to show that even though the game is a lot of fun in it's current state it is also still lacking. upsides : - the game feels super smooth, other than two crashes I had on day 1 I've had no bad experiences at all concerning the smoothness.- nice map variation, sure there are not an insane amount of maps yet but the ones we have are pretty diverse.- Abilities of classes are a lot more fun to use compared to DunDef1, squire for example has a taunt and an AoE stun that are just a total joy to use.- friend system works nicely and due to the way downscaling works you can always play with your friends even if they are low level. ( though obviously a full geared level 25 that is downscaled will still be a bit stronger than a normal level 1 ).Downsides:- Only 4 classes, this is mainly due to the game being in early access so I will remove this one eventually but for now it feels lacking even though they are working hard on it.- Some towers are completely useless while others are a must.  This is also a temporary thing with balance patches coming in the future but I had to throw it down since at the current state some towers are just vastly superior to others.There might have been some things that I missed out on but all in all I greatly enjoyed playing the game and will check back with every big patch , on that note a big patch is coming again soon so those kinda waiting with buying it should totally get it when the patch comes out.edit:  removed the lack of endless survival mode from downsides since it was recently added.This game is being updated a lot and I still have high hopes for the future.

Early Access Review
								LOVE THIS GAME!!!EDIT: They have now made the game free to play which is insane because this game is worth buy to play without even thinking about it.(I never played Dungeon Defenders 1 before anyone asks)So I got this game today and I played it for 8hours straight and literally could not stop playing it.  As I write this review, it is 2AM in the morning for me because I am so addicted to the game!I enjoy this game so much I sent my wife a key and she is also now addicted to the game, we cannot stop playing it.So let's get into the game itself!Graphics: So the graphics are basically a cartoon easy free mesh style with nothing amazing or special to look at, but it does offer some nice aspect to play with a cartoon/ anime feel which draws you into the game with the cool design, meaning the game feels different and runs smooth because of the unique design! Overal decent to look at for once, very colourful!Audio: The audio is actually suprisingly good, cute cat meows, funny slashing with monsters growing, cool weapon swooshing and bangs with some really really relaxing old style music that draws you in!Gameplay: The gameplay is pretty simple! Seriosuly the character controls and the way you move is so smooth and easy, you master the game in seconds and cannot complain! It is basically a tower defense with a mixed in RPG (XP, stats, money, armour etc) so you earn coins and ranks, with armour offering certain things to make you better, you get pets which are awesome from eggs to hatch into some more support... It feels like Fable meets Diablo too me which is pretty decent to me (Even though I do not like Diablo) but this game really you work at it, play with friends, form defences and fight to survive against monsters.  It also feels a lot like ""Orcs Must Die"" which is another amazing game but this game feels more refined and balanced correctly!Too date I am playing at early access alpha, so I am unsure if there will be any character wipes! Too which I hope there best not because I am spending over 8hours waiting for an egg to hatch for a pet to hopefully gain a legendary or mystic!!!You can also have multiple characters to create the perfect setup on maps, example I have one character which is soul Hero DPS which I use to kill the bots, I swap to my tower dps to build which is tower power so it holds my damage, once built I swap again to another character to buff my towers health and DPS and finally I swap again to another just to deal damage before hitting my turrets... Once the build is setup I change back to my main hero damage, press ready and fight. The hand has a very in depth tactical edge which you can dive into and tank the game alone. This I prefer to play on all fields to hold the best edge at all times. (You cannot swap while a combat phase, only during build phases)The armour you obtain is important to what build you would like to have for that character so it's best to pay attention to what you are doing when trying for the right strategy. A draw back I do not like is the game uses matchmaking, no party create in main menu, you have to physically press play or private and then invite a friend into the game, but even when you select private and have 1 friend, you press play and that session is no longer private! Only the lobby is because you can and most likely will join a random person (happens every time with my wife and I)There are a decent supply of maps but my wife and I went through every one in campaign in 8hours (again to date of this review I am writing) we are. Ow playing free mode which is the same maps.... There are other modes but they are... The same maps! Which believe it or not is getting tiring already even though we cannot stop playing the game! Is it pay to win? Not that I can see! I bought the digital deluxe because I enjoyed the alpha code I was given so much, I was given the special blue coin things and found the only thing I could buy with them WAS access the the vault boxes which gave me clothing items (They do nothing, they are only cosmetic) and clothing store clothing (Which again is cosmetic)I could not find ANYTHING that makes them useless, you cannot speed upgrade or use them (Too date of writing this review) that would make them worth the money or beneficial to me or the game or like any cash cow, because it is not.Would I recommend this game?Yes, in a heart beat.  I love some tower defence games and now this is a game that is XP/ Stats/ Gold/ Ranking/ Community and much more on the side to enjoy!			"

Early Access Review
								Dungeon Defenders IIIts still pre-alpha, but second version.I play this game now about 200 hours and i still like it very much. Guess the reason is that the developers always work on this game to improve it. Dungeon Defenders was released in the year 2011. The second part can not be compared to DD. Duneon Defenders II with new 3D animations is the next step with lot`s of improvements. This game belong to the tower defense game genre. The second pre-alpha update include some new game types ( campaign, free play ) like incursion, onslaught, end game, end game incursion and end game onslought. The difficult level has added ( easy, normal, hard ) four new nightmare levels. The match type Quick match is for multiplayer co-op and Private for invited friends only. New pets are available now in epic, mystic and legendary. For all of us who expect more, we can power up and increase our pet`s affection level in order to evolve. It`s necessary to use Shellium shards for evolve. To receive shellium shard let the founded eggs in your inventory about 48 hours. The first pre-alpha offered medium challenge, now with the second alpha it`s more challenge. From easy to hard difficult it`s possible to play single too, but on nightmare it`s obligated to play in a team. The currency in this game are crystals and wyfern tokens. The crystals are included in pre-alpha and the wyfern tokens can be earned in daily and monthly missions. With the crystals for example we can buy more inventory bags, new character slots or discover accessories. For all Uber Speres and lockbox master key it`s possible to pay with wyfern tokens. The balance of this game is good. From the  fondly social and private tavern we can choose challenge on the war table. Bug report is possible too at the tavern keeper. There are some different Shops in this game. The Gran`Masta ( Skill Sphere ) support improvements for hero skills and defense improvements. The Alchemist can improve your items ( clothes, relics and weapons ), simply put all stuff you don`t need inside around your good item and improve your `better choosen item`. The Hatchery for pets can be found at stable boy. For feed your pets go to the Keeper. The Seamstress offers assessories and on the Relic Hunter shop we can buy relics. All special uber skills can be bought on the adventurer token collection shop. The game has reached alpha version and is free to play until beta.short review: ( positive criterion ( + ) maximum 5 ) - single multiplayer and co-opmusic: +++++ (4/5)graphic: (5/5)gameplay: +++++ (5/5)tutorial: ++++ (3/5)			"

Dungeon Defenders 2 ReviewTL;DR -  Video Review	 The kids have grown up!  In Dungeon Defenders 2 you continue the story as the apprentice, the squire, the huntress, or the monk.  The kids are now what appear to be teenagers with slick overhauled graphics.  And, More characters are coming.  The game is now in early access on Steam and I thought I would provide my initial impressions on this unique game.Just like the original dungeon defenders game, this is also a hybrid tower defense and Action RPG.  You still get all the same fun loot collecting, leveling, and skill points, along with a slightly tweaked gear upgrade system.Before I get too far down the rabbit hole, I was an original Dungeon Defenders 2 Defense Council Member.  This meant I have seen every build prior to the Steam Early Access public release.  This game has progressed immensely from the days of its infancy and with much excitement I am glad to say this is one of the best feeling ""Early Access"" games I have experienced in a long time.  They did right by the community and didn't release a buggy product.  I have yet to see a crash.  The only issues I have noticed are a few camera clipping issues.From the first few moments in the game you can tell this is a smooth product.  If you were a player of the original this will feel liquid, with a slightly faster pacing.  When the game was initially announced it was going to be a MOBA styled tower defense game that was free to play.  A lot of the original fans were obviously upset that it wasnât a true continuation of the original game; I was not one of them.  I thought the MOBA style might provide something unique to this game but those ideas were tabled, but will it probably make an appearance in the future in some form.The game did keep the Free to Play ideology though and that will likely propel this game to new heights on the PC.  However to actually in the ""Early Access"" you do have to purchase a copy for $25, or catch it on sale.  This does come with perks such as premium currency, a unique title, and some exclusive skins.  This is the standard fare when a game comes to early access.  However, unlike other free to play titles all items sold for cash currency will, I quote ""Never grant gameplay advantage. Ever.""Being part of Early Access does have a unique perk. Influence.  Influence points are earned every day you login which can be spent to vote on what various features or implementations of features in coming builds.Back to the game, each playable class has 4 spells and 4 unique ""towers"".  The game builds upon its original format with each spell and tower unlocking through level progression, along with ability to upgrade the existing towers.  Another area where this game excels over its predecessor is the new Wave Director which will slightly randomize enemy waves.  This could mean different enemy types, where they come from, or various stat buffs.  They are also looking to get in the occasionally, ""caught you with your pants down"" events.This game is currently planning on remaining in Early Access for at least a year.  Hopefully the Trendy can keep up the momentum and keep new exciting features releasing until the gameâs final release.It currently doesn't have any form of cash shop available, or pets.  The biggest downfall to the game currently is the tedious matchmaking process, which can have you struggling to get in and out games fast.  Layers and layers of menus slow the process even though finding players to play with is the fastest part.Knowing this game is going free to play but still costs money to play before launch can dissuade a lot of players, but if you enjoyed the first game, tower defense, or casual ARPG games you will easily get your monies worth in entertainment.  This game sets a good example for what Early Access games should be in their launch status.			"

								I was waiting over a month to give developers a chance to somehow fix what they broke, but after last update i have to write this out of extreme frustration. Trials update was impressive, many great ideas, but it was badly executed. As a (solo) player with very limited game time it took me almost a month to get to the point where i was.... well, i haven't reached the point where i was before trials, everything is extremally hard.And after last update (19.5) my defenses were a little stronger, but my heroes got nerfed, and enemies got buffed, i couldn't complete maps on difficulty where i was farming earlier. Bosses are unbeatable, i can bearly finish difficulty i was somehow farmin before 19.5 patchNow i have 3 options: 1) uninstall the game2) find some1 to carry me3) farm for gear that won't be any better than what i have and try higher difficulty and fail, after that, pull the rest of my hairI'm sorry this went in such direction, and by that i mean dd2 became very unfriendly for players like me, with limited game time, who simply want to have some fun solo.After over a month since Trials update launched, i have maybe 5-10% better gear compared to what i had before update, while maxed out gear is 100% better. I'm writing this after 6 hours of failing in difficulty (chaos 4) where i COULD find some upgrades. I'm still hoping developers will realize not only hardcore farmers are playing this game and i can edit this review, but it appears they are happy with how it turned out, plus already maxed players are liking new changes, because with the gear they have, little enemies buff isn't a big deal compared to buff defenses recieved (and it's noticable on high end gear).

								I have 116 hours on this game on another  account Do you like towers? Do you like upgrading your towers into epic epicness?Well, i'm sorry to say but you came to the wrong game. Dungeon Defenders II focus more on the different characters different building types and each has very few upgrades for each of their 4 towers/defenses. Do you like strategically organize the best route in order to get the best gear or the item you really want?Well, i'm sorry to say but you came to the wrong game.Dungeon Defenders II makes you grind and only grind and when your not grinding you're trying your luck in crafting items and when you are not crafting you're trying your luck in different maps trying to get that one item piece that you are missing unsure if it even drops in said map or not.Do you like to get to see all the stuff in more than 100 hours?Well, i'm sorry to say but you came to the wrong game.As I mention earlier the only reason I played it more was because of my friends needed to grind after they got some of the better items ( they are properly around 70 hours ) they quit. Honestly for the last few hours all, they were talking about getting some good gear before quitting which they did.Do you like to have progressive gameplay?Well, i'm sorry to say but you came to the wrong game.As in many other tower defense games, the only real change is the monsters, heroes and towers. In Dungeon Defenders II, however, you have seen all the content of 1 character after 2 matches in about an Lvl 20 map and the monsters get reskinned and recoloured but all in all no bigger change. You get a few starting heroes and can buy all heroes for in-game currency however some of them are again very grinding Want to upgrade your towers and your hero outside of your items to improving your personal playstyle on a hero?Well I'm sorry to say but you came to the wrong game. When leveling up you gain points these points can be spend on improving your hero's personal traits however it's basically rather or not you want to be hero focus or tower focused and once you pick one of them the other is going to be somewhat just a side role dealing damage and sustaining the damage but it will fall of later into the game. Do you like fanservice?Well, i'm sorry to say but you came to the wrong game.This game have none of that			"

								I have played these games since the first one, into Eternity and now have put 700 hrs into DD2. This game used to be fun and enjoyable and doable solo, which wasrequired since the community for the seconde one is one of the least helpful of the series. After the Trials update the game is broken for those who put the timeto grind to get viable heroes. Every last apsect of this has been nerfed except the enemies. all the time and hard work put into it was thrown out the door andthe company demands that you start the grind all over again to rebuild. Used to be bleto solo up to nm2, now, lucky to beat a map.			"

								In short, not yet, maybe never.It's still early access, but after playing about 35 hours, I'm probably not coming back.  They tried to stagger your abilities, you get something new practically every round, but it's still about playing the same maps over and over.  I was level 30+, but I couldn't even play the events.  Pretty lame.I don't even know why they have the tavern.  It's just a glorified menu.  There's no interaction with anyone in there, and when you're in a shared tavern you are likely to get sucked into a game on accident.  That will drop you out of whatever thing you were doing.Balance is a big issue.  Having a ranged weapon that fires two projectiles is dumb, because neither of them go straight.  They also do 1/2 damage each, so you might as well just get a 1 projectile weapon and hit things.  Attack speed is the same, you do the same DPS whether you're firing 1 or 4 projectiles per second.  There are a few interesting weapons, but they become obsolete very quickly.  Higher tier items have a formula.  You get more effects, but the stats are the same.  The effects are totally unbalanced.  Some of them are super powerful while others don't even make sense.  Eventually I just sold all weapons if they didn't drain HP or if they fired multiple projectiles.For a game that is all about items, item management is stupid.  You can get hundreds of drops per round, but there's no way to just sell all the low quality ones or anything.  No favorites.  No filtering.  Just a pain.  I was spending more time selling items than I was playing the game, what with all the waiting for rounds to start and an item overflow that times out too quickly.			"

Early Access Review
								I lost interest with this game after being a beta-tester for the Abyss Lord.I had broken legendary gear, able to solo nightmare 5 as huntress.But, what's fun about solo'ing stuff when there's no real challenge or sense of accomplishment?At times playing with other players actually feels like a crutch, you have to spend time arguing ""Who's the builder, check my stats, I have more damage. But I have more speed, blah, blah.""You also have to share the gems with those that argue, when their towers are just insufficient to do the task needed.At at times there's no need to even attack, just spam abilities now and then.And I get that can be 'fun' for some people, but it got boring for me over time.And I know Trendy has been trying to make Hero combat fun and needed, but it feels very forced. And the fun factor still isn't there.I've kept an eye on the updates ever since stopping to play after Abyss Lord's release, but nothing screamed at me to return to the game. The loot didn't interest me, the costumes didn't interest me, the pets didn't interest me, the new enemies didn't interest me, the events didn't interest me and the new heroes didn't interest me.To be honest the only thing that made me say ""Oh, cool"" was the current Terraria + DD2 collab, but that's not enough for me to want to reinstall the game.I don't regret buying the game when it was P2P and buying some of the skins in the past to support Trendy, they're an amazing company with insane talent.But this has no replay value, unless you like more OP loot to replay the same levels again and again and again...It's like some bad bragfest of who can solo what with the shiniest most expensive costumes.

								Like others who had originally paid for this game, I feel a little slighted by the shift to the Microtransaction model. Being ""rewarded"" with a single title and a small amount on abstracted in-game currency feels like a bit of a betrayal. I realise I backed a game that was not released and that was my fault entirely. Just had slightly higher hopes from TrendyEnt than what was received.PROS:-Its basically just updated Dungeon Defenders-Controls are responsive, if a slight departure from the original game. Vetrans to DD may find it awkward that all towers must be walked to and pointed at to be intereacted with, as opposed to just going into an aerial m view and selecting everything, Placing towers also feels wonky without this.-All the characters from the original have made a return (or are in the works) with more to come. That said, they're a grind to unlock regularly, or you can opt to pay a microtransaction.There suppose to (maybe) still be a PvP MOBA-style game mode with a large selection of classes to chose from. This might be worth checking out eventually.CONS:-I feel the new tarvern is too large, anjd awkwardly spaced. This is entirely personal.-The community seems to be kinda eh. I can remember jumping into the old one with a bunch of randos and co-ordinating builders and repairment and whatnot, all without a hitch. This time around everyone seems to do their own thing-The mana handed out at the begining of a way is untrue to the previous game. Now each player can open exactly one chest. Mana can still be given to other players, but this makes having one builder difficult, especially given the tone of the community.-The inventory and hero deck function essentially makes the Defender's Forge obsolete, yet it still remains, I'm assuming only because a team member spent time modlling, rigging, and animating it.-The bag system is abysmal - if I have 10 bags, why do they all have to be in the same window? Why not allow players to have multiple bag windows so as to not force you to constanly open and close them and drag and drop and scroll etc. -Early Access and still microtransactions. This is another personal point, but I feel that Steam should disallow any game that is tagged as ""Early Access"" from having a microtransaction store.-To me, maps feel awkward and sprawling, even if they do have a good flow, especially the early levels when compared to those of the first game. Perhaps sightlines could be improved-Its hard to convince friends to play this F2P game. This could just be my personal circle of friends, but most are more willing to play DD1 and start everything fresh there than they are to do anything here. -Personally, I prefer the old art direction largly over the one this game presentsOverall, the game isn't terrible, but it has shifted its direction and that's kinda left a bad taste in my mouth. I wouldn't say to strictly avoid this game, but would agree that this is a game you can skip and not have missed anything.			"

								I personally enjoy this game, but I don't recommend it. I place out cons of this game first.1) Bugs, many bugs and developer ignore it / take a long time to fix itSo there's a recent meta (defense combo), but we found out the defense is buggy, which makes it overpowered. I've started this game about 3 months ago, yet to be fixed by now (21 - dec - 2016)2) 1 hit on the core and lostThis won't happen on easy difficulties (Normal, hard, nightmare 1). This often happens on Nightmare 4 games, those monsters deal extremely high damage and your core just have about 2k health. They deal up to 20k damage, even able to kill you in 1 hit.3) Grinding system, sucks.You may ask ""what do you mean by it sucks?"", well, we grind our weapon from different maps that offers us the same weapon (legendary) with different stats, yes, thats it, different stats. But for example I just want (Hero dmg) and (Elemental dmg), sometimes you might replay the game up to 10 times, even up to 30 just for the stats. 4) Unfair leveling (IPWR level)For those who yet to play the game, IPWR means Item power. So when you just started, your average IPWR is around 30 - 150. But you can instantly jump into any public no IPWR requirements, grind loot from there and instantly jump from 200 - 600. This is a huge disavantage for those who started the game a long time ago and grind slowly from Nightmare 1 to Nightmare 4 difficulty.5) Spheres are in a complete messOnce again for those who yet to play the game, spheres is a token (or whatever you call them) that gives you a stats, for example +40 hero damage, +10% experience loot, etc. There's some of them which cost a lot (Indeed alot, because you need to spent 2 weeks or even 1 month to get it), and they're useless, pretty much. Because if the current meta defense doesn't require it, you won't find any help with the sphere if you are not someone that like to research.I've spent around nearly 200 hours, and i've gotten bored and lost interest to the game, this game is base on the angle you play it, if you don't like it, just deal with it, because no one is going to change the meta UNLESS the developer does.

								Waited some time for a few patches before I decided to review.  Has it been 2 years already? Well like most I was highly anticipating this game and was expecting that original DD feeling.  Did I get that?  ...Not exactly, but that is ok given games have to evolve in some way, even though it's not always based on our personal wants & needs.  At first I was excited and then somewhat disappointed and then hardly play anymore, but I come back time to time and it seems DDII can't grab me and keep me prisoner like the original still can.  I still recommend this because it has some changes coming, but replay-wise for now, not so much.  I still love the DD universe and appreciate all its parts, so hoping that flare to keep playing returns.NOTE:  Some of the below are based on friends of friends opinions, but seem to be matching equally to random people I asked the same question.PROS:1. Familiar Music themes2. Familiar map areas revamped3. A little more hero customizations4. Knight actually welds a shield without being an accessory5. Graphics are well done frame to frame animations6. Still maintains that unique hero feeling7. Abilities are a bit different, but still enjoyable8. Handling pets has changed9. New Quest system is realistic & fun10. Month-to-month quests for pets & other rewards is a nice addition11. Still has that Boss Fight fun factor12. Customizing inventory = Names, auto-loot categories, by class, etc and etc13. Easy levelingCONS: 1. Limited inventory compared to the original2. You have to purchase inventory slots (Bags)3. Towers to damage to creature formulas have changed4. Huge limitations on gear upgrades compared to original DD5. Handling pets has changed (placed as PRO and CON because itâs a huge argument to most in my circles and circles of circles)6. Open tavern creates some negative feedback on the community as a whole and reporting system might as well not exist (can be avoided with solo tavern play or private + inviting friends); which leads to a very immature atmosphere7.  Normal Mode difficulty does not feel like Normal mode, so difficulty to difficulty is not a realistic transition from one to the other.Most arguable PROS & CONS:Handling petsGraphicsAbilitiesOpen Tavern with no control or monitoringDifficultyEasy leveling (easy to vets but to new players? ...compared to the original)All-in-all I love that the DD community is still going in some way, but... (PERSONAL OPINIONS SECTION)1. Did it grab me and dedicate me like the original?       No2. Do I feel Trendy was able to make a worthy sequel?    Yes, but wanted that old rewarding feeling3. Am I already finding myself anticipating the next Dungeon Defenders?    Yes4. Will I still play DDII?    Yes, but not daily = a couple times a month5. Am I not playing due to the unregulated chat?    No, but I see how the racist names and 24/7 bashing among people in the community can alienate many new players and some vets alike.6. Will I stream DDII?    No, and it's not because the community is very small, it's just that I only stream/record games I play daily to almost daily = no streaming or YouTubeSo basically I like this game and can recommend it, because I do play it, but for me it lacks that replay value like the original granted.Sirspoony rating:    7.5/10			"

								The packs are riddiculously priced...I loved the original DD and played a ton of it, i love the genre its fun to play. But for the paid content, thats a joke. 27.99 for inventory space ? really ? 32.99 for costumes? Better games have been made for less.Cut the greed and maybe focus on providing a great game. Larian Studios is doing it right, they made a revamped version of their game and offered it for free to the fans that had purchased the original. No micro transactions, no packs that cost as much as a game would.Maybe gamers need to realize this and stop supporting companies like yourself. It's Because of this type of stuff i don't play EA titles and by the looks of things i will not be a supporter of any future content from your developments. 152.70$ in DLC lol you guys are a joke.

								Hey guys, I think that this game is an excelent game due to the fact there is a large assortment of items to find and use. I will list the upsides and downsides of this game that I have found during some of my experiences.Pros: Lots of things to do in the gameNew Enemies.Lots of unique modes not just campaignNew weaponsNew lookExcelent GraphicsStill updatingLots of new contentVoting system (Democratic decision making)Allows the players to make the decision of new things (REALLY like that <3)Cons: Too repetitiveGrindyNo unique names for weaponsNot 100% sure they're doing the set bonus'sNot a large variety of Weapon Rarity'sPre-ordered the premium version of the game paying almost double or more of the money for the basic pre-order than less than a year later became Free-to-Play losing all my perks. (VERY upset about that)This is my own personal opinion not yours. I believe that some people may Agree with me			"

								I love this game! I put hundreds of hours into DD1 and while this game isn't quite there yet I'm excited to see where it's going. It has familiar qualities from the original game and there are plenty of hooks for new content. The Dev team has a decent pulse and are fairly involved with the community.If you don't like being a part of games still in development then WAIT!If you are like me and don't mind alphas then jump right in you'll enjoy the ride.

								This is a game with a bit of graphics and well.. did i mention it have stuff that moves on your computer screen?The rest is a bit lacking...Not that fun not that rewarding, It's like that friend you have that always promises that he will change but still makes the same stupid mistakes over and over. He tells you that he values your input and listens to what you say. But then ignores you and runs away yelling lololololol while wearing a crazy cap (CC for short).All you can do is stare at the thing that moves, like your hypnotized by the movement and the stupity. You know you could do something better with your time. Do it, run away from the guy with the CC. It's not worth it, he will never change. It's all empty promises.There comes a point in every gamers life, when you must realize what's in front of you and let go... Just let it go.. Or don't go there in the first place. It's a wery bad and dark place filled of regrets, and restless nights waking up screaming in the middle of the night... Remeber It's all a fantasy, like the fantasy you have about this game ever being any good. It's time to face reality.And if you who tried DD1, DD2 is not the new DD, it's something else but with the same name. The game is just not that interesting or fun. It's like a dull idle game / hold down the button action rpg hybrid. I have som great memories from DD1, played it around 300 hours. Lots of maps that was fun to explore, just running the map and failing a lot of time just to understand the mob movement, was part of the fun. Finding unique loot on the maps, and big maps that you could get lost running around. There was always a sense of progress. A lot of...  let's try that map again and see if i can go one wave furter, maybe if i tweak a little here and a little there. There was a lot more strategy involved in DD1.DD2 is like a no brainer action-rpg with towers. You get a clear line that shows where the mobs will be, and chokepoints pointed out where you should build your defences. A lot more focus around finding the right loot, not upgrading loot as in DD1. Now you can spend days just farming for the perfect loot so you can take on the same map as you where farming the loot on. Even the skins in DD1 was a lot more rewarding since you hade to accomplish something to get the skins, now you just hand over your money and get your skin.Most of the time you fail a map while in a group is because someone from your team fell asleep and forgot to repair the wall. Or was watching youtube on his/her laptop while holding down the fire butting pointing the bow down a lane not caring what happens in the game at all.This game is so bad i regret playing it, I could have done so mutch more with my time like staring at paint while it's drying or contemplating my navel.

								DD2 is a very polished game with some very flawed fundamentals.  It's not really a tower defense game.  More of a baracade game, with shooting.  But not really fun shooting.  Most levels boil down to standing in the same spot the entire level and with four huntresses hosing down their lanes. I want to like this game so bad.  But honestly, it's just boring.  DD1 was much more fun.         Allowing players to hot swap heroes seemed like a good idea.  It's not.  The dps heroes are too powerful.  Here is a short breakdown of what you will experience:Start a level and use your builder to place initial baracades and towers.  This part is fun.  Probably the only fun part.After spending all your money, switch to the huntress and position yourself where you can see the most lanes.Level begins - Hold down the left mouse button.Level ends - Make a sweep of the level, heal some towers, lay some more towers, upgrade others.  (again, somewhat fun)Level begins - hold down the left mouse button.After you've beaten the level, the game has automatically picked up the prodigious amount of loot that dropped.  Now its time to sort through all that crap like its a sale at the thrift store and you're hoping to find at least one thing of value.  Chances are, you wont.  But that wont save you from having to sort through it all for every character you own.  Its as bad as doing your taxes, I kid you not.  I cannot express just how much crap gear you need to sort through.  It's awful.TLDR:  Instead of this, play Orcs must die 2, or even OMD unchained.  Also, Kingdom Rush does TD way better than this.  This game wants you to grind your life away.  Don't do it.			"

								This is a decent game. I've put a lot of hours into this game, meeting people, making friends, and simply socializing as I work my way up to find better equipment. I play this game to simply try out the new classes and try the variety of weapons this game has. I have never spent money on here to get where I am now and I don't find it much of a hassel to grind for what people would normally pay for with real money because you can still get things free. Paying for bag expansions are the only thing you really need to worry about. It's not a requirement, but your items do become full quickly. I was able to obtain 450 free gems in the past due to selling the collectable cards the game provided so I could get another bag expansion but let me tell you where I'm growing extremely frustrated over...The game's bugs/glitches. I cannot tell you how many times I've played this game and found myself randomly crashing or logging me out in the middle of active gameplay. There are bugs in this game that has been around since game release and no one has considered fixing them at all. Examples: Random log out of session, entire lobby randomly gets kicked out, a weird crash that causes you to log out and end up under the map in the lobby, falling into an endless void and everyone is glitched as 999 iPWR (You cannot simply log out to fix this glitch, you have to X out the entire game and reload it for it to fix), inaccurate defense stats when someone else looks at your defenses (Sometimes they even glitch so bad that they show only 1-4 as dmg), match making error, and much more.I've tried everything to reduce the chances of crashing, even lowering my specs to the lowest possible in the options only to still see myself freeze up and crash without warning and I have an actual gaming computer that can handle heavy graphics so I don't see why a game as simple as this would cause me to crash to much. It's extremely frustrating. I would love to recommend this game to people but due to the bugs that have been in this game for so long, have been mentioned to the staff on several occasions and still hasn't been fixed, I cannot recommend this game.I might consider changing my recommendation once these common bugs are fixed.

								(This is my opinion today - The game changes often, and in a month it might be a better game.)I can't help comparing with the original DD and DD eternity, and when doing that DD2 falls very short in almost all aspects (for now). There are some specific improvements to certain mechanics that were annoying in DD, while some of the great stuff from both DD and DD eternity has been lost. Also I am pretty dissapointed in the state of the game, by which I mean that they havent gotten further than this in such a long development period.. was it almost a year since I watched the first alpha gameplay on youtube?.I am not going to write a long list of thumbs up and thumbs down. All I can say is I am BORED.. in all my 800 hours DD and 100+ in DD eternity I was never bored - DD2 just lacks that thing that makes me want to reach for that next level of gear, or farm for better pets or better gear, tweak my stats, explore new builds, try new ways.But lets see how it looks in half a year from now.

								You know those absolutely gargantuan overhauls that completely flip any strategies you had previously, leaving you aleinated in the game you love and enjoy? Like what happened at Robocrap? Yeah, this game had one of those at the time of me writing this.I've been left stunned by all the major changes to medallions/totems, meaning you have to grind even more to get something that's merely a shadow of what you used to have, one of the pains being you need to get totems for individual towers now. Also, some of the tower changes are abysmal, like how the flame burst is now a putridly short-ranged flamethrower that now has goblin bombers laughing hysterically at how useless the tower now is without that small portion of needed range. A lot of my towers even seem to fail at acquiring air targets aswell.Can't even take on lowly hard mobs in most paces, my towers are that inert now.			"

								I put in a little over 200 hours in DD1. Its mind-boggling the scope of how you took a fun game and what should've been an easy sequel, and managed to make something awful. All in the goal of chasing after a market you will never get.  Seriously, it's never going to happen.Sure the graphics are much nicer. Kudos for great artwork trapped in a horrible frame. The gameplay is now awkward. The forced social stuff is exactly that, forced and impersonal; in ways you simply can't seem to understand because there is no point to ""team building"" in DD2. This isn't an MMO, and it's also not LoL, and it never will be. Worse, the myriad of wonky systems feel poorly glued together, yet collectively don't have the depth of the simplier systems of the last game.			"

								So i thought after all this time i should step up and bring you guys my review:Early Access review: As an early access game you can only notice 2 things:- Small balance issues (which are being worked on daily)- Content (specially end game and higher difficulty) These are not game breaking of any kind, it's the less buggish early access i've played (Did i mention that it's still only pre alpha? Man the game totally feels way better).So should you get this game? Well that depends, the game will be F2p, if you have your doubts and only want to test you might wanna wait, now the game is early access, so that means there might be wipes and lack of appropriate content for the time you want to spend in the game, but you can always entertain yourself in many other ways and help the game develop. If you're okay with purchasing a game that's not released yet don't doubt it. If you want to help the game get better, go ahead and don't think twice.FAQ:-Do Developers even care about the feedback? Definitely they do! Many changes have been made for community request, and many were added. There's even an influence system that you can vote with points you gain by being active!-Dev Interaction? Yes there are streams every thursday and friday ; Forum activity by the Devs ; A devlog coming out weekly about what the devs are working on! -Better than DD1? Dungeon Defenders 1 is a full complete game, i believe DD2 has potential to be way way better than DD1, but it's still Pre-Alpha, so it's normal you might not find as interesting.-F2P? Won't that be P2W? Nope the game will have no such a thing as sold advantage, it will depend on costumes and all type of cosmetics and whatelse they can come up with but no sold advantage of any sort =).There's a lot of info i want to give you about the game to help you judge it, but go ahead and watch the streams/videos and decide for yourself, i found myself getting the game a while ago, and i simply love it, love the game love the dev interaction, totally worth it, this game is going to rock for me. There are some changes that must be made but i believe all that will come in time!			"

								The game is very similar to the first one in some points, even the graphics that everyone likes, even if I like the first one better, a matter of personal taste, I recognize the improvements.On the similar aspects, I give a thumbs up. As the first one the gameplay is very cool and the maps are wonderful. The characters and towers are very much alike too.The bad parts are the one that differs from the original DD. As you level up you are given a very limited and poor choices of specs for your skills and, as I have seen, most of the choices are pretty useless. That messes up a bit with your character customization, since you are forec to buff up a single tower with your specs, and once you get 10+ points on that skill its upgrading becomes pretty useless, since you wil get a 0.45% boost on that skill or less.The other aspect is that you can't level up the things you want to play with. You can't level up tower damage, health, hero speed, attack speed etc. You depend on item drop to do that, and you depend A LOT on item drop (and I say A LOT). You can go almost 30 hero levels without ever finding a gear that fits your hero, so you won't play it the way you want for a very long time. That is a terrible decision by the game designers and, for me, what ruined the game, because what makes a good RPG is character creation and the fact that you can costumize you hero to play the way you want to play it. DD2 won't let you.Personaly I like to play builder. That is not an option either in DD2, since you get enough ""build mana"" to build one or maybe two towers in a map. And, if you don't go aura, there is  good chance you will waste your mana by having your tower destroyed in the first waves.The other thing is that you cannot kick a player from the map or even vote kick him. So if someone decides to troll the party on the last wave, he will do it, and will remai unpunished. But I believe that there will be something regarding that for after the pre-alpha.If the game was just a few dolars expensive or maybe free to play, I would give it 5 stars, but, when I pay almost $20 for it, I feel a lot of regret.

								Hello there! :)I'm a completely new DD2 player, but I've already played for quite some time. Lovin' it!I don't understand all the negative reviews. No game can stay alive forever; everything gets boring in time, but why not enjoy it while it lasts? All games are played for the entertainment value; if you think the game is fun and fits your personal preference it's a great game.All the reviews in here comment on the game being F2P and that it should've just stayed as a P2P; well, the game is completely free of charge. 4 completely free heroes (you have to complete the first quest in the game to obtain two of the ""free heroes,"" but that's easiely done); you can play through the entire game without ever buying anything.The only things you buy are either cosmetic or inventory space; what's your problem? You earn Defender Medals over time and can buy any of the heroes, again, completely free of charge.The only thing that really forces you to pay money are the actual skins. Are skins really that important to people? Does it really ruin the game for you? Well, that's sad for you, but I'm enjoying the game a lot. Just started playing and I'm already 45+ hours in. Great game! :)Score: ""9.5/10""			"

								I don't know what they did to the networking, but everytime I try to play with a friend, we lose 5 to 10 minutes trying to get into a game. Going to a private tavern is a hassle. Everytime we manage to finish a map (near impossible with the latest update, even with fully upgraded old NM4 gear with fully upgraded shards), another 5 to 10 minutes are lost because one of the players in the party has to restart the game (you can't join the other person's game from a private tavern, from the city and from the main screen the restart is required). Constant request timeouts when you finish a map and has to pick where do you want to go.			"

Perfect game in the hands of the wrong developersDungeon Degender 1 was one of those amazing games that everyone knew and lot of peoples liked it, so it comes with no suprise that Dungeon Defender 2 was made, but it just doesent live up to the expectations.After around 10+ hours it quickly comes out obvious that the game just doesent have enough content... Maps,characters,gamemodes... there just isint enough variety. The game comes out so short that it only takes few hours to reach the max level of 50 and from onwards youll be forced to grind your way trough those exact same maps that arent interesting really at all. Numerous Bugs and Graphical issues also kill the experience a lotGood: Cartoonish graphics are nice Lot of items to collect 4 Player CoOpBad: Lack Of Maps No Customization (Other than paid outfiths) Same enemy types (Gets kind of repeative) Bugs (Antialising from ingame doesent work, Constant Crashing, Memory Leak, Connection issues, odd error messages)DD2 deserves to be made into a big name game with a strong playerbase but with all the issues and lack of content it just falls short too fast. Giving the game a steam workshop so users could craft theyre own maps would make the game 10x better or even the devs coming up with a 10-30+ map pack with new games modes and/or bigger character roster would definetly make the game much more worth the time.As of now its fun with friends but other than its just mediocre tower defence game.

								Game is free, and is actually ok, but not even close to the original DD (which is not free). Being a huge fan of DD I cannot recomend part 2 to anyone who already has part 1. But if you dont have part 1, check part 2 and if you like it then just go and buy the original DD.Maybe on some point devs will be able to turn it not a good game but now it is just grind and boring ... that is the price of a free game i guess.UPDATE1: I have played a bit more and even bought a DLC (one sale now). Was very interesting moment when i reached lvl 50 and somehow was able to join N4 game (even though i was pretty much usless there) and in a few minutes my iPWR have jumped from 170 to 695. Then i have started my own game on N4 and some other low iPWR level guys joined and did exactly the same (some may say it was my fault, did not set a limit) But i was not able to kick anyone because other guys were either AFK or did not know how to vote ... will keep this review negative,			"

								Game is far too different from the first one so far, in a bad way.- Each hero now only has 4 towers (used to be 5)- Unique towers have been removed (electric tower, ensnare aura, bouncer blockade, etc)- Monk has lost all but one of his auras- Many of these new gear passives enforce 'meta' builds- Melee combat is uncomfortable with the new 'lunge forward with every attack' thing- Resistances have been condensed into two categories (DD1 had 4)- Enemies are less interesting- Imo, the graphics feel unfinished, worse than DD1 evenThere have been improvements, but for them to come at the cost some of the core features many of us loved about the first game isn't worth it. The game is just too different. Had Trendy not changed all of these things so drastically and seemingly without good reason, and just improved the stuff that needed it, this game could have been a smash. As it stands, I'm not a fan of this game and wouldn't recommend it.			"

								I really wish I could give this a thumbs up, but I can't.  I'm more neutral it than anything.The biggest issue is there really isn't a sense of progression like Dungeon Defenders 1 had.  I understand that there were balancing issues, but half the fun was dumping all your stats in range or attack speed and watching your towers perform ridiculously.  Dungeon Defenders 2 has more unique towers, but you can't really ""play around"" with them as everything is tied to equipment.  Specs are an interesting concept to replace tower/hero stats, but they're either broken, uninteresting, useless, or some combination of the three.Hopefully it'll turn around by release and impress me, but right now it just doesn't feel like Dungeon Defenders.

								one of the recent patchs was a huge nerf to everything, after struggling to survive and manage in the now messed up â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, they just again today ( 3/8/17 ) nerfed the last bit of anything useful, destroying dryad as a defense means and making this game simply impossible to play, they will never get another micro transaction from me ever again, ill probably simply uninstall tonight and see if dungeon defenders 1 still has a server or not.

								Rewriting my review so its more up to date with the gameFirst up my playtime is divided with alot more hours put on the ps4 version of this game.Also on the ps4 version i have soon three level 50 characters with one of them being around 400 item power.Towers and spheresWith the updates rolling in fixing balancing and fixing stuff it gets a little bit more funwith setting the towers up and what towers to use. Like before i only needed a barrage of cannon towers and maybe one or two ballistas sitting close together. Now with the spacing you cant have as many cannon towers to make the range work all the time which then require the heavy cannonball sphere so you can set out some long range cannonball towers. The heavy cannonball tower isnt as great as the standard one in damage but the range makes it more effective in some lane defences.That being said it gets kinda weird to go to your character changing station on the map just to change the sphere so you can set out the heavy cannonball tower then go back and change back to whatever sphere you are using on the ultra sphere slot.++ a bigger combination of towers on the map then just three (two good offensive and the wall tower)- - weird way to make it happensuggestionThe heavy cannonball sphere should either have more effects or make the sphere into something else you maybe unlock upon reaching level 50 and not something you have to equip. More like just a alternative version of the cannonball tower that you can EASY change to when in the building stage.This also applies to the other tower changing spheres the other characters have. Its a great idea so i say: more alternative tower version = more gameplay (yeah i know, it requires a lot more work and balancing also).LootI love how they changed up the hero weapons to have more variety in weapon speed and attack pattern. There is also the special weapons (betsy weapons and spooky weapons and more) and thats real good. ""more variety"" = ""more gameplay"" to a certain degree.StoryBecause i have played from the start of this game when it was more difficult to see any story then the Dark souls games, i dont have any say in this, i think i have to play from the beginning with a new character to experience it.

								To Echo the other reviews: New update basically ruined the game. They stripped out all the old endgame content and replaced it with the same maps but instead of mechanics it has randomized buffs on monsters a la The Underdome from borderlands. They also made gearing arduous and frustrating, and based on a hidden value that your existing pieces have. Give it a pass until they do some kind of fix.EDIT: Another couple dozen hours of play in, def give this a pass. We got all our gearing woes sorted out and managed to slowly crawl up to the top tier content where one is treated to the worst designed enemy in any game I've played in this decade. This is an enemy with about a third of the HP of a wave boss, that spawns in groups, can teleport around the map, and glue themselves to you one at at time doing massive damage to you and defense near you. They mechanically get knocked off when taking damage but don't worry, the other ones that spawned in other lanes at the same time will happily take their place. Also you're constantly silenced as long as they're on you and they seem to leave you permanently silenced when they're done. Which has been a 'bug' for the month since this launched. Is it doable? Sure. Is it fun? Absolutely not. Total trash game design and a poorly designed frustrating difficulty spike.			"

								This game seems to have done to RPG games what Team Fortress 2 did for online army/war games. Made the genre nice and fun. A great, fun game to grind away with your mates in teams of 4 or by your lonesome. Bright and cartoony graphics make it easy on the eye, yet not cheesy in any way. It runs like a charm, smooth play and I have yet to experience any bad lag issues, just a couple of spikes here and there. The Devs are doing their job with consitant updates, changes and improvements. Looking forward to seeing where the game is headed. My only gripe is that you can't gift items to friends in game, or even drop them on the floor for some to pick up, OH, and it would be nice to see some way of upgrading your armour and weapons. That's about the only negative things I could say about the game really. Great fun and addictive.			"

								- I rate this game Positive with Mixed Feelings-Heres why:I am a big DD1 and DD2 fan, I generally enjoy tower defense games, and this game is no diffrent. Since the game is now free, I can easily have friends download it, and hang out for a day just leveling new characters, or trying difficultys that are too hard for us just too try and win, what you want out of a tower defense game in the first place.-Why is the game getting so trashed?Recently there was an update, a lot of players myself included that had spend hundreads of hours basically got knocked down to a casual level, our gears stats were randomized and most our effort was destroyed. That said, its for a better tomorrow. The game gets updates that changes it to its fundemental core for endgame, when this happens you always role the dice on if you're going to be setback, don't look at it as your time wasted, but as the game improving to a final state. Its obviouse the developers want there to be a semi-hard core scene for DD2, and its all in prep to see who has the best stratagy to down harder content, and get better gear.-What do I dislike?As if stolen from Diablo 3, they added paragon points after hitting max level. (I say D3 because the only game I currently play that has them. :) )) These add more grinding to help improve your character overtime, but personally I'm not a big fan of them, the game seems to be designed around these paragon points for character progresion, so thats also part of the reason old and new players were on a more even playing field, the more you grind the more it'll help you climb the ranks.-What would I like to see in the game?I would like to see some sort of ipwr, armor restriction, or something along those lines to joining harder difficultys. I want there to be a clear progression path for all players old and new that can't be skipped because you have someone like me with enough gear to afk through harder content, friends love me but they don't understand how quickly they burn them-selfs out just letting someone carry them while they afk, thats not where the true heart of the game lies.-Final ThoughtsI'll continue to play this game on and off for years to come, i'll continue to support the design team by buying their skins and other DLC, for a day I can clearly say ""This is better than DD1, hands down."" till then, keep on grinding, unlock those characters, and make use of the weekend events ect.

Early Access Review
								It's a great shame that Dungeon Defenders II is as dissapointing as it is. I loved the first one and played it loads in splitscreen with my partner. While I bought a few DLC packs (that I understand were fairly controversal) the base game felt like a complete experience with plenty of levels and characters and tons of replay value.I actually bought Dungeon Defenders II before it became free to play for around Â£18, due to my love of the first game. My initial reaction, particularly of the artsyle, was of how much it resembled those crappy mobile games like Clash of Clans. Dungeon Defenders 1 was of course very cartoony but had a level of charm that elevated it above the generic cartoon style of F2P cash-cow mobile trash. Dugeon defenders II on the other had looks very tacky.  The problems don't end at the artstyle though; by going F2P the game now feels like a rubbish F2P MMO. When launching you are greeted by messages asking to buy things and enter a lobby with loads of other players milling about and spamming the chat with nonsense. As a result I overall did not enjoy my experience with the game so far. My reward for both buying in to the game early and spending Â£18 was very little, maybe 1 skin as far as I can remember. Performance isn't great although the game is in early access so this may change. Overall I feel the move to F2P was a huge mistake. While the tower defense genre is hardly an easy genre to compete in what with many other games existing in this genre I feel Dungeon Defenders 1's blend of tower defense with Diablo-style classes and loot was unique and interesting to stand apart from the competition. On top of that brilliant levels, music, art design, and charm meant the first Dungeon Defenders was well worth the up-front investment. I feel the developers almost didn't have faith in their own product with Dungeon Defenders II in their decision to go F2P, feeling they needed to rely on the game being free to attract an audience and that an up-front cost would turn away buyers. As a result the game has taken a huge hit to it's value; feeling tacky, grindy, and just generally unappealing. There is still hope I suppose, the game is still in Early Access and there is time for the devs to reverse the decision of going F2P or at least improve the game signifiicantly that it becomes worthy of a try. By the time the title releases (and exits early access) I will give it another shot and see if it is any better, I hope so because I want to enjoy this game as much as the first but so far I've not been impressed.

								I rreally enjoyed DD1 and had a good time with it.   The biggest stumbling block of most F2p/P2W games is they put most of their endgame content behind either a huge timewall or a paywall.DD2 seems to have gone with the timewall.   The game is fun at first.   Once you unlock your abilitites it quickly becomes stale and boring.   Little new information or items are thrown at you and skills have little to no depth or subtlety in their execution.TLDR: Just play DD1.   You wont have to re-lvl or farm all your stuff.   Its basically the same with some new wrapping.PSA:   Trendy studio is also a POS who is suing another company (coincidentally) right as their game started to tank.   Desperate grasp for cash maybe?  This is also a major driving factor in me dropping the game and abandoning all trendy products.			"

								Early access games often have some sort of in game purchases to help fund the game's development. This is a practice that is as widely accepted as it is criticized. Usually the purchases are for cosmetic items to customize your character in some way. Dungeon Defenders has that.Another thing dungeon defenders has is...$24.99 DLC that increases your inventory space and gives you a title.You know a developer doesn't give the slightest semblance of a crap for you when they sell you inventory space for real cash.This game deserves to be on an iPad, not on Steam.

								I got this early before it was free to play.  I loved the first DD and I like this one.  I have some resurvations about some of the mechanics but in general I like the way the company is approaching it.  It's fun and it's not Pay to Win.  It's Pay to customise (mainly your look)  there are a few convinances that cost also (like extra bag space) but in general you don't pay for better weapons, upgrades, faster leveling, or anything else required to win.  I think DD1 had some aspects I liked a little more but DD2 is still great and it's not done yet.  The company listens to the players, lets you vote on upcoming choices and has great live streams where they actually address and answer YOUR questions.  If you like the First Person Tower Defense games (Sanctum, DD1) I recomend it.  And I'm still looking forward to seeing what else they do to make it even better before it stops being Early Access.Update:  Game is still fun though content is still a bit light.  I wonder if the game operated on DLC terms, where I could buy more content, if the updates would be more dense.  As it is I tend to wait a month or two for content updates then jump on and have a few days of fun before waiting for the next few content updates.  If you are planning on trying this out for the first time it's worth it, Free for a lot of fun.  If you like it I recomend buying bags to support the company as they make the game a bit nicer.  If you don't then it didn't cost you anything.   However if you run out of things to do or are waiting for some of the changes or new content to come aobut, know that it's a slow process.  Trendy seems to still be delivering, and listenning to the people who play, but it does seem painfully slow.			"

								This game used to be so good, probably one of my favorite games for a while. Then it became a ""free to play"" game, aka ""pay to win"". All the new content that used to be free to you now has to be payed for with irl money. This game sued to be super fun, but now with 4 new characters that i will never be able to play, and special events that I will have limited to no involvement in; it is just sad. This game used to be a solid 5/5...No it struggles to even get past a 1.5/5 for me. Sure the base game will always be the same, but half the fun of playing this game was waiting for the new content that the Devs released every so often. It re sparked the games fun for me, and now that is gone. The game becomes repetitive and dull when you don't have new content. As much as I would want to recommend this game, I can't. Making it pay to win and pay to have fun is just sad. (Keep in mind I do have this opinion because I have had the game since almost initial release | But if you don not like in game purchase games, don't waste your time)			"

								DD1 was amazingBought this before Steam early access and was VERY disapointed.The original pitch for DD2 is that it was going to be a MOBA game and I had ZERO interest in buying it, Then they announced they had scrapped that idea went back to the drawing board and were going to stay more true to the original - They did not.The tower defence aspects in DD2 are vastly inferior to DD1 (which for me was the best part of DD1)  No longer can you place your towers as your main defence and fight as filler during the combat phase.  You must now place your (weak) towers and fight for your life during the combat phase or you will NOT win.If you prefer the combat side to the tower defence side then this game may be for you,  If you prefer the tower defence side to the combat side (as I do) I just cannot recommend this game, Which is unfortunate as DD1 was such a masterpiece.

And not a cheap free to play... They constantly updade the game with new heros, new maps and no need to pay. If you actively play, you can get all this for free. Now some people will whine that it's P2W because they have to work to unlock some stuff. Guess what? People are making games for a living. Someone need to pay them. So it's fair that they sell packs to unlock few heroes more quickly and that they sell skins. The only things you cannot get without paying are all and only cosmetic stuff. It's not P2W... Just play the game and you'll notice that you can earn the medals needed to unlock new heroes pretty quickly.Honestly, it's one of the best F2P I ever seen and one of the most fair if we consider players that pay VS players that dont pay. This game deserve a way higher rating than it currently is.			"

In their most recent hotfix patch they have made the dryad completely unplayable in an effort to increase the difficulty, this patch coming after a large amount of players bought the character with real money in order to progress. Super disapointing and regretting spending any money on this game!Careful spending any money on any feature of this game as devs do not care about player investment at all.			"

								Dungeon Defenders 2 should've been a very, very good game like the first one, but since its early access release, there have been so many tiny little things done wrong that were never corrected. All of these cascaded into the poor time of today; and no one is better for it.Bugs that have existed since the dawn of the game are still in, I'm not talking about small minor ones. No, I'm talking about pretty major ones such as matchmaking issues, enemy/map glitching and player's towers being broken. On top of that, the game is repetitive. Once you've played the campaign once, you've seen practically the entire game. You're never forced to adopt and refine your strategies or are given new interesting challenges to play through. The ""incursions"" the game offers, maps that have a special objective of some sort, are a far cry from DD1's challenges due to the fact that the player is given very little option to play around the special objectives. Simple invincibility fields or having the player run around to catch collectibles do not provide interesting challenges to the player, because there's no smart way to play it. You either play ""Simon-says"" with the map, or do the same thing you've been doing except without personally attacking with your hero. The player is not given a choice, and without a choice to make there is no obstacle to overcome.I believe this comes from a fundamental design flaw within the development team. They seem to be prioritizing making new content and incentive systems instead of making a game that is worth playing. If the game itself is not a sound concept, it does not matter how much content or grind mills you put into the game. Nobody wants to play your revival maps, and they most certainly don't want to run through your grind mills. This is why it's very important for early access games to focus on the game itself, not the content it has.If you're just a person looking for a game to mess around with friends though, there's a few hours of enjoyment for you here, as long as you can look past all the bugs. Otherwise, I would highly recommend simply purchasing DD1 instead of hoping this game works. If you really want to look for this game in the future, try to look at what the development team is doing and try to figure out their focus. Once you notice a large shift in their thinking, that will probably be the time this game comes back to light.			"

								What happened to Dungeon Defenders 2?In short: I no longer like the look and feel the game has. I just donât enjoy playing these âwalking stickâ characters. I feel that all the small things, that made me enjoy DD1, are no longer part of DD2.For me personally, itâs a huge step back from DD1. The first thing I noticed when I played is, that nothing is familiar. Everything is completely different and not in a good way. All the menus such as character, level and inventory menus are very confusing. The enjoyment of upgrading your character and spending time on searching through good items, is no longer there for me. I find find it rather annoying and confusing to go through all the menus.In DD1, the mana crystals which are needed to build towers, were so much fun to collect. In DD2, I donât even see them properly. What happened? Why are they so tiny?Same for all monsters and player characters along with the weapons. Theyâre all so small and look like walking sticks. Sometimes the monsters blend into the environment and you canât even make them out. I donât like the art design of the 3D models that they went with. I prefer the more âbubblyâ look from DD1.Towers? I loved playing a mage in DD1, the art design was great, but in DD2 all the mage towers look cheap, as if they were rushed.And no, donât say âOh but early access, they might change these thingsâ. No they donât. The development of the game is now focusing on optimizing the game and bug fixes, they are not making any major changes anymore.			"

								I will try to explain some points:1) The game itself:   -The game is not bad at all: looks beautiful and Trendy seems to spend a lot of money on it, even nowadays. I would say it has a very different game concept if we compare it to DD1. I personally prefer DD1 style.   -It is a little boring. This is not the same DD1 we used play and which we spent hours creating a good tower defense scheme..   -Trendy deliver new contents often. This is a very good point.   -Most of other reviews are legit; the good ones and the bad ones.2) The project management:   -I agree that developing games requires a lot of resources (money, time, patience, life, etc) and there are great risks. But that's not excuse to such bad administration. I bought the game on alpha because I believed that It would help them to finish the game I loved to play. But years later it is still on alpha.. and for free! >:(   -Playing alpha for such long time is waste of time.   -Now the game is free you can play it and check it by yourself. ;)			"

								Dungeon Defender 2 is not good.The Biggest issue to me is the Lags. You can choose to play on any of their 3 servers (EU, AU, US) oftenly experience the horrible rubberband and teleport all over the place. I don't know what cause these lags. be it Net code or server issue or whatever. It's really really bad.Next problem is the Junkyard management simulator problem. There are a few Good equipment stats which are randomly generated for the loot drops. To get them you just need to farm over and over until you randomly get the one you want for your build. while selling other  10,000 junks you don't need. There doesn't seems to be any kind of reroll for equipments.The inventory system is a mess. It would take me like 30 minutes to sort the items i picked up from one mission. to see which has good stats/passives then discard(sell) the rest. I have been using all the sorting option they provide with the bags-autoloot system. but it still took me that long because i expand my inventory (by purchase more inventory bags) and have the autoloot on some of them.Also, there's no trading between players. the few of interactions between players are Chatting and Co-operative play.So i would not recommend this game for anyone. it's bad and sad.

								I'm writing this review on the 8th of December - 14. A Very familiar feel to the first game, definetely needs some polishing, in terms of level design and combat in general. Servers also need an upgrade, as jerking and teleporting, as well as delayed attacks and spells are quite definite. The way the game is right now, is unplayable, unless you are comftorable grinding endless hours. Also, Singleplayer and Co-op is unplayable, as combat is not fixed for either one. I would like to see much more customization and more RPG'esk mechanics introduced. I know this game probably has a while until it will feel polished and fun to play, but at the moment I do not recommend it.			"

								I am having trouble enjoying this game anymore, even though I want to. Pros:You can get fun outfits without having to pay real money for them.You can get some of the highest lvl pets without having to pay real money for them.There is no pay to win aspect in this game.With those pros you would think that this game would be a great mmo tower defense, but the cons make you loath the process you have to undergo in order to even attempt the nightmare difficulty playthroughs. DD2 stops being a game of strategy long before you reach even the hard or insane difficulty levels preceding the nightmare ones. Cons:Grind, Grind, Grind goes the player. Item drops are arbitrary. What I mean by this is that the high lvl gear that drops as you solo a difficult map, will hardly ever be gear you actually want for ANY of your characters. What adds insult to injury is the carnival ticket mechanic. During every map playthrough, carnival ticket's drop, and for every 10 tickets that drop, you can spin the carnival wheel for the chance of getting Legendary gear of your current avg item lvl. This is the only way to dependably get good gear, because Legendary gear is the best in the game. So, even if it is not perfect for your build you may still be able to use it. To use the wheel in this way requires that you equip terrible tier gear that have high item lvls. This way you increase your avg item level before you spin the wheel. If you do not have tickets, you can use 2500 in game currency to spin the wheel. So, you end up farming maps for gold, then spinning the wheel until you get better gear, finally playing the same old maps at a higher difficulty setting, and then restarting the process all over again to advance to the next difficulty setting.Therefore, this game is more than just a grind fest, but also a redundant waste of time with no true reward for effort expended.

								Charming. Technically tower defense but not really. Hack-n-slash and pew pew game that takes almost no skill at all. Farm endlessly for no reason because there's literally nothing else to do.No real strategy. Basically block off every path and prevent the mobs from getting through. Have good gear = win. Not having good gear actually makes it fun and challenging but the fun doesn't last all that long.There's essentially one only one way to play each of the 4 characters. There is no depth to this game at all.High level play, like level 30+, devolves to players swapping their high level characters in to place OP towers and afk every round. Bugged flying mobs are the only thing keeping people active because it slows down the farmfest. Beyond level 40 the game begins to feel nearly dead. Probably because people with half a brain don't keep playing hoping it gets more interesting like I did. There are barely any players to play with aside from the farmers. Once you find a farmer, you can afk and go do something better with your time. Literally anything.You constantly replace gear because this game is all about ascending and descending in power. Take a few zeros off the numbers and check it out! It's as if you're still level 10! The difference is maybe your weapon looks cooler and your gear icons glow and have colorful borders.The gear you are constantly replacing isn't shown on your character. Instead, the devs have opted for costumes that you can buy with real money so your character actually changes appearance aside from weapons. Some of the costumes are cool but that's not going to excuse how silly the Squire runs and pretty much just makes it look even more ridiculous. It's like the devs looked at the melee character and said, ""Make this one pretty much â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥."" However, the attack animations are pretty damned good. The character goes from derp to Spartan warrior at the click of a button.It's charming and could be cool but deep down, just like The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot, it's garbage and will be until time erases it.

Early Access Review
 Decent game, did not live up to DD1	Admittedly, this game is fun. The item progression and character progression make you feel more powerful as you play. The art style is unique and fun. Having it free to play is a bold move, but having paid for access earlier, I do not feel rewarded.However, this is a shell of what it could have been. Dungeon Defenders 1 had more classes, a better item system, a higher level cap and even more enemies (feels better killing 1000 enemies rather than 100). Rather than refining on a tried and true model, they created a different game, taking multiple steps backwards. Character leveling takes far too long, enemies do not spawn properly, waves take ages...After the trainwreck of Dungeon Defenders Eternity and this game falling flat, I cannot recommend this game, or even Trendy. While they produce many podcasts, they seem to have almost no involvement with the community (or at least the vast majority). The games have tons of bugs, many of which should have been easy fixes. It's laughable, really.			"

								The moment the Devs added in the Siege roller the game took a significant step backwards in terms of fun and overall playability. I'll freely admit that the current meta of Poison Dart Tower/Serenity Aura made most levels a joke but making an enemy that is virtually invincible to towers and forcing you to switch to a DPS hero puts a spotlight on how poorly thought out it was; not to mention the fact that despite heavy complaints from players virtually nothing has been done to rectify the situation making some levels almost impossible to pass unless you have 4 players geared to the hilt.In its current state I personally wouldn't recommend it but that is obviously subject to change depending on how the game progresses.

								NOTE: Keep in mind, the game must be paid for in order to play at the moment, as it is in Early Access. It will become Free To Play at around the end of the year. Also, a lot of the negative reviews on the front page are complaining about issues that have been fixed or changed or complaining about features that are not in the game YET.In my opinion, This game has a lot of potential. Even though it is currently in early access, it feels like it has enough replayibility to keep me going for hundreds of hours with the latest update. Now, here are some of the pros and cons for the game in its current state.Some Pros: + Pretty art design, the way it is done gives the game a more 'Toon' feel to it. + Alot more enemy diversity compared to DD1.  + The Game is regularly updated, with the latest patch adding loads of content in to the game. + The people who work on the game interact with the community and hold Developer streams on Twitch every friday. + According to the developers, There won't be DLC Map packs, so the community won't be split. + The music in the game is good. + The towers have more 'Personality' as i would call it... + Once it goes F2P, It won't be P2W. + Betsy and cute Propellor Cats + If you do buy Early Access, you get $30 worth of ingame currency to buy costumes with.A few Cons: - It's in early access, so you have to pay to be able to play it. - Tavern is laggy and the game feels slightly unoptimized. - Uber Skill Spheres cost waaaaaaay too many Wyvern Tokens.. (i call the tokens 'Betsy Bucks') - Level cap that does not take long to reach. (Level Cap will be increased later on) - Earlier maps become meaningless to play once you hit level 25. (They are adding Incursions soon for them to make them playable in late game again) - Bug paradise - No controller support yet.Note: Most of the problems i have with the game a due to the game still being in development and a lot of the features are not in it yet.Final Verdict: While the game is unfinished and has it's fair share of problems, it's fun, which is what people really look for in games. 8/10 (in it's current state)			"

								Firstly, the game is good but a few things have just irked me from the get go. The fact that when you level you cant put any upgrade points into tower stats is a massive fail, it is necessary to reinstate this to be able to even have the smallest chance on higher difficulties. The fact is to improve your towers you are completelly reliant on equpment drops (which are rare as â¥â¥â¥â¥)  The lack of controller support is annoying for now but i understand that this will be added later so isnt that important of a point to make now.The graphics are a nice improvement and i like the art style in general. Trash equpment that nobody wishes to pick up now no longer vanishes and gets banked at the end of each wave it stays until the end of the map making everything look cluttered by the end and instead of auto selling everything and splitting the cash it splits it into each persons inventory which you then have to manually sell or wait a few days for the auto sell.the preorder stated $30 of in game cash but my account has 0, not sure if thats a UK thing but i havent got a dime.The map order is strange and have yet had a chance to work out what sort of order I should be doing them in with no solid structure like numbering added to the map names it is slightly confusing. The lobbies need an option to kick or to votekick idle players as they come in the game and build a few towers the reap the benefits of xp with no action able to be taken against them and it gets worse when the random lobby host is rolled onto them on endgame and everyone has to find a new lobby.The building mana needs to have a higher drop rate as I have gone through games only being able to build a handful of towers that are then just destroyed as I dont have enough mana to upgrade or repair them.To sum up, levelling feels pointless apart from being able to equip slightly better armour now and then when the lynchpin of all rpg style games is character progression and on dd2 it feels completely dead and worthless. Many more issues such as droprates need to be looked at and until this is updated i will probably stay away from this game for now. I will change my reccomendation upon further updates if improvements are made. "

								Ver. - AlphaHello, At the beginning I would like to say that the game itself isn't bad, but there's no ""Neutral"" button to press and my personal game preference pointer is slightly towards ""Wouldn't recommend"", that's why my review is negative.The game itself isn't that bad, just so you know.As a new player to the ""Action-Tower Defense"" games you'll probably like it. The opposite goes for players that spend XXX hours playing the first Dungeon Defenders.Anyway let's write about few things that I would like you guys to know...1. This time they've made a game as F2P(free to play) with cosmetic microtransactions(mostly) as Cash Shop. Don't be fooled by this. Character slots are limited to 4 - you need to pay to get more slots. And you will need more, when new characters will be introduced to the game. The second problem is you Inventory, starting bags are limited, they fill with items really quick - more bags of course are available with cash. It wouldn't really be that big problem if the items like chests or pet stuff would stack, but sadly it doesn't...2. Unlike DD1 you characters here have more skills to use, which is kinda nice - 3 skills + heal, but you have less towers to build, only 4.3. Game looks a bit better than DD1, a bit more cartoony I would say.4. If the game host got crappy connection or his internet will start doing some nasty stuff(high ping, dropping packets, etc) you and other players will be laggy as hell, be ready for that.5. Pet hatching time, 48h to hatch an egg - hatching can fail(no pet, sorry)6. Number of trash items dropped isn't bad, like it was in DD1, it was earlier in alpha but they've reduced trash drops.7. No character customization - just outfits unlocked via chests.I think that would be all I can think about at the moment.To sum it up, DD1 sucked me in for many, many hours of fun, and I really enjoyed it and love the game, while DD2 just doesn't feel this way, it lacks something that keeps you interested in the game.In a bit funny way I will type this:You sit at the table and you see two things on this table - 1. Sandwitch with cheese(represents DD2) and 2. Pizza(represents DD1). Which one would you pick? - This is how I see this two games. DD1 - 9/10 (-1 for the number of trash drops)DD2 - 4.5/10			"

								This game has fooled me one too many times with updates promising gameplay that should have been implemented from the start. Bugs and broken gameplay elements remain unfixed and unchanged for months. The core game is a broken and unbalanced grindfest that's not worth your time, money, or patience. It's been years since release and if feels just as unfinished on the gameplay side as it did on day one. This game looked to be good one and I've rooted for it from the beginning, but it's in the hands of inept developers who have squandered away it's amazing potential. TLDR; Save your time and money, this game sucked then, sucks now, and will still suck in the future.			"

								Ive tried to like this game but just cant. It just feels like a generic knockoff of Dungeon Defenders 1. The levels feel really claustrophobic, the lanes are so tight that when your towers are firing down a lane it looks like the finale to a 4th of july fireworks show, obscuring all sight of what is actually coming down the lane. The movement just doesnt feel intuitive and many objects on the levels seem to have almost the same height as your jumps apex making navigation through the tight levels a pain. The only thing i do like is the new action skills but other then that the game is a huge letdown and id recommend just playing DD1 over this mess.**Update: The game has improved alot. theyve fixed some of the movement issues. collisions could use some work because atm u get stuck on many invisible objects and cant walk over any little bump so u have to jump alot to get onto things that you would think u could just walk right up onto. its easier to see the mobs coming over the graphical effects from your towers, although it can still get a little crazy at times and could be toned down abit or use more transparent effects. atm they seem to use alot of opaque 2d sprites for effects that obscure everything behind them. net code could use work when your in the tavern but seems to be pretty good in co-op matches. figuring what stats have what on an item has been greatly simplified and is much more intuitive now. im still not a fan of the small inventory. u can buy larger bags with earned gold though so thats a plus and alleviates quite abit of that headache but it still feels lacking when u start to play multiple char's. overall though they have improved the game greatly and is worth trying if u were a big DD1 fan. keep an eye on it atleast.

								I've been waiting a long time for this to come out, and yet here it is December 2014 and this is still only ""pre-alpha""??? As other have said, no controller support yet, and no split-screen local multiplayer either!! So those 2 things right there limit my enjoyability for this game since my brother and I have been playing the original DD together for a few years.Also, I'm not a fan of the forced online ""instances"", a la MMORPGs. I hate those kind of games. I generally play games alone or locally with a friend, or very rarely with a friend online. I seriously do not have any interest in playing with random people online. I did not know this was the case before I bought it.And, did something change, because I distinctly remember the Dungeon Defenders website saying that DD2 would be a free-to-play game, with in-game purchase of items, levels, etc. Yet they're asking $24.99 (20% off until 12/12) for this unfinished game! I went ahead and bought it yesterday anyway, though, since I loved DD1, but the current state of the game leaves a lot to ask for.Yes, I get that they're calling this ""pre-alpha"" and ""early access"". But since this game has been in development for a long time now, I would have imagined they be further along, and at least have the same features as the first game (controller support, splitscreen multiplayer, pop up menus for your powers/summons, ability to upgrade your items in your inventory with mana, etc.)The good: The game looks great; the graphics and animations are well polished. Some neat new game play aspects. Simplified mechanics, each hero now only gets 4 types of powers and 4 kinds of summonable defenses.The bad: Core features are missing! HELLO? What happened to controller support and split screen multiplayer??? Also, the music gets repetitive very fast. Some of the new aspects and mechanics are confusingly presented. For instance, you can't get your inventory or character stats without visiting the defenders forge. Level ups seem to be automatic, except for points you can distribute, but you must go to the forge.As others have said, you don't get as much green mana for summoning as DD1. Basically there's now blue mana for powers and green mana for summons. In my 2 hours of play so far, the levels end up littered with blue mana crystals that I can't pick up because I'm already full, yet my green mana is either empty or nearly half full. I guess this is a balance problem, hopefully they'll address it.RECOMMENDATION: Not worth even the sale price of $19.99. They need to bring back the core features I loved about DD1. Maybe once they've released a few more patches it'll be up to my expectations.			"

								29.99 for early access, you know, to help the game and the devs out early on... heres the kicker, i had maxed heros, and baddest gear the game made... only to have it all stripped from me in an update, and given nothing back in return... seems fair, whatever, i shrugged it off... heres the kicker, now if i want to ""upgrade"" and get full features the game offers, i have to pay another 49.99........................ sooooooooo in total, i HELPED this game in early development, and for this, they want me to pay 80 dollars to play it in its entirety. i hope that you read this review before considering this game, trust me, there are MANY more games in this genre that are MUCH better and not a complete cash grab.. you get yellow coins that are absolutely worthless, and the gems that are required to buy everything require micro-transactions of actual cash to buy.... this game will cost you 100s of dollars for basic enjoyable gameplay... pass on it, trust me. TRY SANCTUM 2, MUCH MUCH BETTER AND MORE AFFORDABLE, AND THEY DONT SPAM FOR YOUR CASH! "

								If this is the endgame they have ruined it for players that have been there since the beginning. I didn't pay for extra inventory space. I paid for extra inventory BAGS. But somehow you saw fit to remove them and make a big jumbled mess of the inventory compared to what it once was like. And in the end this game is just a terrible follow up to DD1. Shards are not equipping into items i had previously. All my heroes items only accept blue shards but no wait they don't take those either for some reason. There is no reason to punish myself to earn ""Ascension"" just to earn skills when I already had to farm the gold to get those skills to begin with. Again terrible follow up to DD1. Could not be more disappointed.			"

								So I bought this game a couple of months ago, and I enjoyed playing it initially. It does get quite old after a while. I think they need far more items and item models to make it interesting. That's not my biggest problem with this game though. I happened to be browsing on steam today and one of my suggested items is a DLC pack for this game... why is an unfinished game launching paid DLC packs? This company is clearly just trying to grab all the money they can, steer clear.			"

								It just doesn't feel right.I bought dungeon defenders 2 on a whim (before it went f2p) because I really liked dungeon defenders (the first game) but this just doesn't feel like a sequal to that game. This game lacks depth and that is also why it gets boring quite quickly.(Btw, they haven't updated their mobile version of the old game on IOS making it unplayable)			"

								The game isn't bad, but it's not amazing right now either. Compared to the first DD nothing really wow's me or makes me say ""Wow that was an obvious and needed upgrade!"". What I see are a bunch of little changes that I found unnecessary, the little things so to speak. For example...-Mana crystalsIn the first DD it was fun just running around watching the mana crystals float around and gobbling them up. Killing an ogre and watching it explode into huge mana crystals was oddly satisfying. And seeing the ground littered with mana crystals after destroying wave after wave of minions was awesome. Now there are just little uninspiring little diamonds, just makes it feel more grindy. -TowersThe towers feel kind of meh. I mainly played as a squire, the cannon balls towers in the first game which albeit not the best towers were hilarious to set up and watch all the balls just go bouncing around. They are replaced by generic projecticle explody turrets. The ballista towers which were so fun to just watch go pew pew pew and tens of ballista projectiles go all around the map is so boring now. They just fire every 5 seconds or whatever and the range sucks. Additionally my friend plays a monk and I don't like how the auras from the monks are just so small and are basically circles on the ground instead of huge epic semi spheres. All these little changes that just make the game less epic compared to the first DD. -MapsThe maps are alright. Nothing amazing, nothing outright bad. All of them boil down to find chokepoints, build towers at chokepoints, kill big health mini boss at end of round. Gets kinda repetitive after a while. But its the beginner maps so thats to be expected. -ArmorI was highly disappointed that armor doesn't show up on your character still. Felt like that would've been an obvious added feature upgrade from the first DD. Anyway, I know I've only played ~8 hours on this game so far, but I compare this with my experience with DD I. When I first got DD I i was skeptical of the game, I got it for like 5 bucks and thought it was going to be one of those play for 5 hours and forget it indie games. But then I logged over 400 hours officially but probably alot more (steam account got reset), got to end game farming perfect 600/600/600/600 kobolds and selling for cubes, getting the super legendary skins etc, I played that game to the fullest. Compared with this game I went in with so much enthusiasm and after 7 hours or so I just feel meh. Overall, I know alot of these criticisms seem kind of small but for me they all add up to a product that in its current state just doesn't have the 'magic' of DD I.			"

								How did this game manage to go down hill like that? I left the game since there wasn't all that much to do at the moment I picked it up, I capped lvl on my squire and monk got good enough gear and was pretty much able to solo most challenges and group up to do anything I couldn't on my own so I felt like there wasn't much more to the game for me and I waited for some new patches to add new stuff to the game to make it more engaging and interesting.But hoo boy did they make the game suck as much as they could in the meanwhile. Well that is not completely fair it seems like they tried some things but they ended up making the game unfriendly from what I've seen all the playable builds have been destroyed (I guess they just ABSOLUTELY HAVE to sell the new heroes somehow so tearing down the old ones will do the trick) but again that might be my idea I did see a lot of monks so they gotta have something useful to contribute, but from all that I've seen the new heroes own the battlefield where as the old ones maybe contribute a tower or two on the map, sometimes?I know maybe I should have put more time in the game to be able to make a better review, but the fact alone that the game alienated me so much from the very beginning is a marvel on it self quest that don't explain anything, you have to know what to do from before. But did they tell you before what you needed to do? OF COURSE NOT, who needs tutorials anyway, so off you go to the forums to find out, and you do people are nice enough to explain thing the DEVELOPERS SHOULD.But appart from all that the worst thing is that the game had real potential, and I guess it still has. But I wouldn't hold my breath. If it happens though this game will be amazing if they actually manage to fix all this mess they created. But to me it seems they are more concerned with selling costumes and heroes rather than making the game player friendly and not feel like a grind fest. And that is the last thing I have a problem with, the grind, from what I've been told (since there is no chance I'd stick around for that farce as well) is disgusting, grinding months for medals to get bag slots to fill up with multiple same shards which don't stack (because of course they don't we gotta sell more bag slots) and you might need a bunch of them (again take care this is what people have told me in game and what I've seen in forums but also the fact that my bags got half full with 1 hour of gameplay. I've read of more problems but since I didn't encounter at all I wont put here but I can't say I don't believe exist. Over all I wish this game gets a lot better than it currently is because for as long as I went on with it it was really fun and also a really good game to play with friends and have a laugh sometimes with the maps and the enemies but as it stands I'd say keep an eye on it for the chance of getting better, but as I said, I wouldn't hold my breath if I where you.

								Faster paced than the original, and much less focused on strategic defense than it is on ""KIL AL THUH THINGZ"".If people like fast paced games, that's fine and their preference, but as I prefer to rely more on thought than snap reactions, and have adrenaline problems, this game is Not Playable for me.The focus more on thick-action combat than strategic tower placement turns this into more of a hack-fest. Again, fine if you are looking for a combat-oriented game, but if you want something that rewards planning and a long term strategy, this is not it.I loved the original, but this? I'm not happy that the devs have leaned more toward this fastactiongogogokablamyeahgogogo direction, but that's me. Someone who likes fast games might well love it......but purely from my perspective and preference for games that don't punish taking time to think, I can not recommend this.			"

								Long time DD1 player. Easily clocked over 1.5k Hours. Even had a Carry shop. Now that was a stratigic tower defense game.Now DD2 not so much. The game is F2P now and it shows. A once fun and enjoyable series is now very blandtastic, bug support is non exsistent especially for in game mico transactions. Everytime they patch the game they seem to break more things than they fix. If this game was suppose to be the new upgraded shiny version of DD1 they failed and failed horriably. This is a soft shell of what it could and should have been. The gameplay is stale and very limited in terms of what and how you can use. The meta is overly boring and require no skill at all to get to the the ""hardest"" difficulty of NM4. Which if you played DD1 is the equivilent to insane+ even if that.So much wrong with this ""sequel"" thats its not even a sequel... I wish they would have just went with their even worse first idea and made this game a moba so that I didnt even waste my time waiting for them to come around.			"

Early Access Review
								Well, where should I begin?Dungeon defenders 2 is the sequel to what's probably one of my favourite games, to be honest, it's quite disappointing but I can't hold too much against it as it is only in alpha at the moment, if I haven't updated this and it's in like beta when you're reading this then you should probably just ignore it. This is what I will say for now, however:The game is rather similar to the original DD but to me it just feels straight up bad in comparison. Let's talk about the main two components of both games, combat and strategy:The combat of this game is quite different to the original, in the original you will be greeted by hordes of weak enemies who surround you and make combat a challenge as you smoothly slice or gun them down dodging lots of orcs (basically like big tank enemies who slowly swing big axes) and projectiles along the way, it sounds easy but as there are so many of them, it makes it an awesome but still balanced challenge. However, in this second installment, it's changed for the worse, there are around 15 enemies on each part who all just feel a chore to kill, they have a lot more health but as it's not a proper fun horde, they are all easy to dodge and kill, it just takes AGES, it takes around 5 hits just to kill a goblin (a small enemy which is extremely weak, obviously there are a lot more in DD1). Did I mention melee? Using a melee weapon is just annoying as anything, every attack lunges you forward in the most awkward and uncontrollable way with a melee weapon. I've fell off cliffs trying to fight as a squire (the knight class in the game), so melee weapons and melee combat has just turned to total crap. Ranged weapons aren't any better though, really, all you do with one is move backward and shoot, which is no fun, I'd probably rather be a messed up knight, jerking uncontrollably. Basically, all the combat really is, is hitting and using your abilites when you can (just extra powerful attacks in this game really, and self healing). Squires can block but in this game it's useless as anything, I don't even see any difference in the damage they do me.The strategy in this is probably even worse than the combat, let's start with DD1, all the maps could be built up in lots of different ways, some ways a lot better than others, all of the good looking builds worth trying, if you're smart (or you just have ridiculously high stats for the level) you can just build up and sit back to watch it perfectly working, or just grab a cup of tea. Now let's look at DD2, there are two obvious builds for every map, put turrets on the walls of the map and walls to block them off as they die, or just put turrets and walls on the obvious bits of the path. Both aren't really that different at all and no matter whether you chose the best out of the two possible decent builds or not, all the towers need constant supervision, repairing, fighting and all that. There are also environmental traps (such as valves you turn to release smoke and damage the enemies) which you NEED to use, forcing a lot of players in one game, it's hard to play with just one friend, you end up on a public game packed with 7 year old idiots. All the towers also have huge like spaceboxes so you can't place a tower within a meter's range of another, making placing them properly difficult, in DD1 they just couldn't overlap, unless they were monk or hunter traps. In short, there's no real strategy, you just need to run around like a headless chicken attending to your towers and activating environmental traps.Let's move on to looting, this isn't that main a thing in both but it gets a verrrrrrrrrrrry annoying in DD2, you get a new, better weapon almost every wave and upgrading them does barely anything to the stats, all considered (In DD1 you need to upgrade your weapon to do good damage, which in my opinion is good). There is an option to automatically collect loot but it fills up the few bag spaces you have in DD2 very fast and you find yourself sorting good from rubbish after every level. There aren't many different models the items can spawn with either, so you will probably find someone with the same weapon as you in a public tavern. There's also only like 20 different pets in DD2 but tonnes in DD1 and in DD1 EVERYTHING spawns in different sizes and colours, nothing does in 2. This makes looting very bland. The items do spawn with different weights but this is broken so that heavier weapons do more damage per second, even with the same damage stats.Now on to DLC, there's a lot of better, more optional and reasonably priced DLC in the first game, such as different characters with unique abilities but in DD2 it's inventory space for Â£20, More items and IN GAME FREAKING CURRENCY(!!!!!!!!!!!!??????????) for Â£30, how reasonably priced, fun and worth it this is (sarcasm BTW), oh and if anyone wants it's Â£17 for a costume pack on special offer!Summary:DD2= rubbishDD1= awesomeIf you like the look of this then just play DD1, you'll have a much better time.

								Bought this game and now it's free.I don't care if I received in-game currency for my purchase, that was supposed to be a bonus with the purchase, not a hidden purchase as it now seems it was.As far as gameplay goes, I loved this game for a while, but it becomes a gear grind if you want to play into the really high tier nightmare modes. Then finding a game with anyone else is impossible so you have to grind every class to be able to solo, or just play Squire because they're the only class that really needs no other class's help to solo.  Every other class can not solo end game well enough without the best of the best gear, and even then, it's probably impossible.So, broken classes (Squire is better than everything by far) + a broken business model (charging people for the game for over a year and then suddenly making it free to play, prioritizing skins and selling in-game currency over actually progressing the game to a conclusion and taking it out of Early Access) + broken servers (lagging in my private tavern, connecting to the public tavern happens once in a while) = not recommended.

								*GASP*! A new hero! Stuck behind a grindy pay-wall.......... I supported this game forever ago with a lot of cash and I have to grind or pay $10 USD for the new content. I love DLC in early access games <3. Before you charge me for new content, polish your netcode and engine.I still stand behind the idea that you'll get your time's worth of entertainment here. That being said, after leveling one or two characters, there isn't any reason to return to the game. It's not the lack of content, but the lack of well-polished content. Loot is confusing and clunkier than it was before, and there quickly becomes no incentive to play early-encountered maps. You'll still enjoy your time here, even if that time is less than 20 hours.--- ORIGINAL REVIEW ---TLDR: Great MMO-Tower Defense-RPG romp with enough content on offer to justify the purchase as-is. An incredible experience. Well worth the fee to enter the Alpha. I'd be freaking enraged if the developers did not make true on their word and finish the game with the features they had discussed. But, I wouldn't feel like I was out any money if they didn't. I've had so much fun with the content on offer, and there is a ton of it. About 10 hours to beat the campaign with each character (for a total of 40), and you will not be max level by then.After that, there are still about 4 more gameplay modes that your characters can enjoy that help level them to the cap! In addition, the Free-To-Play model being implemented here is solely for skin customizations and inventory space. (Spend your gems on the inventory space) Skins can be unlocked through random crate drops a la Counter-Strike, but those can be opened with tokens earned in-game. These Wyvern Tokens aren't too grindy to earn. All-in-all I've had a ton of fun with it! I'm working on a playthrough right now. Give it a watch if you want to see what it's all about! -

""we are so sorry""...If you like hiting a wall all time playing and like it , you can play it :) "

Early Access Review
								So after 38 hours of gametime and three lv.25 characters i think it's finally time for a review to give you my opinions about the game in it's pre-alpha stage.So to begin with i'm gonna say that i really loved DD1 but it feels like i won't give DD2 a chance if i would compare the two to eachother, especially when DD2 is just in it's alpha stage. So i just left DD1 behind and seeked out all the great potential from DD2 (Comparing DD1 to DD2 will be more fair when DD2 gets an actual release)-So the game can be played both solo and with other players, i've been playing solo more or less all the way and i haven't encountered any problems that way (My experience when playing with others was just frustrating, lack of communication and semi-afk people)But i would say that the game feels very smooth with it's wonderful design, a very toony feel which i absolutely love within games. It sorta feels like it's a key enhancer for this game.I've encountered some small freeze lags here and there (especially when i upgrade items), but it's really no big of a deal. I wouldn't expect anything else from a pre-alpha game.The way you choose maps in the game so far so is to me a big mystery.. I don't think anyone would say it's a very appealing to replay old levels at a little harder difficulty.. It becomes boringThrow some ideas at trendy how to make ^above^ better.But let's just cut to the end,Do i recommend this game?: Of course i do! It's a fun addictive game that you can enjoy for many hours to come. And i have a big trust in Trendy :)I wanna throw in some words from another review i read before: If Trendy follows their heart it's bound to become good, Very much true!			"

								At the moment and possibly in the future I can't recomend this game.It's never good to load into a sequel and the first thought to have is ""Man I really wanna play the first one again..."". Don't get me wrong this isn't a bad game or anything it's just not as fun as the first one and a lot of that has to do with the littering of real money pay options and the inclusion of a live tavern. I can't tell you how hard it is to get into this game when you're surrounded by people who are already way into the game, it feels like I'm a scrub and there's no point in continuing the journey.In fact of the three times I've launched and attempted to play two of the times I just logged out because I was surrounded by players speaking an entirely different game language than I was used to and felt just overwhelmed by the amount of new. Not just players, or a new game, but even exploring a cluttered hub with large notifications yelling at me that 'this part is unlocked after XXXXX is beat!' was all just way overwhelming coupled with a new UI that feels like a mix between a moba style skill layout and a diablo II ability clone I was just constantly overwhelmed.The third time I played I made it two minutes before I ended up loading DD1 and playing on a much more comfortable and smaller scale. I may return since it is so early but it's just so different from the game I fell in love with and I know the only way I can solidly play this is if a friend drags me along.			"

								For an early access game, it's largely in great shape compared to other games that are either completely unfufilled games or broken.  The fact that it's F2P is even more amazing.  Absolutely nothing about the game is P2W.  Almost everything purchased with cash is cosmetic.  Lots of potential for people who came from DD1, and with continued support from Trendy will be a huge success.  The game isn't without it's issues or quirks.  Thankfully the support staff either here, the discussion boards or the official forums are all quick to help. A lot of the issues I've seen or have known others to encounter are largely quality of life issues and don't cause the game to be completely unplayable.  Considering the cost to buy the game, there isn't much of a reason why anyone shouldn't download it and give it a try.			"

								Tsk Tsk Tsk, Before You Make any Assumption As to why Im writing this review after only playing for half an hour, Just know That I have played Dungeon Defenders 1 Across Many Platforms for many hours.I gave Dungeon Defenders II a Thumbs down  for the time being Because as of right now Trendy..Your going a little try-hard.I believe they should have stuck closer to their roots, Dungeon Defenders was and awesome game for what it was. They Kinda Moved away from that to make more money it seems adding this coin system to upgrade weapons and buy weapons alike like we saw with their Dungeon Defenders Eternity. Also, The unlocking of maps is awful. It's really aggrivating.  They way the enemies work along with how you level up and your starting strength alone is too OP. Why AM I Hitting 100's as a lvl 1. This Gives the Leveling up a slower pace and not much of an increase. You rely too much on your armor in this one as well with the added Relic's to be the most effiecient way of boosting tower health and strength.This game needs a lot of tweaking and i would even say a complete make-over. At least when it comes to Game play.The game looks good, The game itself is bad however.			"

								After seeing all the recent negative reviews, I think a positive one is in order.  I've had this game since the pre-alpha days and it for the most part, has been a joy to play.  I'm sure that some have had issues with the gameplay, however, I haven't seen a game developer like Trendy, take the opinions and suggestions of the community, and put them into practice.  To those who question why the game is still in alpha, it will soon come out for full release.  Would you rather receive an inferior product that only took months to create, or get a quality one that may have taken years to create.  Be patient, it's coming.  Great job Trendy, and I'm looking forward to the HUGE update coming soon.			"

								Unlike it's predecessor, Dungeon Defenders 2 features a bunch of new qualities -- such as separate mana for abilities and towers, and a huger tavern.Now, the graphics may be more attractive than the first game, but this DD2 quickly gets downgraded with it's slowly slithering 'pay to play' standards. Costumes in the previous one were able to be achieved through quests and fun game types, whereas in DD2 you must pay. Also, to open chests which include 'oh-so-rare' loot, you must buy keys. It's a good tower defense game, but definitely something that gets old faster than Dungeon Defenders 1 -- you'll get bored from the inability of accessing cooler items in the game.			"

								All these negative reviews as of the trials update, i can guarentee that every single one of those people were reliant on pure PDT and afk = win.Sure as of now the game is quite a bit harder even on chaos 1 as the towers are garbage without a medallion or totem in the defence slot, so the game has basically gone back to the good old pre-PDT days where you NEED to do something otherwise it's a loss, laziness doesn't get rewarded with this update, once you get some points into the ascension tree it all starts to become rather easy.

In DD1 I had a buddy that would spam ever mage tower and monk aura, while he stood there. DD2 makes you actually participate in fighting. Currently you get 4 towers and 3 skills (Not counting heal skill). I'm not sure about the level curve since I am only level 15 but I can say I am enjoying this game more then DD1.			"

								It seems to me like Trendy has no respect for peoples time, and this update proves it . The game now feels like an insurmountable grind compared to what it used to be. You spent how many months doing how many runs for that perfect relics with the right passives at a high enough power level? Well congratulations, now your time has been completely thrown out of the window and we hope you enjoy your arthritis. Has the trial update brought some pros? Of course it has, but with it, it has brought just as many, if not more cons. If I wanted to mindlessly grind gear and work on paragon levels I would just go play Diablo 3.Early access or not, it seems to be a trend in the development cycle of the game where they just throwâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥at the wall and see what sticks and that to me seems like a very poor development process. With their blatant disregard for peoples time and effort in previous game builds, I cannot recommend this game. Stick with the first dungeon defenders if you want a unique and actual fun game like this.			"

								The gameplay is really fun, and the whole thing would be enjoyable. However, if you try to play with friends, it's a complete nightmare. Starting or ending a mission, you have to wait about five minutes for the game to find a session. It's just nightmarishly long, and the missions aren't long enough to make that amount of wait time seem inconsequential. Additionally, when inviting friends to play over steam, often time they would be unable to join and we'd have to retry constantly. And a couple times, we'd all be in game and suddenly I'd be shifted into a solo private game for no discernable reason. It was just awful. If they can ever fix those weird issues, I'll change my recommendation status. But until then, this is basically unplayable.			"

								Dungeon Defenders use to be a simple, rpg-ish, tower defense game that you can play with a group of friends on a couch or online. Now, it is online only. In DD1, with a push a button, you can see your tower set. Push another button, you can repair or heal yourself/towers. Now, you have to push a few more buttons to repair or heal. I like the look of the game and the fact you can build towers without needing to be there anymore but the tower placing, equipment, and attacking are completely different. Control tutorials dont change when a controller is connected. So good luck finding out how to ready up or build towers with a controller when they say hit G. I don't recommend this yet but have high hopes they don't require us to buy gems to progress like most F2P games.			"

								TLDR: Its not pay to win, its just pay to be able to have anything worthwhile.  Can it be played without paying? sure, but I remember the days when this stuff we pay for now was referred to as unlockable content already in the game. YOU PLAYED TO UNLOCK STUFF BECAUSE THAT WAS HALF THE FUN.  Game is bleh, I dont recommend. You will have more fun playing the first one even though its loot system is broke.Between Xbox 360 and the pc version I played the original dungeon defenders well over 1000 hours combined, it was a game I absolutely loved.  Then the announcement came for dungeon defenders 2 and I was all giddy and super excited for its release.  Then I read that it would be free to play, and my excitement turned to ""meh"".  Because we all know what free to play really means. But i remained optimistic, so I bought the game a couple months ago.  I must say I am incredibly disapointed.  Every time I turn around I am bombarded with treyarchs ""give us money"" free to play philosophy and im tired of it.  Wanted an extra bag? gotta pay for it, want another hero slot? gotta pay for it. want some costumes? gotta pay for it.  Most recently however is, want to get super rewards? give us money for a chance at a loot wheel.  As for the game itself, meh, levels are not very fun, balance between champions and towers are just bad.  The progression system could have been awesome, but it turned out to be ""meh"" as well.  Playing with friends is boring, one person sets everything up, everyone else just pulls out their dps champions while the tower person just sits in a corner watching every one else mindlessly shoot enemies in their lane, and this is nightmare 4 im talking about, the current hardest difficulty.This game is nothing like the first one, its been in development for some 50 freaking years and they've got very little content to show for it. I cant recommend this game. Maybe the developers will pull magic out of theirâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥and actually put out a decent game but at the moment its a money sink and nothing more.			"

								Here I'll give you my opinion on the game.I never played DD1, and I got this game 7 months ago. I did help Trendy beta test a game they were working on (Monster Madness Online) internally, so I did learn a lot about how they work, and manage things, ect.First things first, you can expect constant updates and changes if they don't like how something is working, this company works very hard on their games, and they aren't here to just sell the game in early access and then throw up their hands and stop working on it. This is one game you can buy and know for sure that things will always be getting added/changed, ect.So what can you expect yourself to be doing in this game? Well at the beginning you will be doing the Campaign, it's basically a long tutorial with a bit of a story to it, unless you/your group fails the zone, you won't be replaying the same area more than once during this Campaign, you will amass a ton of loot and after each zone, I like to replace/sell whatever items I've gotten. Once you've finished the campaign you will be doing ""higher difficulty"" zones, this is the worst part of the game according to most people I've spoken with, because it's literally just grinding for gear and replaying the same zones, so that can be a negative depending on the person.What customization do you have in the game? Right now there are 4 classes, you can build each class in two ways, you can focus your stats & spheres (explained later) on your hero doing the bulk of your damage, or you can focus your stats on your Towers doing the bulk of your damage. What are spheres? These are kind of like ""talents"" from other games, where once you reach a certain level you unlock a new sphere slot, this can buff your skills, your mana regeneration, and a bunch of other things. There's also a new feature recently added into the game, it's kind of like ""transmogrification"" from WoW, this allows you to change what clothing your character is visibly wearing, without losing stats of your actual items.Extra bits I forgot to mention: You can not change your skills, whatever class you choose has 4 ""hero"" skills (like maybe an AoE spell, or a bomb that slows enemies down, ect. Each class also has 4 ""building/tower"" skills, so you may have a Fireball turret, an Ice Beam Turret, mines, ect. Again, you don't have an option to change any of these 8 skills, but each class has different skills. Building requires green mana, which you get from killing monsters and running over the green crystals they drop, and at the end of each round you open a chest that gives you a lot of green mana to help upgrade/make/repair towers. There is a limit on how many towers your group can place in a map, however it's a fairly reasonable amount. And then there's blue mana which is for your hero's skills, these drop much more frequently than green mana, and you will use whatever amount a skill requires if you cast it.So that's about it, I hope this helped somebody make their decision on buying the game, I purposely skipped some mechanics in the game because it would take too long to explain. Overall I'd recommend picking up the game, it's pretty cheap and you can always be expecting updates and changes, and Trendy is a company that does listen to player feedback quite regularly.			"

You are stuck with ""easy"" and ""normal"" till you are high level - which means, every game is too easy to even care. Why would you play a game which you can beat with like... closed eyes? That's funny.I liked DD1 that there you had access to difficulties and maps you shouldnt be able to beat - but you could try! And if you managed you could get nice items - high risk, high reward - thats what was good about DD1 is no longer a part of DD2.For me - everything that made DD1 fun is gone in DD2.Instead of polishing everything in DD1 and adding new content(skills/towers/characters) they just re-designed the game to something unplayable.

								Dungeon Defenders 2 is in pretty playable condition for having the tag 'pre-alpha', and it is filled with a decent amount of content to keep coming back to. The Devs are constantly listening to what users what and are responding in a positive fashion. This game has to live up to the high standards of that Dungeon Defenders One, but i feel the game is on the right path. The loot system is much better than the 1st game series and the towers have a refreshing appeal, especially since you can now combine elements to increase damage or efficiency. It is a great game to play with friends, and hopefully the game will live up to the standards of Dungeon Defenders One.			"

Early Access Review
								At first I'm talking about other people's responses to DD 2 and how DD 1 is with grinding compared to DD 2, so skip to paragraph 3 for the review.First of all, everyone seems to hate this leveling system. They say it's all grinding, and its stupid, and that DD 2 should be just like DD 1. Now heres the truth, these people just dont remember the beggining of DD 1. Sure you could beat the set of levels to proceed to the next 3, but guess what? Usally those levels were IMPOSSIBLE for your level! Sure Sure, you could say that you just needed skill in tower defense to win, but remember how you unlocked toweres? By grinding! Not just a little grinding, ALOT of ginding. For me atleast I thought it was alot of grinding. So then I play through the story, replaying the same levels over, and over again until I win. Then guess what? I was level 30, so all the challenges wereâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥IMPOSSIBLE! I had to gind to 50 to have a chanse at those. I went hell no, and downloaded the DLC. I invited my buddy over to play and guess what? It was impossible for a level 30. So you know what I did? I grinded myâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥of. So please dont tell me DD 2 is a grind fest, because DD 1 beats it sooooo far out of the ballpark, it's in a whole new planet. All these people remember is the end game, but there was a incredibly long grind to victory.Now lets talk more about DD 2 way of handling levels. You start in the 1-3 level select. With my three characters it takes one game to unlock more levels, therefore in the 3-5 group. I play another game and I'm not there so I play an online match to get levels faster and boom I unlock another (this time set) of levels. See the way this works? The game is just helping you through the grind with you having to sometimes replay levels to level up, instead of giving you a level your 10 levels off beating, then you keep getting to the last wave and crying when you wasted 30 minutes of your life. Then I have to grind previous levels, then every level replay it until I'm stroung enough. This is more of a way to let you know if your stroung enough. Could it not force you to not play those levels... well yes but you'll die anyways so I dont really care.Now on to the review side of these DD 2 has some proublems. First I wish there was a story, but oh well it's only pre-alpha and it will be added later. (plus, who play DD 1 for the story any way?.) Next is the glitches. Theres a wierd teleporing all over the map/tavern glitch that keeps happening, but again it's in pre-alpha so what did you expect? Third point is that while weapons and shields change with loot, the armour never changes and I REALLY what this to change because I'm disencoureged to find armour when that new sword will be flaming, or that new staff have a crystal with mist around it. Kind of a knit pick but, it does effect how I play so I put it here. (plus this game is so good I don't have many knit picks, and im the biggest knit picker I know.) Lastly is a good and bad thing that won't apply to everyone. You have a character deck for who you can switch out in between waves like in DD 1, only the limit is 3. So if your like me and levels all 4 characters, say good bye to one or later when theres DLC but 2 other characters and cobine them with your left out choice. This may not affect most people because they have only one character, but I had to say good-bye to my monk... for now.Now the good things, aww yeah. Lets start with the obvious, the GRAPHICS ARE SO GOOD. I mean like INCREDIBLY good levels of good. Set this game to high and you won't be sorry. Also EVERYTHING look 10 times beter from background, to envirment, to the glourious loot, to my favorites the characters and enemys. My good good there so detailed, the goblins which are the weakest trash enemys of the game are so detailed, clearly someone spent countly mounths perfecting each design to make it just perfect. AND THIS IS IN PRE-ALPHA! Not even the full game yet!Next good thing is the level design. DD 1 was good, even amazing, but this is borderline pefection. I mean it there was some clearly good designers here. You all deserve a cookie, wait no a pie. Infact I'm coming to Trendy with pies for everybdy, unless there to busy prefecting more enemy's and loot. Next is the new lines that show the path of all the enemys. Thats right, theres no more comlaing that you lost because you didnt know a enemy ogre could go there, or a pack of colbots went another direction you didnt expect. (I HATE COLBOLTS! I take it back, goblins arn't all trash I take it all back.) The next thing amazing about this game is what was in my opinion, not that solid in DD 1, the combat. In DD 1 the combat was simple, press button alot in a swarm of enemy's and when you lose to much health (which im garunteeing you will in survival mode on mave 15) go and heal. The best thing about combat was the  ogers, but they were so slow you just have to back off while they attack and go in for the kill after the attack. Simple, and with a friend you could trick the AI shooting at him from both sides, and therefor confusing him making him turn around alot. Then the ninjas were stupid, would lose me all the time, and shouldnt be in DD 1 in the first place. In DD 2 It's much better. First off all death has a big consenquense. when you die your dead for a LONG while instead of 10 seconds, so dont ever die. Next healing costs alot of blue gems and takes a long time. So don't get hurt, because theres a consequense unlike the DD 1 where you wait 2 seconds to heal. The combat its self is more balenced so squire wont steal all the kills like in DD 1, and most importantly the enemy AI is good in combat. They are worthy opponets and running in with a sword to a giant lizard (forgive me I forgot there name.) Will hurt alot or kill you unles you sheild ALOT or back away at the right time, and shooting the lizards is just as hard because you'll have a arrow (or mana) vs acid the giant lizard is spitting. And thats just one enemy. Trust me, the AI is better.Next is the class balencing issues with DD 1, Squire is way to Over Powered, Wizard is Over Powered and has mana bomb, Monk is balenced with nothing good or bad about him, and huntess us Under Powered with long reloades. On the other hand DD 2 made everyone good in there own way, and the huntress is even one of the three people in my main deck.Next is the defenses themselves for each character are more balenced but if your solo, you need the wizards or squires blockades. The best thing about the new defenses this time is there alot more fun, like the guyser the sendes enyemes flying in the air for you to shoot. There really cool, and the huntress traps have way more ammo.I'm going to stop here because this review would go on forever but i'll start the conclusion. If you love DD 1 you'll love this game but remember, there is a little grinding that you may of forgot from all that time in the end game. If your new I would wait until this becomes free to play, with DLC on the way. I say this because there is no tutorial for newbies, however if your new and your friend is begging for  you to play now I HIGHLY recommend this. Play with ypur friend a little while and you'll soon get the game inside and out. I want to cut this short so message me if you have any questions about thing like level count, loot, ect. Hope this helped :) Thanks for reading!			"

Early Access Review
								Although I guess I can understand some of these reviews I still really have to disagree with the negativity out there.When I got DD2, I actually bought it when it was still $50. I did buy it on sale but then I found out that it went to free-to-play and I was a little upset. Except that they gave me one of the DLC worth the $50 price tag and then I was not upset as I had been properly compensated. The game is awesome and a lot of fun and I guess some people still don't understand Early Access. This game is still in Early Access as of writing this post. It's so much fun to play and I have gotten a couple of my friends to download it and not pay a dime and we have had a lot of fun. And none of them have griped about any of the paid-for content as free-to-play is awesome all on its ownSo what did I get with my $50 edition? well it's the Defender's Pack or something like that so it's not incredible. But it was enough for me to buy myself two extra inventory bags. Which are great. And I could buy a new character if I wanted to as well but i'm happy enough that the original 4 characters are FREE TO PLAY and you can make all 4 at once and they level all at the same time... and yes it does take a LONG time to build up enough Hero Coins to unlock more characters + slots which I do admit kind of sucks but honestly I love this approach.Yes there are some things that make the game very different if you pay for it. But that's actually something they did right. This game is FREE TO PLAY right now and I know i keep bringing it up but peopel seem to be overlooking that and having expectations for a SEQUEL which is FREE. If you like it enough you will pay for the DLC which means you get a full size demo in the hopes that you will just give them extra money to access content faster. Or, you could just keep playing FOR FREE and unlock everything that way. Maybe not costumes but who gives aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ I haven't even bothered to check that.This game is great. There are NEW CHARACTERS (in the last game there were a lot of 'characters' but every single one was a clone of the original 4 except with SOME different abilities. Which really blew chunks in the last game). It's free and VERY accessible even to free-to-play players. And it's so much fun especially with friends and guess what they all have it in their library too because it is free to play.			"

Early Access Review
								Just remember this is an Early Access Review and does not refer to the game in it's completed state.Dungeon Defenders, the game before the sequel, in it's entirety was completely awesome and great.When the game started, there wasn't a whole lot of DLC and stuff added to it just yet. The difficulty of the game for starters was not easy and it took time to learn how to play.The same can be said about Dungeon Defenders II currently. It's difficult, it isn't easy to learn, and there isn't ANY DLC just yet. However, this is currently an Early Access Game and it isn't the end of it's expansion. Currently I would recommend this game to be played with friends and you will have a fun time exploring the new maps, learning the new mechanisms, and enjoying the overall gameplay with friends.This game singleplayer is not recommended at all because it requires alot of strategy and time to understand the complexity of the new set of towers and defenses, finding out what works for you. You only get 3 heroes overall per map (unless there is more in later levels or something) and you can only do certain maps and difficulties in a particular level range so power-leveling your characters is not really that much of an option.Having more people on your team also gives you a better chance at an item bonus so working with 3 other people aside from yourself is the most ideal way to make it through every map and level range. This game is a great multiplayer game and is far superior to Dungeon Defenders when it first started out. It is more balanced and fair and it makes the game a little more challenging and competitive.Anyone who does not like this game only doesn't like it for the fact that the game isn't done.This is an Early Access Game and it isn't completely finished. They haven't even brought out the PvP just yet and they are already complaining about the Co-Op. All the heroes have not been released yet and it certainly makes for an interesting game to watch come into development.Highly recommended.			"

								The last patch was a completely downgrade in all the aspects of the game.Character personalization is goneVariety of maps is worse than ever.Loot sistem is completely broken, too grinding and pointless, after 4 days playing the patch got 0 useful loot.The meta is worse than ever, most of the tower in endgame are useless, and i dont mean bad, they do nothing.Inventory management is worse.The shard system is a joke, before the patch you could modify your heroes with th old system, now you need to wait a shard, wich never drops to be able to use the hero you like.Infinite leveling is just the old stats system, shatered into pieces and leting players pick 1 piece each level, so instead of 50 levels now are thousands.They removed a lot of features of the game instead of fixing them, cause they are ""outdated"", nice way of removing ancestral bugs...

Chaos 2 is freaking hard except if you follow the 1 meta and it still give you lvl 46 items wich are totally useless!!! it make just no sense at all... last time they released a community vote for the next content was literraly months ago, patch are slow as hell and just break the game more.before the patch i could solo NM4... now i cant even do Chaos 2 and it only drop lvl 46 items...

								Dev's have no idea which direction they want to take with the game and change core game mechanics every couple of months which essentialy wipe all gear progress you've made. And they cant figure out how to balance their game which always results in 1-2 towers(PDT/Archers)being brokenly OP and  being spammed everywhere on the map.And theres still the same bugs in the game from a year+ ago(Ogre's getting stuck inside spawns or bugging through defenses)  which causes you to have to restart the map and lose ~15min+ of progress in most cases.Then the newest Ascension system they added is just a clone of Marvel Heroes Omega system that just makes you have to grind levels for hours upon hours until you can advance to the next difficulty.So if you're looking for an annoyingly  buggy and grindy game with dev's that cant decide  which directiion they want to take the game then this game is for  you otherwise go play Sanctum/SC2TD/or DD1 if you're looking for a Towew Defense fix.

They freaking nerf towers again... Well it doesnt feel like a tower defense game and this is what i was hoping from this game.Also the loot system is so messy in this one ugh.But wait there is one cool thing in the game: They have a broken new Inventory (colors off items in the bag doesnt match the items) and they worked so long on this new cool inventory !!! wiiii now we can all be so happy...so i will Uninstall this ugly game that you deliverd to us.Thank you for listening so good to your community !! keep it up soon you have the servers for yourself.

								Was really excited for the new update to come out until I tried it out on my characters. All of my characters are level 50 but now they all feel like level 5 with how bad the reset hit them. My once fearsome attack character that could dish out a crap load of shots per second is now reduced to roughly three shots per second. They ""reinbursed"" us for all the upgrades and such we spent our in game money on with the new shards however when I revealed all of my shards, they were all garbage stat upgrades like ""2% chance to douse your target"" I got roughly five of those in the small batch they gave me. The new update ruined my builders, attackers, and experience for the game. If someone new is coming in then I could see the appeal with being able to work with the new system but for a long time Dungeon Defenders player, this unfortunately has made me turn away from the game. Possibly for good.			"

								This game is in a bad state right now, I recommend you not waste your time.I really liked the first Dungeon Defenders, and I wanted to like this but despite my best efforts trying, I couldn't find any part of this game that I liked.This is a hero defence through-and-through, a slightly modified third person shooter. Every tower has been nerfed to uselessness. As an TPS it's pretty bland and boring.Progression is broken. Especially with the most recent update. Shards (upgrades) that you need to progress drop from the hardest difficulties, and even then they're locked behind RNG walls, requiring you to grind endlessly for little to no progress. Gear usually drops one difficulty level below you, meaning more mindless grinding for little gain.If you want a tower defence, play anything other than this.If you want an TPS, play anything other than this.I hate to say it but this game is bad, and from the direction Trendy has been going it's unlikely to improve, move on and don't bother looking back.

								This is coming from a DD1 fan who played it for a few years non stop.Yes it's not exactly like the original, but thats the good thing about it, who would want an exact clone of DD1 after all this time? Now I am not saying that DD1 is bad, It's brilliant, but personally I think DD2 shines where DD1 failed to do so.Yes it is a bit cheesy that they are selling the same charachters again for dlc, but remember, it IS free to play.If you have played this game when it was pay to play, let me reasure you that it is almost a different game, everything is alot smoother and flows better.One of the only things I am dissapointed in is the lack of upgrading items and pets at low level, which in my opinion let players get used to it before choosing a pet was the most important thing in the game.Another is the lack of harder difficulties on low level players, I love a challenge and was dissapointed to see that the hardest difficulty for my noob mage was Normal. What happened to trying to beat The Deeper Well on Insane level 1 char only?This game is definantly worth getting since it is an amazing game, if i were to put a price on it, I would say around $15-$20 AUD. but since its free there is no reason not to give this a spin.

Early Access Review
 Dungeon Defenders II  review:Dungeon Defenders II. The sequel to Dungeon Defenders I. Last game, the focus was a Tower Defence with First-Person Combat on the side. This game, it's the opposite. It's a mix of Sanctum 2, and a bland MMORPG game. Not necessarily a bad combination, at least in my opinion. You can either go in, collecting and equipping items only for boosting your damage, instead of focusing on the other aspect of the game, Tower Defence. Towers, they do not do as much as would seem viable for a game which has them as one of the two subjects. Only barricades are actually needed. You can go into a match and be able to just place a few walls here and there, on chokepoints or in corridoors, then take out the whole enemy squadron using nothing but your 'Wizardly Stick of Purple Flames andâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Or, well, that's my experience. You can have geat on yourself to only help make your Towers and Defences more powerful. Health. Damage. Range. Speed. Those sorts of upgrades. Minor numbers, however, you will not be seeing a Catapult dealing 203 Octillion damage within 2.7 seconds (approx). You will mainly be using your weapons instead of your skills, too, I actually have forgotten that they even exist in my few latest missions. Unless, well, you are too weak. Then, they will become useful. Otherwise, the damage does not scale too well, my weapons are truly able to take care of all problems. Weapons aside, other parts of the game include:+ Skill Trees.+ Private and Public HUBs.+ Matchmaking system (not the best at all).+ Daily Missions.+ ""First Win"" modifiers.+ NPC merchants.+ A bunch of maps and difficulties.+A Terraria crossover.- Not much endgame content.- A really bad UI in the Inventory menu, especially trying to sell all your loot.- Inventory being spammed by items which were useless, even 5 levels below.The RPG element, it's... Satisfactory. Put the bar, well, not too high though. It's not yet finished and the minor flaws, are a lot in number. The gameplay, though repetitive, it is alright enough for me to carry on a little longer. I recommend playing with a friend, however, as the matchmaking system is, well, about as basic as a stick and stone. Sure, you can say how strong players must be in order to be able to join the lobby, but there's not much else to it. But, the levelling and progression aren't that great or a real ""wow cool"" moment. They're more of an ""ok..."" moment. You can't care less. Especially while you're in a mission, and reach a certain level when you unlock something new, then there's this huge black box which takes up a lot of the screen. Disturbing. Unneeded. The weapons, I have mixed feelings about. There should be a way to filter things when in your inventory, from best to worst. Or, only let us have collected some real goodies instead of the same trashy ring from level 2 or so we still get on one of these endgame missions, for whatever reason. Just, let us have the useful gear when we need it. Not some OP gear before we reach that level. Not some weapon which deals feathercuts in terms of damage. Endgame. Endgame. What do you mean, endgame? There is not much endgame. There is repeating missions, however. But no real endgame. There's harder difficulties. Those are fine. But something which is just unfairly difficult but actually accomplishable, is not. I want to feel I have done enough Radiation damage to take out a good 20x15x30xkm blast in the planet, while I am trying to survive with all of my thoughts and mind on the task. Something which is a real kicker. You either are dying all the time, or only die because you fell off the map because of the very slippery movement. Not much inbetween. Either Zeus or a peasent. The closest experience to such a thing in Dungeon Defenders II is going to be a Nightmare mode mission, or the gear, or the pets. This brings me onto my next point: pets. It's an RPG. There will be pets. You can either buy pet eggs using paid currency, or find them from some more difficult and later missions in the game, then hatch those eggs. There's different eggs, each bringing a different theme of creature. From dragons to cats. All pets have their own powers, damage types, rarities, really what you could expect. They're not too great when  you first get them. Their at their hatchling/junior stage, and have not been evolved or powered up in any way. This costs time, and money. The latter is not a problem at all, as you can easily grind a ton of gold within 2 hours. I have actually not needed to grind for gold at any stage in the game so far, actually. In order to evolve your pet, you must first fill up its 'Affection' bar, which is how often or how much you've been using that pet in missions. After the evolution, your pet will grow up a bit, changing the looks and stats. It's a simple system but I don't mind it at all in the game, just seems a bit bland what you could do with a pet, as they do not deal that much damage, though, they are not meant to, they are meant to act as a support for your character.Characters. There's classes: Squire, Monk, Huntress, Apprentice (The main ones), with some others which are more difficult to unlock. Some are more poweful in certain situations than others. The Apprentice has stronger towers than the Squire, however, the trade of lower base HP for them, is the price. The Monk has some powerful towers, such as ones which automatically damage enemies unlucky enough to walk into them. And do they damage. They damage a ton. He also can play a Supportive class as he has a healing tower to help back up your noob teammates if they die too quickly or too often. The Squire is a tank and can deal damage relatively nicely. Just what you could expect. Not much more to talk about. The Huntress is a ranged bow-user. A Ranger or Archer. Good damage. Good range. Overall, the characters are all used for different situations, and they deal with them in different ways.That's all I have for now. Potential. Not yet met.~Wilkowaty			"

Early Access Review
 DUNGEON DEFENDERS 2 I personally CANNOT STOP PLAYING THIS GAME. To be honest, I was extremely skepticle on whether or not it would be worth my $14.99 for, and it's not (Maybe), but I got it off another site Steam keeps blocking with a Four-Pack for $2.49, completely worth it. I did however buy the Collectors Edition to show my support for this beautiful game. But enough bantering, here's the Game in a Nutshell. MECHANICS Dungeon Defenders 2 plays like a Tower Defense with a complete twist of Four characters you play in 3rd person, all with their own Abilities and Towers, Strengths and Weaknesses. Your 4 Heroes are The Apprentice (WHY NOT CALL IT THE MAGE?), Squire (AGAIN, WHY NOT CALL IT A KNIGHT?), Huntress, and Monk. All have their own good Synergies with the other Heroes.The Apprentice is a good Form of DPS, Squire is a Tank, Huntress makes Traps that Synergize well with all other Heroes, and the Monk uses Buffs and Debuffs for your Team. ENDGAME This game probably has a lot of Life ahead of it, despite being in Alpha for a year, the Devs listen to their Community, and have made the Game extremely long for anyone looking to do a Completionist run on it. OVERALL REVIEW This game is Beautifully made, but make sure you have a good enough computer for it, sometimes the particles can make your game lose framerate. All in all, buy the game, either on Steam to support them or get the Value price of 2.49 on a site steam keeps blocking, which I recommend. 11/10 would buy four pack again on a site that Steam keeps blocking because the site sells games for very low prices and is trusted... (See my Profile page for the Site name, because Steam blocks the name.)			"

								Fix the floor in tavern when you return to it so this doesn't happen over and over and over: 


YouTubeâ¢ Video: Dungeon Defenders 2 falling through ""tavern"" without models or texturesÂ 

			Views: 83		

			This is by far the first time and I have to restart the game every second time or so that I get into the start area because this happens time and time again.		

 That aside the gameplay so far to me has been fun and I like that you can just swap heroes and have a deck. I wish the deck of heroes had more importance though. For a free game it's a solid tower defence but it feels unfinished even without the bugs. When the game has been improved and/or the game is finished I'll update my review.			"

								So very minimal gameplay at time of writing this. Only played the first few maps. There is a fair few bugs, which unless you can identify them, it will stop your progress (enemies glitched inside of walls in small corners, death seems to disable the 'ready up' button, etc)I also noticed the price of DLC, and holy crap! There should be a way to earn them in-game or something, not flog out up to $50USD just for some skins and a title...Other than that, gameplay is basically left MB = attack (can be held for infinite attacks), right MB (hold down) = bigger attack.Easy difficulty is super easy and Normal is basically an instant match loss (from the times I tried it). Seems a tad unbalanced.As current, I can not recommend this game, due to repetitive and far too simple gameplay and super expensive DLC.----------------------------------------------------------------------------I must say though, I LOVE the weapon designs!

								First I must say the gameplay is very fun and I love the graphics. However, the lobby system, logging on, just connection to the game in general is the worst I have encountered in gaming. I will click on a map to go to and it will tell me it is searching, then as if I never selected anything at all I am apparently not in a que/loading up any map and I have to reselect one. After that, it will tell me that too many multiplayer requests have been made and I must wait before trying to do anything again. I CANNOT DO ANYTHING IN THIS GAME. I have played this game for 4 hours and less than one of them was actally gameplay.			"

Early Access Review
								I was an avid Dungeon Defenders 1 player and loved so many things about that game.  Dungeon Defenders 2 is a far cry from a sequel to do it justice.  While 2 does have its few improvements, most of what they have tried to do and the changes they have made just fall well short of 1.I do have to say that I PAID for early access and now this game has become Free To Play which I think is not at all a good thing.  Cheated with no reward.Comparisons of 1 and 2:-The size, scale, and scope of the levels are very dissapointing compared to 1.  The maps are small wiith no real options for strategy, just put down big towers and hit the mobs as soon as they exit the doors or just barricading the crystal.  Towers seem too big and bulky on most maps.-Character depth and selection is so much less than 1.  Why do so many changes and break a great stat and equipment system?  Less skills, less stats, less customization, less options, big part of what made 1 great which is gone in 2.-Sloppy developement in a lot of ways.  Parts of the game, which were disabled from early beta, have just been abandoned in place, or left not working and broken.  Glaring glitches, major errors, updates that break the game, cumbersome control and gameplay (ex. can't use controller due to faulty button mappping on programmer side), major lag and sluggishness on normal game operations and loading which suggests a bare minimum approach to developement.  I would say that they have a long way to go before this early access build is anything like Dungeon Defenders 1.  I don't feel the experience is anywhere near as good.  While I would love to help develope this game towards that direction, I don't think Trendy's direction is a good one at the moment. "

								I loved Dungeon Defenders 1. It was fun, funny and very easy to handle everything.In DD2... well I was utterly dissapointed. I only played 15 minutes and I know that if you read this you will think to yourself... ""You didn't try the game at all! Your review sucks"" I could care less to be honest. The only reason I only played 15 minutes is because it was all I wanted to give the game. In DD1, movement and everything else was so smooth. Sure this is still Early Access but still this was not fun for me to see that the game I utterly loved got turned into this. I feel like interface, options and simply everything is lacking in some aspect.I will probably try some other day but right now, this is not the game I expected. I hope this can be made into a better game even if you have to buy it. Put DD1 and just add better maps, mobs and items, thats all this game needs.			"

								Fantastic game i waited so long for it to come out! when i first saw it go up on there site i had to buy it. The games scaling does get a little weird first two maps you are doing pretty well against the waves then all of a sudden you get to your 3 map and BAM it hits you. The learning curve is kinda weird for this game but once you have it down it the game curve seems to smooth out a lot. The new sphere system is really cool and i REALLY hope they expand more on it than it is right now because it is extremely small and the uber spheres seem to be a little lengthy in obtaining. Long story short the game is fun, game curve is a little weird, talent system is pretty decent, item upgrade system which i didnt mention sucks due to the amount of gold and gear you need to sink into it, another thing i didnt mention is how cool the combos are but sometimes in higher level stuff they feel really needed and you cant do high level content without them. All and all great game i have high hopes for this "

Early Access Review
								Dec-12-2014Time Played: 26-HoursPre-Alpha Review (Patch 1.1)From the view of an Aprentice main with mid-lvl huntress/monk----TL;DR at the bottom----*There are plenty of reviews giving a Pro/con list for this game in comparison to DD1, so this is my take on DD2 as is, and where it seems to be going.Initial Thoughts - This is not DD1. Hands down, the hardest part of this game is other people. You can't throw down your towers without reason, you have to communicate(esp. for Hard-mode), and plan out a ""strategy"" which at the moment is basically Lightning aura/Gyser/Ice Tower and a Boost aura(there are other combos that work of course). Sure you can add on some towers that synergise with those as well, but that is the core layout that many people are running. (Squire - cannon/Apprentice- earth are the best additions)  ---Edit: They fixed a bug with lightning aura, so it's not as op now. However, the gyser/lightning is still a strong combo. Furthermore,  I'm glad they're willing to make changes, I wouldn't want just a reskinned DD1. Because lets face it, if you want DD1, play DD1. Any re-skin they do will always pale in comparison to nostalgia. As for me, I'm loving where they seem to be going, and hope they implement new ideas that make DD2 look like, what DD1 wanted to be.----------------------------------------------------------------------------Towers/Classes - With all the negative things being said, I still think having synergy between towers is a plus. Yes, it does somewhat limit gameplay at the moment, but, it creates some purpose to playing with other classes/using various towers together. it just needs some tweeks in the way it's implemented atm. Remember, Pre-alpha. Currently, I can think of 1-2 optimal builds for a map/character(excluding legendaries that buff certain towers and may make them very valuable). that's extreemly boring in the long run, and limits the replayablility of the game. *More towers, combos, and specable talents would open this up some, because currently the Meta for a good team-based build seems to be - Apprentice? Max the ice towers chance to freeze, place ice towers Monk? Max lightning aura dmg, place lightning aura's and boost aura'sHuntress? Max the dmg the next atk does to a doused target. Or, If you want to go single target dmg, Dmg+ for target dist./ AA Full charge chance. Either way, place gysers.Squire? (haven't played squire, so no idea) Cannons are rediculous, as are balistas. ----So, why do I reccomend the game?----It has potential, a lot of potential. Remember, this is Pre-Alpha. They're still working out the kinks, and adding in a ton more content, this game, as is, is the foundation with a skeletal structure for what's to come, and it's shaping up very nicely. At the moment, it's meh. Not amazing, but not worth a thumbs down. IMO the game looks a lot more promissing than DD1, it both looks better, and has a more intuitive UI in place. I'm loving it so far. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------Suggestions for the game - . More than 4 towers per character. But you can only chose 4 to bring into a map. . Improve lvl'ing experience. The game really starts 15+ when you have all your towers, but takes a while to get to depending on solo/group play. . Lower chances for green chests. . . 1 non-green chest in ~70-80 runs is rediculous, and it was a blue. . Item Drop chance not dependent on # of players in the map, but on difficulty of the map. . . . Stat re-roll option for items. (i.e. Changing M.Def -> def). More Weapon options. . Clan option in-game . Improved UI/Overlay. Improved Matchmaking. lvl25+/++ and all challenge modes should only be able to be played by 1 of your characters, no Hero Deck option, unless in private play. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------TL;DR - This is not DD1. If you're dissapointed it's not just like DD1, play DD1. . . but you'll be missing out.TL;DR V.(Patch 1.1 Pre-Alpha)  -Thumbs neutral, at the moment it's ok, but has a lot more potential than DD1 IMO. Hardest part of the game is learning to communicate, and strategize. They made multiplayer mean something, so don't be a 1-man army in a group of 4. ----Currently 7/10, could easily be 9/10 - 10/10 with some minor tweaks by Launch. If you're on the fence, waitlist it, hopefully the upcoming improvements will push you over the edge =PIf not, it'll be Free-To-Play upon full release. . . whenever that is.			"

								They took everything that made the first one interesting or good and threw it out the window so they could create a F2P game. They stripped the depth from each of the character classes so that they could flood the game with more character classes, or maybe it was because they could not balance more than 4 towers per class.I am disgusted by the game. I thought the flood of DLC heroes was annoying in the first one, but that game was at least fun and at $14.99 for the first go around a few DLC heroes were worth it.This game is less about the strategy and more about the bang things with your hero.

Early Access Review
								It's not a great game and honestly it's a step back from the original. However, DunDefToo does grow on you a bit. Finding rare loot and pets feels nice... but loot is so overabundant that you stop caring about anything that isn't mythic/legendary. The game has an auto-collection feature but it doesn't let you choose what is collected/left behind. This means you gotta sift through the garbage to make sure you didn't miss a pet or pet food (they don't have an indicator on the screen/map to make them easy to track).The maps are all super boring, small, and mostly tight spaces. This is problematic because players and towers have collisions on them. So, the game gets crowded very quickly.Players get their own mana (currency for making/repairing/upgrading defenses) each round and it scales based on the player count. This is pretty nice and you can hand it off to the other players. Sadly, the game is totally anti-social. A single player can (like the first game) change their character to place additional defenses. The players also have a shared point limit for placing defenses. So, most of the time you either put up with bad placements or a single player doing everything. Basically, the game stops being tower defense and more about doing nothing or going combat focused (killing things yourself). This was a problem in the first game as well, but those maps were usually laid out in a way that a combat player still retained value.The pet system is god awful. You need special materials to ""evolve"" your pets... this sounds cool, but you need a resource called ""shellium"" which is obtained by letting pet eggs expire. This means you have to give up the chance at an interesting pet for some resources... and it takes 48 hours of sitting in your inventory to expire. Pets occupy their own special bag space, but eggs take up normal bag slots. Leveling up pets requires food... food does not stack with itself and therefore takes up extra bag space. The eggs can be hatched instantly between matches (in the tavern after you reach a certain level), but the timers could change. The timers used to be 8 hours and you can only hatch one at a time.So, your inventory will consist of the following:* Garbage items for upgrades/selling* Eggs* Cosmetic item boxes (requires premium or daily quests to open)... you'll get a lot of these.* Quality items (so you can use a different build.* Pet Food* Pet Food* Pet FoodIf you want to get materials to upgrade pets then you'll spend even more space on eggs.What the game sells for a premium:* Character slots (5$) - you get enough for each class at leas* Bags - 2-5$ depending on the size of the bag* Pet Bags - 2-3.5$ depending on the extra space you want* Costumes - 10$ or more for costumes* Pet Skins - 2$ or more depending on the costumeAt first glance the game seemed pretty fair (monetization-wise)... but with the inventory problems and sheer cost of space it began to feel greedy. Like they sacrificed usability to sell more things.Physics/Networking:So, the game is prolly hosted on a server rather than on the leader's system. This wouldn't be so bad, but the game's server is authoritative and the client has to obey. This means rubberbanding, or worse, the server sends you flying forward because it didn't notice that you had stopped. This means that input lag exists... and it's pretty awful. It's like they built the game on an old-school architecture without realizing that there are superior options.The game has large, blocky, collisions for everything. The characters slide (prolly input lag) around and so it's not uncommon to throw yourself off of a cliff. When your character attacks they move a little bit and the animation can't be canceled. This again, leads to the feeling of input lag (this is animation related rather than server related though). Basically, ranged attacks function better than melee attacks.Bottom line:It's a skinner box disguised as a game... a game with poor physics and networking. While it's free-to-play it has a lot of greedy elements hidden in there.			"

Early Access Review
								I am a former player of DD1 for Xbox 360 I played it for about 2 or 3 months then I quit because of hackers that hacked for their own good not modding. This caused me to quit playing it. Then about a year later I overheard one of my friends talking about a second dungeon defenders coming out, I was esctatic <-(I think thats how its spelled who cares) suddenly the memories of all the fun I had in DD1 on Xbox came back, then i heard it was gonna be f2p that was the icing on the cake. So when it came out I looked it up on my steam acct and saw $20, because of the christmas sale, and I have to admit I was disheartened but I bought it anyways because of how much I loved the first one. Got on it and I just got warmth in my heart for how good of a PRE-ALPHA game it is. I have yet to find a bug and I even found some cool places in the tavern like walkway above the weapon shop. I was so shocked even to see an enemy get stuck behind the purple defense wall, first thing i thought was guess theres no such thing as a flawless game then next thing i know he just dies. i dont know if they integrated suicide for them like they did for players but something they did even stopped the enemies from getting stuck. so for all you haters if you dont like the game then dont buy it tell you i certainly dont like playing with people who just constantly dis a game for no reason.Thank you to the developers of this exceptional game i just hope it doesnt succumb to the same demise of the first			"

								Me and my son loved the original game. Many happy hours playing it together, Paid the money and got on with it. Nice. This new version appears to have the dreaded pay for gems and upgrades. Such a horrible horrible way to go, if this stays in the final version, won't play sorry. Ditch your coc copying business manager and gives us a game we can just buy and enjoy and stop exploiting kids ;-)			"

								After about 65 hours into Dungeon Defenders II I am happy to report that they have been enjoyable. While the overall feel of DDII remains similar to that of its predecessor, there are some things that are notably different. To start with, if you want to use each of the heroes you will have to grind them up to the higest level (currently 25 although this is bound to increase as new content becomes available) individually as the maps are now broken up into level restrictive increments such as 1-3, 3-5, 5-10 etc. You are however able to use your higher level characters in lower level maps although they will be scaled down accordingly to the highest level for the current map. This can be time consuming but presumably it is to discourage solo play and encourage teamwork and synergy between community members. The maps feel a bit busier graphically and it was harder for me to wrap my head around tower placement than it was for the first game. In DD1, you were often able to place towers in such a way that you could guard multiple lanes with clever and well thought out placement. With DD2 placement feels more dictated and formulaic which takes a bit of fun away from the planning process.Currently at the time of this review (Dec. 2013) only one ""Stage"" is available. There is not yet a ""boss"" fight which was disappointing but the game is still in a pre-alpha state. There are synergies now between damage types and trap combinations which are interesting and give the players something to strive for in terms of teamwork.Item progression seems well planned, however the items have very little variation. There are generally two stats associated to one item, the first is determined by the item name (i.e.: ""Rapid Fire Gloves"" are guaranteed to have Defense Speed on them) and the second appears to be random. As a result of only 2 stats for each item, you are almost forced into choosing a specialization of 2 to be effective and are only looking for items with those 2 stats on them for the majority of the game.  This often leads to finishing a map, browsing through items very quickly, keeping the ones that match your criteria and selling the rest. While this seems like a good formula, I found myself quickly bored as there are only a couple combinations of items that are worthwhile at the moment (Defense Power/Defense Speed for builders, and Hero Damage/Ability Power for DPS). This meant that 90% of the items I found I sold and 10% I kept. With 20-30 items per map it felt like a lot of time selling useless items.The inventory system is currently somewhat challenging to navigate. Dragging items onto other bags works infrequently and forces you to manually open bags and move items between open slots. It was difficult to organize them and I wanted a more user friendly experience. It would also be lovely to be able to check your inventory with 'i' like in the first game instead of being forced to visit a defender's forge.Working with other people was sometimes more challenging than it should have been. I think this game could benefit from a built in chat system to make the process easier.I'm looking forward to the costumes to become available in game via micro transactions so that I can lend some uniqueness to my character as currently, when there are four monks running around in game it feels very much like a clone of the person next to me which takes away from the immersion considerably.Overall, the game was really fun up to the maximum level but there is little reason to stay and grind at the moment. I look forward to exploring additional content as it becomes available. I would reccommend purchasing the game in it's current stage to anyone who is willing to be patient as content becomes available since as of right now it is somewhat limited in scope.  "

								First impression:Only level 3 so far but at face value,it seems like the DD1 of old.You build towers,some towers are k,CC towers are better and you smack stuff with your hero.We don't do skillpoints but gain stats as we level? Seems nice.I always found switching my spec/making a whole new character for a specific spec to be too cumbersome.I only hope the loot is better this time around.There's an item level system from the looks of it.Hope that doesn't screw me over when I get to endgame.Also,when this game eventually dies down,I hope I can solo most of these dungeons.The later DLC for DD1 made the challanges pretty awful once the population thinned.

								I liked this game before the update.  Trendy said they ""balanced"" the classes.  BS.  Most of the towers are useless now.  And if you want to use a tower, you have to make a character and put your ascension points into that tower.  Now you see people with 3 and 4 of the same class just so they can put their ascension points into one tower on each character.  You may say ""why dont you spread your ascension points around?""  I supposed some would, but that just makes your towers weaker.  And there is no cap on ascension, with most of the stats you can put it into capping out at 999.  And this isnt a tower defense game anymore.  Its a hero defense with added korean mmorpg grind.  They removed the range on towers, nerfed the gear and relics, added shards you have to put in gear with needed buffs forcing you to play the same maps over and over hoping you get the one you need.  No longer my cup of tea.			"

								Yes, still Alpha. Yes only 4 hours played at this point. But I know what I want from a Game.*Let's be realistic, with the recommended specs, It's 2016 Tomorrow. And it's not like Trendy Failed with Dungeon DefendersGraphics 4/10 *Sound 5/10 *Storyline 0/10 - ""Copy Paste""Game Play 3/10 *Networking 0/10 * Additionally I'm lagging out in my 'private' tavern.Yet another example of not getting the Minimal Viable Product down before Proceeding with development. If you paste a bunch a roses on a turd, it may look more appealing, but I Can guarantee you that it is still a turd.Pros:1 - Dungeon Defenders 2.2 - Free to Play.2.1 - Not pay to win.Cons:3 - Towers and Skill Changes.4 - Profanity Filter does not work.5 - Forced online Play. {I don't know about you, but I want to play single player/LAN offline}6 - Development Direction.7 - Community.8 - Chat.I will come back to this after a couple months, maybe. But until then I highly recommend that you either stay away until full release, which will probably never happen if they keep this up, or risk Beta {If that will ever Happen}.Closing Thoughts:A whole year in Open Alpha? Is no one Playing this game or are the developers relying completely on the more than 'juvenile' community to finish the game for them?			"

								This game, made by...some of the same people as our beloved classic is more than disapointing.But, because im not a prick ill start with the positives1.Lots of content2. Better graphics, performance...and thats it, the only things that are better than the original are the technological things.Here come the bad things1. You remember that unique system where the money you use to buy stuff is the same as  the money you build towers with? sure noone used it but it was UNIQUE.2. Its a free to play game, expect them to cut content off if you dont want to grind endlessly or pay money which is exactly what they want.Id have prefered to play 50 dollars for an Actual game which doesnt limit the ammount of content i get. 3.Hero abilities suck. Especially the beloved manabomb.Also, they no longer use the building mana which also differenciated it from your run of the mill tower defense game.4.Grinding.Even.More.Than.The.Last.Game.5.Everything feels...empty. It just feels like a big studio bought the name and made a completely diffrent game.I loved the original to bits, but this is just sad. I know theyre trying yet...i dont think my issues are resolveable.It doesnt feel like a sequel, it feels more like a ""Startrek Online""-ish Adaption of a series using the name to get easy money. Im just dissapointed in trendy.			"

								Was a fun time killer before, it wasn't perfect but they were doing a good job by adding new hero's and updating the gameplay.  Now for whatever reason they have completely changed almost every aspect of the game to where it's not really interesting. Gear is basically not important at all unless you want to go DPS. They removed all options to really costomize your style of gameplay with the hero's you like. Ascension is basically a sloww grind process to try and be able to be able to do any higher lvls of maps. Drops are horrible now and it's just a pure grindfest that has removed all the fun from it.It really seems like the developers have lost touch with it's game community and what people really wanted out of the game. If you enjoy griding yourâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥off forever then this is the game for you, if not I wouldn't bother anymore.			"

Still no response on the issue from the devs. Second issue.This game has not even been released and the total cost for for all the DLC is over 130â¬ at the moment. WTF, just seriously WTF! Just NO! You want people to pre-order and support then give that option, nothing wrong with that, but NOT stuff AT A TOTAL OF 130 EUROS that is mostly useless! That pricing is insane. All i can say is that the devs seem to have sold out completely and i seriously have doubts that this game will ever be anything close to what DD1 was. Sad but true. So far my recommendation is, if you can start it then fine, go ahead and try it as it's ""free"" but DO NOT BUY ANYTHING. Stinks like a cash grab from miles away.			"

								What the hell is this crap?They completely ditched the art style of the first game. Seriously, jump into this game and you'll feel like you're playing a game on the PS1. Now go and play DD1. Notice the huge difference?Going F2P was a huge mistake. Dungeon Defenders had a special place in my heart from its very detailed and unique mobile gaming experience. I was ecstatic to see a DD2 being developed years ago. Having popped in and out of the early access tid bit of DD2 I am nothing but disappointed.Once again, going F2P was a huge mistake. It feels like a 3D clash of clans with horrible graphics and so much damn clutter on the screen. Seriously, everywhere you look is another attempt to get you to spend more money to get a better chance at RNG loot. Besides that the GUI is a mess and the game almost feels like it makes an effort to make it difficult to simply manage your insane amount of useless loot.They took what DD1 did and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ized it.

								Albeit I have only played for a short while, I have gotten a clear picture how this game works, and even though it is very similar to the first game, this one takes the simple idea and then tosses it in a river.The RPG, loot collecting, and tower defense, is fun as ever. However, when you first start off playing the game, you are met with utter confusion. The first maps start off as hard as most maps were half way through the game in the first game. By the way I reached the third or fourth map; It had four places where monsters kept pouring out, and the items I were to defend were placed in a haphazard manner. The maps are in general just poorly designed in comparison to the first game.So, right from the start; This game is impossible to play alone to get a hang of it. So you are forced to play with people online, which I figured is the way it's supposed to be played, of course. Well, it would have made a bit more sense to let a person who is new to the game actually start off in a brand new game, and not throw the poor player into a group that is already half-way through the map, leaving you unable to build any towers. So you stand alone in the onslaught, doing no damage, simply waiting to get your free loot.Also, throwing all the leveling info, stats, customization, and everything of the sort ALL AT THE SAME TIME, is extremely daunting and off-putting. Slowly introducing mechanics to new players would be extremely helpful, since most info you get is either too detailed or not detailed at all.It's not a terrible game by all means. But it would at most get 4 out of 10, where the original DD would easily get 8 out of 10. If it was as simple to learn as its predecessor, the game would have been better in general. But the useless stats thrown around, no proper info or pointers given, poor optimization, and the maps being completely rubbish in comparison to the first game, does make it feel extremely lackluster.

								really like this game, even in alpha stadium,been playing dungeondefenders 1 and the eternity version(the first was better i think)I like towerdefence games and combined with gearfarming and leveling ur heroes,equiping them with pets,  weapons and   armor sure is nice,the comunity of players is mostly helpfull.it looks hard when u play alone but i found playing with public partys very helpfull, its a lot easier to play and get started then the first dungeondefenders, so come on buy this game and support this really nice piece of a game.i know im gona play this a lot in the future!

								Just finished a 14+ hour marathon of this unfinished masterpiece. The top review for this game is a serious overreaction. If you played dd1 a lot and had all the dlc, then you'll like this one even more. The gameplay is super refined over the first (buggy but only like 1 game breaker that i know of), the matchmaking is excellent most of the time, and the grind has plenty of incintives if you're the type to min-max your gear to become a godly monster slaying badass. I haven't even reached the endgame yet and i can see myself sinking hundreds of hours into this game over the next few years. It's hard to believe that this is only an alpha and it's already better than the first game!As for the paid currency transactions: HOLD OFF UNTIL YOU KNOW YOU LOVE THE GAME. Don't get greedy and burn your money just because something looks good. If you truly like this game (or even the first game) you'll glady drop the money with no regrets because the premium content is really satisfying if you're a big fan.If you were the type of person to repetedly run challanges on nightmare difficulty in the orignial game, you'll find this game to be an amazing breath of fresh air. If you're new, skip the first game and play this one... NOW!!tl;dr: I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Amazing RPG/Survival/Tower Defense Hybrid gameonly in alpha; still beats the first,Don't waste money unless you absolutely love itJUST PLAY IT NOW			"

								Having played the this game's predecessor: Dungeon Defenders 1 it's great to see Trendy is trying to fix some of the issues that plagued the previous title, while staying true to the great foundations of the Defenders series. Combat is easy to get into and unlike the previous title the hero abilities feel like they make a difference in combat, not only does this make battles more exciting it also gives you a compelling reason to invest in ability specs instead of heading straight for hero damage and health like in the previous game.Tower placing has improved vastly since the previous game, and feels more balanced in terms of green mana being available - in the previous title towers were able to reach their maximum upgrade level fairly quickly, however in DD2 mana is more scarce so upgrades need to be more tactical and always repairs are essential at all times. Some towers in the game have combinations but the squire class seems to have been left out of this equation - something I hope the developers are planning on addressing.Loot is more fair in this title, in the previous game loot was dropped and visible to all players, this would lead to a mad scramble as everyone abandoned their posts to try and snatch the loot before someone else. In Dungeon Defenders 2, loot is instanced (players can only see their own loot) and means that people focus more on the battle than watching for a nice drop. Nice drops are also alerted to so people don't have to stare at the map all the time.However a lot of the game is still missing, I'd like to see:* More bosses* Improved pet system* Higher level cap (as content comes)* More game modes* Balanced uber spec spheres* A way of selling unused spec spheres* More adventure maps "

								""We Never Sell Any Gameplay AdvantageWe mean it! You will never be able to gain gameplay advantage by spending real money in Dungeon Defenders II.""  /\   |This is quote from gamedev (read the description)- Initiallly the game is really entertaining, but as soon as you reach the level cap (which takes a couple of nights), it kicks you in guts! Here is the list ofâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥1. If you played most of the so called ""free-to-play"" mobile games you know the drill - it lets go easy peasy on first 10 to 15 levels, and after that the further you get the more tempting it gets to buy stuff. Here you will get the same story. The game is now solely based on microtransations.2. It has been waaaaaaaaaayyyyy too long in pre-alpha (not even a pre-beta John!). And what did the game get in such a long time ? Well :1) More pets! Yay! ( 9 out of 10 for real money only ^_^ )2) New costumes! Weepee! ( 9 out of 10 for real money only ^_^ )3) New levels! Free*! OMG! ( but with your lvl you still need to either spend over 40 hours to get something decent or *JUST BUY STUFF )4) Poor otimization :( BUT WAIT! The devs promise to fix it someday ! They still haven't done so since the release in Dec 2014, but please believe in them.To devs: Of course you have to earn money from this - DLC was a good idea, paid access to early access was good idea, but you â¥â¥â¥â¥ed it both up. DLC matters nothing now - it is all about microtransations; paid access to alpha for 1,5 years ?! SERIOUSLY ?			"

								I really like this game. Even though it's in early access I can tell there are a lot of different routes you can take with your character and I love games where the end game is infinite and you can always be upgrading and changing specs.I have a first look I did before this most recent patch if anyone is interested in seeing what it's like to be a newbie in the game.

								I used to love this game but when it came to I realised the grind was too real. It was so real because of the fact that you need over like 10k Medals to get a new hero and when it comes down to it grinding the game is boring as heck. I can't even play the game anymore because before the round is over I have to go study or do homework. The rounds are very long and the grind for loot is terrible. It would be better if you could access all heroes no matter what because the heroes are what I play this game for. I have been grinding and grinding for Ev Mk2 but when it comes to the matter it would take over a week of hardcore grinding to get ev 2k and on the road there all the gear i've gotten is terrible and farming Harbringer is plain boring.

								i played the campaign through once and it got very repetitive and boring shortly after. Also ever since the carnival/gunwitch update i can only play 2 maps in a row before i get hit with 'request timed out' and thrown into the hub which wouldn't be a major issue if the hub were actually there, instead i'm put into an infinite fall since the world didn't even spawn.Edit: i forgot to mention that i ran it on a computer that exceeds recommended specs and since the terraria update i can safely play the games for hours without the aforementioned bugs.Actually being able to play it now, the game is still repetitive and the heroes (aside from the base 4) require either a premium currency gained through daily and monthly challenges or with a premium currency bought with real money. all cosmetic outfits require the currency bought with real money.

Early Access Review
								To be quite honest, I DO RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR THOSE WHO HAVE PLAYED DD1 AND LOVED IT. It's great, but there are multiple problems that you would commenly expect when getting a pre-alpha game. Ignoring the fact that I have down voted this game, there are multiple aspects of this game that include DD1 gameplay style and newly intergrated styles in this new game.Now for the main reasons I have (not) recommended this game.- A lot of the features of DD1 have been removed/rehased/recycled. This means that some of the things have been kept, while some of these things have been reworked, while most of the other stuff has been reused.-Style of the game is great, it is visualy appealing and very well textured/graphics are amazingly good for a pre-alpha.- A lot of the classes have been reworked and nerfed heavily. Huntress's mines/traps and bombs area of effect has been greatly nerfed had has no were near the the effect they did in DD1. Squire's defences are while the same, have been heavily nerfed, and dont hold a candle to DD1's squire's defences. Monk and Apprentice are in the same boat, thus making the game a lot more difficult and challenging when progressing onwards in leveling. Defences are also quite weak, and you're forced to rely on your hero to do most of the cleaning of waves.-Mana: Mana has been drastically altered and is no longer the main currency of the game. While you still use mana to build towers and use abilities, the new incorperation of a coin/gold system is now the new money of the game. Speaking of mana, there are two different types of mana. Ability mana (Blue) and Tower mana (Green) both drop off enemies, but in very LOW quantites.-Online system: They have a very strange working of the Online/Server set up which at first greatly confused me. However it took a while to get use to. You are thrown into a recruitment tavern where you talk to a recruiter. This brings up a menu allowing you to pick from multiple different level groups. E.g. 1-5. 5-10. 10-15. This also stops boosting somewhat as if you were a higher level, (E.g. 15) and joined a lower level bracket, (E.g. 5-10), you would be brought down to level 10 for the remainer of your time in that bracket, once you leave, you are returned to your normal level. This also kicks lower level characters from trying to join higher level brackets.Overall, the game is very different from DD1. I was expecting it to be a lot better than the first one, and wasn't expecting much of the workings of the characters to change that much considering they were perfect in the first game. However this is my opinion and that doesn't mean much on the internet.The main reason I am not recommending this game is becuase it's purely a pre-alpha and the the fact that its $24, (from New Zealand), is not really ideal. However, in another case, if you loved DD1 and want to give it a try, by all means, i would recommend it to you just becuase its a great start to a game that has LOADS of potential. However, definately needs work, and lots of changes.~~TLDR~~ If you liked DD1, get it and see for yourself. If you haven't played DD1 or didn't like DD1, don't get it, becuase it's simply not worth $24 or whatever its going for in your country. Especially when rumour has it that on offical release its going to go Free 2 Play.			"

								I'm sorry to say, Trendy is running the game quite poorly. I've been playing since the alpha, and hosts have no control over who enters your room. I have had people join my room then proceed to upgrade the incorrect towers, purposefully throw away mana, and even have the audacity to blame my ""poor"" build. I have been forced to play solo custom games to grind out my dailies, meaning progression in the game is abyssmally slow.If the host had control, i.e. could kick people out of room, it would stop the host form getting kicked out of their own rooms,  deny intentional trolls from ruining builds, actually develop friendships between likeminded individuals looking to advance, and aid newer players in advancing.With the addition of the new end-game update, everything has gotten worse than ever, many characters have difficulty building in the new chaos difficulties, trolling can easily waste 30 minutes, it is impossible to solo certain maps due to the necessity of hero dps, and equipment is impossibly difficult to grind.I really did love Dungeon Defenders 1, but this is not fair to people that actually want to progress into the end-game of any third person tower defense.

								This game used to be so good about 2 weeks before this post, everything was perfect, the item power, the items choices, the dmg ratio, but after the recent updates everything has gone downhill. Charaters do no damage, enemies are nearly invicible, every map is close to impossible to complete, towers are weaker, old stratagies has been vanguished, inventory has been changed for the worse, there is no skill points for personalisation. I wouldn't recommend downloading this game until they fix these issues or rollback the updates. You shouldn't get into this game yet, wait for them to roll back the updates because you will hate it, you will find it very hard to do anything and you will be confused by the unnecessary complexity of the inventory. ROLL BACK THE UPDATES DEVELOPERS!!!			"

Yet (they will be added)Upgrading system becomes a little tedious late gameAura and other defence placement interaction is a little finicky at presentCurrrent item managment system could use a bit of work (fine for now though)Arguably the F2P model (a lot of people dislike it, please note it will NOT be P2W however)The Ugly:Current matchmaking process and map selection is unintuitiveMonk AA tower still has trouble with target identification (will be fixed soon) "

								FIRST OF ALL NOTE THAT THIS GAME IS ON EARLY ACCESS (PRE-ALPHA), MEANING ITS NOT A FULLY DEVELOPED GAME WITH NO BUGS AND ALL CONTENT AVAILABLE.I played the original dundef and i liked dd2 just as much.Keeping true to the original game, still blending the fun of tower-defense game with action rpg games, this sequel is just as fun, if not MORE fun than the original dundef. (And it's only on early access! Imagine when it's fully released!)~PROS~-Better Graphics (LMFAO wHo cAREAS Xd seriously.)-Characters are more customizable with the new accessory patch!-The new sphere skill tree is better than dd1's skill point system imo. + UBER SPEC !!! (game-changing spec for each classes towers.)-4 HERO ABILITIES COMPARED TO DD1'S 2 HERO ABILITY.-The world is more interactive (Pre-Set Traps!)-Class COMBOES! water + electric = electrocute? oil + fire = ignite? yes please!~CONS~-The towers are BOOORING. I miss the bowling ball turret from DD1 T_T-BUGS GLITCH BUGS GLITCH (But it's okay, since its only Pre-Alpha.-NEED MORE HEROES!-Some Spec is just utter 5H!T AND USELESS. MORE CHARACTER SPEC PLZ!!!-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ AI GETS STUCK AND IT PISSES ME OFF! (Could be exploited too, but what fun would that be?)Overall, the game's progess is looking REAAAAL good. I was skeptical about buying it first, but then Trendy really showed me their hard work on making this game, even convincing me to buy the collector's edition (DAMMIT TRENDY!)9/10. HIGHLY RECOMMEND PLAYING THIS WITH YOUR FRIENDS! Soloing is possible, but it gets BOOORING REAL FAST, but if you play this game with your friends (4 stack if possible) it is just simply AMAZING.<3 u Trendy, keep up the good work!-Popon			"

								-The game isnât about getting gear anymore (what the whole game was about) you now need shards from end game lvls like chaos to do any real damage. How do you get high enough lvl to play chaos you may ask?-Well gear in hard mode is only lvl 46 / isnât good enough to play chaos 1-Chaos 1 drops lvl 46 gear not good enough to even fight its own lvl. SOOoOOoOoOO you need to be carried like a baby while you stand around and let someone else do everything and then equip all the max stats gear (even if the item sucks and does nothing towards how you want to build the charter) Because thatâs the only way to get better stats. It also makes getting gear always lame. Like any loot game when you find that one SUPER awesome peace that just amazing and you jump up and down for joy doesnât exist in this game. You just do this slow climb to the top that is dual and not really rewardingâ¦..What this game is missing for me,1. Maybe some set gear that bonus off each other. 2. A better roll over from hard to chaos mode. (itâs like two totally different worlds) Why make shards the best way to really tweak and help your character but then only given it to the top players. That can farm chaos. 3. Better random items. Like I understand the slow stat increase wayâ¦ But throw in an item occasionally, thatâs super nice that I donât have to be doing chaos 5 to get. (like set gear) As of right now hard mode doesnât give me any better gear then what I have on and chaos 1 is just so crazy I canât farm it to get any better gear. From a game that use to give you so much, now only gives you so little. Iâll have to put it back down from now. Sad to see a free to play that was always a load of fun go down the drain.  "

								If you want a super repetitive, unsatisfying, grindfest then you'll love this game. After you play the first map, you've experienced all the game has to offer. You max out your character, just to be able to play the same boring maps. You repeat this cycle until the day you die. Terraria crossover? You mean more sifting through the same boring map set ups with the same exact enemy types. After years in development, you'd think there would be more to this game then over priced microtransactions and boring missions.Edit*If you are a braindead mindless retard that likes doing the same menial tasks over and over, until you have the coolest looking things to be able to the same missions that you already completed, then you will â¥â¥â¥â¥ing love this game. As for me, this game is probably going to destroy most of my friendships.			"

I enjoyed the game play, they made it different to the first one, which was good, but it still stuck to its roots of a magical RTS with some 3rd Person fighting involved.Enter TrialsGame I spent Â£15 or so on is now free. I get some ingame pay-to-win currency for what is now basically an FPS with a slight hint of tower defence in that you can kiiiiiinda slow them down. If you are new to DD as a franchise get DD1.

								I really wanted this game to do well. I have to just stop playing this game. Every time I come back to it every mechanic changes and progression is flipped around and left incoherent. The developers seem to not know what they want to do and I just cant support this any more.  As of right now. The game does have entertaining aspects to it. Classes feel fun, buildings are entertaining and flashy. But the bad things like certain monster forcing play styles is just jarring and not needed. Goblin tank forces you into tanking because it just plows through any tower without stopping and requires massive amounts of dps to kill it. They added the annoying talent system from Diablo 3. Want to find tune some thing? Too bad you have to gain 4 levels to add one point to the thing you want.  I suggest Coop if you are interested in the game. After hitting about level 45-50 it gives you an enormous gear check and soloing comes to a grind.Best of luck Trendy. I loved Dungeon Defenders 1. I dont know what went wrong in house, but this doesnt feel like a sequel. Feels like some thing EA would do to an IP they want to get rid of. Ill check in again once you guys officially release this game.			"

								Good game. it is an improvement in a lot of areas from the first one, including design and scope.Added multiplayer functionalities are great, expanded story is great.As is in alpha, its still a bit buggy, and the netcode isnt all that great, but the gameplay is fun.Perhaps a legitimate flaw of this game is that its a loot fest, prepare to be going thru your inventory equipping, unequipping,selling, etc, over and over again. Theres also a lot of rpg elements like skill spheres, your stats level, your equipment. Lot of space for different builds but also a bit of spreadsheet madness. But thats ok if you like that sort of thing.			"

								I've logged into this game every so often since they very first released it as a paid beta. Coincidentally, each time I see what they've done in the latest update, the pulsating cancer in myâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥grows slighly larger. Somehow the devs have managed to make an even bigger and more unethical cash grab than the first game, which was produced under Chinese sweatshop conditions. But at least that one was fun.Originally, a lot less emphasis was placed on the microtransactions, but now the game is essentially another â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Korean MMO grindfest with state of the art psychological exploitation. Every nasty business model around has been distilled and injected into this game which plays you much more than you play it. There is very little strategy in the shockingly limited towers and abilities you possess, and every inch of the game has recieved the 'competitive' sterilization that never fails to suck all the fun out of multiplayer titles. You can also find more impactful character customization in a Kim Kardashian dress up game. No matter how much I try to push a single stat, my max level character feels like it plays exactly the same as it did at level 1. Also, you're forced by both level design and game mechanics to use both towers and abilities, because Trendy sees their players as vegetables who shouldn't be deciding anything for themselves. I would have quit this much, much earlier if I didn't like DD1 so much, but I guess it's what I get for hoping a F2P game will be good. Loot is boring, pets are boring, the game is boring, the art is pretty nice, the cancer hurts, and I regret spending $30 and however much time on this game. I could see myself recommending this game to devoted fans of cookie clicker and/or lobotomy patients.			"

								As you can see I have quite a few hours in this game so I can tell you that this WAS a great Tower Defense game prior to the new update.  As of 2/28/2017 and beyond the ""Trials"" update has now turned this game into complete and utter trash.  The normalization of gear, removal of unique stats from class specific gear, addition of runes to enhance gear, stat squish and ascension system have ruined everything that was fun about this game.  It is now no longer a Tower Defense game but has shifted into an action RPG with a few towers to help you a ""little bit"", because that is literally how much damage your towers do now.  All of the unique aspects of the classes are pretty much gone since they removed the unique abilities and character enhancements from the gear with this update.  Until this is reverted I will not be putting any more time into this game.  I personally recommend playing Dungeon Defenders 1 now if you want to play a very fun Tower Defense game with a dedicated base of players.I've played this game since DD1 and supported this game since day 1.  The current changes to the game derailed the entire focus of Tower Defense and made it more of an action game which relies more on your character than your Towers as defense.  It also normalized all gear so that all the hundreds of hours of farming that we did to get special weapons etc which gave characters special abilites or enhanced abilities in ways that we had worked towards are now trash and just like any other pieces of gear.  Shards was a terrible idea and even after all of the money that I've put into this game to support it I will not be putting another penny into it until they revert the trash parts of this update and find a better way to do things.  We didn't even get a community vote for this trash like we usually do, it was just thrown onto us without anyone having any kind of input on it whatsoever.  The company doesn't HAVE to have a community vote, no....  BUT Trendy has always done it in the past to avoid making terrible mistakes such as the ones that they did with this update, pure garbage.

								Core Gameplay:You defend your crystals, build towers, kill waves of enemies, level up, loot and get better equipment, kill even stronger waves of enemies and have fun.Review:While the game undertook several changes since it first appeared on steam, it stayed pretty consinstent over the time. It had some weak patches, but it also had some pretty neat changes. I got bored of the first part of the franchise, because my towers were basically godlike and I could take on everything. They changed this with the sequel. You need to kill the special enemies and bosses yourself and can't just layback (at least I haven't reached the item-power to do so yet) and it's very entertaining. I think we can all agree, that a game, in which you got nothing to do is a bad game.The game is meant to be played with up to 3 other defenders, which can be very funny or very frustrating (like every other online game, where you have to work together), but overall I prefer to play this game alone. Some maps are way easier as a team, especially the harder difficulties in the game, but it's still somehow doable.The only problem I have with this game is, that it takes some time to unlock the heroes themselve. When I remember correctly, you start with the 4 basic heroes and have to unlock the other 5 with wyvern coins or real money. You get wyvern coins for finishing a map and completing daily or monthly quests.One important point is, that you don't get any advantages by investing real money. You can only unlock skins and heroes with the premium currency. Personally, I think the 4 starting heroes are all you need. The others are just for optimizing your defense.All in one: The game is f2p, it's fun, try it yourself. You don't lose anything beside some of your time.			"

								So far I'm enjoying this game quite a lot, the biggest issue I've come across is the constant searching for parties system it has, but if that's the biggest issue I have with an early access Alpha, things are looking solid. Game play is smooth, engine runs well have come across very few bugs.Looking forward to see how the game continues to develop, if you were a fan of number 1 it is definitely worth investing some time into this. 8/10			"

								I loved and supported this game from the beginning, but Trendy ruined it for me.Sadly they seem to have no idea how to balance the game, implement end game features or fix game-breaking bugs, some of which are part of the game for a very long time now.The game itself and progression in general are frustrating and do not feel balanced at all - especially when playing solo.Trendy, you had a great game idea and lost it on the way.This game might be playable or even good one day, but I won't be around to see it.UPDATE:Had to see it with my own eyes, but you did improve the game at least a little bit with the latest updates. And you made it P2W by adding Shard-Bundles to the store. I remember a time when you promised to never do that, but I guess you are desperate. Hate to see a great game concept go down like this ...

								this game is.... uhhhhh the WORST tower defence game EVER I never died unless I fell in a pit and apperantly goblins are babies!? also am I the only onewho thinks this looks like clash of clans and should be on ipad? DD1 had the coolest graphics for a 2011 game but now in 2015-2016 we have clash of clans. the inventory space is terrible in DD1 it was ok.... but in DD2 it has no inventory space after 3 levels and I know this is turning into a rant and getting annoyed by (some) bad english but just bare with me. speaking of levels there are about 15 that are not fun to play again and onslaught mode is really hard for a huntress who has a great bow and great stats. now the difficulty is is very not hard at all like oh no ranged enemies? where are the dark elf archers? and wyverns at the final boss wait I meant Only boss. ogres are gone now so we now get powered up normal enemy thats super duper easy wow so cool........ this rant is overalso dont judge me by my profile pic I cant change it for ssome reason and bye!!!!!!!!!!!

								-This review may get some future edits-Apparently there is few bad reviews for this game, and I notice the reason for that probably is because they don't find the game similar to first DD1 and to have different aspects. As far as I can see those folks didn't even play the game enough to make such harsh reviews of the game, they simply give up after having to do some grind, which is sad cuz the game is very promising and fun.To begin with I must say that I never did any review about an early-access or beta/alpha games, but well ... like they say : there is always a first time.So here we go. The first Dungeon Defenders games come out a couple of years ago, and I never had a chance or time to try them out on that time. Just this year I had a chance to play it and without any surprises I immediately loved it. After getting all the collection I decided to also buy the upcoming Dungeon Defenders II, which is currently on alpha (I probably will update this review later), but for now the game is running really GOOD, So good that doesn't even feel like an early-access, As you can notice I got tons of hours already, that's all because the game hook you in, lots of fun playing solo or online, and will be even better when this goes F2P, cuz all your friends will be able to play it without spend a cent. Though I really reccomend this game as it is right now because it worth every penny.			"

								So I have played this game for a significant amount of time and I have finally come to the conclusion that I cannot recommend this game right now.Pros:So this game is kinda like a visual upgrade for dd1 which I played a lot on the 360 at the time and I enjoyed that game. The maps can have a pretty good learning curve and they can be kinda fun to play on. The gear can be pretty nice to get but later on in the game you will come to find the gear to just be frustrating in terms of the shear amount of rng on the rolls for different stats and so called ""passives"" which are suppose to give you buffs to certain builds. Then there is the characters. The characters are pretty simple. There are builds for each type of these heros that can make them fun and pretty viable late game(I say this now but Trendy are doing a lot of nerf passes as of late which is kinda why I am kinda done with this game for the time being but more on that later). Cons:There are a lot of problems for this game and I feel like the game devs can't use the whole ""It's in beta or alpha"" argument after the game being out for about 2 going on 3 years now. It is extremly buggy and each update seems to be adding more problems. Then there is the new heroes they have released. You can grind these heroes for this type of currency called ""Defender Medals"" which can be somewhat easy to grind for if you have a lot of time through the means of daily missions which reset at a wierd time for some in different time zones. There are also weeklys and monthlies but they haven't done a monthly in a good couple of months. Some say it is ""pay to win"" I like to call it ""pay to skip"" which is not that bad if you think about it. The gear at later levels can get really frustrating if you don't get the correct rolls. The devs keep just doing the nerf hammer on a lot of heroes and builds people run and barley buffing anything to a viable use. There are massive server issues and bugs that can make the game unplayable for some people for some length of time. TL:DR This game was a really cool concept and I liked playing it for the time being but it seems the way the devs are doing things at this point in time compared to the time was a payed to get access alpha the devs seemed to have lost sight of what this game was suppose to be. Until the devs either fix the the problems in the game or stop the nerf hammer on a lot of things and buff stuff to be more viable in endgame then I will still not recommend this game.			"

								This is a pretty good game, and heres why. - Fun to play characters.- Plays at 50 fps on my crappy computer on medium in some pretty intense moments. - Doesn't look like crap on medium or low- You can earn basically everything- People who pay get very trivial bonuses- Some sort of story that revolves around the four main playable characters- A decently done two-way crossover- Multiple challenges after the story is done- Diablo-esq loot system that doesn't seem heavily rigged in favor of pay to play players.Heres some cons. - Very short six act story, with 2-6 missions on average per act. - Challenges recommended directly after final boss seem infinitely harder than the final bosses stage. - Can't unlock any of the cool heroes even if you beat the full story, still gotta do those challenges for them. - Paying does give some convienient short-cuts, nothing bad though. - Story lacks general depth, but its alright for a game of this length.

								Dungeon Defender II is a very fun game.  They have done an incredible job on the graphics too.. such detail its amazing.  You will love the game.  Quite addicting and everything can be bought with medals you win so you dont have to put money into it to get the paid for items.  Now...the costumes on the other hand are ridiculously over priced... not to sure what to say about that one except laugh.  I would love to see a finished product in the near future though but there is no talk of such yet.  If you are going to play this game during this stage then be prepared for your characters to be constantly changed, your items to be nerfed and inventory to be wiped.  I have been doing this for few years now and at this point I am hoping they come to some end and decide to release a full game so we dont have to go through this anymore.			"

WTF am i playing!????its not a defence game anymore, the core value of DD is totally damaged. SIGH!Its now just a cartoon style fps game with some construction of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ buildings. A cartoon style FPS game, why dont we go and play over watch!Fold up and stop this development. Back and see why was dd1 so sucessful. Rework the whole game!

								There are six reasons you buy and play a DD game. You love TD, RPG, loot farming, burning your life away, forgetting what the outside world looks like, doing the same thing over and over again, and have a tendency towards masochism. Every actual DD fan cannot deny the prior statement is true of themselves, and they know it. Moving on.What is actually wrong here:Content; believe it or not after 2+ years in ""alpha"" dev, the amount of content is sorely lacking. Namely endgame.Microtransactions; exclusively costumes are pay only, while new heroes/heroines are either 20$ish or replaying the same maps hundreds of times.Community; there are generally two types of players, those that have no clue what's going on, and those that are farmed and know what's going on. The two don't interact much and if they do the results are often less than fun.It's not a new story for the series but it's reached thinly vieled to in your face bad, at least for me. I can't expect Trendy to make any different decisions at this point and I can no longer support their business model.So, if you either have a deep pocket, or lots of time on your hands, I recomend you skip this one.

								7 Feb 2015 - Edit: They have changed how things work and implemented the old system where you can just beat a level and be on your way. They are listening to the community feedback and changing the game and how everything works according to that. If you like developers who work hand in hand with their community, then you will like these guys.I can now recommend this game if you liked the old Dungeon Defenders and have friends to play this with and if you don't have any friends who will play this game, it's still a solid game to play co-op with strangers or just solo.Keep in mind that the game will be free to play once it is released and the price you currently paid will be converted to in game currency, which will only be used for cosmetic items according to the developers.

Early Access Review
								I have been following dungeon defenders II just for the love I had for the previous game. I was hyped at first few months of the game. but the developers are taking very odd decisions about this game. There is no real challenge in this game. You simply do the same content in different difficulties and skyrocket yourself to the highest difficulty which is NM4 atm. Then the game is simply over. You can get the best gear, still improve very slightly but the content does not change. There is no end-game challenge that keeps your mind working. This was supposed to be a strategy tower defense game with attacking hero mechanics but all I experienced so far is constant map zerg. They are releasing very cool new character every once in a while but that is it sadly. Some metas change in the way characters are built but the result never changes. I never have to think of a strategy. I can just put towers whereever I like and the map slowly melts before my eyes while I sit and browse the web. This is not the game I hoped this game would become.			"

Only problem with this game is the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ server lag (and the fact that even on solo, you are required to be in a server. Where you lag.) Lag aside, when the game runs properly it is a lot of fun. I cant wait for the game to leave Alpha and make its way to full release.			"

								Originally I made a review for this that was negative. However, with all the updates and the amount of love and effort put into this game by the devs, I'm happy to say that I recommend this game. It's very pretty, with a better art style than the first game. Skills and whatnot may be a little different, but anything that has changed from the original DD to this game has been for the better.And it looks like Trendy is still at work updating this game, so expect to see more stuff incoming!

								If you like orcs must die then you will like this game. So what you do is build traps and barricades to defend the target, the only thing I find annoying with this game is the chests (not the ones at the end of the level that spawn) require keys or gems to open. This game is $15.00, you have to buy the gems to open the chests and the cheapes is $5.00 fo 500 gems. If I have to buy a game then there should not be any in app purchase/micro transaction. But other than that the game is pretty fun.			"

								I am really enjoying Dungeon Defenders 2, I am a fan of Dungeon Defenders and have had the second game on my wishlist for a while now.  Overall I feel like the game has improved, it lacking a lot of things the first game had at the moment but it is still in alpha. I am jsut glad i dont have to deal with all those crazy hacks and mods i feel like were rampant on the first game.  For those not familiar with Dungeon Defenders, you chose your hero and battle waves of enemy's in tower defense gameplay with up to four friends. Dungeon Defenders has a good deal of classes to chose, but so far in Dungeon Defenders 2 we only have the 4 original to chose from, those being the Huntress, squire, monk, and apprentice. Really I am hoping that Dungeon Defenders 2 ends up better than the first game. Its supposed to be going free to play after launch so I am really hoping it  gets popular. its a fun tower defense game, especially if you play with friends.   "

Game has to be the most ridiculous early access game on steam.

								This game is fun, especially if you have friends to play it with. However, the developers misled a lot of people early with making us buy the game, then turning it to free to play. We still have to pay more to get all of the new stuff that they're still devolping.In short, try this game. It's worth it. Just don't pay a dime until you know for sure they're done adding things.

								As with any Early Access game, make sure it is a game you are okay with it being changed as development goes on. As it stands, the game plays very similar to the first, with some minor changes. So far it seems to be living up to the greatness that was Dungeon Defenders 1.Understand that because it is early access, I know a lot of my concerns with the game will be fixed, and I will update my review when that happens.Pros/Cons:+ The AI seems to be smarter, and more dificult than those in the first game.+ The ability to move your hero while in place/repair/upgrade defense mode is amazing.+ The Dual Mana system is also an awesome addition. You now have mana for abilities, and a separate mana for towers.+ The new defenses each hero has are either upgrades from the first game, or new all together, which is good.+ The ability to vote for the next addition into the game is an awesome early access feature, and should be done more often by developers.- The gear upgrade system is lacking, and confusing at first. - There has yet to be added a proper tutorial system for new features.- The small amount of maps gets old quite fast, and the game tends to get boring after a bit.- Costumes and pets are nowhere to be found, and is one of the things that made the first game a favorite.- The gear shops are barely useful, as the only reason I use them is to get junk gear to upgrade my current stuff.All in all, the game is damn good, and can only get better from here.

Early Access Review
								A sequel to the wildly popular and unique Dungeon Defenders game that takes a different direction from its predecessor.(Note, I originally did not recomment this game, but after hours of playing, I have decided to recommend it.  I'll explain why below.)Pros- Personal loot drops make for a more relaxed game where you don't have to constantly keep your eyes out for drops you need (There's no more race to grab the good loot before other players and that is a great design call)- The classes have some really cool attacks and abilities making each feel unique- Changes to mana and loot selling have made things much easier, both for sorting through loot and for upgrading it- Seperation of mana for building and for personal powers was a great call- Easy group finding system gets you right into the action- Reputation system makes random players more inclined to be polite- Synergy system means you can make powerful tower combinations if you have a cooperative team of players.Cons- Can't play offline- Long lags between games.  Due to the fact that a game has no clear leader, everyone has to ready up for the game to progress between levels and after the games.  This doesn't sound too bad, but when people go afk or someone new isn't paying attention, it can end up being 2+ minutes to continue on- Solo, each classes tower set is lacking (I'll explain more about this below)- A lack of mana will prevent you from doing much during a combat round (at least at low level)- The win points and fun-factor strategies to this game aren't as obvious as they were in the original- Builder specs feel very nerfed thanks to the lack of mana (EDIT: Again, this is only when you don't try to work with the other player's towers)- Maps are a bit bland, there aren't as many strategic points where you can put towers to have them cover multiple lanes- Tower synergies are esential to effective play- Certain specs are almost completely useless right now- Gating low-level players means that you can't power level your buddies.  It also means that, if your buddies get too far ahead, you can't play with them unless you make a new character.- Certain monsters outrange your towers.  I'm not sure if this changes at high level, but at low level it's extremely frustrating.  It means that you'll be babysitting your towers instead of being able to place them in different spots and trust them to do their job.- Due to the fact that you have to babysit your tower clumps, you cannot solo most of the levels (At least as an apprentice)So I went back and started playing as the monk with a friend who was playing the huntress, and I quickly figured out a pretty devistating combo that made the game much more playable.  I also figured out that one of my mages towers, while not super impressive when combined with his original towers, was extremely effective when combined with one of the monk's auras.So it seems the devs are really pushing for cooperative gameplay in this one, the game almost feels more like WoW than it does Dungeon Defenders.  To be successful, each player must assume a certain role in their tower construction.  A group of apprentice towers isn't very effective, however an ice tower combined with an electric aura (monk) combined with a water geyser (hunter) is devastating.  The concept is fun when it works out, the big problem is that new players or stubborn players will often build whatever they want, effectively lowering your chances of success.  I feel like this sort of design choice needs to be combined with a matchmaking system that tries to put one of each class in a game together.  (Maybe this is already the design, I don't know, but I was often in games with several members of my own class.)The good news is, I did start having a lot of fun once I figured out how the devs expected me to play.  However, I had to do a lot of digging to find that answer.  The game needs to guide its new players better so they know what's needed for victory and don't just build whatever, therebye frustrating the other people who are trying to work as a team.Also, the game needs more towers and more tower synergies.  As of this review, there is one devastating tower/aura/trap combination and everything else is very meh.  Certain towers are very meh and pretty much un-needed.  This needs to be changed so that there are multiple metas (tower building combinations) showing up in the games instead of just 1 or 2.In closing, the game is fun but very different from the first Dungeon Defenders.  You'll have the most fun when playing with friends, and you may want to watch some videos on how to effectively use your towers depending on your class.* UpdateSo the game changes quite a bit at high level.  Once you get your gear established and start the process of farming, you pretty much only need one skilled builder (generally an apprentice or squire) to do the tower setup for the level.  To be honest, it is kind of grindy and not always fun.  And while finding new items to improve your stats can be fun, the actual gameplay isn't.  This may change once more maps are available and harder difficulties are provided.  I'm going to keep my recommendation for now as the game isn't bad and still has potential, but I'm really looking for some new kinds of juicy cooperative gameplay.			"

Early Access Review
								I've played the first one, it was great fun. This second one does a fantastic job building on what was great. Keeping what made it successful, yet deepening the gameplay, and setting itself up to become a very successful and long lasting experience.I've played the Pre-alpha so far, these days with so many Early Access floating around on steam, very few are actually entertaining for long periods of time and don't portray a very good picture of what the end product will be like.After purchasing it (based on the gameplay I've seen, and my experience of the first game) I read up on some of the difficulties the Studio faced, and as a member of a fellow game studio, I can understand their struggles, but I also commend them for making the right decisions to make the game they want to make for their fans.What I didn't know was that DD2 is intended to become a Free-to-play game. Even though I bought into it (with a 4 pack) which I think will work really well if done correctly, and it sounds like they got their heads on straight.I fully intend to cover this game in my future video guides, as I feel there may be enough depth to the game to make regular videos for fans.But one tip I can share right off the bat: PLAY WITH FRIENDS. It is infinitely more enjoyable, especially if you're around the same level. The matchmaking system is probably still in the works, so do yourself the favour, and don't expose yourself to potential malicious players who could ruin your experience. You payed good money, a good experience will allow you to justify it's current Early Access cost.Keep it up Trendy, you all deserve it!			"

Early Access Review
								The original Dungeon Defenders was likely one of the best executions of an integration between FPS and Tower Defense that the marketplace has seen.  I managed to clock a substantial quantity of hours into the original game, and it was an absolute blast to play.And then they started monetizing the game.  DLC became incredibly commonplace for addons.  New Heroes, new levels, new cosmetics, new character skins, anything they could think of.  They never directly monetized 'power', however, with the introduction of new levels with a higher level cap, it was an indirect way of power-capping new players.The other concern out of the implementation on the original Dungeon Defenders is that as new content got released, there was a substantial amount of Gear Inflation.  +500 to a given stat, which was godly at release, was trivial a few months later.  It had a much more MMO-esque grind to the game that drove their monetization strategy.Then we come to Dungeon Defenders 2.  When I look at this game, I realize that there were a lot of underlying engine upgrades, tons of texture updates, and they completely revamped multiple parts of the game... However, it's different enough from the original.  A lot of rehashed abilities, the same/familiar characters, etc.  The strength behind Dungeon Defenders 2 is that they have a better grasp of their monetization model going into it, and it's built that way from the ground up.  The reason Dungeon Defenders 2 is so popular right now is because it's still at it's infancy.  But even incredibly early on in the process, it really appears to be taking the same path at the original game, but by 'resetting' everything, they're opening the door for more monetization opportunies.  In my opinion, there hasn't been substantial innovation into this game to necessitate the high price tag, or recommend this game to anyone that has already enjoyed the original Dungeon Defenders.  It satisfies the same basic FPS-Tower Defense itch that can be scratched by cheaper alternatives in a more complete state.  This is much less a Dungeon Defenders 2, so much as it's a substantial overhaul of the original Dungeon Defenders.			"

								Updated review (as of 01/28/17)Let me start by stating that I have never played the original Dungeon Defenders game.  So for me, Dungeon Defenders II (DDII for short) was my first experience with this franchise.  I have no knowledge of how DDI played and I will not be comparing DDI with DDII in this review.For me, DDII did something other Tower Defense games have never done.  They combined awesome tower builds with the ability to have a 3D environment that you (the character) can also run around and interact with.  This means that, in DDII, if you are not optimizing your towers as well as your hero damage and contributing both equally, you are not really playing the game the way it was meant to be played.The game also has its fair share of issues, like any other game, and itâs also worth mentioning that it is still in early access so anything I mention is subject to change.  When I started playing this game in mid-November of 2016, quite a bit had already been changed in DDII from the inception (or initial launch of the title).  For example, the campaign got a huge revamp right before I started and now it is designed to take you from lv1 to lv50 and get you started in Nightmare I difficulty out of the gate.  This was not the case originally.  The reason I mention this is, there is a massive update coming which will change and address quite a few issues most players have with the game, how you gear, progression within the difficulty tiers, inventory management, game balance and so much more.  Itâs important to understand, in my opinion, that the game is still early access and will continue to get better over time.All that said, I have really enjoyed my time with this game thus far and it is free to download so you can try it risk free.  I am so excited for the new changes coming in February 2017 (or later depending on TrendyENT) and I can highly recommend this game to anyone that likes the idea of a tower defense game that is much more action oriented.  Since I havenât really mentioned it, your character gears and levels up and it is very similar to diablo style games, loot based systems, where you are going to be grinding for better gear/drops so you can not only enhance your towers' defense power but also your hero power.

All four of us play: father, mother, sister, brother.It is cartoony, in a colorful fantasy setting.  Everyone has a character and is always active, yet we're in it together, planning  a joint strategy to  prevent the monsters from destroying our crystal.DD2 is nice step up from the original DD.  The visuals are fantastic.  The interface seems more intuitive.Please game developers, let's have more family friendly co-op games such as this one.			"

While in the social tavern (where you see other people), I didn't see many players which probably doesn't help the others who went into the game solo with the intent of finding others to play with. The graphics are cute. Overall, I think it's a good game with slight problems, but it's to be expected with early access games.			"

Because the game lacks end game and too many people had insane stats, so TE nerfed everyone to oblivion and most people left, don't bother to play because sooner or later a nerf will make your gear and pets obsolete.  Only the hardcore fanbois have stayed and they fool themselves with the same ol crap, ""It's an Ea game"".

THATS NOT MICRO! YOUR FULL GAME DOES NOT COST THAT MUCH. Almost $10 for a single costume, and then more on top of that to unlock the alternate accessories? How about you guys actually focus on making and FINISHING the game instead of some cash shop items. Hell the $50 extra for the collectors edition upgrade is even more crap. 4 character skins, 4 tower skins (which aren't in the game yet) 10,000 in-game cash shop currency, and a title. You could spend that $50 and get DD1 with all of the DLC, or a 4 pack of DD1 and have even more fun with your friends.And for those of you saying ""Well this is just there way of gaining support to make the game better."" No, it's not. The collector's edition, maybe. Not this BS micro transaction crap. I already know where this is heading, there going to make the level cap high, and slow the leveling process to a halt halfway through. Then they start selling speed-ups, EXP, money, item droprate boosters. At the prices I'm already seeing I imangine they'll be $5 each, or a bundle pack for $10. Other games and other companies have pulled this same crap, and a lot of those were crucified by gamers. Just because they made a decent game once doesn't mean they should be immune to this. What happened to my character customization? Why can't I change my characters colors, put skill points into the towers and skills that I like the most? Because they monitized how your charcter looks and streamlined all forms of character building. Now you pick a character, name it, and that's all you get to do. Oh, but you get skill spheres. That's scool right? You get a total of 7 skill spheres: 3 small (stat boosters) 2 medium (tower/skill boosters), 1 large (tower/skill modifier), and 1 uber (huge boost to tower ability I guess). And that's it. That's all you get to do. There is no other form of customization, you don't get to level up skills or towers, you don't get to modify any of that crap. This is basic stuff that was in the first game. Why whould you take it away? Yeah, I get it, the game is pre-alpha (which is a BS excuse to ignore any problems people like me have considering how this game looks and plays) and a part of me really wants to like and enjoy it for what it is, but these terrible business practices will need to either change. I will not play this game ever again, and I will go back to playing DD1 as it is a more fun, enjoyable, and fulfilling experience, with or without friends. Do yourself a favor and go buy that. If you'll excuse I'm going to go put in for a refund now.			"

								6/10  For those who have invested many many many hours into the first Dungeon Defenders, heed my warning. This game is very much worse than the first Dungeon Defenders. It just does not offer much in comparison but since it is free (open alpha), feel free to try it out yourself.  I personally enjoyed this game a fair bit.This game was also very fun playing with friends and theory crafting strategies for beating maps we were having trouble on. Figuring out the most effective/efficient tower placements made it quite fun the first time around.After the initial 50 hours I started to grow quite boring and tedious to do anything and everything.The journey of getting your first max level character (level 50 at this point in time) is probably the most fun I've had in this game. Getting to max level and grinding out for the best gear you can and then replacing it instantly after climbing to the next Nightmare difficulty becomes less and less rewarding and feels like more of a chore.With everything I've said, this game is fairly fun for the first 30-50 hours. In that time you can: -Learn about the classes-You can reach max level on a character or two (or 3 if you're really diligent)-Learn about every map F I N A L   V E R D I C T All the maps are given to you and you can play them all before you ever reach max level.There is no real reward to reaching max level besides being able to start the Nightmare difficulties which are just a pain the butt and offer nothing new besides identitcal weapons with better overall stats.You get the feeling of ""Oh great now I get to grind the same maps but its even harder...woop dee friggin' doo"" I give it a rating of 6/10 and I'm listing it as a positive review because I did indeed have a lot of fun. It just gets boring with the lack of variety in ""End Game""			"

 This is my third review of this game because I can not even PHATHOM why this newest update exists. With this newest endgame update, it sure did end the game for me. I don't even know where to start with this, so I'll go ahead and start with what I think the worst part of the update is about.  THE REMOVAL OF NIGHTMARE, THE ADDITION OF CHAOS So chaos goes up to chaos 5. Each chaos tier adds a brand new enemy type, ups their health and possibly even the wave sizes. Chaos 1 is extremely doable and is fair. Theeeen we get to every other chaos tier. This is where the game really goes belly up. My build is predominantly traps and auras at the moment. The reason? Almost every other projectile tower has turned into hot garbage after the update, either because they don't have enough crowd clear, attack too damn slow, or have pathetic damage. Auras and towers that are considered traps are where the real meat is, doing a decent amount of damage at a fast rate to a large group of enemies. Why did I just explain this to you? Just so you get an idea on what sort of hell you are facing on chaos 2 and above. Starting as early as chaos 2, they introduce EMP orcs. These â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s can just spawn in a lane, do a quick windup where they slam their hammer into the ground, and suddenly every aura and trap within a 5 mile radius is stunned for 7 years (give or take). See the problem here? Unless you have a 5 man team of coordinated players who manage to insta kill the EMP orcs before they have a chance to EMP your towers, you're screwed kiddo. These guys render EVE2, monk, and huntress almost entirely unusable because most if not all of their towers are some kind of trap/aura. Did I mention they spawn in more than 1 lane? If you're someone like me that only plays with 1 other player, good luck dealing with these insects before they screw up an entire lane for you. So by that point, you are almost required to use a projectile tower or at least a dryad trap with good range. Oh but wait, whats this? Chaos 3 introduces a new annoying enemy type that completely blocks all projectiles? They spawn in every lane too?! AND have 1 million health?? Looks like that plan didn't last long. Again, this might be alot easier on a 4 man team, but this is an extremely cruel punishment for solo players. Oh, and they block projectiles from some heroes too, so I hope you brought a melee hero that needs to do a large amount of damage quickly to kill it as well as have enough health to not get blended by the enemies inside of it. Chaos 4 and 5 just add more annoying crap enemies to the mix that I won't even bother going over. Chaos 5 is basically impossible while 4 is an even bigger pain in theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥than 3. But thats not all, folks! WHAT HAPPENED TO INCURSIONS AND PASSIVES Disregarding the fact that they removed entirely different balanced 4 difficulty levels, lets move onto incursions. Originally, incursions used to be unique forms of missions that had you do a specific task or kill a special type of boss. They were brutal but possible, and rewarded excellent types of unique loot. This was because they could be done on nightmare difficulties. Now, this mode is locked to hard, meaning you get abysmal tier loot that will NOT help you in chaos. If that wasn't bad enough, the passives of alot of these weapons simply do not work anymore. The MAIN POINT of these weapons were their unique passives. The midas bow's gold drench passive is entirely gone, and its fully charged m2 flamethrower attack does NO damage. The monk's staff that gave him a cloud to fly on is entirely broken and only allows you to fly for 1 second. These issues and many others have not been fixed at all 8 days after the release of the update. Which ties into my last complaint: THE 1GB UPDATE THAT CAME OUT JUST TODAY Seeing as how there was a very large update today, I thought good things were coming, hopefully some nerfs to chaos and buffs to towers.  No.The update nerfed towers. It nerfed towers. Let that sink in. Broken passives weren't fixed and the acension bug that actually REMOVES slowing percentages were not fixed. At this point the game might as well be called ""Barricades, Rams, and Flamethrowers oh my!"" because these are the only towers viable anymore. Oh wait, you don't own abyss lord because the grind for medals is an incredible slog that takes weeks before you can afford a single character? Guess you'll be playing ""Barricades and Flamethrowers"" then. The game is like a burning building right now, and they are pouring gasoline onto it before grabbing some water to snuff it out. Even after these supposed 'big changes' (http://imgur.com/rNumAbr) go live, I doubt the game will be as good as it was before the update. I want nightmare back, I want nightmare incursions back, I want passives back, I want the old game back!			"

								It's still in early development but already quite playable. For the players familiar with DD1 it's a feast of recognition and for those new into the world of ""hybrid FPS combined with tower defenses"" there's a tutorial and campaign easing you into the game.At the moment of this writing there's only 4 characters available, the same foursome from the original. But in true spirit the characters have aged a bit and no longer look like grade-school Southpark aged characters but more like teenagers. Quite a nice detail giving you the feeling of story progression.The game is still defend a crystal (see it as a homebase) from getting damaged by angry enemies. You can do this actively by killing them with your hero (the FPS element) or using your heroes defenses, arrow shooting towers, explosive traps auras and walls/barriers.Not all is quite finished yet. The way xp evolves at the moment is still a bit unbalanced the same if you compare the ratio of hero damage versus the damage traps/towers do. At the moment there's lots of ways to share your feedback via the forum and the developers seems to take the feedback into account.It's not a finished gem yet, but from what I can tell it plays a lot better than plenty of other ""beta games"" available on steam now.So if you can live with a few issues and enjoy playing either solo (doable) or with friends (co-op) then this can be a fun game			"

								Overall if you played, and liked DD1, then you will like 2. I especially liked that they separated building mana and ability mana so you aren't put in a position of being restricted from using abilities because you have to save up mana to upgrade every tower to the highest rank.  Their new rune system is nice as well to add some customization in terms of passive abilities.  The only down side that I can think of is that if you were one to completely neglect one stat and focus on others (i.e who needs health and attack when I plan on just using the character for towers?  Or vice versa.)  That you will still collect gear that has stats which affect them, but the stat bonus when gaining a level has been steamlined.  I personally don't mind it, but I do know there were people who would have multiple versions of the same character, one for building and one for combat.  One other feature that is nice is that the enemies per wave seem to be no longer dependent upon the number of players, thus the probability of someone booting you because they don't want more bad guys to fight per wave is no longer an issue.

I personally don't mind it, but I do know there were people who would have multiple versions of the same character, one for building and one for combat.  One other feature that is nice is that the enemies per wave seem to be no longer dependent upon the number of players, thus the probability of someone booting you because they don't want more bad guys to fight per wave is no longer an issue.

Early Access Review
								Yet another good game doomed to fail because of a developer team that can't listen to even the most simple of feedback.Dungeon Defenders 2 was fantastic before the release of the Trials update, then everything seemed to begin snowballing downward. Not only was the initial jump from campaign mode to the new Chaos difficulty nearly impossible, but the people who managed to do not only that were punished instead of being congratulated. I'm sorry, but you don't reward players for getting to certain difficulties by randomly nerfing all the heroes and raising green mana costs on things that were just fine on their own. You do not make your new difficulty more difficult by making players weaker and making some heroes completely unviable.Another thing that the Trials update has done to doom this game is player scaling. In what screwed up universe is it a good idea to make your players feel like a burden just by playing with other people? The more people that join, the harder the Old One's Army gets. And it's not even to a challenging difficulty, a Chaos 1 or 2 map with four players is nearly impossible to beat, and it's gotten to the point where most people swear by the playstyle of ""solo or nothing"" because of how much of a burden playing with other people is. You've really messed up when people don't want to play with their friends by no fault of said friends. Trendy tried to fix this by lowering the scaling, but they refused to listen when their playerbase said ""We want it GONE"". That description I used for player scaling? It was referring to after the nerf. So even after they believed they had done good and entirely ignored their fans cries, their multiplayer-centric game still entirely discourages multiplayer.The loot scaling system is a damned mess to the point where most players in the chaos difficulty are just waiting around for the blacksmith or relic hunter to stock something that's even some semblance of an upgrade. Because apparently the very simple idea of ""Stronger enemies and higher difficulty = better loot"" is too bland and stupid for Trendy Entertainment. There are far too many stories about how players are confronted with the choice to either sacrifice all their shards because a piece of equipment is far better than what they have but has no shard slots, so they opt to just sit around and wait for the blacksmith or relic hunter to have something better. Waiting around for an upgrade despite having clearly earned it is not okay.Trendy doesnât seem to care about proper game care, either. Reports abound of gamebreaking bugs that have been occuring for months up to a year, and what has Trendy done? Absolutely nothing. They seem to have a complete and utter disregard for things that make an online multiplayer tower defense game what it is. I wanted to like this game. But I can't care about a game if the devs can't either.			"

								game is playable now.  id say give it a go.  what have you got to lose?  if you liked the first one try on this one for size.  it is a smaller game.  more like bite sized in the early levels.  as usual we can buy stuff from the tavern for in game currency.  the cosmetics are purchased w/ a rare in game currency which can be added using irl money.  i have not encountered any paywalls as yet so for the casual player this is a good choice (edit - this experience is from a while back, YMMV).  the learning curve for veterans of the first game is mostly non existent.  for new players the tutorial levels are pretty much on the mark.i do not recommend this game as it is still (and may ever remain) early access.  recommended for casual to advanced tower defense, looters, and casual role players.

								so i have a huge issue here.  when you come in to games late you end up with no ability to upgrade or place defences. where some might be okay with this when 3/4ths of the game play is that, when you come in late or to a big group you end up swinging your wepon 2 or 3 times and nobody letting to get any kills. they will follow you from place to place defending their experience rate or someâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ part of my issue with that even clicking play privatly sends you to multi player where you can be joined or just flat out joining a big group. i have played solo 3 times in 23 hours of game play.  and every single time i have had to leave and try getting that solo experience again with another match because people join and it does not let me have the fun part. that being said they did well making setting up your towers fun.  if i could get a solo experience at will i would change the negative score.

								Dungeon Defenders 2 is a fun little game to pick up and play for short bursts of entertainment. Unfortunately that's all it is in its current state. With not much depth or difficulty, the fun can quickly turn into a boring grind for gear/currency/unlockables, all of which do not make much of a difference in gameplay.Every map has been mind numbingly easy, even on the ""hardest"" difficulty, and most of them can be cleared with a single Hero's defense towers. This can make for a very boring and lackluster session. It is a shame because the Heros do have some fun and interesting choices for defense, but they're just not needed in most cases.In my opinion, with the main flaw being lack of difficulty aside, DD2 still is a great game to own and play, especially if you have some friends to co-op with. Just don't burn yourself out by mindlessly grinding and instead focus on playing for fun-like using towers you don't need just for dramatic effect!			"

								Ok this review might be a lil shallow since i've just started today but heck who cares. Sooooooooo without further ado,Pros: Simple & Easy to learn game mechanics.Cool graphics and audio soundtracks.Challenging and requires the use of your brain to succeed. (well for solo players anyway).Awesome friendly community. (High lvlers aren't snobs).Cons:OMG the costumes are sooooooo expensive.The other class jobs are also soooooooo expensive to unlock. There are some trolls that ruin your game just to leech for free xps. (luckily u can vote to kick).The session timeout forced logout is annoying.Edit:ok after 59 hours of gameplay, finshing campaign and reaching iPWR of 700, I literally have nothing left to do in this game except playing nightmare maps. All I can say is, to all my fellow new players, finish campaign as fast as u can. Coz nightmare level is where all the fun is. I can guarantee you'll have a freaking wonderful time surviving the endless lvl500+ mobs (well not endless)			"

								After quite a lot of time with DD2, the most important item of conversation I think should surround every review of this game is simple: Developers that listen to their players and act on it.I've been playing DD2 since closed beta early access, on and off. I'll go a few weekends playing almost non-stop, come back a 3 months later and the game is the same but different. It's always better. Little things here and there, big changes every once in a while, but always getting more polish, always getting better.That's what matters to me. They know exactly what kind of game they wanted to make and they made it, but they're open to player opinions and requests. Obviously they won't change everything based on what one person says, but if enough people share an opinion they make the change. That's really cool and is what keeps me coming back.			"

								I have changed my review from a meh yes to a no due to lack of faith in the products future.Trendy, hot tip. Fix the core game before you make more content. It only gets harder and harder to go back and make the core good the more you stack a bunch of stuff on top of it. I keep returning to find more and more stuff, but it keeps feeling of lesser and lesser quality.This means tuning controls, menus, hub worlds, visual design choices...This means returning to DD1 and finding what was so fun about that game and infusing DD2 with it.This means adding controller support and splitscreen.And this means doing this BEFORE adding a bunch of levels and characters. Go back, look at the core. Fix it, then return to adding new stuff with the lessons learned from fixing the stuff you started with.I have returned to try out this game on MULTIPLE occasions hoping it had found its stride. I have been disappointed every time. I want this game to be good, it can be good. Everything is there to make it good, but its not good. Still no Controller support, the menu's look worse than they did before. The town is still huge for no reason. I don't want to buy anything because I don't have faith in the product. Give me the faith back, dig deep and find what made DD1 great and contrast it with what made Eterny-whatever suck. Pull it out, get it together, and then kill it. I want you to succeed. I want to play that game. I will come back and look at it and hopefully change my review to a resounding thumbs up. I have been waiting to throw a bunch of money at this game since it was announced.			"

								so i have a huge issue here.  when you come in to games late you end up with no ability to upgrade or place defences. where some might be okay with this when 3/4ths of the game play is that, when you come in late or to a big group you end up swinging your wepon 2 or 3 times and nobody letting to get any kills. they will follow you from place to place defending their experience rate or someâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ part of my issue with that even clicking play privatly sends you to multi player where you can be joined or just flat out joining a big group. i have played solo 3 times in 23 hours of game play.  and every single time i have had to leave and try getting that solo experience again with another match because people join and it does not let me have the fun part. that being said they did well making setting up your towers fun.  if i could get a solo experience at will i would change the negative score.

								Gameplay is alright, just very very repetitive, so you have to really like this kinda thing. If you want a different character you're going to have to grind for weeks or spend $15ish to buy them. The game is pretty broken, at the end of every single match the game will error me out and not send me back to town, forcing me to restart the game. But don't worry there are plenty of crappy microtransactions to make up for all the unfixed bugs.			"

								this game is awesome just like the first game, the only issue i have with it is that internet is required to play it solo, which means youll be fighting a boss, get it to 1000 hp (about 2 hits) and the game boots you loosing you loot, exp and any patiance you have with this game. if you have internet that isnt bad i highly reccomended. if, like me, you have rubbish internet then dont bother. get the first game instead, its awesome and you can play OFFLINE! to the game developers PLEASE make an offline mode! games that can be played one player but still needs online is silly and looses some fanbase who cant play due to rubbish internet. i love this game and have hundreds of hours in the first game, so far i got to level 4 on this during which time i was kicked about 10 times in 3 hours before loosing my patiance. i will play this again one day hopfully the game devs will make it offline, at which point i will more than happily change my review and let it consume my life like the first one did.

								Was good when my friends and I first played it but after coming back to later they have nerfed every good weapon in the game, removed skill spheres, made inventories a hassel to deal with, reset and redone leveling, made towers useless, and added a bunch of uselessâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥that nobody wanted or needed. Dungeon Defenders is supposed to be a laid back casual game where you set up a good defense and only help towers on especially hard levels. Now with 4 lvl. 50 characters previously able to solo The Buried Bastille without broken dlc characters *cough* Abyss Lord *cough* I can now barely make it through the first couple of levels on normal difficulty without having to babysit my defenses.Also unless I have overlooked something, they have completely removed fireball towers from the game and made them all â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ flamethrower towers that nobody ever liked or wanted to use. Rating pre-Lavamancer release: 8/10Rating post-Lavamancer release: Personally I would rate it at most 5/10			"

								Ever wonders what a game is like when the focus on getting cool items in order to survive only to spin it around to where items are only 10% of your character within 6 months of gameplay? Look no further for now you can play a game where all your hours are wasted and the core concepts are rotated on a 6 month basis.  Now for the second part to hopefully captivate you, creatures that are immune to attacks from the front specifically lead the charge while a conga line stream of enemies file in close behind to make a difficult concept even worse (the new update added the shield goblins).  So please enjoy collecting medals and grinding maps to get expierince instead of items which will only be completely changed waisting the majority of the time that you invest in the game and remember Alpha is the new Beta.Spoiler- If you were to take a roleplaying game and make it where every level required 1000 exp points to earn and each MAP earned you 1 exp point this would be what you would get, it's basically a 2 tier leveling system, in the beginning they treat levels like normal games then after 50 you now have ""infinite"" growth IE complete a hard map to get enough exp for 1 ""ascension"" level and the focus is on grinding your character and not on items.

								This game is a perfect example of what happens when a dev team makes a really good game and then decides to get greedy and make a freemium sequel. In order to get any characters except for the first 4, you have to log in a solid 20+ hours across several days to get the currency you need for them from daily missions, or simply do what they want and buy premium currency. Along with that, the daily missions suckâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ You'd expect things like ""deal x amount of damage within 10 seconds in a match"" or ""kill x enemies with y character"" but nope, the only daily missions are ""beat x maps of this theme"" It's utterly stupid. On top of that, in the first dungeon defenders game, it actually mattered that you leveled each character up, got good equipment, and played your towers correctly. Now none of that really matters. All of your characters level up together now, which makes leveling up completely pointless at all. And then to actually do anything you have to ""level up further"" through ascension which is actually completely stupid. On top of that, the level cap for you and items is 50  (although I've never seen an item above lvl 46), and in order for any equipment to do jackâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥it needs to be upgraded, and all new equipment starts from 0. This game is an absolutelyâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥poor sequel to the first game, which was actually really good. Now, it's just a greedy company trying to get money.Oh, and one last note: the devs don't know how to balance forâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the game is absolutely FILLED with bugs and optimized horribly. I shouldn't be teleporting across my PRIVATE TAVERN when I'm BY MYSELF. Having lag when playing alone is horrendous. Oh, and the dev teams attitude towards patches sucks too. They literally will say ""we know x bug exists, but we'll address that in the next patch."" That's aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥poor attitude towards the literal stability of the game.Last thing I want to mention: the campaign is really â¥â¥â¥â¥ing easy and doesn't require all the extra â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t I mentioned earlier. The campaign doesn't need you to upgrade your equipment 30+ levels to do anything, and it's easy enough to where the ""balance"" the devs try to make doesn't hurt you. The campaign itself is fun. Really fun. And it's worth going through some lag to play. I'd give the campaign experience an 8/10. The problem is that the campaign is like 15% of the game itself, where the rest of it is post game â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t that requires ungodly ammounts of grinding. If you're interested in this game at all, then I definitely recommend trying it and playing the campaign, because it's worth it. After that though, just stop and play something else, because there's nothing after the campaign worth trying to do.			"

								After posting a positive review on this game, i have decided to delete it and give it another review altho this time its not so positive.I would say that this game was once good and fun. But updates happened, trials update was fun but then it started to go downhill, the developers are idiots, as someone who has put some cash on ""Gems"" for all the characters (Only because i thought it would be good to help them out), sadly i wish i could refund thatâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥back as its not worth it. As much as this is a F2P game, give it a few more months and it will end up either being P2W game or just dead. Recent update has started going in the right direction (Till sping update) which has made the game crap as hell.The developers were told about the issues but they decided to start removing comments regarding (Major issues), so to put it short, if you plan to play this don't expect too much from it or from the developers.

Early Access Review
								Okay, I tried to give this game a fair chance. I really did. Even through the almost 3K bad reviews on it since release. This isn't even I great game and it's a shame since I loved the first one so much(Still no DLC on console version and I want TE to know that people who have console version of DD1 aren't thrilled about no DLC and the vow to not release any).Now that my mini rant about the company's past mistakes is over, I can say what I think of this game. This game has a unique option to change characters at any time(Provided you have the hero card required). This game also is not as much about strategically placing towers to save the crystal and leave sides covered as DD1 is. This game is more about how much damage your character can do. Towers are still useful but games can be completed without them. When this game first came out, I knew immediatley it was going to be about the money as the PREVIEWS AND TRAILERS spoke about the MICROTRANSACTIONS. Granted this game is free but it could've been much better without the microtransactions and money grubbing. DD2 tries hard to be DD1 but different and ""better"" but the better part did not happen. This game, once again, is free and I have to tone down my displeasure due to it being free intentionally, however, it does not excuse this game from being one of my least favorite games despite its precursor being one of my all time favorites and I own two copies, one on PC and the other on console. Overall I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. TE, if any of you read this, I loved the first game completely even with its occasional bugs but this one just isn't as fun as the first. If this game actually gets better, I'll definitely change my rating because I loved DD1 and want to love DD2 but I just can't with how it is.NOTE: You can get almost everything in this game for free, such as the other heroes, but the prices of the heroes were increased 5x(2000 coins to 10000) so if you get this game and want anything, put on your grinding boots and hope you're lucky.TL;DR:This game has many problems. The first game is better, get that instead even though it's not free and this one is. Trust me.The rating would be lower but I have a soft spot for this series and I believe TE can learn from their mistakes. If they don't, the company could die but hopefully they'll prove me wrong.I'll change my rating if the game gets better and TE learns from what the community dislikes.Overall Not Recommended: 4/10To TE if they read this:It's not about quantity of what you release, it's how much you care about the game. This DD2 makes it seem like all you want is money due to the TRAILERS talking about the microtransactions, something every gamer hates. It seems like this game was rushed to be released and meant to rake in money instead of be fun for the community. I love DD1 and hope DD2 will turn out as good at some point but that probably won't happen. I appreciate the bug fixes and whatnot which are regularly released but the main problem of the game was how rushed it seemed. I got this game shortly after release(If I remember correctly) and it was so full of bugs and glitches that it seemed like it had not even been test played beyond the menus. All in all, I hope you, TE, do well with this game. Some heroes seem weird, one seems almost copy-pasted, and there isn't much variety beyond the one guy who has tactical abilities and everyone else has damaging everything besides the monk. I, personally was hoping for the Harlequin to be re-made though I had never played as that class due to it being $3 and I have no money but based off of what I had seen of that class, it looks to be extemely fun to play even if it is extremely diffcult. Well, I'll end my review here.I'll come back to the game to see what has changed within the next year or so and update my review then if I deem it needs updating.			"

								Pro's: -If you have a group of friends, its a very fun well crafted tower defense game.Con's: -To unlock the rest of the characters available in the game you either farm for an estimate 3~5 months, get lucky and gain some gems from their on stream giveways and maybe get enough gems to buy a character, OR buy gems in a total value of 95â¬'s just to unlock the rest of the 6 character's. -Even if you do spend the ridiculous amount of money on it or grind out the 3~5 months just to unlock the other character's, you might get one of their famous Lost Connection type of bugs, that will plague you until you have a mental breakdown and either delete the game or re-instal it in hopes that it will fix the issue, which it may, or may not, depends on how Trendy Entertainment feels like that day.

								I'll go straight ahead:Pros:-Graphics are alright;-Runs as smooth as butter in a less than average PC.Cons:-Bugs are taking forever to be fixed;-Good weapons and combinations are always nerfed;-The devs seem to be really interested in making us players farm for the rest of our lives for crappy gear;-This game has no progression at all;-Bought this game on early access while it was not f2p and received enough crystals to buy just two characters;-Microtransactions are painfully expensive;-The UI was changed three times already and it's still really confusing and misleading on matters like levelling up characters, pets and gear;Conclusion:Devs, you should listen to your community.It would've been better if you were to follow DD1's footsteps and it's approach on DLC. Although it was nearly impossible to play the first game without DLC characters, they were cheap and everyone used to buy them. Maps were far more memorable and new content was always highly anticipated.As a matter of fact, I've enjoyed playing DD2 on it's first year, but things have come to a point that this game is nearly unplayable and you are losing more players each day.

								I would have recommended this game before the Trails Update ruined the game. It alienated the people who invested time to grind out armor in the original game by givingâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥gems wilth little variety. There is A lot less individuality.Before:-You could have two of the same charaters with different builds, encouraging you to try different play styles for the same Character.-The Armor you received scaled the towers and charater to different builds. Allowing you to look for the gear that suits that individual charaters build (Tank, DPS, Wall, Tower DMG, Slow Tower, Debuff Tower, Anti Air) allowing for alot more grinding.-the game allowed for coordination with indiviual tower specing.Now:-You only need one Character (per Class) Because each tower is buffed by its own Talisman/Relic and your armor and weapon scale your health and damage. (Eliminating the Mulit character grinding and individual Tower Specing)-If Everyone is DPS, and Every Tower Speced where is the Individuality?-No one Needs to coordinate because everyone is speced to cover entire Lanes without help.Current Complaints:-The Mini Sheilds are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t (They Block the Phonix from the archer completely Ruining her Wave clear. The Seige Rollers dont do that)-The Gems NEED to Stack if they are the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ing GEM.- Past Players are going to need more incentive to restart the entire game then theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥tier gems provided for Max level Gear. At Item Level 750 I could not play against Chaos 2 Because of the garbage gear I received. Other Comments:-I was a Fan of the Idea of Gems (Another thing to grind great!)-All of the new enemies I was happy with, besides the shield minions, If the sheild had health and could break awesome and instead of stopping any projectile that hits it.Misc:When is this game getting out of Alpha it came out in 2014?

								I really do enjoy this game and I think it's a quirky fusion of RPG and tower defense. Is it better than Sanctum 2? Are you kidding me, Sanctum 2 is amazing and it's the game that pulled me into tower defense fusion and DD2 doesn't have what it takes to rival it. For now. Does it have potential? Yes. Here are some of the things I think can be looked into.- Rubberbanding: it's extremely infuriating to navigate around maps where you can fall off and it's so easy to die when rubberbands exist.- Unclear boss location: It would be beneficial to highlight where the boss mob(s) is/are going to appear from and perhaps apply different colour on the minimap. It's easy to lose the red symbol of the boss in the middle of trash mobs.- Tower range: Add a feature so that you can see on the minimap the range that each tower has- Build view assistance: Perhaps add a keybind for birds-eye view during build phase?- Characters: Add personality to the characters, maybe some quirky dialogues or banter between the characters present- Taunt/emote: Nuff said			"

								16/11/2016 In 10 hours of gameplay, I've succeeded in leveling 3 characters to 50 (Max level) and finished the campaign. The game itself is fun and I guarantee that it'll be more fun to play with friends.However, there are a few things I'd like to note. 1) Infinite loading screens2) Game is already running bug3) FPS dropsThe first problem appears randomly. Sometimes you load to town successfully, sometimes you don't. You're then forced to ALT+F4 and you might think you're able to try again. Wrong.Here's where the second problem starts. When you relaunch the game and click Play, there will be a 'Game is already running' bug. There's nothing on task manager and the only fix to this is by verifying game cache and restarting the computer.Last but not least, FPS drops. I'm running i7-4720HQ 2.60GHz, 8 GB Ram and GeForce GTX 970m.I'm left to disable all video settings and set texture quality to medium because there are times where FPS drops even in town.All in all, without all these bugs and problems, it's still a fun game. Could be better.			"

								This game is great for those who love strategy and tower defence, early on the game can be hard to learn but once you start getting more heroes and learning from the community it becomes alot more fun. updates are very frequent as of recently so new content comes out quickly. Right now the difficulty of the game is pretty low but they are planning to revamp the enemies and make planning out tower placements and which to use in certain situations alot more important. Once you get to endgame it pretty much becomes a gear grind but its never really gotten old for me but that might just be me.			"

								Got this to play with a friend and all I can say is that this is how a good tower defense game is supposed to look like. Classes are balanced, the player base is mostly cooperative, lots of maps to choose from. I'd say lack of appearance customization or the massive junk loot is a bit of a drawback, I rate 8/10			"

								I loved playing this game when it was first released for early access as I was a huge fan of the original. All that was lacking was content and replayability.I came back to the game recently and it's a mess now. Although there are more missions and content to play the community is extremely small so it's hard to find groups, and even less item drops. Too much for purchase DLC for a game that is still marked as early access.			"

								TL;DR It's not too bad to play if you can look past the p2w, just don't spend money on it. Not worth it.I've played for a long time, just not always on this steam account specifically. It's a geniunely good game, great concepts and all that. But it is leaning to that p2w side of things with microtransactions and overpriced heros and kits. It's great as a free game, but seriously, don't waste your money on it. They improved from the first dungeon defenders, but they're not quite there yet. The pay to win is ruining the teamwork and skill elements because if you have enough case, you don't need to work with people or have any skill.Plus it's been early access for at least a year by now? Probably longer. It wasn't even always Free to play either, it cost $50 at one point. But seeing as now it's free, it's not too much of a waste of time,  there still room to enjoy the game to a degree. But I have a lack of free time, so I play it maybe once or twice a week? Maybe if you play it every day, you'll get sick of it sooner.			"

								damnit dd2 why.so when this first came out i really liked it i even bought the pack to get into early access but now jesus where do i start.cons.ridiculous amount of farming for a new character also the currency used to buy the character itself is also used to buy the characters ability orbs. im fine with f2p farming but this is a bit much.enemies are currently weak ... if you use the unlock characters, they are going to buff both the base 4 characters and monsters but that seems a bit away at this point.locked playstyles so anyone remember the bonus you got in dd1 for letting defenses do everything? ya even if that were in game it would be impossible... without abyss lord because he has the range to counter an enemy whos entire point is to be dealt with by playerspets are now ... meh at best RIP kobold on treadmill we knew thee well.so heres the good stuff.DEMOCRACY REIGNS, basically just by opening dd2 you get a point that you can use to vote on what thing you want next it could be a map new characters or it could be various other things i like this system a lot it does have some wierd things in how it works. (though i dont want barbarian i do feel sorry for those who do want him)actually starting to shape into something nice at this point its going away from the ""you must have all heroes on your team even solo to be able to win later on"" and going back to very powerfull heroes that can work together which i like.secondary part to the above new heroes look to be doing some pretty interesting things all around i can only hope the base 4 get to be just as cool when they get buffedfarming up levels on new characters is really easy now so you can powerlevel to your hearts contentoverall right now the game is aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥show with several things transitioning i really want it to be good but right now it just isnt sadly			"

								I really do enjoy this game and I think it's a quirky fusion of RPG and tower defense. Is it better than Sanctum 2? Are you kidding me, Sanctum 2 is amazing and it's the game that pulled me into tower defense fusion and DD2 doesn't have what it takes to rival it. For now. Does it have potential? Yes. Here are some of the things I think can be looked into.- Rubberbanding: it's extremely infuriating to navigate around maps where you can fall off and it's so easy to die when rubberbands exist.- Unclear boss location: It would be beneficial to highlight where the boss mob(s) is/are going to appear from and perhaps apply different colour on the minimap. It's easy to lose the red symbol of the boss in the middle of trash mobs.- Tower range: Add a feature so that you can see on the minimap the range that each tower has- Build view assistance: Perhaps add a keybind for birds-eye view during build phase?- Characters: Add personality to the characters, maybe some quirky dialogues or banter between the characters present- Taunt/emote: Nuff said			"

								16/11/2016 In 10 hours of gameplay, I've succeeded in leveling 3 characters to 50 (Max level) and finished the campaign. The game itself is fun and I guarantee that it'll be more fun to play with friends.However, there are a few things I'd like to note. 1) Infinite loading screens2) Game is already running bug3) FPS dropsThe first problem appears randomly. Sometimes you load to town successfully, sometimes you don't. You're then forced to ALT+F4 and you might think you're able to try again. Wrong.Here's where the second problem starts. When you relaunch the game and click Play, there will be a 'Game is already running' bug. There's nothing on task manager and the only fix to this is by verifying game cache and restarting the computer.Last but not least, FPS drops. I'm running i7-4720HQ 2.60GHz, 8 GB Ram and GeForce GTX 970m.I'm left to disable all video settings and set texture quality to medium because there are times where FPS drops even in town.All in all, without all these bugs and problems, it's still a fun game. Could be better.			"

								This game is great for those who love strategy and tower defence, early on the game can be hard to learn but once you start getting more heroes and learning from the community it becomes alot more fun. updates are very frequent as of recently so new content comes out quickly. Right now the difficulty of the game is pretty low but they are planning to revamp the enemies and make planning out tower placements and which to use in certain situations alot more important. Once you get to endgame it pretty much becomes a gear grind but its never really gotten old for me but that might just be me.			"

So honestly if you want a new DD experience check it out, if you want a full game with a new story and purpose this isn't for you. If the microtransactions go away and they make it Pay 2 Play I'll change my review...https://www.youtube.com/c/vezatir "

Like it's predecessor it has the elements of what makes a good tower-defense game.However, Dungeon Defenders II features a all new competitive mode which I've yet to tried out. (to be updated)Overall, I'd say its feels just like Dungeon Defenders,  the environment is much more beautiful to look at and the community is more lively which is a plus.It's a great game that I would recommend to veterans / new players to the tower-defense genre.

								The game was amazing and fun to play, untill the ruined it. The last big updates changed the game for the worst. All that i've farmed all that i acomplished is worthless now. And what do i get? A bunch of useless shards. Is that what i desurve? Is that what we desurve? For what we've done for this game till now? I don't know if i'll ever go back to this game again. Couse i don't like my work to be underpriced like this. For the question why do i even bother writing this is just for that little hope that maybe, the game will go back to normal, when it was fun to play, when you spend hours with random people and just have fun. But now it's gone and i don't know if it will ever come back. For those who are thinking should you play this game i'm not gonna tell you no, but remember that who knows what will happen in the futcher. Play at your own risk. That's all im going to say, have fun if you can.			"

								Dungeon Defenders 2 is one of the few sequels that, in my opinion, is better than part one. I like the way the makers stuck the idea of a tower defense rpg, improved a lot of things, but at the same time brought back some old dungeons and nostalgia. I like the fact that this is a great multiplayer game since the best way to win is using the symbiosis of multiple classes and builds. That doesn't mean you can't play it on your own, if you grind enough and you are lucky to have the currently overpowered character you can easily play it on your own. But it's only the beginning and although slowly the game and characters are getting balanced regularly. Well, what I didn't like is the insane speed in which new classes were released at some point. There are two ways to get them, by playing a lot and collecting rewards or by buying them. For someone who is not planning to play this game on a daily or weekly basis the pace of changes might not be enjoyable. Some times I would have wished for more new working maps than characters, but since most of them are out now I'm hoping for more content in the future. And since I've been playing from the start I lived through my share of bugs and glitches, but I expexted that from the beta. Good things take some time, just like getting used to this hybrid will.I really like the graphics and the animation with love for little details. I appreciate that it is not a pay-to-win game and that most things available are cosmetic and can be unlocked by playing. I like that there are multiple ways to play a map, incursion, difficulties... And also maps on which you have to do more than be afk like the bling king. By now they have improved the lobby making by far, but at the same time used people's egos against the community since its harder to join a high-end game with bad equipment. If you ever need a little boost, let me know, I think the community needs this in order to live and prosper. Which brings me to my number 1 rule for beginners: fill your deck, make as many characters as possible, symbiosis is the key. You can always make more, but you need builders for the tower defense and also damage heroes for the rpg part. Overall a great game that takes some getting used to for most rpg players but guarentees a lot of fun :)			"

								this is a tower defense game that you can control a hero and each hero have different towers you can construct to defend the thing you need to gaurd. your heroes have 4 set abilities that they use to kill enemies and 4 different types of towers. the towers requires green gems to build that you can get when enemies dies and in gem chests at the beginning of each wave. you can change heroes anytime you want. If you are playing solo you can organize the defense to anything you want, which towers you want and where they go. in coop mode you get paired up with 3 other people and the green gems get divided up among you all.

								Dungeon Defenders 2 is one of the few sequels that, in my opinion, is better than part one. I like the way the makers stuck the idea of a tower defense rpg, improved a lot of things, but at the same time brought back some old dungeons and nostalgia. I like the fact that this is a great multiplayer game since the best way to win is using the symbiosis of multiple classes and builds. That doesn't mean you can't play it on your own, if you grind enough and you are lucky to have the currently overpowered character you can easily play it on your own. But it's only the beginning and although slowly the game and characters are getting balanced regularly. Well, what I didn't like is the insane speed in which new classes were released at some point. There are two ways to get them, by playing a lot and collecting rewards or by buying them. For someone who is not planning to play this game on a daily or weekly basis the pace of changes might not be enjoyable. Some times I would have wished for more new working maps than characters, but since most of them are out now I'm hoping for more content in the future. And since I've been playing from the start I lived through my share of bugs and glitches, but I expexted that from the beta. Good things take some time, just like getting used to this hybrid will.I really like the graphics and the animation with love for little details. I appreciate that it is not a pay-to-win game and that most things available are cosmetic and can be unlocked by playing. I like that there are multiple ways to play a map, incursion, difficulties... And also maps on which you have to do more than be afk like the bling king. By now they have improved the lobby making by far, but at the same time used people's egos against the community since its harder to join a high-end game with bad equipment. If you ever need a little boost, let me know, I think the community needs this in order to live and prosper. Which brings me to my number 1 rule for beginners: fill your deck, make as many characters as possible, symbiosis is the key. You can always make more, but you need builders for the tower defense and also damage heroes for the rpg part. Overall a great game that takes some getting used to for most rpg players but guarentees a lot of fun :)			"

								TL;DR It's not too bad to play if you can look past the p2w, just don't spend money on it. Not worth it.I've played for a long time, just not always on this steam account specifically. It's a geniunely good game, great concepts and all that. But it is leaning to that p2w side of things with microtransactions and overpriced heros and kits. It's great as a free game, but seriously, don't waste your money on it. They improved from the first dungeon defenders, but they're not quite there yet. The pay to win is ruining the teamwork and skill elements because if you have enough case, you don't need to work with people or have any skill.Plus it's been early access for at least a year by now? Probably longer. It wasn't even always Free to play either, it cost $50 at one point. But seeing as now it's free, it's not too much of a waste of time,  there still room to enjoy the game to a degree. But I have a lack of free time, so I play it maybe once or twice a week? Maybe if you play it every day, you'll get sick of it sooner.			"

								damnit dd2 why.so when this first came out i really liked it i even bought the pack to get into early access but now jesus where do i start.cons.ridiculous amount of farming for a new character also the currency used to buy the character itself is also used to buy the characters ability orbs. im fine with f2p farming but this is a bit much.enemies are currently weak ... if you use the unlock characters, they are going to buff both the base 4 characters and monsters but that seems a bit away at this point.locked playstyles so anyone remember the bonus you got in dd1 for letting defenses do everything? ya even if that were in game it would be impossible... without abyss lord because he has the range to counter an enemy whos entire point is to be dealt with by playerspets are now ... meh at best RIP kobold on treadmill we knew thee well.so heres the good stuff.DEMOCRACY REIGNS, basically just by opening dd2 you get a point that you can use to vote on what thing you want next it could be a map new characters or it could be various other things i like this system a lot it does have some wierd things in how it works. (though i dont want barbarian i do feel sorry for those who do want him)actually starting to shape into something nice at this point its going away from the ""you must have all heroes on your team even solo to be able to win later on"" and going back to very powerfull heroes that can work together which i like.secondary part to the above new heroes look to be doing some pretty interesting things all around i can only hope the base 4 get to be just as cool when they get buffedfarming up levels on new characters is really easy now so you can powerlevel to your hearts contentoverall right now the game is aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥show with several things transitioning i really want it to be good but right now it just isnt sadly			"

								Fun with a group of friends, but not that great for soloing unless you are willing to create multiple characters. Much like Dungeon Defenders 1, interactions between towers and the involvement of the player brings a new variable to what would otherwise be a traditional tower defense game. Average run length for each map is much shorter compared to DD1 (about 20-30min vs 1hour+) and the game overall is quite short, though there is decent replay value. Visuals and gameplay mechanis are much improved but the high degree of customizability that I loved from DD1 is reduced. Relatively a worthwhile purchase.			"

								Dungeon Defenders 2 is a fun free to play game, with the option to ""pay to get ahead"". While at first glance when in game it may seem like new characters are inaccessible, that's a short term examination of the game. If every game only took two or three days, even a week to get everything in the game, you would stop playing. To start with everyone gets 4 character slots (assuming the player wants one of each class). Each character levels up when in your deck (4 hero slots, oh look less grind work) meaning when you start off and create one of each character (or whatever config you like) your first 4 heroes will reach maximum level at the same time. Simple beginnings no? After this comes getting good gear by playing endgame maps (working your way up the nightmare ladder). While you play however, you are also completing dailies, weeklies (monthlies will probably come back in a bit) and gaining defender medals. These medals can be used to unlock new characters (12000 the first two weeks for new heroes, 10000 afterwards, may eventually change) purchase special boosters (like pet love), keys (for the non paid costume and seasonal costume chests), powerful skill spheres, character slots (2000 each) or eggs (not quite yet, they are working on it). While characters might sound pricy, if you like the game you will easily play long enough to quickly obtain them and then be left wondering ""what do i spend it on next?"" The estimated time to obtain a new character at present is 3-4 weeks if your a brand new player that hasn't done any dailies. However they intend to boost the daily reward for a time from 150-250 per quest to 225 - 450 meaning that 3-4 weeks could be much shorter depending how often you play and events you participate in, giving any newbies a chance to jump headfirst in and get to the heroes they want. Overall, yes it's in Alpha, it's not the most polished or perfect game, but its damn good fun and they are working hard to make it not a product or service, but an experience that will entertain and spread enjoyment. They are aiming for 120 heroes, 6 down and 5 in the works, avg release time is one month inbetween characters. Every other week seems to be a release or event of some sort, not including special medal boosting weekends. This is my overview and recommendation of the game, hope it helps sway you in favour.			"

								As of right now, it is lag nation... And since there is no single player option, even when playing solo you still LAG, its quite â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ indeed. Its an awesome game other then the lag though, so I will still recomend this beauty, just FIX THE LAG! Please :) Some of the pros: Loot, lots and lots and lots of loots, and its not like you get amazing op gear fast, so its more like you have to work to get decent gear, which I personally enjoy. Visually, this game is a real beauty in comparison to its predecessor. Four diverse classes to choose from, and the ability to choose how you wish to play. You can focus your skill points into your character, or your characters defences (towers) or even go for a balanced build.Cons: Already toxic community, but thats every f2p game right? Lag, but again, thats expected from an initial alpha launch of a f2p game. Lack of offline single player same with the lack of LAN play, this is a HUGE con for me as this is how I play 90% of the games I play, with my wife on LAN. "

								I feel that the developers really do care about this game and that they work really hard to make it good, but they can't design a game forâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥I paid for this game pre-alpha because I loved the first dungeon defenders and I did everything that I could do in the game at that time (like 4 hours of content). I've come back after every major update but I keep getting dissapointed. They've changed loot and progression a few times, but it's arguably at its worst now.There are even more problems Bad netcode, always online, servers keep timing out, confusing item and character progression, annoying controls, boring characters and more.Wait until its finished, and don't buy early access games.

								I'm surprised, to be honest. I bought every single bit of game changing content the previous Dungeon Defenders had, and loved the characters all the way. This dungeon defenders, though? It's a breed bought in microcontent and not even close to the original's quality. I am willing, nay eager, to pay $30-40 for a sequel - but I refuse to pay for gems, points, or widgets to make a lackluster base engine shine enough to make this work. From my play experience, I swear, it's like they farmed out design and even sensibility to a foreign country for cutthroat rates. I haven't spent a dime on the sequel, but I'm willing to chip in a fiver to pay for the tombstone of tedium for this developer group.			"

								I Don't know why people are giving this game alot of hate, it's a free tower defense game that you can play with friends.  Sure the DLC cost is stupidly expensive but there's 4 different characters you can play for free and another character you can buy with ingame cash meaning that you don't need the DLC to make this game a good game it is already a good game.  With that being said me and my two friends played this game till the end doing every mission from the story to the hardest missions and we all had a blast.			"

								Great Tower Defense with a lot of freedom. Played it with some friends, had some fun.Heroes can be played various ways, tower defense, dps, one of my friends went tanky knight. I especially like the freedom of tower placement. You can place towers almost anywhere in the most bonkers placers. MIght not be efficient, but fun. In contrast to let's say Orcs Must Die where trap placement is restricted to certain places more or less (though a good game on it's own). Difficulty was alright. The beginning was really easy. Depending on the amount of people you play with it gets harder as you progress (we were not powergamers who let themselves get carried, so if you do that you might skip difficulties entirely). Overall a great game. The only thing it is lacking are maps. There are some server issues but apart from long loading times there wasn't anything serious. D3 had more performance problems than this game.There is some criticism that I think is unfair and I want to adress it from my point of view.Some say overpowered characters are locked behind a paywall. In my opinion this is simply not true. Apart from a business perspective (it's free to play afterall) we found the gathering of ingame currency quite easy. There are daily quests and can stock up 3 of them + weekly quests. The lowest amount of currency for a quest is 275 (you can reroll a quest). You need 10000 to unlock a new character. So in 30 days logging in 10 times you should have a new character.So in my humble opinion anyone who thinks this is a paywall or considers this grinding has never played a game with actual paywalls In fact while I write this review I doing my daily quests on a low level map almost completely afk.While these new characters are really strong they don't lock other characters out from content. We did all content perfectly fine with the original 4 heroes. There is a balance patch coming in a few days that is supposed to bring the old heroes on par with the new ones. I really like this approach. Other developers opt for the other way. For example Path of Exile (a Diablo-esque grind ARPG) does the exact opposite. They nerf their content until it is no longer playable.We were satisfied. It was fun and we are sure to check back when there is more content.PS: Yes, the store prices are bonkers and I hope they restructure them once they get more content rolling out. "

								Take this review (like you should with all reviews) with a grain of salt. I played Dungeon Defenders 1 back in the day on the Playstation with my bro and enjoyed it greatly. When DD2 was announced, I had a trip of nostalglia back ot the good ol' days. Initially, I got a chance for early access and didn't really like what I saw. There was so many issues with it, it wasnt worth the time or effort to play.Fast forward, I'm now playing this game with my bf and his friends and I really enjoy the game again. Its really not a game for lengthy play throughs though. I get easily bored of the same maps after a while and can predict where all the major issues with waves come into play.That being said, its still a great game and still a good strategy tester. I even love the predictability of the waves which allow me to mess around with different characters and their tower strategy. This game has room to grow and has shown that it can grow. Dungeon Defenders will always have a spot on my game shelf.			"

After a couple emails and sending them a crash report, the response I received was that I was basically S.O.L. and that I would have to wait for a full release version for them to fix my problem. I'm pretty disappointed in this response. Hopefully others are not having the same problems, and I am definitely surprised as my system uses recent components.			"

								When I played Dungeon Defenders 1 on the X-box 360 I enjoyed it, until it came to multiplayer and experienced nothing but hackers and modders. However here in Dungeon Defenders 2 I can honestly say that I have found my new haven in the video game community. In my first week of playing I felt all of the nostalgia from DD1 rush back. I quit many other games that I had invested (easily) hundreds of dollars in, to start this game and dedicate myself to the immersive game play that Trendy (and Etheria, the Realm they created) are known for. The game is, hands down, on the top of my list for games. I have invested (proudly, I might add) to the continuation of this games developement. This is the open Alpha, and there is nowhere to go but up for this game.Obviously, the game is Grind intensive, but you get out of this game what you put in. In my first week I had 5 level 50's and 700 iPwr on each of them.Overall, I heavily recommend DD2. I hope that our friends here at Trendy continue the great work and continue to amaze us with new content. Happy Hunting!			"

								ungodlyâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ servers, you load in without being able to open the box if you are in someones party, sometimes when you get disconnected and try to rejoin a party you enter with a phantom you in the party and fall continuously into infinity. You will have to exit the entire game and relog in to fix it.	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ server coding that makes you use so much bandwidth to access any games it actually borks itself and makes you get a connection issue even after you are in the game. You can also get a match making error that pops up when you try to leave a party. So...yes. You get a connection issues for leaving the server host? ha. When you are in a game and change characters it has a random occurance to kick you out and tell you your login session expired and you have to restart the game to play. It will also do this on other occurances that tell you someone else is logged into your account. Sometimes your spheres won't equip and the network inconsistency makes it so you have to try and try until it works. When you switch characters some of the previous models will be stuck inside the other characters.There are a million problems with this game yet content is being released over the absolute nonexistence of server stability. For a game on unreal you would expect it to run better, but no. No it doesn't. Needless to say there is alot of content to observe! This is the kind of roller coaster of a game where it's so fun you go again even though the sick guy in the front keeps puking all over everyone. when you are ending a map and getting the chest if you change characters it has a 3in5 chance to randomely kill you.

								Fun with a group of friends, but not that great for soloing unless you are willing to create multiple characters. Much like Dungeon Defenders 1, interactions between towers and the involvement of the player brings a new variable to what would otherwise be a traditional tower defense game. Average run length for each map is much shorter compared to DD1 (about 20-30min vs 1hour+) and the game overall is quite short, though there is decent replay value. Visuals and gameplay mechanis are much improved but the high degree of customizability that I loved from DD1 is reduced. Relatively a worthwhile purchase.			"

								The game had potential.The problem is the devs are trying to distinguish DD2 away from DD1 even though DD1 was a beloved game.  Unfortunately this has lead to removing many of the fans favorite things from DD1 and focusing on things in DD2 that are not being well received.Unfortunately with the most recent update, they have doubled down on the things the population seems to dislike.  It is simple.  Increase difficulty that counters the player, not adding difficulty that counter playable content (towers).  So many buildables are now useless.  People want this to be a tower defense game, not an action adventure game with a side of tower component.  I had hopes they would get it right with the recent update, and while I think the shards and ascension were a good addition, the new mobs, rebalancing decisions, and overall design/direction have truly hurt, if not destroyed, my future with the game.I held out for as long as I could.

								Developer: Trendy Ent.Publisher: Trendy Ent.Genre: Action Tower DefenceThe emperor of the Action Tower Defence games is back. Help your friends, build towers, auras and traps; repair and upgrade 'em. Get back to endless waves ofâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥kicking fun!In the first installation of the series, we were playing as the Little Defenders ( sons and daughters of the real heroes). These little heroes defended the Eternia Crystals and put an end to the Evil's plans but just when these littlelings lost all their power and hopes at the end of the first game, their beloved parents came to rescue at the right time and defeat the evil of the evillest.With Dungeon Defenders II, the developers giving us the ""Real"" heroes and their real adventures. Oracular graphics, incredible character models and wondrously designed maps and gameplay mechanics that mostly operating like cogwheels; these are also what they are throwing at us. And as a Early Access it stand out like a sore thumb among others.Lets start with seperating facts of DD1 and DD2:-DD1 adopted the simplest co-op game formula; buy the game and its â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of DLC's. DD 2 will be free when it is released ( People who bought the game before f2p release get cosmetic items, in-game crystals for costumes and some other premium gifts)-DD1 has cell-shade and simple graphics. DD2's graphics are resembling a good animation movie, it has cartoon/animation like graphic concept.-DD1 use mana as currency, DD 2 differentiate mana and currency. Now we have gold coins $$.-DD1 just have 1-2 basic costume per character and you need to buy DLCs for them. In DD2 we have evolving and much more detailed costumes ( even at this stage, there are many compared to DD1), which you can buy with real money currency.-DD1 has tons of DLCs, (it is not %100 clear but) developers thinking of earning money from cosmetic items like MOBA's and supporting the game with free expansions.-DD1 has offline private option. Ä°n DD2, you need to be online even though you are playing solo.Yes DD2 has core mechanics from the first installation; but it looks better on the surface, it feels better when you play it and it is much more refined than most of the other Early Access' and DD1. Let's get to pros and cons part:+ Will be F2P!+ Fantastic graphics and colour palette+ Refined gameplay mechanics ( developers are trying to make it much more stable )+ Developers that are listening to us.+ Good animations and rigging+ As a pre-alpha, it has less bugs than a lot of open beta phase games.+ Fun to play, get repetitive after some time but not boring.+ Except a few trolls, the community is awesome.+ Constant updates and hotfixes.- Minor graphical bugs- Some balance issues between classes- Pet system needs some work- 4 towers per character constrain some tactical elements- As of now, the content game has falls a little short.I think i managed to summerize what you can expect from the game at this stage. Hope it helps :)TL;DRGame is solid, but falls short on content. If you are not sure about buying this and haven't played the DD1 before, I suggest you to wait for it to be released for free.			"

								 I'm sorry I know I don't have too many hours in this game as it is but I played this game before the update made on 02/28/2017... I loved the game back then I was excited to play it but the new update literally killed this game for me! For instance one of my favorite towers was the Flameburst Tower. It did an excellent amount of damage and it did decent AOE when it hit. It was butchered to the Flamethrower Tower which now has pitiful range awful DPS and no AOE damage. The towers of the Apprentice pretty much stayed the same but now it just doesn't feel the same.  Next we have one of the other character's I loved to play the monk. His boost aura, Lightning Aura and Serenity aura were all must haves on the battle field. The Boost Aura allowed towers to become even more powerful and finish enemies quicker and easier!  The Serenity Aura healed team mates who were low on HP but didn't have enough time to get out of combat and heal up. The Lightning Aura was an AMAZING AOE tower that did a good amount of damage to anything inside of its aura. You could pair this up with the Barracade from the Squire and be set!  Now here's the thing... All three of those towers were amazing on their own... How did they screw it up? Change the previous Boost Aura to the Flame Aura, give it Lightning Aura's AOE effect but make it worse then what it did previously. Change the Serenity Aura to the NEW Boost Aura which gives pitiful amounts of boost to your towers. Seriously I couldn't tell the difference between a boosted and non-boosted tower! It's horrible! And then the kicker than may make me never want to touch Monk ever again, they change the Lightning Aura to the Lightning Strike aura... They got rid of the AOE storm damage of the amazing Lightning Aura tower and replaced it with a very slow, very unreliable, single strike tower. It doesn't do AOE and the damage it does if it even fires at all is awful! Why did they change what was so much fun to play in the first place?!  As I said they changed a lot in this patch already right? But there's one last thing they changed that I might never want to touch this game again because of... That would be the fact that they got rid of Skill Spheres, which were amazing in their boosts and quite useful in certain play styles, got rid of stat points, and replaced all of it with shards. SHARDS THAT GIVE SO LITTLE BOOSTS IN YOUR EQUIPMENT THAT THERE ARE NO NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCES WHATSOEVER!! They spat in my face when they refunded my Skill Spheres! This new shard system is not only confusing and doesn't help in the slightest but its also takes up so much inventory space! Granted you get a lot of inventory slots but that doesn't change the fact that Shards are useless with their minuscule stat boosts and their unappealing system.  Overall, this used to be a good game... I loved it so much and it was such an amazing one that I thought would last me a long time. The only reason I even got it was because of the Terraria crossover which was amazing. But after this recent update all my drive of playing this game again is gone. I'm sorry Trendy Entertainment but you butchered your game so much that I don't want to play it again until everything goes back to the way things were before the Endgame Update... They got rid of what Dungeon Defenders 2 fun and interesting to play for me... And that's something I just can't forgive.			"

								i really enjoyed this game but it is way too many bugs, like bugs to a point that i can't even logged in, keep searching for session, can't join next map after beating one dungeon, can't return to social hub, can't load game. Yes, I have experienced them all and I have only played 4 hours of this game. Developers, please listen to us, yes this game is fun when it works, but the bugs and server makes me so frustrated and you lost many of your players or potential income because of them. Please please please fix them please!			"

The passives were all removed from weapons with a replacement system called shards that socket into the gear pieces, sadly there is no list of shards and no information given about being able to return some of the effects that they gear pieces originally had removing even another layer of uniqueness from the game.

								Stopped playing this game before terraria update, the current update made me want to come back and check things out and like a lot of people I didn't read the patch notes about gear being changed to all hero type gear except for relics being tower gear. Honestly that doesn't bother me that much and them changing the meta was fine with me. Before the update I was one of those people who did use the pdt and serenity build and if I had to create a whole new build for this update I was absolutely fine with that but as of right now I wouldn't say the game is unplayable but I just don't feel that sense of progression or feel like im getting anywhere even though I had some ipwr 750 gear pre-update. My biggest gripe with the game currently is with offensive towers where they at this point really can't kill anything on even chaos 1 and in order to kill most enemies I have to dps them down with a hero. Now I am generally a solo player so me having to dps is normal anyway I rarely afk in my own game so having a dps is fine but as of right now with the offensive towers being as they are to where I am legitimately doing most the work is wrong for a tower defense game. One major gripe is defense range, I'm not saying that they should roll back to the defense range it was before the update but this currently needs to be looked at because this update was suppose to make it where any dps hero can also be a builder but with offensive towers being how they are this doesn't seem viable. Although there some towers that will work it like the AL ram tower and apprentice firethrower tower and couple other ones it feels like unless you use these towers or have the heroes other then the original four your out of luck. Another thing is the inventory currenlty needs to be reworked since right now it is too clunky and messy this isn't too much of problem though in honestly since they do have a search but still needs to be looked at.  As of right now I will still play but not as much as before and right now I can't recommend this game until they rebalance offensive towers and fix up the inventory UI.Contiuation after Patch 19.2:So before this hotfix I was able to clear c3 decently while dpsing solo with my gunwitch and using dryad world tree and nimbus, huntress pdt for anti air, and abyss lord ramsters. After this patch though they have made things worst and not what everything was wanting which was to make the other towers more viable again.Instead of getting tower buffs for the towers not being used we get a cost to upgrade nerf to the world tree, severe damage nerf to the nimbus and the standing near tower DP shard nerf, damage of PDT is even nerfed more with crit chance reduced. Also the emp orc they made it even worse seemingly increasing its emp range and making ti stun on every attack now. So now in terms of offensive tower the only viable towers seemingly are the ramster or the flamethrower, for blockade at this point I would say either use which ever you can get to highest HP and upgrade quick. In terms of anti air I don't even know because I was using PDT as my anti air but now you might have to switch to skyguard which has a pretty low attack range and that is with a good bit of range points in Ascension.So sum up this hotfix all it did was just nerf some viable towers even more and buff enemies. At this point I don't believe they are even listening to the community or even really addressing the feedback from the community. I was one of those that was hoping for better changes but with this update I have lost hope in what they believe are fixes and balances to their game.So based upon this hotfix I still will not recommend the game still unless towers become more viable and the only time I will spend on this game currently if at all is only on doing the medal daily or weekly only.

								When you click Reset to Default in the options, you'd think that it would only do the page you were on. Nope. It resets ALL your optiosns. Please change this. Also, for the love of the great gods above MAKE IT SO THAT CONSOLE IS REBINDABLE, I'M SICK OF PRESSING TAB FOR INVENTORY AND THEN GETTING THE CONSOLE.The only other thing I can complain about it the Dryad looking way too sexual, I meanâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ those hips are thicc. It's just kind of annoying seeing the over-sexualization.... And is it intentional that the Huntress appears to have jiggle mechanics? She's an A cup guys, and she looks like she has jiggle physics. wtfGame is very good, has potential, and controls pretty easily. It's also very beautiful, and despite the tutorial actually being kinda bad, it wasn't hard to figure out with some goofing around for like 5 minutes. It starts off very easy but I quickly started to have to be more thoughtful with my play style. I'd probably give this game an 8/10.  (9 if the controls and options get changed)			"

								 I'm sorry I know I don't have too many hours in this game as it is but I played this game before the update made on 02/28/2017... I loved the game back then I was excited to play it but the new update literally killed this game for me! For instance one of my favorite towers was the Flameburst Tower. It did an excellent amount of damage and it did decent AOE when it hit. It was butchered to the Flamethrower Tower which now has pitiful range awful DPS and no AOE damage. The towers of the Apprentice pretty much stayed the same but now it just doesn't feel the same.  Next we have one of the other character's I loved to play the monk. His boost aura, Lightning Aura and Serenity aura were all must haves on the battle field. The Boost Aura allowed towers to become even more powerful and finish enemies quicker and easier!  The Serenity Aura healed team mates who were low on HP but didn't have enough time to get out of combat and heal up. The Lightning Aura was an AMAZING AOE tower that did a good amount of damage to anything inside of its aura. You could pair this up with the Barracade from the Squire and be set!

								I liked the first Dungeon Defenders a lot. It's one of the most played games on my Steam account. I've only played a little bit of the sequel so far, but man, I am struggling to find any enjoyment in it.  The structure is mind-boggling. The focus on online/social taverns, extremely limited quick match options with no server browser, having to load back into the tavern in between every map in the campaign? What are the developers thinking? Forcing everyone to be online all the time and giving us no control over who we match up with leads to every game being half full of afk players or max level characters who are wiping the floor with the low level maps for some reason.At least when playing solo in a private game, I finally get to stop and look at the maps and use some strategy. But even then if I exit out of a map and try to do another one, I run into errors saying that I have made too many matchmaking attempts recently and to wait a few minutes. Can't even play the game alone. Thanks Trendy.I cannot recommend this game at all in its current state. If a loot and stat-based tower defense/action game sounds appealing to you, I would highly suggest playing the first game instead.			"

Another thing is the inventory currenlty needs to be reworked since right now it is too clunky and messy this isn't too much of problem though in honestly since they do have a search but still needs to be looked at.  As of right now I will still play but not as much as before and right now I can't recommend this game until they rebalance offensive towers and fix up the inventory UI.Contiuation after Patch 19.2:So before this hotfix I was able to clear c3 decently while dpsing solo with my gunwitch and using dryad world tree and nimbus, huntress pdt for anti air, and abyss lord ramsters. After this patch though they have made things worst and not what everything was wanting which was to make the other towers more viable again.Instead of getting tower buffs for the towers not being used we get a cost to upgrade nerf to the world tree, severe damage nerf to the nimbus and the standing near tower DP shard nerf, damage of PDT is even nerfed more with crit chance reduced. Also the emp orc they made it even worse seemingly increasing its emp range and making ti stun on every attack now. So now in terms of offensive tower the only viable towers seemingly are the ramster or the flamethrower, for blockade at this point I would say either use which ever you can get to highest HP and upgrade quick. In terms of anti air I don't even know because I was using PDT as my anti air but now you might have to switch to skyguard which has a pretty low attack range and that is with a good bit of range points in Ascension.So sum up this hotfix all it did was just nerf some viable towers even more and buff enemies. At this point I don't believe they are even listening to the community or even really addressing the feedback from the community. I was one of those that was hoping for better changes but with this update I have lost hope in what they believe are fixes and balances to their game.So based upon this hotfix I still will not recommend the game still unless towers become more viable and the only time I will spend on this game currently if at all is only on doing the medal daily or weekly only.

								This game would be great but....1.) you are constantly thrown in empty servers2.) the player base is full of people that don't understand strategy as basic as ""if you put up walls so they are forced to stand in a high damage AOE they will die quickly""3.) People constantly leave games if they aren't full, an absolute rarity 4.) Once people have left there is no way, that I have found yet, to easily report them. This goes for spamming, griefing, etc.5.) This is a game that should not be played alone. The same fun as playing an entirely dead MMO. GW1, my baby, i'm looking at you.IF these problems get fixed from alpha this will be a great game. Not too buggy and fun game play. I prefer the fantasy vibe, but Sanctum 2 is executed better IMO. If you are willing to hold out, do it. If you want fun now and not in an unknown amount of time, play Sanctum 2.			"

								Honestly, half the not recommend reviews are just plain stupid. The game is great and has no paywalls. New heroes? You can get them by playing the game! I know, shocking. And no - Just because you can't get something within 5 minutes doesn't mean it is bad. Oh and the DLC you see that may turn you off from the game? Not a single one is what I would count as ""True DLC"", 2 of them are for people who wish to support the game (Defender & Starter pack) and the other ones? Skins or bag slots. They aren't making new content that you have to buy, they are selling skins. Stuff that the art team can make if they have no work to do.And for anyone who mentions how the game is still in early access? Yes, cause y'know, games take time to make. Not every company has 100 workers or whatever and can produce a game out every second. Can I recommend DD2? Yes, as my review says. I have yet to run into any problems so far - Not to say there aren't any. But early access is early access - You can't download/buy stuff like that and not expect bugs. Content doesn't come out super quick, but the devs also aren't silent like other devs. They may not post something every day, but they do keep us updated on stuff. DD2 gets my thumbs up.P.S. For anyone who thinks you should get all the new heroes for free because you bought into the game, you are stupid. You got what you payed for.			"

								I will be writing this post from the point of view of a player that has never played Dungeon Defenders I.This game is pretty much Sanctum meets Diablo and Borderlands.It is a pretty looking FPS (first person shooter) set in a tower defense game. The game itself is mainly centered around loot. Getting weapons, armor and pets which upgrade your hero(es).Pros:â¢	Pretty looking visuals.â¢	Fun loot system (rarities, traits, certain map/mission bound loot).â¢	Great co-op play with friends or random other players.Cons:â¢	Lack of/bad difficulty scaling. It will be impossible to beat a difficulty higher than hard with a low level character as it does not scale with your level but instead is set to level 50.â¢	Bugs. Lots and lots of bugs. For example: People joining private lobby sessions, loot being sent to bags which have autoloot disabled and many more.â¢	No support for Borderless Windowed mode (alt tabbing is a pain and might get your cursor stuck).â¢	âEarly accessâ after two years of release. Feels like an excuse to not do/delay bugfixes.â¢	Pricing of âDLCâ and currency. While the game is free to play, I would consider paying 20 Euros for some stuff. However that would be able to get me a single character. In order to buy all âyear 1â characters I would have to pay 60 Euros, the price of an AAA game title. As long as the prices stay this way I will not make a single purchase.â¢	Currently unobtainable currency locks skills in certain stores.â¢	Very slow free to play progression for additional heroes. Your first 10K medals costing hero can be bought in about a week due to campaign rewards. After that you will be getting like 300 medals a day for daily quests on average while heroes still cost 10K medals.â¢	Goblin Siege Rollers.While this game has issues, lots of them, I will still be giving it a thumbs up because I simply enjoy the (free to play) gameplay, and that is the most important thing about a game.

								From the few minutes I've played and the trailers, I can already see this game took a wrong turn at the intersection. If you were a fan of the first Dungeon Defenders, this game is like a whole new game. The art style and graphics were completely changed, and now it's a leveling up grind. Almost all female characters are sexualized, making the game feel more unconfortable. This is not what I expected from Dungeon Defenders 2. Go ahead and try it, after all it's free. I can't say I reccomend it, but don't let my words stop you from giving it a go.			"

								While I was very excited about this game when it first became availible. I Played and enjoyed the game quite a bit. However the constant add on and change of mechanics and gear has turned the game south. If i had to say 1 thing turned me away is the wait for OVER A YEAR on split screen co-op on pc. Devs say it is comming but we have yet to see it. In the meantime though they have managed to further progress the game by developing new endgame and characters. But why trendy would you CREATE the same game for xbox and ps4 with split screen co op as a basic feature and not give it to us on PC.  IMO you have shown at least me you do not care for your PC playerbase and not only will not give them things that console gets even though we are the original platform developed for. No split screen co-op means time to give up on this franchise.			"

Early Access Review
								Don't like the free to play aspect. I would have gladly paid $60 for a better experience. I recall annoucements that you would only be able to pay for asthetic items, nothing that would make the game easier. Well you have to pay to have more than 4 heroes and pay for more inventory. I personally am not dumping in the money pit. As far as content goes, only 4 heroes(which is understandable with early acess), but who knows if you would have to pay for some hero packs when those come out. Tower changes for each class which is refreshing. Not that i didn't like the old towers but something new like that is good. Maps are terrible. There is no challenge on a build. The enemy paths are so short that you could literally build anywhere and win. Armor does not show up on your hero, so you will buy costumes. Again, i would have gladly paid money for the game to have that capability and avoid a money pit. Costumes, as of right now, aren't that great. A couple of good ones for a couple heroes. Huntress costumes are garbage in my opinion. Amount of content is lacking and bugs are present. I wouldn't expect anything else from even a game that was just realeased let alone an early access. The deciding factor for me is this has been in alpha for over a year. Seems like progress is going to be very slow considering they were working on it before it was released for early access. But don't worry, the money pits are up and functional so you can dump some money in.

								Well thank you developers for deleting characters from prealpha and not giving anything for time spent on leveling up. Yeah, I'm so glad that you gave me back 3600 gems so i can spend them on the same costumes again.			"

								i have a deep passion for games that have charm,an rpg tower defence game with different classes wich have different ways of being played?sign me up!its like the first game but more advanced and the ''kids'' have grown up to be late teens  / early 20's.there is an RNG system here wich makes it a little grind heavy, (RNG is basicly a system that haves you desiring items and they're not dropping)i feel however that the monk's boosting abilities for other towers is not really that great, the monk in general feels weak to me.i play as a tower mage on my first playthrough.as it stands in this stage, i like it!co-op only though solo kills the mood for me "

								As a huge fan of Dungeon Defenders 1 and having spent many hours looking around and impatiently waiting for Dungeon Defenders 2, I finally decided to buy it and see what is going on with this game.I was way more impressed than I expected myself to be. The game even though in alpha stages with not an enormous amount of content, I'm having tons of fun so far. If you've played DD1, then most things are similar. If you haven't, you should totally give this game a try if you're into RPG, Tower Defense type of games. I can't wait for more content, up so far there are a few maps + many weapons and pets and armors. Since this is still Alpha stage I can't say too much, but up so far the game is totally worth it, especially if you liked DD1.PS: As of the new ""Loot and Survive"" update there has been a complete wipe. I got extremely frustrated with this, but as long as new content is added I'm not gonna keep a grunge to the developers. I hate losing my progress but oh well it is for a good cause. Hopefully no more wipes though, pretty please.			"

								Pay To Win game. The best deal is $100 for 12,500 Gems. You convert gems into items in this game. To get a pass into the Dragonfall Carnival for a chance at Epic Items you need to pay 150 gems. This game used to be okay but after it went the route of PTW, it lost any chance to be a great game. Pity.PROS1. CampaignThere are 16 levels for you to play, ranging from Level 1 to Level 40 (Max).2. Dragonfall CityThe Tavern, the Personal Room, the City, the Catapults and all the Merchants make the game look great.CONS1. Pay To WinYou can pay cash to get Legendary items ahead of other players. PTW just spoils the game.2. Spin The Wheel for ItemsThis is a PTW mechanic. You either use 10 tickets that come from drops or spend Gems.3. Low Player CountFor a 4-player game, there are really few players.			"

								Ok, so lets get a few things straight, and excuse my spelling. Dungeon Defenders 2 has essentially become P2W in a way. it's also become pretty grindy, but it is still a fun game. Sure it has many flaws and bugs, but if you can ignore them, it's actually quite enjoyable, although the time it takes to buy the Abyss lord is horrible, withought buying Defender Medals ( if you can that is) and jsut farming Betty, it would take atleast 120 hours or more, just to get him. Still, I would reccomend trying it out, you might hate it, you might love it, but it is still fun.			"

Early Access Review
								I played DD1 and loved every second of playing.  I was extremely excited about DD2 but when it came out as a MOBA, it bombed royally!  I was extremely disappointed with this and even paid money to support their plans to change it back into its original gameplay.  Instead of redoing the game, it appears they kept some coding and left a bit of a MOBA game play.Here are my issues with the game.1. Time - Itâs been years and this game is still in alpha/Beta testing.  Extremely disappoint considering how much time itâs been.2. Price for heroes - The price for heroes jumped from $2-$5 to $99!!!!!  What were you thinking?3. Maps - The maps are just wonky to say the least.  A whole wide hallway and one blockade in the center can stop them?4. Towers - Some hero towers are either underpowered (mage) or overpowered (Lava mancer).  One Volcano can hit an entire map from the center of the playing field.  Whatâs the point?5. Gear - Your gears IPwr is off.  One level 50 green with less stats have higher IPwr levels than a level 50 Mythical with more stats.  This makes no sense.6. Heroes - You limit the heroes to four unless you pay more money.  Not even LOL, Warcraft, Clash of clans, or other iOS games do this.  If I am going to pay money, then you better offer me something great in return not BS costumes!7. Costumes - its overkill!  Fix the game and make it actually work instead of playing dress up with your hero.8. Abilities - The old abilities are gone and replaced with junk abilities which require mana that cost too much and feel like a MOBA game.  9. Mana - The mana is way too small to see and having everyone run around the entire map just to collect mana that only they can see is annoying.  If Player 1 already covered an area, why does player 2 have to run that same area to get mana.10. Mana - The amount of Mana a player receives is way too low.  11. Pets - You no longer receive pets like last time, instead you have random drops with random stats, with random eggs, and no real way to farm.  itâs all just luck.  Which really sucks12. Bags - I have 12 bags or so with 16 slots and scrolling and trying to organize them is a pain and a hassle.  No real way to organize all your gear, instead you have to play move and shuffle just to get gear in the right place.13. Tutorial - you really get no tutorial on anything, it all just click and figure out on your own and hope you donât lose anything.14. Towns - You get randomly disconnected from town because a host has left.  Why do I have to rely on a host for a town meetup, shouldnât this be a server hosted town and not based on someoneâs connection.  Does this mean that one personâs PC is hosting all our heroes at once?  Seems crappy.15. End of map - You have to wait for all players to make a decision before replaying the map or going to town.  if a player disconnected or leaves the session before you all press G, you all have to wait for the countdown to be over before you can go to town.  Seems like a complete waste of time.16. Heroâs orbs/Spheres - The cost is too high and the abilities are too low.I can go on and on about how much this game is nowhere near game ready.  I recommend either waiting to even see if this game will finish or just going back to DD1.  As of right now, I cannot stand playing this game anymore.  I have four toons, all 680 ipwr levels and am bored with farming maps that have no real direction.   "

								I do not recommend that you pay money for this game.  The main reason is the server issues.  Every time I try to play this game with friends we have trouble connecting to each other in private sessions.  Sometimes the game itself will not even load because of bad server connections.  I regret paying money for the game (but that is mainly because it is free to play now).  Also, in my opinion, games that allow you to play but make you pay money for certain things that exist within the game is not cool.  If you do play, since it is free, and you do not have server issues and aren't tempted to pay a ton of money for a different costume, you will probably like the game.  It has tons of potential and I really hope they get the bugs worked out.  Until then, I am gonna have to recommend that you do not play this game.  If it gets better I will change my review.			"

								It is an interesting game especially for those who are looking for something free to play. There are many maps we can choose from and four different classes to play.I personally enjoyed playing it with friends but after the first 10 - 15 hours i got bored of it. The gameplay itself is quite grindish so this is a game that should not be played alone.There is a feature at the login screen where it gives you the option to join a group related to the game and if you do that you should receive some gems which you can spend at the in game's store. I joined it but it didn't gave me any gems. I hope it gets fixed soon...It's not a pay to win type of game! The only thing they have at the store are cosmetic items that don't really affect your gameplay! I'll give it a 7/10.			"

It would not get into any games. I reinstalled, verified cache, and reset computer.  The forum mods and Trendy support helped me out alot, though it took a couple days I did get it working by disabling my modem firewall. The game itself is amazing, players are helpful, and the game is fun though frustrating when 1 player makes you lose. I would reccomend buying the game if you played the previous Dungeon defenders.It is amazing.			"

Early Access Review
								""it has a long time befor it becomes a succeser to the original"", well that day has come.I'm officaly addicted, I had some mixed feelings about this in the beggining.but its safe to say, that this game is a succesor to the original!While im no where near to end game, my IPWR on my main builder being ~150, and only one charecter being max lv (in the procces of maxing another one).But lets start from the beggining;GOOD STUFF The early quests help you figure out what the h3ll is going on, and bassicly the basics.from a sertian point the quests becom something along the lines of this: ""get a charecter to lv 40"" and when you finish that one you have to go to some npc for a new feature or item and the loop starts over again.If you chose a DPS/CC charecter to start with, you must play in a group.and i even found farming to lv 50 in sertian maps diffcult without the other defenses can build, like the sky guard tower which is crucial for maps where the wyverns simply dont come out of the lanes where the mobs come out.In the very start Trendy has claimed that switching between towers and mixing the setup is crucial, and from what i see, IT IS!building with one set of towers is allmost impossible in most end game maps and modes.while element combos are not as effective as they first were, they still pack a punch.NEGETIVE STUFFThis is a free2play game, and an ""in game currency"" was a must to keep the cash flowing and to keep Trendy from not supporting the game.And the customes dont effect gameplay at all, and acttualy decreases youre currency in game, either from buying myth gear with gold or buying lockboxe's keys with wyvern tokens.but the bag system is one of the worst things i have ever seen in a free2play game.Grinding loot is the core of the game, and keeping alot of important loot is, well, important.If you have more bags, you will get further. hands down no question.some say its for more  but i call this a big load of BS!Auto pickup loot is a major thing with the bags, instead of every wave going and looking if you got good loot and then picking it up, you can just have 10 bags optomized for auto loot and in the end of the match just check everything.this is a pay2win concept, where  if you have more money to spend itll be much easier for you to get better and proggres.Pets.yes, pets have a terrible system.not the pets them selfs, or the hatching system, but the storage system.Pet food, eggs, rotten shells, â¥â¥â¥â¥ you need to evolve the pet, all stored withing the same place of youre loot.now how is that a problem? you may ask.It is a major flaw, and makes the game even more pay2win.its connected to the point i made earlier, you now even have less space for loot, since you need slots to keep youre eggs, shells pet food and the other stuff.Trendy did make the pets a different bag, where only pets can be stored, but you still have to pay more cash to store more pets!End notes:If you made it this far i thank you, for putting the time and dedication to read all of what i just wrote.I would love to hear feedback from you, the reader!I would give this game a solid 9/10 for new comers to the series, and for hardcore original fans a still pretty solid 7/10.

								Well for ppl who played DD1 (also played btw), DD2 doesnt disapoint, Most of the negative reviews forgets that the game its still in pre-Alpha, so alot of stuff still missing like trading and  player droping gear on tavern... etc... no drastic change was made that would make u think that isnt a sequel to DD1, all the old fun stuff is there. Plus some new, but im not gona spoil it for the new player.			"

								Everything I liked about Dungeon Defenders was lost in this game.  Customize your character? Naw. Lots of tower choices? naw.  Yes it looks prettier, but it's far less engaging and interesting. I asked for a refund, they said no and then made it free to play. Screw you too.			"

								Overall it's a brilliant free to plaay game that almost anyone can enjoy. Gather a group of friends and fight your way to the top in one of the most entertaining and exciting games of this year! Ive had this game for a week now and ive tried all the classes and I have to say every one of them offers there own unique way that makes them so noticible. I have not found a single bug yet and im extremely excited to see how this game develops! The only negative thing i have to say is that you have to pay for the outfits and outfits are one of my favorite ways to customize y ingame character.			"

								Dungeon Defenders 2 is more or less the same as it's predecessor. Although there are less characters, less maps, and less viable strategies. The only thing really new in this game is Microtransactions. Community is rude, unlwelcoming and elitism is as rampant as it was in the first game. Leveling is slow, boring and ultimately devolves into pointless loot grind. The game is also very buggy and crash prone, requiring a lot of work to get to it run in a stable state. DD2 feels like a hollow shell of what the Dungeon Defenders was. None of the charm of the original game is present. Time will tell if DD2 improves, but right now I'm not holding out any hope.			"

								Awesome game as always with Dungeon Defenders, awesome Tower Defense. Only few bugs for an Alpha, correct amount of content to start and a lot more is planned!If you were an hardcore player of DD1 you may have a rough time to get used to this new DD but it worth the try.The game will be free to play once release (with only comestics buyable in real money) but, hey , why wait a whole year when you can get it now?!

								This is a fun game with pretty asthetics that are easy to run. The towers and their effects are easy to understand but very effective if mastered.However, the reviews are bad due to the developers sueing the ARK: Survival Evolved devolopers, so please do not be turned away from this game for the mixed reviews.Overall good game.

								First off, this game is absolutely different from Dungeon Defenders 1. This isn't to say that it's a bad game, just don't go into it thinking you can pull the same stunts as the last game. You are not going to be afk farming in this game. You will be out on the battlefield holding down the fort and defending with all of you character abilities. Every original character feels really balanced and has a few roles they can fill. Gear hunting is great because there's actual game-changing abilities on the gear that can dictate how you are going to be playing the character. There's more game modes and difficulty options that can keep you entertained and on your toes. Also, they Devs really put an emphasis on ""use more than one character or else you will fail"". Like I said, you won't be sitting here building with a mage and afking wave after wave. In this game, it just isn't good enough. You need to find your combos and create/build characters that synergize. Have one character throwing oil while your mage is igniting them with his flame towers and stuff like that. It's a good twist. Not to mention there's no more stupid helicopters flying in and dropping ogres from random places on the map, or spiders that drop down from the sky out of nowhere to sabotage your builds. All in all, this is a solid game and I can definitely say it's a step in the right direction. Worth playing, hands down. My only real complaint is the strength of the DLC characters. The summoner and EV2 just don't belong in this game at the power they're currently at. The summoner is a step above all of the original 4 in terms of straight dps output. It takes a lot for others to compete with his tower strength and utility. However, EV2 is just absurd. Without gear and using one ability, EV2 can solo campaign mode on normal at lvl 13. Then she can solo nightmare 3 at lvl 30. At level 50 with around 300 gear score, EV2 is easily putting out about 300k dps. A hunter with straight hero dmg and ability power is only pumping out around 50k, but it requires double the gear score. That being said, EV2 is reaching levels of damage that SHOULD NOT be attainable in this game! SHE NEEDS AN IMMEDIATE NERF. Proton beams allow her to sit on the crystal and shoot halfway across the map and clear lanes with ease. Levels that should be challenging are just turned into minor inconveniences with her on your squad. She takes the fun out of the game because people who play her just don't have to actually PLAY the game. They don't need to find/build the synergy between their heroes, they don't need to farm gear and hunt for specific abilities. They don't need to balance stats or even move. They are able to push into the endgame with ease, and it's disgusting. By making these DLC characters as strong as they are, the Devs are just straight disrespecting the game they made. Playing a monk (whose towers are completely underwelming and weak) to playing EV2 or the summoner is just disgusting. Personally, I'm waiting for the barbarian to come back (shouldn't have even taking this long, in my opinion). However, if he's even half as  broken as EV2 while the other original 4 stay at the same terrible weakness they're at, then this game is going into the recycle bin.			"

								Complete garbage.Developers can't even get the ""menu"" right.Instead of clicking somewhere to do something, you run around as if this was a mmo.Imagine league of legends, and to queue, you have to run with teemo, over a crappy map, to some npc, and tell him you wanna do a 5 vs 5...Even character switching requires an NPC, one that i can't find. Made a test character, played one game, wanted to try another character, tried to get back to the character selection screen, 30 minutes later i ragequit. Completely idiotic design. HAVING A ""START GAME"" BUTTON IS A GOOD THING!YOU DON'T NEED TO MAKE EVERYTHING INTO A NPC!!!Literally the only things you can do without that dumb tavern, is start, quit, select EU / US and the options menu...No matter how good that first level looks, THOSE developers are NOT capable of making a good game, save your money.

								I want to like this game, but without knowing what the game's content is about, I can't. The main issue I had was performance issues, not the usual kind of fps issues that people are complaining about on the forums, but there was few troubles just trying to get the game launched.On my first try, I clicked the Play button in the launcher, then nothing happened. When I sorted programs by RAM usage in the Task Manager, I found out that the .exe was the the bottom of the list, so I had to force close it.My second try got a step further, which got me relieved. However, the DD2 logo appeared, then the whole thing froze. Appeared as ""Not Responding"" RAM usage doesn't cost as much as running Steam.I decided to give myself a final try. Sadly the result I got was the same.You might say:The game's in closed alpha - give the developers some time. Um, how about no. Since its launch date, the developers had 9 months to work on the game, but nothing was done in terms of performance optimisation/bug extermination?My PC is not up to its performance requirements. You may be right.  Either that or the requirements listed on the store page is giving out false information. "

								I'm only recommending this game because it's free-to-play.  Micro-transactions are present in a lot of miniscule aspects of the game, but in my 90 hours of playtime I haven't felt like anything was an essential purchase.  I hesitate to recommend this game because after a while, I realized I wasn't playing this game for fun.  It was just a simple slow grind progression that I get sucked into so easily.  There was always another level to gain, or the hope for better gear, but for the most part, I would just set up my defenses on whatever the hardest map I could beat at the time and let the game play itself.  I rarely went online, and I say that it was an even split between good experiences, bad experiences, and joining games that already had everything under control.  The initial 20 hours or so were probably the most fun, since that's when new abilities were being learned, and I was still perfecting my map layouts.  Again, it's free, so give it a try. I'm going to wait for the official release before I dive back in.  I love the concept of these games, and spent many hours in dungeon defenders 1, but the sequel has worn thin for me in the endgame.			"

								Hard to review this one, as a fan of the original. Where to begin? Well...let's start off with what I don't like.The game is quite a bit easier. The maps are visually more interesting to look at and have more full 3D depth to them, which makes them interesting to run around in at times. But each lane is identified for you immediately, and the maps are designed in such a way that you can't have an ""aha!"" moment as you discover a way to place a single tower to cover multiple choke-points. Either the developer placed the chokepoint for you and pointed you right to it, or the chokepoint doesn't exist. This can help to eliminate the feeling of ""trial and error"" gameplay that existed in the first game, but it also means you can never feel like you're outsmarting the developer when you find a good way to place your towers.In some ways, this doesn't necessarily change the final feeling of the game, as in the first one, once you figured it out, you always placed towers in the best spots. I suppose this makes it easier to play the game in public groups or with friends that don't really play video games the same way you do, but it makes all of the maps feel a little samey after awhile, because you never get to experience that first moment of wonder as you treat the map like a puzzle to be solved.The pricing of the cosmetic items is...quite high. I find myself learning to enjoy the default skins, since purchasing the outfits i'd like would quickly put this game at a higher price than an off the shelf, AAA title. I don't have a problem with the microtransactions themselves, I think it'd just be nicer if they were a little more ""micro"" so I could get a few skins and not feel like i'm getting robbed.Now on to what's been improved!The new hero-deck system will (eventually) prevent a single player from effectively filling every role. Playing with friends in the first game could be quite difficult at times, because you were capable of leveling up and gearing out the entire cast, and placing every tower type. Your friends could quickly outgrow you, and if you didn't play a ranger or barbarian, there was little reason for you to be in the game with such a person, since their towers would be better than what you could make. Being limited to a certain number of heroes encourages you to work together - once there are more hero types than there are deck slots, you'll need at least two players to do everything. It's forced co-op sure, but at least you can always be useful to your friends, since you can bring something that they cannot.The way they introduce new unit types as mini-bosses feels good. Later maps and harder difficulties can repeatedly spawn mini-boss versions of these enemies too. Since there are a lot of things that can define an enemy (such as movement speed, walking or flying, special attacks, resistances), they keep your defenses in check and ensure that everyone has something to contribute. Defenses and your attentiveness get tested as each lane fights to divert your attention across the map. The new, proper bosses feel a lot more interesting than all of the bosses from the first game, too. They have mechanics that make them more than a ""bullet sponge"", and it was an excellent move making them a bit of an outside force that interacts with the map and the waves in interesting ways, instead of just being placed awkwardly and requiring that you blindly hit it with regular attacks and awkwardly placed towers.The aesthetics of the game are sweet. Everything is much nicer to look at.I think my biggest complaint is that I just wish the game was harder. Not in a ""just make the numbers bigger"" way, but that the maps were actually more interesting to play. It feels like the entire campaign is a tutorial to get you acclimated to the games mechanics. The maps never seem to get nearly as complex or interesting as they were in the first game....The revisited maps in 'the harbinger awakens' content update come closer and are definitely more fun than the maps that came before it, which gives me hope for the future. You really can't go wrong with ""free"" though, and I can see myself losing a few more evenings as I continue to play this with my fiancÃ©e. But ultimately, I don't think either of us will be sinking dozens or even hundreds of hours into it like we did the first time around.			"

Also, you can see some references or easter eggs - for example ""it's dangerous to go alone, take this"".The only bad thing is that i feel like they try to change Player's Interface so much without bigger purpose, while older Interface was easy, clean and basicly good looking.As for Alpha i rate this game 8/10, i hope they don't screw it up.Psst... I hope they will add something exclusive for people that bought DD 1.			"

								I will write a review later as an update but for now i just wanted to congragulate the creators of DD2 for such an amazing game. The graphics are great and the combos with spells and toweres are amazing. The one thing i realy look forward to is controler support. As soon as the game has that integrated I will buy five more copies for my friends. i look forward to new tower interactions, and combonations.			"

								If you like RPG's and tower defence games, this is the game for you. Choose between an apprentice, huntress, monk or squire to defend Etheria from the Old ones. They're trying to take the magical crystal back with waves and waves of orcs, goblins and all manner of crazy beasts. Level up and fully custimize your hero with stat points, spehres, pets and gear to deal with the baddies in the way you see fit. Work on your hero themselves or your defences. Each hero has there own set of defences such as walls and towers and traps to ''defend'' the chosen objective. Each mission is very colorful and completed with difficulties for your team to overcome. A great co -op and friends game , becuase you all need to work together, hero and defence wise to protect the objective and well, from experiece if you don't....you fail. You spend equal time defending, as setting up defences to gearing up and looking through loot. It's also not a play to win, they only negative is a long loading time or game crashes but i'm sure Itll be fixed and renderd ASAP...			"

								im the type of PC gamer that needs a controller to play games, and this game does have controller support but doesnt say it does *COUGH* Left 4 Dead 2 *COUGH*.  but this game reminds me a lot of TF2(Team fortress 2) because TF2 is like a more cartoonie like CoD game and DD2 is more of a cartoonie Dota 2 and LoL which are games i do not like but i do like this game.  plus its free now and that's the only reason why i have this game lol its not a game i would recommend to someone but still a fun game to play every once in a while.

								First of all, DD2 feels like a complete reboot of DD1.Graphics and animations aside, the few changes that felt refreshing to me were the substats you get from loot and the spheres, especially uber spheres. The substats (e.g. hearty blockade) are way more important than just the stats you add from leveling whereas the spheres gives you a diverse option to build your towers. Oh, and you can no longer add defense attack speed with equips, so that makes it different from DD1.Similar to DD1, this game is all about the loot. Pretty self-explanatory, you progress from getting better loot and to get better loot, you gotta keep replaying maps. Essentially making the game feel ""grindy"". Just a disclaimer, loot isn't the most important aspect of this game, there're still ways to beat levels such as strategising tower placement and countering magic/physical resistance. I feel that loot is what drives the game, it is the 'core' of Dungeon Defenders.Which brings me to...What I don't like about DD2 right now 19/10/2015:- THERE IS LIMITED BAG SPACE!!!!!!! You get pretty good loot that you wanna keep (that takes up space). You gotta wait 48 hours for an egg to rot and become a material required for evolving your pet (that takes up space). You get pet food for your pet (that takes up space). You get some other material required for evolving pet (that takes up space). It's disheartening that you have to either sacrifice loot for progressing your eqp/pet, or sacrifice progress for loot. Moreover, certain maps gives you a lot of loot, so you gotta sell items in between waves (playing with people, everyone is in a hurry to 'g' up).- So gems are no longer just solely for cosmetics. Since more bag space also requires gems, would this make it P2W?- Server lags. This game just became free to play recently, so no doubt this would happen. However, playing this game every now and then, I find myself off the side of the cliff. You decide if you wanna put up with that (personally I'd give it time).Other than the few main points above that I have problems with, the game is still in Alpha with lots more potential. Can't wait to see it in completion.The game is free to play, so what are you waiting for? Try it.			"

								It's a really good game with very nice graphics, and has awesome weapons, maps, game concepts, and game mechanics. The only thing this game is missing is a really good story, to me the story seems pretty boring and doesn't have much character voice, if the game had characters that talk, and a story that grips you in, it would be really amazing. Also if the items like armor and relics would render onto the player that would be awesome. In total the game is really great and fun.			"

Looking for a free to play, non pay to win game? This one is the game.May contain mild spoilers.Dungeon Defenders 2 is by far one of the best free to play MMO's I have ever played. Sure there are in-game purchases, but you don't need to purchase anything to progress through the game, everyone levels up equally, there is NO Gameplay Advantage to those who buy in-game items.About the gameA general summery of the game.Dungeon defenders 2 is just like any other tower defense game, except you can play with your friends, and have a free roaming expirence. Protect your lands against orcs, or else you will end up in defeat! There are 4 characters to choose from at the start, the apprentice, huntress, squire, and the monk. Play with up to 4 friends in an in-game co-op party, and have fun leveling up at your own pace. Gain more ipwr by defeating the orcs, and picking up gear that you can equip at your level. Gain money, to buy power ups, that make your hero, or defenses stronger.Cons?Nope, not many at all.This is one in many free to play games that has very little cons to it. I'd have to say the only downfall to this game, is having to pay for costumes for your characters, and there is no other way to unlock them yourself.TL;DR?Too long; didn't read?In short, Dungeon Defenders 2 is one of my most highly recommended free mmo games out there right now. There is tons of gameplay, and the game is still in development with more maps and upgrades. You can play with your friends, and have fun leveling up at any pace you'd like. Levels get harder as you progress, making it funner to level up.Definitely do try out this game. What is there to lose? It's free-to-play!Like my reviews?To see more of my reviews on games, you can view more HERE!(http://steamcommunity.com/id/redsauce117/recommended/) "

								It's Dungeon Defenders I, but it's F2P!This is good and bad, though. It's good because, you know, it's free, but it's bad because they have microtransactions and DLC to make the game generate income.In my opinion, this doesn't matter too much, as all of the items you pay for are purely cosmetic and give no special advantage in any way.It also has better graphics than the first game, quests, daily missions, a better upgrading system, another way to upgrade your character, a better tavern, and more!And it's still in alpha.I'd rate this game 9.5/10. It still needs some more maps, but again, it's in alpha. It also needs PVP!			"

								ATM No, The game doesn't have a true direction and is constant change. Game feels to linear and only provides a few days of fun after each patch, a TD game usually tends to not be as fun after each map playthrough. Going Open Alpha shortly id recomend you wait for that, as good graphically as the game and costumes are, the game experience is lacking.with a few more modes for longevity, some competitive modes and more maybe (they could look into other custom maps on wc3 for idea's.)The game can become great, it has potential. But its all round the place and patches are very sporadic and feel un-tested.Edit.Came back for a bit games still bad if not worse (aside from weapons) with a even more horrible patch called ""Carnival"" and patches that came with mroe bugs than fix's. Im looking forward to New heroes, but even more core rebalance and the hero deck change. I'll probably be back again after core rebalance hopefully its good enough for me to change my review then.Edit.2017 now, feels worse than before.			"

								It's a good, somewhat completed game, that's fun in LAN. :) It's free to play, and there's no real ""pay-to-win"" need, either. I love how you can collect items throughout, reminding me of Borderlands and Diablo. None of those wussy items like in Secret World and Age of Conan, either. ;) Tons of small gimmicks, like pets and skills. Later in the game you can change some of the effects on the other towers. A few downsides, though: it's buggy (it's alpha, so no surprise there). You'll be thrown out of the game and have to rejoin the match at times (fortunately you don't have to wait for the match to finish before you can rejoin), sometimes the weapon-animations suddenly stop showing, or trying to carry more than 1 gold/crystal during the Kobolt Challenge will simply delete the other, sometimes you just can't connect with a friend and both gotta restart the game... I do wish there'd be a few more towers to chose between for each character, though, but at least you can change character ingame as often  as you wish, and use several types. Yeah, there are downsides. It's a free alpha though, so can't complain and let it prevent me from giving a recommendation, because we (four of us) had a lot of fun. Some even bought the hideously expensive Hero/Costume packs - not worth it in my opinion. My tip? Download it, play it for free, enjoy it a lot (or not, and no money lost). If you like it enough that you'll buy pretty-coloured things for lots of real money, well - all power to you, I suppose. Enjoy!			"

								This is an excellent suceessor to the original DD. Time for the PROS:+very smooth controls unlike anything I've ever seen.+Still multiplayer (YES!!)+Players can be as creative with their classes as they want.+New updates every day.+Ma-HOO-sive community!Now for the cons. You all knew it was to be.CONS:-no offline singleplayer-no controller support.-no local multiplayer.Over all I say this a very good game. Of course its still in alpha, so bugs are to be expected.I hope that they do as well as they did with the original DD.I give it an 11/10 for now.My rating WILL change as time progresses.UPDATE: I now give this wonderful game a 12/10			"

								Great game but there are some pros and cons that i want to point out before buying/getting the game if it becomes p2p again. (it was f2p in alpha if you're reading this in the future lol)Pros: Play with friendsGet Stronger as you level upMake new friendsGet insane gearCons:Enemies stay in spawn and kill your defenses (probably will be fixed soon)Bosses are too easy at the last waveWhen you invite a friend to your game, they don't get a green mana chestInaccurate thumbs up thumbs down symbols for items7/10 "

								I see a lot of reviews from people who are upset about the grind to get new characters - Devs realized it was a bit too hard to grind for the medals, so they increased the amount you receive from missions, maps, etc... I am now capped on medals after just a few days of playing. There has been a ton of content released for this game in the last few months, including new maps, incursions, weapons, and even two new characters. The community has a say in how this game is progressing, which is more than I can say for a lot of other games. I can also look at news for this game and weekly (if not every few days) there is detailed** updates on where the devs are in updates, and even a look at what is to come, whether it be a thought, or a work in progress. Overall, I've been playing this game since release, and I still play it almost every day. If you enjoy tower defense, you should not pass up the opportunity to at least try the game out.			"

								This game has for the most part been garbage, and a real disgrace to DD1.Most maps seem to be made with appearance in mind (and they do look pretty good) rather then gameplay, as good tower placement is all but forgotten in the map designs (which is of critical importance to a tower defense game).Combat itself is fairly clunky, leaving you with a lackluster experience as you run about hacking at waves of mobs.Tuning is evidentaly very poor, in most cases leaving you with either extreme ease or impossible difficulty. Difficulty, in this case, a result of being undergeared/leveled.Despite not yet even being released, updates have been centered around monitization schemes. The free to play is a bait-and-switch designed to lure you in to show you pretty maps, and then ask you for money.Trendy has gone down the drain hard. Where DD1 was a fun and unique game that got great support and a thriving community. DD2 has been a half-baked game and a terrible money grab.			"

								The game is amazing, because it has the same concepts as DD1, but does feel like a different game. Just as enjoyable as the first game. I realize this game is in Alpha stage (even though it feels like it's been forever, and DD1 took forever to come out fully). I'll give a positive review, because it's a great game, but there's one problem...The jump button barely works if you're using an XBox controller. I loved DD1, and played it with a controller, and loved it. Now, when I'm in the middle of a battle, trying to do what needs to be done, I can't even get around my towers because the jump button is so bugged out! I even end up dying sometimes because I fall in a pit, because the jump button doesn't register.I think the problem might be because the ""A"" button does other things, so I've tried to remap the jump button to something else... But the remapping aspect of the controller menu doesn't work!The game is absolutely amazing, and IF they fix this problem, I will totally love it, and probably play it just as much as I did DD1 (250 hours). However, if they don't fix this, I'll probably give up after a while because it's just so infuriating.			"

								In short, Dungeon Defenders II would have been a good game, had DD1 not existed.The game is quite close to a neutral level to me, however I still can't recommend it much. That said, if there was an indifferrent option, I would select tht instead. Dungeon Defenders 2 is a decent game in its own right, although certain controls can be more complicated and somewhat difficult to remember. For some gamers, myself included, controller support is a must-have, however DD2 lacks this and uses a keyboard and mouse only. Unlike DD1, it's a generally more complicated game, in that the maps are slightly more complicated and use more paths to make things harder. That said, the game is generally easier if you've played DD1 or DDE.As a rating, I give DD2 a 4/10, because it isn't a bad game, but it dismisses some redeeming factors and negates their usage, such as the forementioned controller. The game is still early access, and as such, I would call it one to watch, and with any such improvement, my review may change to recommendation.			"

								TL;DR, modern tower defense with a hero element.  can build freely anywhere and everywhere in most cases.  MMO-ish looting and rarity hierarchy ex: white, green, blue, purple, orange flavor text.  all heroes in a deck level up regardless of them being active so long as they are in your deck.  all content can be obtained without spending a penny even heroes and hero slots. premium options are conveniences or skins ex: inventory expander or unlocking heroes.  you cannot purchase spheres or special things with premium currency.dungeon defenders 2 being the sequel to dungeon defenders continues the tale of the four youngsters who are now all grown up.  Etheria is in a golden age after the defeat of the old ones and eveythings hunky dory for a wile.  however, someone's running amok releasing those old ones once again and the original 4 are enlisted to fight once more.  taking place in the kingdom of dragonfall you work with the locals to ship out the eternia crystals to hopefully fix whoever's making a mess of things.the old ones have adapted and enlisted some new and old units alike to aid their advances to destroy the shards.  you'll face off against most of what you known from the first game, goblins, orcs, mages, even ogres return.  the goblins got a new ranged unit that throws bombs, the mage has been adapted to resurrect the dead, and the ogres are more geared to the teeth to do some serious damage.  the archer and dark elf assassin units have been retired, the archer has been replaced by a javelin thrower capable of piercing through defenses and enlisted the drakins as a bombardment of magical flame to shoot at things from a distance.but that's not all, they enrolled many new units to help their conquest such as the witherbeast, a supportive tanky unit that burrows itself into the ground and emits a healing field for enemies and debuffing nearby defenses to take more damage while also receiving less damage from them.  the kobolds have taken to the skies and have learned the art of paragliding, and will dive-bomb into their targets.  a new air unit has also been discovered, a lightning bug, capable of dealing chained damage to defenses.many more dangerous enemies await but what of the heroes, have their friends made a comeback? well, sort of.  EV comes back with her second edition and the summoner now retitled to 'abyss lord' also make a return.  they handle and function very differently than their previous incarnations so expect different game play.  some new faces also join in on the fight as well such as the lavamancer, a living molten rock of a man along with the mystic, who has a huge fixation to appeasing the snake gods, and, as of just recently, the dryad from terraria has also came on in to help.  the game has also been streamlined to reduce the whackyness and longevity needed to complete a map, guesstimated to 1/5th the insanity that was dungeon defender 1.  the game will adjust each lane after each wave to be more difficult.  it will spawn special enemies, such as ogres, less often and more predictably, but as a result, they are much more vicious.  you are also rewarded a chest at the end that will guarantee one item's loot quality depending on its color.  gold replaces mana in terms of spending money for functions such as upgrading.  defender medals, obtained through daily/bonus weekly missions and map completion, are used for specific things such as skill spheres and unique items.overall i think it's a solid game for it being free, although a year or so ago there was a buy in price but now that has been lifted and a lot of content adjusted for a free to play model i think it's heading in the right direction.  they got some kinks and cracks to undo and seal up as it is but they are introducing some nice new player friendly features such as an ability to try the dryad in a 'normalized' mode.  on top of the campaign giving a generous heaping amount of defender medals to be comparable to a new hero with about 1~2k missing.

								First off, this game is absolutely different from Dungeon Defenders 1. This isn't to say that it's a bad game, just don't go into it thinking you can pull the same stunts as the last game. You are not going to be afk farming in this game. You will be out on the battlefield holding down the fort and defending with all of you character abilities. Every original character feels really balanced and has a few roles they can fill. Gear hunting is great because there's actual game-changing abilities on the gear that can dictate how you are going to be playing the character. There's more game modes and difficulty options that can keep you entertained and on your toes. Also, they Devs really put an emphasis on ""use more than one character or else you will fail"". Like I said, you won't be sitting here building with a mage and afking wave after wave. In this game, it just isn't good enough. You need to find your combos and create/build characters that synergize. Have one character throwing oil while your mage is igniting them with his flame towers and stuff like that. It's a good twist. Not to mention there's no more stupid helicopters flying in and dropping ogres from random places on the map, or spiders that drop down from the sky out of nowhere to sabotage your builds. All in all, this is a solid game and I can definitely say it's a step in the right direction. Worth playing, hands down. My only real complaint is the strength of the DLC characters. The summoner and EV2 just don't belong in this game at the power they're currently at. The summoner is a step above all of the original 4 in terms of straight dps output. It takes a lot for others to compete with his tower strength and utility. However, EV2 is just absurd. Without gear and using one ability, EV2 can solo campaign mode on normal at lvl 13. Then she can solo nightmare 3 at lvl 30. At level 50 with around 300 gear score, EV2 is easily putting out about 300k dps. A hunter with straight hero dmg and ability power is only pumping out around 50k, but it requires double the gear score. That being said, EV2 is reaching levels of damage that SHOULD NOT be attainable in this game! SHE NEEDS AN IMMEDIATE NERF. Proton beams allow her to sit on the crystal and shoot halfway across the map and clear lanes with ease. Levels that should be challenging are just turned into minor inconveniences with her on your squad. She takes the fun out of the game because people who play her just don't have to actually PLAY the game. They don't need to find/build the synergy between their heroes, they don't need to farm gear and hunt for specific abilities. They don't need to balance stats or even move. They are able to push into the endgame with ease, and it's disgusting. By making these DLC characters as strong as they are, the Devs are just straight disrespecting the game they made. Playing a monk (whose towers are completely underwelming and weak) to playing EV2 or the summoner is just disgusting. Personally, I'm waiting for the barbarian to come back (shouldn't have even taking this long, in my opinion).

								Complete garbage.Developers can't even get the ""menu"" right.Instead of clicking somewhere to do something, you run around as if this was a mmo.Imagine league of legends, and to queue, you have to run with teemo, over a crappy map, to some npc, and tell him you wanna do a 5 vs 5...Even character switching requires an NPC, one that i can't find. Made a test character, played one game, wanted to try another character, tried to get back to the character selection screen, 30 minutes later i ragequit. Completely idiotic design. HAVING A ""START GAME"" BUTTON IS A GOOD THING!YOU DON'T NEED TO MAKE EVERYTHING INTO A NPC!!!Literally the only things you can do without that dumb tavern, is start, quit, select EU / US and the options menu...No matter how good that first level looks, THOSE developers are NOT capable of making a good game, save your money.

								I want to like this game, but without knowing what the game's content is about, I can't. The main issue I had was performance issues, not the usual kind of fps issues that people are complaining about on the forums, but there was few troubles just trying to get the game launched.On my first try, I clicked the Play button in the launcher, then nothing happened. When I sorted programs by RAM usage in the Task Manager, I found out that the .exe was the the bottom of the list, so I had to force close it.My second try got a step further, which got me relieved. However, the DD2 logo appeared, then the whole thing froze. Appeared as ""Not Responding"" RAM usage doesn't cost as much as running Steam.I decided to give myself a final try. Sadly the result I got was the same.You might say:The game's in closed alpha - give the developers some time. Um, how about no. Since its launch date, the developers had 9 months to work on the game, but nothing was done in terms of performance optimisation/bug extermination?My PC is not up to its performance requirements. You may be right.  Either that or the requirements listed on the store page is giving out false information. "

								Hard to review this one, as a fan of the original. Where to begin? Well...let's start off with what I don't like.The game is quite a bit easier. The maps are visually more interesting to look at and have more full 3D depth to them, which makes them interesting to run around in at times. But each lane is identified for you immediately, and the maps are designed in such a way that you can't have an ""aha!"" moment as you discover a way to place a single tower to cover multiple choke-points. Either the developer placed the chokepoint for you and pointed you right to it, or the chokepoint doesn't exist. This can help to eliminate the feeling of ""trial and error"" gameplay that existed in the first game, but it also means you can never feel like you're outsmarting the developer when you find a good way to place your towers.In some ways, this doesn't necessarily change the final feeling of the game, as in the first one, once you figured it out, you always placed towers in the best spots. I suppose this makes it easier to play the game in public groups or with friends that don't really play video games the same way you do, but it makes all of the maps feel a little samey after awhile, because you never get to experience that first moment of wonder as you treat the map like a puzzle to be solved.The pricing of the cosmetic items is...quite high. I find myself learning to enjoy the default skins, since purchasing the outfits i'd like would quickly put this game at a higher price than an off the shelf, AAA title. I don't have a problem with the microtransactions themselves, I think it'd just be nicer if they were a little more ""micro"" so I could get a few skins and not feel like i'm getting robbed.Now on to what's been improved!The new hero-deck system will (eventually) prevent a single player from effectively filling every role. Playing with friends in the first game could be quite difficult at times, because you were capable of leveling up and gearing out the entire cast, and placing every tower type. Your friends could quickly outgrow you, and if you didn't play a ranger or barbarian, there was little reason for you to be in the game with such a person, since their towers would be better than what you could make. Being limited to a certain number of heroes encourages you to work together - once there are more hero types than there are deck slots, you'll need at least two players to do everything. It's forced co-op sure, but at least you can always be useful to your friends, since you can bring something that they cannot.The way they introduce new unit types as mini-bosses feels good. Later maps and harder difficulties can repeatedly spawn mini-boss versions of these enemies too. Since there are a lot of things that can define an enemy (such as movement speed, walking or flying, special attacks, resistances), they keep your defenses in check and ensure that everyone has something to contribute. Defenses and your attentiveness get tested as each lane fights to divert your attention across the map. The new, proper bosses feel a lot more interesting than all of the bosses from the first game, too. They have mechanics that make them more than a ""bullet sponge"", and it was an excellent move making them a bit of an outside force that interacts with the map and the waves in interesting ways, instead of just being placed awkwardly and requiring that you blindly hit it with regular attacks and awkwardly placed towers.The aesthetics of the game are sweet. Everything is much nicer to look at.I think my biggest complaint is that I just wish the game was harder. Not in a ""just make the numbers bigger"" way, but that the maps were actually more interesting to play. It feels like the entire campaign is a tutorial to get you acclimated to the games mechanics. The maps never seem to get nearly as complex or interesting as they were in the first game....The revisited maps in 'the harbinger awakens' content update come closer and are definitely more fun than the maps that came before it, which gives me hope for the future. You really can't go wrong with ""free"" though, and I can see myself losing a few more evenings as I continue to play this with my fiancÃ©e. But ultimately, I don't think either of us will be sinking dozens or even hundreds of hours into it like we did the first time around.			"

								I am not disapointed.At first i thought it would feel like very diffirent game.Played it for myself, and it feels really great!I remember the nostalgic feeling of Dungeon Defenders (1).As i said - for now it looks cool. ""Cinematics"" improved very much, as well as graphic.It really brought back good old memories. Also, you can see some references or easter eggs - for example ""it's dangerous to go alone, take this"".The only bad thing is that i feel like they try to change Player's Interface so much without bigger purpose, while older Interface was easy, clean and basicly good looking.As for Alpha i rate this game 8/10, i hope they don't screw it up.Psst... I hope they will add something exclusive for people that bought DD 1.			"

								Like tower defense?Like loot (lots of loot)?Like RPGS?Like 4 varied classes?This is the game for you!It combines the thrill of an action rpg and loot with tower defense elements. Really addicting, and really fun! Just beating the campaign is only the start. After beating it you unlock harder scenarios of the maps you've played with new loot drops and a chance at higher quality items. Did I mention that there's no ""pay to progress"" paywall in place? Well, there isn't. Almost everything with the exception of some purely cosmetic costumes, and a few pets are achieveable just from playing the game. I highly recommend this to everyone!10/10 would fight monsters beside friends again :D			"

								The game is amazing, because it has the same concepts as DD1, but does feel like a different game. Just as enjoyable as the first game. I realize this game is in Alpha stage (even though it feels like it's been forever, and DD1 took forever to come out fully). I'll give a positive review, because it's a great game, but there's one problem...The jump button barely works if you're using an XBox controller. I loved DD1, and played it with a controller, and loved it. Now, when I'm in the middle of a battle, trying to do what needs to be done, I can't even get around my towers because the jump button is so bugged out! I even end up dying sometimes because I fall in a pit, because the jump button doesn't register.I think the problem might be because the ""A"" button does other things, so I've tried to remap the jump button to something else... But the remapping aspect of the controller menu doesn't work!The game is absolutely amazing, and IF they fix this problem, I will totally love it, and probably play it just as much as I did DD1 (250 hours). However, if they don't fix this, I'll probably give up after a while because it's just so infuriating.			"

								Pros:- Mixes RPG and Tower Defense together which diversifies and gives the game a unique playstyle.- Unlock 4 classes for free.- 2 playstyles which you can build each class the way you want. (i.e. building or fighting which the game will explain).- You can switch classes based on how they are built. (i.e. At the end of a wave switch to a class that you have specialized to be a builder, then switch to a class you've built to be a fighter after you're done building.- The stat points and the equipment also support the way you want to specialize your classe in.- Simultaneously gain experience and levels for all the other heroes when only using one, this helps for grinding.- Afraid that you're alone or it's too difficult? Worry not, you can play multiplayer or go off to be a lone wolf.- Has an auto collect system where it does the equipment collecting for you.- You get 4 bags which hold equipment.- Dying doesn't punish besides respawn timer.- Challenging for those who want it.- You can play with friends.Cons:- VERY grindy- Requires you to use your brain as does every TD game- Not very F2P as grinding and playing a lot will only be the way to advance- Time consuming- Only 4 main classes are available as free, (Squire, Monk, Huntress, and Apprentice) the others you must grind a lot for or buy with gems.- A LOT of things require gems such as costumes or skins for your characters and getting pets.- NO guilds or clubs for people looking to socialize and work with others.- Gets quite boring after grinding for many hours.TLDR; Don't play if you don't have a lot of free time and don't expect the game to be full F2P as it requires gems for a lot of things, otherwise the game is unique, thrilling, and challenging.

Of course its still in alpha, so bugs are to be expected.I hope that they do as well as they did with the original DD.I give it an 11/10 for now.My rating WILL change as time progresses.UPDATE: I now give this wonderful game a 12/10			"

								Great game but there are some pros and cons that i want to point out before buying/getting the game if it becomes p2p again. (it was f2p in alpha if you're reading this in the future lol)Pros: Play with friendsGet Stronger as you level upMake new friendsGet insane gearCons:Enemies stay in spawn and kill your defenses (probably will be fixed soon)Bosses are too easy at the last waveWhen you invite a friend to your game, they don't get a green mana chestInaccurate thumbs up thumbs down symbols for items7/10 "

								This game is a SCAM.I paid full price early on because of my obsession/love for the original Dungeon Defenders.  I'm not sure if Bill Cosby is the lead developer, but at this point I definitely feel like I've been violated.This sequel is nothing more than an outright cash grab.  So much cash has been made from the orginal game's faithful that this company had been able to purchase enough fake reviews to make it appear decent.I really wish I could get my money back...or at least the home addresses for everyone involved in making this game.  (I'd be sending them cases of random chinese junk similar to this game.)UGH			"

								Dungeon Defenders is a good game and I love it, but there is something that doesn't work properly. I went to the tavern after a match when suddenly I came to the hero creation site, and i couldn't get out. And I noticed that the connection to the servers isn't very good.This game is one of my favorite games and I love it but these two things annoys me really much. And there is more things that is annoying, but I choosed these two because they annoy me the most.But I think this game is good and it will be better in the future because its just an Alpha.

								ATM No, The game doesn't have a true direction and is constant change. Game feels to linear and only provides a few days of fun after each patch, a TD game usually tends to not be as fun after each map playthrough. Going Open Alpha shortly id recomend you wait for that, as good graphically as the game and costumes are, the game experience is lacking.with a few more modes for longevity, some competitive modes and more maybe (they could look into other custom maps on wc3 for idea's.)The game can become great, it has potential. But its all round the place and patches are very sporadic and feel un-tested.Edit.Came back for a bit games still bad if not worse (aside from weapons) with a even more horrible patch called ""Carnival"" and patches that came with mroe bugs than fix's. Im looking forward to New heroes, but even more core rebalance and the hero deck change. I'll probably be back again after core rebalance hopefully its good enough for me to change my review then.Edit.2017 now, feels worse than before.			"

								First off, this game is absolutely different from Dungeon Defenders 1. This isn't to say that it's a bad game, just don't go into it thinking you can pull the same stunts as the last game. You are not going to be afk farming in this game. You will be out on the battlefield holding down the fort and defending with all of you character abilities. Every original character feels really balanced and has a few roles they can fill. Gear hunting is great because there's actual game-changing abilities on the gear that can dictate how you are going to be playing the character. There's more game modes and difficulty options that can keep you entertained and on your toes. Also, they Devs really put an emphasis on ""use more than one character or else you will fail"". Like I said, you won't be sitting here building with a mage and afking wave after wave. In this game, it just isn't good enough. You need to find your combos and create/build characters that synergize. Have one character throwing oil while your mage is igniting them with his flame towers and stuff like that. It's a good twist. Not to mention there's no more stupid helicopters flying in and dropping ogres from random places on the map, or spiders that drop down from the sky out of nowhere to sabotage your builds. All in all, this is a solid game and I can definitely say it's a step in the right direction. Worth playing, hands down. My only real complaint is the strength of the DLC characters. The summoner and EV2 just don't belong in this game at the power they're currently at. The summoner is a step above all of the original 4 in terms of straight dps output. It takes a lot for others to compete with his tower strength and utility. However, EV2 is just absurd. Without gear and using one ability, EV2 can solo campaign mode on normal at lvl 13. Then she can solo nightmare 3 at lvl 30. At level 50 with around 300 gear score, EV2 is easily putting out about 300k dps. A hunter with straight hero dmg and ability power is only pumping out around 50k, but it requires double the gear score. That being said, EV2 is reaching levels of damage that SHOULD NOT be attainable in this game! SHE NEEDS AN IMMEDIATE NERF. Proton beams allow her to sit on the crystal and shoot halfway across the map and clear lanes with ease. Levels that should be challenging are just turned into minor inconveniences with her on your squad. She takes the fun out of the game because people who play her just don't have to actually PLAY the game. They don't need to find/build the synergy between their heroes, they don't need to farm gear and hunt for specific abilities. They don't need to balance stats or even move. They are able to push into the endgame with ease, and it's disgusting. By making these DLC characters as strong as they are, the Devs are just straight disrespecting the game they made. Playing a monk (whose towers are completely underwelming and weak) to playing EV2 or the summoner is just disgusting. Personally, I'm waiting for the barbarian to come back (shouldn't have even taking this long, in my opinion). However, if he's even half as  broken as EV2 while the other original 4 stay at the same terrible weakness they're at, then this game is going into the recycle bin.			"

								The game is fun, you can put the towers pretty much anywhere (not just at specific points), and it's free to play.I really only have one issue, but it's a huge one. First let me preface this by stating that my ISP is absolutely terrible, so my internet is only decent in a small window shortly after midnight. So I thought I would at least get to play this game by myself, and then when we get a chance, my friends and I could play together. Nope. Even when I'm alone, in a private session, the game is laggy and unplayable.If you have a good, reliable internet connection and enjoy tower defense games, then give it a try. If your internet sucks, it's not worth the hassle.			"

								Have you played a tower defense game before?- Of course it's grindy- Of course it's repetitiveDungeon Defenders 2 is an action hack n slash/tower defense.  It is a type of game that you play on a weekday afternoon for a couple of hours until you get sick of it. Then you do it again next week.Those 10k dragon medals are simple to get.  Just play the game like a normal person.  I only played the game for a few hours these past 2 weeks and I didnt even realised I got 1.5k dragon medals.People these days whine like babies on even the slightest hint of grind.			"

								This is a fun game to play for a few weeks, then jump back to it and see the changes they have made. Constant upgrades are nice, with a good community of players. Since I have started playing, 2 new characters have been added (and more are still on the way), new maps, weapons, armor, and pets have been added.My only complaint with the game is that the story mode ends fairly quickly (about 10 hours of gameplay), then it cycles back through all the maps again on a harder difficulty. Therefore making it a bit repetative to play consistantly. That being said, I still do enjoy playing the game and would recommend it to others.			"

								TLDR at bottom: Do you like Tower Defense? Do you like multiple difficulty and balanced gameplay for all heroes? well you won't find that here! At first its great fun playing with a friend, the amount of diversity of gear and item sphere's to modify all aspects of your characters, the real feel of ""oh i don't have to pay anything and can be just as good as anyone else"" until you get to the end game. Level 50, new patch comes out ""Power Up Update"" promises to balance old heroes to stand up with the newer ""Paid"" heroes, promise gleemingly seems true as all heroes became stronger than ever to a point that you could throw your towers out the window and purely focus on hero defense. But i hear you saying why the negative review? Surely this is an amazing game that you can blow countless hours at and feel constant rewards and satisfaction, well yes it is at first. After 3 days of this Power Up Update the nerf bats came in strong, nerfing new content that made the original 4 characters viable in Nightmare IV Difficulty, You would still get one shot and had to have the best gear available to stand a chance but now without your dps you then have to rely on your towers. So the issue here is even with full ipw 700 gear for the squire and the 125k gold sphere's for the monk to increase blockade hp to its absolute maximum you get to around 580k hp, seems like a lot yeah? well the Orc Blockades From the Abyss Lord in similar gear have 1.5 million hp and deal almost 4x the damage. Then onto dps, my monk was doing 700k dps single target similar to the new ""Gun Witch"" in similar gear another Paid hero,, now you can technically ""unlock"" these characters in game via doing a daily for 200 coins per day, and around 20 per nightmare dungeon, so thats 2 solid months to unlock a new hero that starts at level 1 or pay $20 to get it today and another $40 to get a full kit of legendary gear and level 50, The problem here is normal heroes in the best Nightmare IV ipwr 700 dps gear all do around 60-70k dps with the squire doing around 30k whilst all of the paid heroes do 10x the damage and have 3x to health. Nightmare IV is by design isn't meant to be doable with the original 4 characters regardless of gear or skill level.TLDR: Decisively Pay to win, Given hero buffs and take them away after 3 days due to no testing, server unstable crashing 4x a night 3 nights in a row when releasing the new patch, unable to download new patch, no support, no response from tickets/bug reports in game or email, all backers got shafted.The one kick in the face that you get for gaining max level 50? 200 ""paid"" gems that aren't enough to purchase ANYTHING WITH!? This feels more like ransomware than a game at this point.			"

								Yeah its a fun game, everything CAN be obtainable if you play long enough, like for heros. If you buy one hero, it will give you an extra slot. Therefore everyone can have every hero. It's just gonna take you while to get 10000 defender medals. (12000 for new released one) Um... What else can I say... OH this game is very fun with friends. One tip for playing this game or any game actually. Enjoy the game rather than rushing to end game content, it'll ruin your experience on the early stages on the game.

								As many here I loved Dungeon Defenders: the loot grind, tower defense, character builds, and the general carefree game play of it was loads of fun. So naturally I was super happy when I saw Dungeon Defenders 2 was being developed, and waited patiently for its early access. For the first few months things were great, it lacked content but it felt like Dungeon Defenders and things were looking good. Up until a few updates ago the game started to take a sharp turn for worse. Poison turret hunter got deleted I think and overpriced and unbalanced heroes made the game seem cheap. It seems like the games more after your wallet than it is after your time. I get that developing a game takes stacks of cash, but if people feel like their getting ripped for their micro transactions they'd just rather not play at all. All said I do really wish the developers would focus on making their game fun alongside good advertisement to fund the game instead of inflating their content prices. I truly do believe it would benefit everyone.			"

Terraria update added ALOT of what I wanted, but with me having all default characters max level and max gear, I feel no need to play.			"

								I stopped playing this game a while back and thought I would let it progress and see how much better it is down the line....... ohh boy was I wrong I can't even clear 1 map it seems the focus of the game switched from tower defense to hero defense.  Is it me or does the towers do nothing, I use to play a squire and set up my defense with towers mainly and that was fun for me because thats the way I wanted to play it..... now I can't even clear anything the tower system sucks my towers don't do enough damage the range is utter garbage..... wow this game turned around for the worse I thought it was really good last year but how the dev's messed up real bad in my opinion anyway.  They should take out the tag on this game being a ""Tower Defense"" its more like a hack and slash now			"

								Free to play in every sense of the word. Pets need to be fed with a special item, which you can buy with money, or with in game moey (at fastly increased prices) but DOES drops... sometimes. New characters need to be bought, anything beyond the first 4 at least.Chests drop that you need to buy keys for (this is by far the most aggregious of the examples IMO)If you had just made this game pay to play, as Dungeon Defenders 1 was, this game would have been at the top of my list in fun games to play. It's a shame, too, they made a lot of improvements to the game over DD1. (They stil have player collision with other players though, such an oversight in a multiplayer coop game.) A shame indeed.Do not play this game. It will waste your time, as you need to spend more money than the game is actually worth to get any enjoyment out of it.			"

								So many things went wrong in execution. It took many great features from the first game and then split them into a microtransaction format. Not necessarily a horrible thing, except they made it unusually expensive to have; almost like someone thought people will pay the ridiculous prices solely from loving the first game.Of the things it kept in, they expanded in poor ways. The larger environments don't have anything to keep them going. One thing about the first game was how tight and well designed its levels were, but that's gone now. It's like the microtransaction model was made to rely on past players, but the design doesn't attract them.			"

The only thing this game is missing is a really good story, to me the story seems pretty boring and doesn't have much character voice, if the game had characters that talk, and a story that grips you in, it would be really amazing. Also if the items like armor and relics would render onto the player that would be awesome. In total the game is really great and fun.			"

								The game is great when I can play. I'll get into the game no problem then after I complete a match and attempt to exit to tavern. The game gets stuck in ""Searching for Session"" and I have to force close the game 9/10 times. The one time it does happen to work I have to click go to hub, wait for the the searching for session to bring me to an error screen three times. Then it will finally bring me to hub. However, I'm unable to join any game from the war table. So I'm forced to exit the game to desktop and re launch the app.I did some research on this and this seems like an ongoing issue since launch. I opened all the ports, turned off firewall, re-installed. Nothing seems to work.Will change review once patched or fixed.			"

Which is kind of cool considering you have around 10 champs you can all take to level 50. I can see where this game can become a grind2win game, but personally, I'm ok with that.

 Deep review This is a towerdefense game of a 3rd person view. I would say this game can be comapred to diablo series. Because of the loot system and the grinding involved into it. So lets start of picking your 4 heroes, each hero has its own kit/style. Mage The mage has a  LOT  of aoe spells and places turrets that also deal aoe dmg. Hes ranged and builds turrets pretty well (The mage has a freeze turret that helps pretty well in defense also because his normal turrets deal aoe dmg he can easy deal a lot more dmg). The weapon he uses i a staff.  Fighter The fighter is a mele class hero and uses of course a sword. He can build small walls better than others (they deal dmg when someone tries to destroy them).  Hunter The hunter places traps that can CC (Crow Control: Stuns, Slows, Silence etc). Also some just deal dmg. She places turrets that can poision the target for a small amout of time. She is ranged and uses a bow. Monk I like to call him lee sin  Because in league of legends lee sin is a blind monk  . Hes weapon is a staff but different from the mages cuz he is mele. He can create totems that will heal you or buff your turrets. Gameplay As i said this is a towerdefense game with where you can roam freely building your towers and walls to not let the enemies get pass you and break the core. You have crystals (green crystals is like your building material and blue is more like your mana to let you use spells). There is a limit on how much building you can build in the field so if a person uses all that liming to build only in one lane and dosent want to destroy it youre screwd.The  loot  system is almost the same as diablo (if not the same). A big amount of grinding is nessecay for leveling up and getting the best loot. Most of the loot you get are usefull at start but at the end game lvl 38 for example, 95% of the loot you get will be useless and is just junk that you sell. Even if you get a legendary it might be useless, someway because of the level cuz youre grinding on low levels and somethimes just of its stats.So lets talk about  XP . At the start its easy to level up as you proceed the campain but after youre done it will get easier. To unlock the insane difficulty and nightmare, nightmare 2 and so on. You have to complete the called quests, but the quest are no more than just lvl up to 50 so when youre lvl for example 38, you have to replay ALOT of the same level to get the most xp out of it and do it agan and again and again till you reach lvl 50 and unlock the insane difficulty to get better loot. Here is where i think is a big gap and alot of people thinking of quiting when they reach this certain point. You can see that the developmers has helped a bit and added daily exp to the first finishing missions. But on the other hand there is still something missing. That gap from lvl (exmpl) 38 to lvl 50 takes a lot of time of replayability so i think that the devolopers can add something into that like for exaple letting them acces the unlimited modes at a lower level than at 40 and still keeping the insane difficulty there. I think that would at least do something (if not fix it). Co-Op  is in this game and i highly recommend playing this game with a friend. You can still solo it and do well. But plaing multiplayer is easier because heroes in this game has a great synergy with each others for example lee sin (Monk class) can create totems that gives your turret a lot of power and a significantly increase in dmg. Free2Pay As the develpers are saying its NOT a pay2win game. Right now you can only use special money on cosmetics and chests that you find as loot. The chest CAN have very good loot but often dosent and just gives you a small boost on your items (Other words: you get better loot but not too far away from what you had). I hope this systems will stay as the realise comes. Development The game patches is pretty common and i mean it. There was a patch yesterday and a patch today. Those patches arent that big BUT add small features that the community requested. For example the sort panel on bags that wasent before todays patch. You can see (or read) with your own eyes that the developers react to their community and helps. Final verdict I dont mind grinding and farming for loot like in diablo with a small gap between the hero lvl. Graphics are ok for a free to play game and port is well optimised. This game is specialy good to play with friends but you can still solo it. The developers are nice and  hear  the community.I give this game a  8/10  "

								TLDR at bottom: Do you like Tower Defense? Do you like multiple difficulty and balanced gameplay for all heroes? well you won't find that here! At first its great fun playing with a friend, the amount of diversity of gear and item sphere's to modify all aspects of your characters, the real feel of ""oh i don't have to pay anything and can be just as good as anyone else"" until you get to the end game. Level 50, new patch comes out ""Power Up Update"" promises to balance old heroes to stand up with the newer ""Paid"" heroes, promise gleemingly seems true as all heroes became stronger than ever to a point that you could throw your towers out the window and purely focus on hero defense. But i hear you saying why the negative review? Surely this is an amazing game that you can blow countless hours at and feel constant rewards and satisfaction, well yes it is at first. After 3 days of this Power Up Update the nerf bats came in strong, nerfing new content that made the original 4 characters viable in Nightmare IV Difficulty, You would still get one shot and had to have the best gear available to stand a chance but now without your dps you then have to rely on your towers. So the issue here is even with full ipw 700 gear for the squire and the 125k gold sphere's for the monk to increase blockade hp to its absolute maximum you get to around 580k hp, seems like a lot yeah? well the Orc Blockades From the Abyss Lord in similar gear have 1.5 million hp and deal almost 4x the damage. Then onto dps, my monk was doing 700k dps single target similar to the new ""Gun Witch"" in similar gear another Paid hero,, now you can technically ""unlock"" these characters in game via doing a daily for 200 coins per day, and around 20 per nightmare dungeon, so thats 2 solid months to unlock a new hero that starts at level 1 or pay $20 to get it today and another $40 to get a full kit of legendary gear and level 50, The problem here is normal heroes in the best Nightmare IV ipwr 700 dps gear all do around 60-70k dps with the squire doing around 30k whilst all of the paid heroes do 10x the damage and have 3x to health. Nightmare IV is by design isn't meant to be doable with the original 4 characters regardless of gear or skill level.TLDR: Decisively Pay to win, Given hero buffs and take them away after 3 days due to no testing, server unstable crashing 4x a night 3 nights in a row when releasing the new patch, unable to download new patch, no support, no response from tickets/bug reports in game or email, all backers got shafted.The one kick in the face that you get for gaining max level 50? 200 ""paid"" gems that aren't enough to purchase ANYTHING WITH!? This feels more like ransomware than a game at this point.			"

								I played 800+ hours at DD1 and as Trendy totally gave up on it (no bug fixes, no new maps), I was super excited to hear there was a DD2. But after being release (in early access, which is still the case now) the reviews were pretty mixed, especially from the ones that players DD1. So I waited a few months hoping the game will use the same magic recipe as DD1 and will be an improvement.As the game was on sale, I decided to get it and give it a try hoping I will have a tremendous number of hours coming on. Unfortunately after 20 hours on it I was pretty disappointed and don't understand why Trendy made so many bad changes:PRO:- better graphics- details on monsters for the incoming wave- can see your defenses range by holding the Shift key.and to be honest that's pretty much it.CONS:- right after getting the game I wasn't able to join any public game, the servers weren't working properly. Seems to have gone better but it seems like that's a recurring issue. Even joining the public tavern sometimes doesn't work.- 4 heroes with 4 towers, compared to 8 x 5. They might add some more later on but right now we are missing a lot on diversity.- the stats system has totally changed and is so confusing: gear rating/comparison doesn't seem right, can't boost particular stats anymore (you've to find objects with stats you want), we've lost the range stats (no more high-range harpons).- this game will become a free to play (Yeah!) but some upgrades will require real money (Boooo!)- most of the shortcuts have changed from DD1- DD1 was having a listing of all games and it was easy to join the party you felt will be fun to play (map/mode/difficulty). Now you just join a public tavern and have to select a map+difficulty and you might join a starting game or it will create a new game (and if you quit/cancel right away you are loosing social points, wth!?)So far I haven't had any fun playing DD2, I might try to continue leveling up (I've 3 heroes lvl 20) to see if it gets better and unlock some other maps but I'm seriously considering going back to DD1...

								In short, Dungeon Defenders II would have been a good game, had DD1 not existed.The game is quite close to a neutral level to me, however I still can't recommend it much. That said, if there was an indifferrent option, I would select tht instead. Dungeon Defenders 2 is a decent game in its own right, although certain controls can be more complicated and somewhat difficult to remember. For some gamers, myself included, controller support is a must-have, however DD2 lacks this and uses a keyboard and mouse only. Unlike DD1, it's a generally more complicated game, in that the maps are slightly more complicated and use more paths to make things harder. That said, the game is generally easier if you've played DD1 or DDE.As a rating, I give DD2 a 4/10, because it isn't a bad game, but it dismisses some redeeming factors and negates their usage, such as the forementioned controller. The game is still early access, and as such, I would call it one to watch, and with any such improvement, my review may change to recommendation.			"

								To start my review, I'd like to say that I'm very disappointed by the devs of the game. I paid the full price of the game before it got moved to free to play.

But for free to play, it's a good game to sink a few hours in. Playing this game is a pain in theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥unless you wanna try doing way too strong maps with undergeared equipment in order to gain the equipment you would've needed to do the level the normal way.Do not spend any money on this. Do spend your time downloading and playing it.It's definitely a great free to play game. Do not expect it to be like DD1, it isn't. And I don't mean this in a good way.			"

								Dun Def 2 is still in alpha but right now It's pretty neat. The event stuff for halloween was fun. We have our four base classes back like the Squire, Huntress, Apprentice, and the Monk. They all play similarly to the original game. I just wish the game had mmore boss fight throughout the campaign. Like in the original game there would be a nice big boss every so few levels. Now there is only a final boss at the last level and the campaign simply introduces new enemy types as if they were bosses when they will be regular mobs later on and in the harder difficulty/modes.Its still got a ways to go. I also know people are eager to see what classes will be added, as well as more maps for modes like Incursion and Onslaught.Still pretty nice for an Alpha at the moment.			"

But after playing a bit more, and getting used to the changes, this has become one of my favorite changes in DD2.I have been around for quite a while, and I am still having fun.Trendy entertainment, thank you for making one of my favorite games in recent memory.Also, anybody who reads this, remember:This game is STILL in early access. It's not finished yet.			"

								It seems the game was walkaing forward when it was alpha being that i could actually play the game. But now the game is out of alpha and free but now I can't launch the game... Looked for a fix and saw threads upon threads with the issues in numerous ways and most have been left unanswered, No matter ho great the detail or the persistence of the player.			"

								When I first got this game I was having framerate issues when trying to play, I started out with high because thats how i run most games but had to quickly drop to low in order to run at 10-15 fps. After talking with some of the devs as well as other players we were able to get things fixed for me and I was able to get the game running smoothly. Ths is one of my favorite series to play with friends on xbox so I'm super happy I was able to get things running on here. Thanks for the help devs!			"

								    I have played this line of games since Trendy first started the dungeon defenders series and will continue to as long as they make them. It is a very interesting game to me because i like the challenge and the grind factor that seems to be endless. I like the progression level of the game as well wiht the exception of the massive increase between nm3 and nm4. Now that said there a few things that need to be addressed with the game like the supposed fixes that cause more problems than they fix and the push to rush new content that is incomplete or broken. i am sure that most would rather have quality over quantity. This problems seems to derive from the fact they want to sell something new to you to keep the money rolling which is understandable but its not worth it to pay for something that doesnt work since they keep coming up with new things to sell you without fixing what they have already sold. It is a great game and i hope that they keep producing but would like to see more solid fixes and updates as well as better balancing.			"

								This game is absolutely fantastic.  It's beautiful and loads of fun.The ratings for the game reflected that, too, until March 24th when Trendy decided to sue an ex-employee who had violated his contract.  And then people started to rate the game badly.  Seriously, go look at the ratings prior to the 24th and then the avalanche of ratings on the 24th that announced how horrible that is.  BTW, nothing significant changed about the game on the 24th.So we have a bunch of liars, basically, who are willing to claim that this fine game sucks because they don't like what the company is doing elsewhere.

								Graphics:- Nice comic-style with a lot of bright colors, resulting in a very ""warm/lovely"" atmosphere- A lot of variation in maps for example old dungeons, green fields, gigantic sewers, burning cities, spooky forests or a throne room and there is much more! New maps are constantly added, each with their own layout and theming.- The characters are designed with a lot of love for details and they all look very different from each other. You can also buy skins with ingame currency to give you a bit more variation.-> Overall one of the biggest pros for me are the graphics. I could stare hours into the beautiful landscapes and also write hours about it ;)Balance/Bugs/Ingame Currency-> Trendy constantly adds new content to the game, so they can have all features they want as quickly as possible, but this also results in a lot of bugs. The worst bugs get fixed quickly. The balance issues are not that bad in early stages of the game, but in the endgame there are only a few viable towers/characters. IÂ´m sure the balance will get fixed, since most of the old characters will get reworked soon to be as good as the new ones. The ingame currency is fine. You can get some skins and additional inventory slots with it, but nothing that would give you an advantage in the game.Gameplay:- A lot of variation in maps, difficulties, items and characters. You can even equip spheres to boost your character to the max. or take a pet to help you in battle- Tons of enemies, each with their own strengths and some with special abilitiess- The normal gamemode is nice and balanced and will take you a good amount of time to reach the last difficulties.- The second gamemode is named ""onslaught"" and is basically an endless mode. The gamemode is fun but does not provide good rewards at the end. IÂ´m sure they will make some work on this gamemode soon.- The third and last gamemode is named ""incursion"" and is a much harder version of the map you choose. The gamemode is very challenging and is okey so far. But they currently work on adding a different task for each map and a unique reward if you win. There is already one map with this concept and iÂ´m very happy with it.- Daily missions/monthly missions have good rewards and are well done.- Characters all have their own playstyle and look.I could write on for hours, because there is so much more to talk about, but i wanted to keep it short and just give you an idea of the current state of the game!  Result:-> The fantastic graphics, love to details and the variety of characters, pets, enemies and maps, make this one of my favorite games. I spent over 440 hours on this game so far and donÂ´t regret anything. The Trendy team is friendly and listens to the community. Constant patches with new characters, challenges, maps and much more keep the game interesting and fun. Just keep in mind that the game is in development and still contains some bugs and balance issues, but overall I can totally recommend you to test it out yourself, you wonÂ´t regret it!!			"

								It's DD1 with upgraded visuals. Very enjoyable. For a while.It lacks all the little things, the depth, that makes you want to keep playing the game beyond the first 10-15 hours.In DD1, you could really delve into stats, builds, and have fun with varied maps and challenges. Plus, there was an actual feel of progression. Here, you grind through a lvl 30 map until you get to the level cap (50), simply because it's better than any other gamemode or map when it comes to XP per hour per effort.In truth, if DD2 didn't kill all activity on DD1, I'd still be playing DD1.This game is not an improvement. It's a dumbed down game with better graphics.But the potentional is there.			"

								This game is Balance HellWith the release of the new Abyss Lord of Overpowered Doom and the constant nerf to all other classes, it is super obvious.You can be happy when you get a tower with 7k DPS that has a 30%ish splash range of 1 meter at level 1.Abyss Lord gets a 2 way shooting tower with superior range and about 25k DPS level 1, but hey.. its single target, duuuuuuhSure, so is Squire Cannonball tower, but that does not shoot 2 ways -.- and that also tops at like 8k dps level 1If players can say ""Oh once you hit nightmare 2 (nightmare 4 is max), you can't do levels SOLO with Abyss lord anymore"" and I think to myself, ""Oh yeah, mage stopped doing that after Hard""It is to be expected, that they will nerf the new hero very soon and then you will know that it was just a big big power grab for money			"

								Games like these are the ones that you would spend the whole day playing, but since this is only alpha and not the full release, your area and items are limited, but there are alot to choose from. Although, your time on playing the game isn't that fun after you crash. For me I keep crashing for every 6 to 7 hours, then I have to do a process to get back to the game. Right now, when you crash, it might say that your game is still running when you try to retart Dungeon defenders 2. I sort of found a way to get back to your game again, but even if you do the process,the game will still crash. Overall, this game is fun, really fun and especially with your friends, but it can be ruined when your game suddenly crashed and you can't get back on it.  I hope the developers see this and try to fix the problem. For now, I recomend this game if you're willing to play it even though it crashes.			"

								I really liked this game, was a huge fan of DD1 when it was still new but here updates broke it its not challenging what so ever the gameplay is either you play alone on a map wich can be pretty fun if you dont mind playing a multiplayer game alone but as a group its less boring and at the same time more boring because 1 or 2 people will build their towers at first wave,... done thats it for the entire game you upgrade here and there but you dont have anymore to do.The Ogres wich were supposed to cause stress to the players usually die within seconds, and im not taking 20-30 seconds here im talking of like 2-3 SECONDS! no challenge.I can play my EV2 level 31 with a level 16 weapon not because i want to more like because i have trouble finding a propper replacement and on top of that i dont need it anyway EV2 is basically so strong that you onehit almost anything anyway but because of the ipwr (Gearlevel) you cant go to higher levels so you can choose wearing piece ofâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥gear with high ipwr and play higher difficultys the way you dont wanna play it or youre stuck forever farming items you will probably never find because the lootsystem is broken.Ive found over 500 Items with the same defense stats and maybe 10 or 12 with hero damage. I want hero damage because i want to fight actively when i pick defense power ofc id have some badass towers but in the end badass tower means afk gameplay wtf developers when maxlevel was 25 the lootsystem was balanced you found equally hero and defense stat items now i find the same legendary with useless stats 10 times in a row.... wtf?I know this is early access but the game was full of people when maxlevel was 25 now there are barely 10 lobbys... also the items themselves you find a legendary item level 26 for example then you find a green item level 28 the green item is slightly better wtf? Seriously fix it trendynet!Ive seen a Lavamancer dealing 52 MILLION DAMAGE wtf guys stop adding new content start fixing what youve done until now especially remove the ipwr barricade it does not make any sense !!

								Wow, nice job devsyou made DD series look like those typical, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, f2p tower defenses.I don't think there's something to say about that you actualy made it f2p, after it costed like 10 Euros.And hm, I also don't think that there's something to say about that you didn't gave anything special for players that actually played this game when it wasn't f2p. But there's actually something to say about how unbalanced it is, how boring it is. You don't even need to do something. You're just putting sentries and they're doing the rest. You can literaly wait till you kill everyone. You don't even have to look if they breached defences, cause y'know , no matter where you're gonna put them, they'll do everything anyways. The plus is, you can browse imgur, text with someone on Facebook and don't even bother about the game.very good job devs, you made DD boring and f2p. wow			"

								Problems with parties were here since alpha and i thought that finally it was all fixed oh how innocent i was... As of now i can't join private match that my friend is hosting and he can't join mine. If we try to party in public lobby we either dont see each other in party or cant find session due the timeout. If we party in private lobby we get seperated even if we click ""stay together"" button. This game is supposed to be played with friends but how? Rating : Fix your â¥â¥â¥â¥ finally / 10			"

I uninstalled completely ESET NOD32 for nothing. How do you expect to get a decent review if you can't even start the game...			"

								You know, I used to enjoy this game.  To be honest, it used to be my favorite game, until chaos came out.  I came back after a few months of not playing, due to more recent games like overwatch.  I came back to see that all of my spheres, which made it super fun to play, were deleted.  iPwr, which I spent about 200 hours farming, just to be able to finish Nightmare IV, which is now gone, has been deleted as well.  All of my kits I had spent so long building, and all of the friends I had spent so long gaining, are now gone.  Even my friends are reccomending me to quit, which I might as well do until the previous game I used to love comes back.  My kits for Nightmare IV are still there, just not as effective due to the removal of spheres.  My shields for the squire went from having approximately 500K to 55K.  My Poison Dart Towers went from about 15K dps to 1k dps.  I instantly was furious.  I had spent so much time, just to watch all of my hard work crumble right before me.  I shall not be returning to this game, until I see on the youtube channel that there was an update allowing spheres again.  Thank you to those who read this extensive review, but to be honest, I would not reccomend this game anymore.  Maybe previously, but not now.			"

Early Access Review
								First 2hrs, already impressed. In my opinnion for its current stage is a big improvement from DD1. Hopefully when its on its final release the anti-cheat will stop the hackers. Since it will be free. So far I rate it 8/10. Great game! Must buy if you got the cash!^ 12/13/2014------ Updated Review.Now for a better review as I have more game time.Straight off we will start yes this game is lacking some very needed functions or should I  say core elements for the game, as trading or even just to drop items in your tavern should be in but I am just going to leave that as it's still in Pre Alpha.As you journey on playing the difficulty ""Normal"" on some levels if you are new or unexperienced, the levels seem to be some what difficult for someone new to the game. If you are playing alone that is. As again you are meant to play with people, More people more chance of bonus loot(better loot) 4 Players becomes a large chance of good loot.From DD1, I can say that the towers have been nerfed? That don't seem to feel do as much damage as I would rather expect. I was suprised when they had said there wasn't going to be PvP, slightly dissapointed but it isn't that much of a big deal as I got the game to play with friends. Graphics:In my opinnion I think they are a lot better then the previous dungeon defenders and truly like the new graphcs! But again I miss the more cartoony side of the old DD not sure if that makes sense but can't really explain it. - Overall: 7.5/10Maps:Great maps, so far loved all of them! each map is unique and some what different in a way wether your helping crystals or just a cart. Overall: 9/10AI:AI are great, so far there are some great monsters/enemys to verse in DD2, they have annouced there will be more enemys which is great and excited about that! overall: 6.5/10Towers:So far I've played as Monk, Apprentice and Squire. From what my experiences have been the towers lack power as they had more power in DD1. other then that I really like the desings of some towers that are in the current DD2. Overall 5/10Taverns:It can be quite confusing as there is an ""Entry Tavern"" and a ""Private Tavern"" (Not sure if there was a public tavern as I played in private groups) And going to the war recruiter is a bit annoying as if you have a player thats 1 level below the war recruiters you can't play, I guess it's to stop boosters? Eh overall: 6/10Inventory:Inventory is really basic at the moment all though, the ""Temporary bag""(if your bags full it goes there) just seems to be endless and you can keep getting items not sure if that was intetnional or what. Inventory can be a bit buggy, you can purchase a ""Small Bag"" for $10,000 In-game Credits and a ""Large Bag"" for $50,000 In-Game credits. I am not sure if I like this or not, I haven't purchased one as I don't need it. But seems pretty cool. Each item you get can be transferred to other characters ( just stays in your inv) which is handy as same does your money transfers across, I am not sure what happened but a mate and I both got the game at the same time, played same time and he ended up with $40,000 and I had $13,000 but had collected close to same amount of coins laying around. Not sure what happened. Overall 8.5/10Money system:I like how they approched this, insted of Mana being your currecny it's gold. Which is great! Overall: 8/10Overall:Still think with everything I have mentioned it is a fun game, and it is great to participate in the development of this game. Rating:7/10Worth Buying?:Yes and no. It all really depends on yourself. Do you want to support or just wait?If you want to help development then sure go right ahead, but aside that there are a lot of bug's that will be fixed in the near future hopefully but still great game and I do personally think it's worth buying.

Early Access Review
								Loved Dungeon Defenders I.  Dungeon Defenders II is a steaming pile of poop.  It isn't ready for release to the public at all and I'm very, very unhappy that they charged a fee for a game in this state.  I originally bought the game months ago (it's 7/7/16 now), and as of yesterday the game is still garbage.  I feel insulted and I feel like I was taken advantage of.  I spent more than a decade making games professionally, and what I see in this ""released"" game is horrible.The biggest problem with the first game appears to be that the art direction (which I think is lovely) attracts an incredibly young player base who isn't particularly suited to strategy gameplay.  The sequel seems to be lining up to be the same mess of incredibly young player population who play selfishly rather than cooperatively even at the cost of losing the match, and prefer to have their characters speed leveled by high level games rather than earning their levels and actually learning how to play the character classes and the maps.I wouldnât consider recommending this game to anyone for any reason in its current state.  After the game is actually in a completed state I would recommend it as I would the original game, if you have a player group already assembled who can play together, go for it.  But, as an adult  it isnât worth the time to deal with the immature player population.			"

								A game where you set up defenses and kill monsters with a cartoony graphics style. Fun game but later on enemies become gluttons for pain, enduring massive amounts of damage. Each character feels unique and fun to play. Co-op is not exactly needed considering the fact that every character can hold their own in combat but coop is no doubt enjoyable anyways. It's free so enjoy it but I recommend you get the first game as well because it's pretty fun as well.			"

								Free to play in every sense of the word. Pets need to be fed with a special item, which you can buy with money, or with in game moey (at fastly increased prices) but DOES drops... sometimes. New characters need to be bought, anything beyond the first 4 at least.Chests drop that you need to buy keys for (this is by far the most aggregious of the examples IMO)If you had just made this game pay to play, as Dungeon Defenders 1 was, this game would have been at the top of my list in fun games to play. It's a shame, too, they made a lot of improvements to the game over DD1. (They stil have player collision with other players though, such an oversight in a multiplayer coop game.) A shame indeed.Do not play this game. It will waste your time, as you need to spend more money than the game is actually worth to get any enjoyment out of it.			"

								So many things went wrong in execution. It took many great features from the first game and then split them into a microtransaction format. Not necessarily a horrible thing, except they made it unusually expensive to have; almost like someone thought people will pay the ridiculous prices solely from loving the first game.Of the things it kept in, they expanded in poor ways. The larger environments don't have anything to keep them going. One thing about the first game was how tight and well designed its levels were, but that's gone now. It's like the microtransaction model was made to rely on past players, but the design doesn't attract them.			"

								The game is just so bland and unoriginal.In their previous game each hero actually had a selection of towers to defend with. Here you get 4 for each but expect to only be using like one or two of them.I liked the monk in the first game so I picked him again here. My job is to put up boost auras on each tower and then baby sit them all. My lightning field just doesn't help all that much and it's much better to just boost the mages fire tower.So the strat me and my brother have been using it. Mage shield, mage fire tower and then boost aura. Every single time we played it. Not even the slightest hint of being able to change anything with the setup.It's boring, soul crushingly boring.Also you basically get up the setup on the first and second round and after that it's mainly buffing up the towers.Tl:dr version: Developers added bare minimum in terms of towers and variation and it's making the game pretty damn boring.Get Orc Must Die 1 and 2 if you want a quality Tower Defense game. Some actual planning in those two games.			"

								I can't recommend DD2, it's just not near as fun as the original and it's been in EA for years. Trendy made a huge mistake making it F2P trash. Really no reason to play until release (if that ever happens) because Trendy constantly updates, which is not a good thing, because they have changed the game 10x over. They let a small community group update their first game (which somewhat ruined it, because they nerfed/buffed classes) and now they dropped the ball with DD2, RIP Trendy and the Dungeon Defenders franchise, if only they made it a normal paid game like the first one...

								The UI in this game might be one of the worst I've ever interacted with. The game itself looks pretty, but the user experience, navigating between screens, and not to mention the controls for the xbox controller really are not intuitive. This on top of the fact that they removed literally the best part of the game - the local co-op. I used to play this with my wife, and friends in split screen and it was awesome during the first dungeon defenders. It sounded like they had planned to add local co op back in, and so my friends and i were stoked for more awesome lan party play, it really made this game unique. Now its a WOW wanna be, and just lost its magic. Kinda like you had a great thing going and broke it.I'll update this review if they ever fix the menus, controller issues, UI, UX, and add in local co-op. But until then, I'm gonna sadly stay away from it. If you're looking for the great experience you had in the first one, you won't find it here sadly.			"

								           So, I've written two other reviews, and I'm coming back to write a 3rd. What can I say? I bought the first Dungeon Defenders on my Playstation 3, loved it, so I purchased it on my pc with all of the DLC. One of my all time favorite games, this one had a lot to live up to. So does it? Heck yeah it does! I purchased the game on Early Access, and let me just say that this is Early Access done right! With so many dev teams abusing the Early Access platform on steam, this definetly gives me hope for Early Access in general. The developers respond to feedback and even allow players to vote for changes to the game on the launcher. Early Adopters were rewarded with $30 of in-game currency as well as a unique cosmetic for each of the 4 heroes currently available in the game (although I do wish the items were a little flashier for bragging purposes :D) I would say the campaign is a bit shorter than the original, and develops the story very little. I would assume that expansions are on their way, as I cannot stress enough how little the plot progresses, so if you're looking for a full story, you won't find it yet.             But how's the gameplay? The tower defense is amazing, although there are many tower's that haven't returned or have been altered significantly. But to make up for this, there are a few new towers. Hero spells have also been changed, and a whole new type of energy is used for them, which frees you up. You don't have to choose between using hero abilities, or getting that tower upgrade you desperately need. The action element of the game definetly feels nice, but you won't find yourself being able to completely ditch towers like you could with a maxed barb or huntress in the first Dungeon Defenders. You could argue that this is actually a plus though.            Should you buy it? F2P? YES! What are you waiting for!? P2P? YES! The Devs deserve the support! But I recommend trying it F2P first, just to make sure it's your thing.			"

Early Access Review
								Dungeon Defenders 2 is by far my favorite tower defense game ever, It surpasses DD1 buy leaps and bounds by making the game more than just towers, the player needs to pay attention to the map and attack more difficult monsters to complete the missions, although there are some problems with their servers, but when I talked to them on twitter they said ""There are starting to be some issues with the way our backend service handles all of the matchmaking requests coming in so quickly"" and they also said that they have engineers working on the servers throughout the week of 10/19/15, I believe once the servers are working normally, DD2 will be an amazing game...

								Very great game, obviously has some bugs which is fine since it's still in alpha. I haven't found any game breaking bugs. Not pay-to-win at all, and has option to play privately. Strategy and thinking is needed to beat matches, which I like. One of the better games I've played			"

								I do think that this game is insanely well made. Being an early access game still, the dev team are adding new thing every other week! There are always things to do in the game. I do recomend this game if you like tower defense games and have played the first Dungeon Defenders 2! :)			"
