												Probably the best of the AGE Games, Rise of Prussia covers the fascinating European Theatre of War during the Seven Years war, or third silesian war. The Gold Edition also adds the First and Second Silesian Wars, which are smaller and more focused and great for learning the game. Its a period that is ironically, often overlooked by most people. Taking one of histories greatest generals, Frederick the Great, you lead the fledgeling nation of Prussia into war against the monstrosities that are France, Russia, Sweden and most importantly Austria, with only a few hannoverian allied armies supporting you. The game enjoys minimal bugs compared to most AGE Engine Games, and I have only run into one so far and it was minor at worst (A General teleporting). The Performance is good, which is something you can't normally say for an AGE game as well, and whilst it isn't the prettiest game around the graphics are pleasing enough to the eye. Although the UI is a little outdated, its easy to get used too and can be learnt quickly enough.A major strength of the game, infact the main focus, is the way in which war is waged.  You have total control over your force composition, in a realistic manner that even takes into account your generals seniority. (A General with more seniority expects to be promoted before that new guy, even if the new guy is  10x better hes gunna have to get some achievements before being promoted to leading his own Corps). Your armies are divided into groups, starting with an Field Army, which is made up of different Corps, which are in turn made of different Brigades, and whom are also made up of Battallions etc. This area of organization is brilliant for anyone who enjoys reforming whole armies to fit their needs and despite how it sounds, is relatively simple once you get used to it. The UI for doing this is far less convuluted than similar games (Looking at you hearts of iron). Each of these forces can be detached or re-attached to their command at will, so if you have a Brigade of Hussars and need to know if the enemy is in Prague, or still sitting on his♥♥♥♥♥♥in Vienna, you can detatch them from the main army and send them on a scouting mission (or a raid). This level of flexibility blends excellently with the warfare of the time period, where battles are fought and won on manouver. On the note of manouver, don't expect the enemy to just sit around and wait for you! You both move at the same time, planning your turn for the next two weeks and then the plans execute simultaneously, this can lead to some very interesting situations and provides for a far more interesting gameplay experience, and also means you'll have to predict enemy movements and prepare for them accordingly. In addition to a brilliant manouver system, the Supply system is perfect, and accurately represents the systems used in the time period. As you advance deeper into enemy territory, it may become necassery to build supply depots to keep your men fed, and to even place guards at these depots to ensure enemy cavalry brigades don't come along and raid it. I havn't fully worked out the supply system yet, but running out of food stocks is sufficiently devestating, and Winter is suitably harsh (In the actual war they had to sit around in prague until winter was over, I had to do the same thing) effecting supplies, movement and attrition effectively, as well as combat and encourages one to wait it out and lick your wounds rather than continue the advance. The game isn't perfect though, it has a few flaws and I think the foremost of them is the military recruitment system. I feel as if, the recruitment process is a little slow at times, and that whilst the time it takes to prepare men is fine, the number of men I can prepare at once feels rather limited. I can't speak regarding the realism here, its a personal view and may be to some peoples liking. But it isn't to mine. Another issue I've run into is the reinforcements. I'm not really sure how they work, and the concept is never really explained. But I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually, so I'll update the review once I have figured it out. In short, for those looking for a pretty realistic strategy game, with indepth customization of forces and an excellent combat/manouver warfare system and mechanics, this is the game to get. Its fairly priced, clean of bugs, and provides hours of gameplay. "

												Entry level game for Ageod games. Too bad it is ridden with small bugs. Worst of all: the game has a tendency to crash or freeze.			"

												All the AGEOD games are very good. This one covers the 7-years war in Europe, and comes with several long and short campaigns. The game works on a WEGO system, and focuses on operational level warfare. Supply is very important, as are weather conditions.You can build units for your armies, give orders to your generals (which they will not always carry out, due to an activation system, simulating the difficulties in co-ordinating actions in this period). There is no 3-d battle function. Strictly old fashioned strategy, played out on a beautiful 2-d map. The units and leaders also have very nice art to represent them.Highly recommended, in-depth simulation of the campaigns of the 7-years war in Europe!			"

												If you are willing to take the time to learn the game's systems then you will find that this is a very deep strategy game. This game more than others will force you to actually plan your moves and consider what the enemy may do. The way the turns are formatted makes it very difficult to only play a reactionary game. The fact that the AI seems competent helps as well, and you can turn the difficulty settings in ways that makes the game more difficult without just giving the AI ridiculous buffs. Watching your plans unfold along with the enemy's and seeing how they work out is a very intense and rewarding experience. Definitely recommended.			"

												I can agree with other reviews that have said that once you learn a little about the game, it becomes extremely rewarding. The period of the 18 century for Prussia is quite an interesting one. Facing a coalition with Britain against virtually all of Europe, constantly outnumbered, and facing challenges throughout the seven years the war lasted.  Rise Of Prussia is one of the easier Ageod games to comprehend so this may be your type of game if you are a new player and enjoy wargames. Both food and ammunition is accounted for, not to mention the indepth chain of command system that allows to you accurately and realistically organize armies outside of any strategy game. The music is also great being legendary classical pieces performed by music genius like Mozart and the like. Despite the pleasing exterior and detailed 2-d graphic map and unit cards, the game does suffer occassional crashes due to improper use of cacheing and driver issues with modern computers. The options panel in this game is very flexible in that you can change almost any setting in this game which may help some players avoid crashes or errors. However, the game can easily be resumed, and this minor occurance can easily be overlooked as it does not happen often. The FPS is also capped and occassionally reading the manual is required if the tutorial didn't cover a particular subject of the game. The supply chain is fairly easy to grasp, but knowing when to use certain strategic and regional decisions are daunting to new players. Overall, an excellent wargame that accurately simulates 18 cenutry warfare and the history of the Seven Years' War where a fraction of europe opposed Prussian might.			"

												Like all AGEOD games there is a steep learning curve for this game, however once you become used to the system you will find that you will find a deep and engaging game with the ability for the player to actually use strategy and tactics to best achieve your goals.Especially good if you have friends that will join for a game via email, nothing like crushing your opponents army and then letting them know about it.Regarding Steam AGEOD is slowly moving to being more supportive of Steam and with their other games the patches come quickly.

												This is a fabulous game and it was worth every cent I spent on it. If you are a fan of Grand Strategy style maps as Commander-in-Chief of all your armies than this a great game for you. As a fan of anything between 1700-1945 this game covers a crucial part in the history of Europe and that makes playing it even more excting!			"
