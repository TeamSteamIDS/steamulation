												Shortly:Love a good cartoon? You're welcome :)Love a good puzzle? Close the page :(Pros: visuals and such: stunning design, not bad graphics, nice atmosphere and jokes, John de Lancie as Professor Quadwrangle, original story, priceCons: actual gameplay: pretty short (there are some DLCs out there though), not many good puzzles, requires more jumping skills than thinking ones, freaking tons of blurThe long way:I love this game. Yeah, that simple, just as simple as the game is. It has nice design, good 3d-cartoon-like graphics and jokes which are really good (well, sometimes they aren't, but nothing is perfect in this world). The main problems are the puzzles and length of the game itself - I've run through it in ~6 hours, but I haven't got 100% completion though. Now about the puzzles. They are simple as well, but that's not good this time. You won't find any really hard-brainsmashing-cool-etc puzzles in this game - all of them are considerably easy. Also, this game has a lot of platforming. I like this, but you may not if you're looking for a brain challenge.PS: I'm sorry if my English is bad, it's not my native language.			"

Q: What do you get if you cross Portal's wacky physics puzzles with a modernized, gorgeously realized Tex Avery-like art style, and add in a mad scientist voiced by John de Lancie[en.wikipedia.org] (""Q"" from Star Trek: The Next Generation)?A: Well, if any of that description made you perk your ears up and drool, then you probably already own this game. And hey, the great thing is, if you absolutely hate any part of that description, you will probably avoid this. Easy!It's a great game, and really, really scratches the Portal itch. The animations and artwork in the game are charming, demented and sometimes unspeakably cute. (I love the machines that barf crates! I love them so much!) De Lancie is suitably crazy, but not maliciously so -- he's just very determinedly absent-minded, that's all! The areas are filled with a nice array of collectibles, the game runs smoothly... I can't really find too many things wrong with this.Well, except one: I'm stupid and haven't been able to finish the game yet. But chances are WILDLY in favor of you being much smarter than I am, and so you have nothing to worry about!Adorably exasperating game.			"

												Riding off the coat-tails of Portal, the same dev team is back at it with this first-person-puzzler. The difficulty for the base game stays between beginner to intermediate while the DLC increases it to a ridiculous difficulty that will have you banging your head on your keyboard and you punching a nearby house cat. Despite this increase of difficulty (reliance of speed, timing, and LOTS of patience are needed), the game is hilarious and  beautiful with a semi-cell-shaded, cartoon feel. John de Lancie (Q for all you trekkies out there), provides a nice narrative to the environment and story as you progress through the game. If you enjoyed the Portal series, this is a must-buy to add to your gaming collection.			"

												In theory this is a game I should like. In fact, I WANTED to like it. John ""Q/News Anchor from Crank"" DeLancie as narration, time/space manipulation in a 3D puzzle environment, a distinct visual style, etc.Here is the problem, and to elaborate, I'm going to have to compare this game to Portal, which a lot of people did on its release due to one of Portal 1's designers (Kim Swift) leaving Valve to work on this title, which is a similar genre, let's be frank. Portal 1 worked because it was brief. It'd do a few things with a tool, then move on to something else, occasionally mashing all your obstacles up for a challenge room/test of what you'd learned. Part of what worked to keep this from getting stale was that you had hints and taunts from your omnipresent narrator/torturer, and part of it came down to the puzzles being tested to a good balance of ""solvable but not instantly"".Quantum Conundrum has most of these attributes, but in sort of a ""they came back wrong"" variety. John DeLancie is playing the same role of narrator/reason for being in this mess, but a lot of his hints are either weirdly couched in ways that you're not going to get them (and you will hear them 5 times as you try to figure them out, too), or just outright irritating. Between stages in the loading bridge areas you'll hear him spout what is basically monkey-cheese randomness about ""his"" predicament, but there's not much reason to care because he's the dude what trapped you in Deathtrap Manor by accident where he decided to design really, really overzealous laser beams everywhere. (I'm not entirely convinced the lasers work as intended: stuff that's just supposed to destroy items had a tendency to fire right through into my skull more than once, ending my run at a puzzle.) The puzzles are indeed short rooms to solve and then move on to the next ""chamber"", but there's not much chance at learning them and a few are just straight up blind luck. One in particular springs to mind as it has you choosing two or three different branch points on a conveyer belt and while it IS possible to backtrack on it, it's a real bear and a lot of them lead around corners or to paths you cannot immediately see are dead ends/death.The other big Portal gripe I'm gonna throw out: in Portal, you get the gun, you get a few rooms of training, and then YOU HAVE THE GUN FULLY OPEN FOREVER. Quantum Conundrum gives you 4 seperate powers, which are clearly controller-mapped given how they show up on a keyboard, and then gives them to you and takes them away randomly from room to room, so that just as you earn something it's out the door for two stages, then you need to find the object in the level to swap it out with the other power, then... The juggling really makes the game more tedious than interesting, when I just want to play around with all these weird reality warping buttons instead of learn about DeLancie's fuzzy multidimensional friend who hid a bunch of barking robots all around the house*.I did not finish this game. I'm sure some people will bash me for that, but I'll be honest: I got halfway? Most of the way? through the second of four hubs, and when the puzzle was repeating the same ""make object light, toss, turn on slow-mo to catch it"" gameplay for a third room running, but this time with instadeath pits and sloppy wooden platforms to bounce between... I stopped. I realized that absolutely nothing in this game had any sort of charm or fun factor to keep me going. It wasn't even a CHALLENGING game, so long as you realize ""Okay I have two powers what can they do"" and ""how to avoid lasers"".This has potential, and I'm sure that the writing isn't going to be a turn-off for some, because comedy's amazingly subjective, yadda yadda. I'M going to tell you ""this game is a hot mess, avoid"", but if you're remotely curious, it drops to like... $4 with all DLC constantly. Why not, it's your money.* Not a joke.			"

												Rating : 8/10Overview: 1st person puzzle platformerThe Good:+ The game allows you to switch between 4 different dimensions to solve puzzles and traverse the environment. The first dimension is 'fluffy' dimension, which makes objects lighter allowing you to carry them and place them on switches. The second, is heavy dimension, which makes objects heavier, the third is slow time and the fourth is reverse gravity. You can only be in one dimension at a time. + The game offers a mix of puzzles and platforming. Some areas are strictly related to one or the other while other areas combine the two.  It provides a nice change in pace as you are not strictly doing one thing over and over again. +The most important part of a puzzle game is the balance between fun and challenging. This game does a great job of finding the right balance. Solving puzzles offers a satisfactory feeling and feels very rewarding.  The puzzles were not super easy nor were they impossible to solve, with careful thinking and planning you should have no problem with the game. +The game offers a nice art style that compliments the game+Every puzzle offers a time and shift goal offering a lot of replay ability if your into that sort of thing. The Average:-The game takes place in your uncles mansion while he provides witty banter to you throughout your journey. The problem is the dialogue isn't very funny or witty and the voice acting annoyed me.  The Bad:-The ending is very lackluster -Despite the great puzzle design there will always be frustrating moments in a game like this. Too many times I wanted to jump off a platform and the game didn't register my jump, a problem with most 1st person platforming games-Though I loved the main game puzzle design the DLC levels are frustrating. I said there is a balance between fun and challenging and most of the DLC levels go way too far in the challenging category to the point where I was more frustrated than having fun.Conclusion:I really enjoyed my time with this game and if you are looking for a solid puzzle game then this is worth checking out.

												First half of the game: Thumbs upSecond half of the game: Thumbs downWelp I quit. I really liked this game when it first started, because I really enjoy first person puzzlers, and in a lot of ways this game is a great one, but it also kinda shoots itself in the face. The different ""dimensions"" (light, heavy, slow, reverse gravity) make for some really great puzzles and there a lot of puzzle chambers that were genuinely fun to solve and exactly what I expected when I purchased this game. These were the puzzle chambers where you had to use the four dimensions to maneuver blocks in the environment to press buttons, trip lasers, avoid lasers, drop a ball into a net, and other types of things. I remember really enjoying a particular puzzle chamber with a bunch of conveyers, and the trick to it was that you had to use reverse gravity to utilize the UNDER side of the conveyers as well as the top side. That was a fun discovery, and it was fun to execute on when I realized it.But here is where the game is possibly going to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off and possibly make you quit. It is not ENOUGH in quantum conundrum to just solve the puzzle, because this is not just a puzzle game. The further you get into the game, the more the game becomes about physics, timing, and platforming---and in the most annoying way. We're talking about a situation, for just one example, where you have to position three blocks in such a way that they fall onto three conveyors at the same time, and those conveyors (hopefully) drop them onto a fourth conveyor in a (hopefully) straight line, so that they move into position under a gap where you can use reverse gravity to elevate them into a bridge position across the gap, then quickly use slow-time to hold them in position so you can use them as a series of platforms to jump across. BUT WAIT. The opposite side of the gap is blocked by a door that has to be opened with a button, but there is a 3 second delay between the time you press the button and the time the door opens, and the door will ONLY open if slow time is on at the EXACT MOMENT the door would open. So you have to try and figure out the exact timing to press the button, press reverse gravity, then press slow time. Or is it press reverse gravity, THEN press the button, THEN slow time? How much of a pause do I leave between each one? Who knows? Good look setting up the solution 50 times until you trial-and-error work it out. And then when you finally DO figure out the timing, the game's physics dropped the safes onto the conveyor all sloppy so they're not lined up well, so when you try to execute some crappy first-person-platforming (let's face it: FPS platforming is always kinda crappy) across them, you miss the third safe and have to set it all up AGAIN. And again. And again. This all gets very f***ing tedious and sometimes even feels like there is an element of luck to it (i.e. how the physics works out), which is not a good situation.Also, the professor or whoever talking to you over the intercom talks way too much, and it's sort of painful to listen to how much he tries to be funny but just isn't really. (Sorry, writers.) And his constant blabbering sort of ruins the atmosphere. For a dramatic improvement to atmosphere and experience, do yourself a favor. OPTIONS -> AUDIO SETTINGS -> DIALOGUE VOLUME -> turn it all the way down to zero to shut him up forever.At the end of the day, it's a really great puzzle game that could have been a real classic, but its annoying habit of ruining its puzzles with physics that are beyond your control, first-person platforming too demanding for a puzzle game (FPS platforming is rarely a good idea as it is), and requiring a series of actions to be executed in a specific sequence with incredibly specific timing----it all just increasingly ruins the puzzles as each new chamber ratchets up the demands on the player in these areas. It wouldn't be so irritating if you didn't have to go fetch and reposition a bunch of blocks into catapults and conveyors and springs etc every time you failed one of the requirements (i.e. failed timing, or failed a jump, or else the physics just f***ed you over), but when you get into the later puzzle chambers, you're going to waste a lot of minutes of your life just ""reloading"" the puzzle chamber setup over and over again. As I said before, this all gets very f***ing tedious.It's a shame, because this is a really well-made game and there is a lot here to like. I just really wish they wouldn't have pushed so hard on the physics/timing/platforming demands for a game that sells itself on puzzling. In my opinion, they took those aspects overboard and thereby undermined the enjoyment of the puzzling.			"

												(Reluctantly not recommended)I found this game to be really fun at first. It had a charming art style and relaxing music. As the game was from the designer of Portal, I assumed the it would be just as solid and dependable. Sadly, I was disappointed by inconsistent physics and weird behaviour such as any spring jump's momentum being instantly cancelled by pushing a direction on the stick (WSAD). This totally arbitrary restriction meant that getting a handle of that aspect of the game play was highly frustrating. I see no reason physics or otherwise for it to occur. It made the game incredibly irritating and it never recovered from it. With this knowledge, perhaps you will enjoy the game as I didn't. However, with inconsistent platforming mechanics and frequently irritating level design which unduly punishes platforming slip-ups, I'd have to say, play Portal again. I am glad that this game was free.			"

												While the game starts out fun and enjoyable it slowly becomes a sort of jump puzzle “I-wish-I-were-Portal” type game and after that point it’s just plain irritating. Towards the end I just really wished it would finish quickly because I couldn’t stand all the jumping and luck involved in solving puzzles. The second half of the game just ruined the whole thing for me and if I ever have to surf on top of a safe again it will be two lifetimes too soon.			"

I wish there was a sequal for it. I had my best times while playin'. 4 different dimension supply a huge variety on complexity and not only that it has awesome gameplay trough with it. I always thought that could cause lots of improvement in game industry but it's been 3 years and yet all we got is ""The Talos Principle"".

												What could have been a wonderful puzzle game is ruined by so many levels designed around sensitive platforming mechanics.  I really gave this game a chance as it has a lovely concept for puzzles.  But after my frustration level became just too much I uninstalled the game unfinished.  I found myself in so many levels where I had solved the puzzle and knew exactly what to do but just couldn't pull of the complicated jumps or positioning that was required.  Often I was doing a puzzle over 10 times and failing every time because I didn't quite make the jump or I wasn't quite standing in the right place.  I knew what to do.  I had solved the puzzle part.  But I couldn't pull of the platforming aspect.  If you like platformers and puzzles but really go for the platforming aspect than this really is a good game.  If you like puzzle games like Portal but aren't the most agile of gamer in platformers, then I highly recommend skipping this title.			"

												Moje česká recenze: http://www.playhit.cz/2015/01/quantum-conundrum-neco-jako-portal/ I really enjoyed Quantum Conundrum although it wasn't very long. You switch between dimensions to solve puzzles that lead to the rescue of your uncle, who you visited. He still can talk to you though, he tells you some hilarious jokes and might give you a hint or two. His interdimensional pet Ike watches over you and hands you some of the stuff you need. I recommend you to skip any guidence in the first gameplay because the base game isn't really that hard, that'll be the point of its DLCs which I will review later. Patience is golden, many times you'll stop looking back at how easy it actually was after finally proceeding. I loved it and it deserves more attention in my opinion.

												This is an enjoyable puzzle game, and even a little bit child-friendly!  Ike is a rather adorable monster.  This game is often compared to Portal, but I find the only overlaps are that it's a fairly linear puzzle game, and the feel of Science.  That's it.  No real antagonist, no feeling of ominous loneliness, and no teleportation in this game, plus there's a lot more platforming to be had.Please, stop comparing this game to Portal already.  We get it. :PNow the summary:Pros:+ Child-friendly (depending on your taste, you might find this to be a ""con"")+ Outstanding music — it reminded me of some of the music on this one Science Channel (tell me you're not surprised) show called ""How It's Made.""+ Well-designed puzzles+ Nice writing, and classy voice acting by John De Lancie+ Good mechanics and good pacing+ Extra goals to push your thinking and agility furtherCons:- The (""subtle""?) hints are given too soon, and occasionally spoil the puzzle.- Humor is rather cheap and punny (unless you like that sort of thing).- Game got to be a tad buggy at times, especially when trying to speedrun it for achievements.- Inflexible graphics options.- No sequel (yet?).Overall: 8/10 (for the main game)			"

												Quantum Conundrum has you play as a young fella dropped off at his Uncle's house for the weekend, but, lo and behold, your Uncle has gotten trapped in an alternate dimension and it's up to you to save him!This game is incredibly fun and a pleasure to play. The controls are very easy to use (I used a keyboard for it) and the levels well designed.There is no steep learning curve, in fact, the pacing of the game is great. I spent 6 hours in the game and had a swell time. The story is clever (if a little far-fetched, but c'mon, it's a sci-fi fantasy game) and overall an awesome experience. (I cannot comment on the DLC, though, as I have yet to complete any of it).The best part of the game, however, is the absolutely incredible voice-acting of John De Lancie, of Q fame from Star Trek: TNG. If you're a fan of his work, you'll love this game, as he's with you every step of the way!Would recommend checking this one out when you can, especially if you're a fan of puzzle games such as Portal or Portal 2!Nilesy			"

												Quantum Conundrum is a puzzle game centered around a weird science contraption that switches dimensions.Players take first-person control of a young child who comes to visit his scientist uncle at a crazy mansion. Upon arrival, the silent protagonist learns that his uncle is trapped in another dimension, and it is up to him to save his relative. In order to do this, all three of the generators in the mansion will need to be restarted.The puzzles are made up of simple elements that are combined into complicated and elaborate puzzles. Puzzles are completed by moving around objects, which are mostly just boxes. Heavy weights are used to trigger pressure plates, boxes can be stacked to climb on, and there are a whole bunch of other unique solutions that are pleasing to discover.This game is amazing. Quantum Conundrum is well made, it controls well and it is almost flawless. It is perfect for people who like puzzle games like Portal. It is definitely worth to buy.Sounds 8/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 9/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												Ok..this game. I got it with a offsite bundle when i bought it.First off, you may notice the voice of the Narrator as ""Q"" from Star trek series, also know as John De Lancie. His voice is great and somewhat soothing.Now for the game itsef, it is a puzzle game with different situations to solve. Basically, you get different powers depending on the ""dimension"" you are currently in. For example, the cloudy dimension makes everything so light you can move it around, including heavy bricks. There is also paid dlc for this game, but i don't own those dlc's. They just add more levels and stuff i think.Recommended due to John De Lancie doing narrator is great reason, and i love puzzles.

												Quantum Conundrum is an interesting game. It was developed Kim Swift, who was the lead designer of Portal, and it shows. The game takes the interesting idea of switching between four dimensions to solve puzzles. The first dimension is the Fluffy dimension, which makes heavy objects like safes and couches so light that you can pick them up and throw them. The second dimension is the Heavy dimension, which makes cardboard boxes weigh like a ton of lead. The third dimension is the Slow dimension, which slows down everything but the player. The final dimension is the Reverse Gravity dimension, which reverses the gravity of all interactable objects. Throughout the game, the player switches between these four dimensions to travel from room to room. Some rooms only allow one dimension, while other may allow all four, so it does change it up every so often.The story isn't much to look into. The protagonist, a young chap, goes to visit his uncle, Professor Fitz Quadrangle, in his mansion. When he arrives, the Professor gets sent to a pocket dimension because the project he was working on went ary; however, he is able to talk to the player as he travels through the mansion. The mansion, because of the Professor's failed expirament, is on lock-down, and the player needs to travel to three generators and turn them on. The ending is rather unsatisfying, so don't go to this game for the story.The graphics looks nice and clean. There's not much detail within the rooms, much like Portal, but it is still pleasing to the eye. The one problem I have with the graphics is the default setting for bloom effects. Whenever in the Fluffy dimension, the bloom can be really bright and hurts the eyes. I had it turned off for the entire game, and there were still times when it was super bright.The tracks that play in the background, while not abundant, are pretty good. They don't get stuck in your head, but it's still nice to listen to while racking your brain on a puzzle. The voice acting in this game is wonderful. The Professor is played by John de Lancie, the actor behind Q from Star Trek. His voice fits the role really well. The dialogue, for the most part, is entertaining and chuckle-worthy, though there are times when he gets annoying, mainly when he repeats dialogue after you failed an attempt.While Quantum Conundrum isn't perfect, it does a fine job in delivering an interesting puzzle platformer. If you are a fan of Portal, I would recommed give this game a try.			"

												Quantum Conundrum is quite a conundrum to review. On one hand, the gameplay and visuals are solid. Everything from the fluffy-iness of the fluffy dimension to the roughness of the heavy dimension is rendered beautifully. The Uncle's mansion is such an incredibly unique style. Even the only NPC you ever actually interact with looks like something straight out of a Disney or Pixar film. Gameplay is obviously inspired by Portal, but it takes the concept from that game and changes it into something completely different and incredibly similar at the same time. Three dimensions, light and soft; normal; heavy and hard, govern the elements of the puzzles you'll find in your Uncle's mansion. Along with the intriguing gameplay, are tons of hidden collectables. This makes the game a treasure trove for completionists.On the other hand, this Quantum Conundrum is plagued by a badly voiced Uncle and a story that leaves much to be desired. The Uncle drones on while you play through each level. Either giving you hints to certain puzzles or just fumbling around seemingly holding you back by mistakes or errors comitted on his part. The voice acting is sadly bland. To be frank, there was a lack of anything. The Uncle sounded as though a preset voice created by a computer. Perhaps, that was what the game's story was implying, but I can never be to sure because there was almost a complete lack of a story. The underlying goal of the game was for me to finally meet up with my uncle, but other than that there wasn't much of a plot. The ending is equally as frustrating. Nothing is even remote resolved or answered. The ending implied a continuation of the game in a sequel, but after two years I haven't heard of anything.Instead of implementing a half-baked story with an Uncle and his estranged nephew, I would've much rather have the game just focused on the puzzles. Trying to recreate the Portal experience of having a robot entity taunt you throughout the game just wasn't a good idea and detracted from what was otherwise a wonderful game.I give this game a 7/10. The puzzles are definitely worth the price tag of $9, just don't expect a story-telling masterpiece.Pros:Unique ArtstyleInteresting GameplayAddicting CollectablesCons:Poor StoryVoice Acting Leaves Much To Be Desired			"

												Going into Quantum Conundrum i expected a Portal like expierence but with different dimensions to toggle, especially because Portal's former lead designer ""Kim Swift"" worked on this game. And yes, there are some similarities like going from room to room to solve ""puzzles"" and a narrator making dumb but often funny jokes. But sadly the puzzles aren't as great.... I expected brain twisting and greatly designed puzzles. But what we got are puzzle like environments based more on momentum and physics than actually solving diffecult puzzles. This however is fun and original aswell, it creates a good balance between solving puzzles and platforming.Now i really enjoyed my time with Quantum Conundrum. The game has great cartoony graphics and the mad scientist voiced by ""John de Lancie"" is quite funny sometimes. And even though the game is rather short, this actually benefits the game in my opinion. For me the length was perfect, around the point it all got a bit repetitive the end was near. Something else Quantum Conundrum does really well is create a original and great universe. Everything is made really well, and just fits. Unfortunately the ending is rushed and just not satisfying in anyway.... And although the game has a great balance between puzzles and physics, timing certain actions can get frustrating at times.I still recommend this game to any puzzle fan out there. It's a fun and challenging puzzle platformer with a well made atmoshpere. The game will take you around 4 to 6 hours to finish. However there are alot of collectables and achievements to get if you would like to get the game on 100%.			"

												Quantum Conundrum is a great game for people looking to be puzzled or just want a cute and funny challenge :3.- Graphics/How It Plays: Now don't let the ""Childish"" graphics detur you, the game plays well on most computers and looks great if all the settings are maxed out (Which any potato of a computer could do). The only complant about graphics/how it plays is that instead of using loading screens, Quantum Conundrum uses long hallways, so you get some REALLY bad frame drop inbetween levels, and some hallways are just WAY too long. I would give the graphics and how it plays a 5/5- Level Disign: The levels are very well created and have a mix between science lab and mansion/victorian feel. Sometimes though it is hard to tell what the objective in a level is, I would have liked like a big red ""Exit"" sign at the exit door so I could see it. I would rate the level disign a 4/5.- Music and Audio: All I can say is the music in this game is just astounding, even though this game does not look to be that popular, so much work has gone into the music I HIGHLY recomend buying the Soundtrack while buying the game. Some sound effects are a bit obnoxios, but most sound fine and work well with the feel of the game. I would give the sounds and music a 5/5.- Controls and Menu: The menu is sometimes confusing but may I just say THERE IS NO EXIT BUTTON ON THE MAIN MENU, you have to go into ""Start Game"" to exit the game I mean how counter intuative can you get. Also the mouse sensativity settings in the menu had like 3 different levels, not just a slider and I would have liked to see more than 1 audio slider. The controls where great out of the box, everything you would expect, exept jump. Jump was space BUT unlike in some games when you jumped, if you weren't EXACTLY on the ground you woulden't jump and in some situations in the game, that ment life or death. I would give the controls and menu a 2/5.Overall this game is a great game with a very easy story to follow and challenging levels. I would DEFFENENTLY recommend buying the DLCs because the game is about a 4 hour playthrough so if you are still thursty for some demention switching I would recommend the DLCs.I would give this game a overall rating of 4/5 and would DEFFENENTALY recommend it. And it's cheep so buy it boiiiii.			"

												A very long, complex and crazy puzzle platformer. The only downside is the platformer part, as getting to the right solution usually is less difficult than perfectly executing it, which made it a very frustrating game to myself at times. The story is great though, the art design is spot on and it is highly creative. Definitely different, unique and worth a look.			"

												Another great puzzle game, themed heavily on Portal. You change physics around you to solve the puzzles. I've heard it described as ""baby's first Portal"" and that is a decent summary of it. The puzzles are a bit easy, though that doesn't take away from the fun. The doctor is very clearly based on GLaDOS, but John DeLancie does a wonderful job of voicing, and the script pulls it off pretty well.If you like puzzles, physics, or Portal, it's worth picking up, especially on sale.

												Portal by Pixar. It's not on the same level as Portal but it does it's own thing and makes it work. The levels are heavily physics-based mechanical challenges rather than the ""this should logically be impossible find the loophole"" puzzles that Portal sets up, and the game is unapologetic about this. The main reason I approve of this choice is the ""slow"" dimension, which is basically ""remember those ridiculous Quicksilves scenes in the recent xmen movie? Here's a game of that"". The ridiculous spectacle of what this game has you do makes it memorable to me.That said, the game is very much ""style over substance"". It's got the Pixar aesthetic, the wacky physics puzzles on a crazy scale, and that's basically it. There isn't much story to speak of, or much sense of progression until you hit a new third of the game. If you want to live out the aforementioned Quicksilves scenes and aren't hung up on the above flaws, give this a shot.			"

It's quite a time since I played this, so I may not have remembered everything well.Quantum Conundrum *is* a good game. The graphics are cool, nice and cartoony, great design, the concept of the gameplay is nice, and the jokes are hilarious.However, as everything in this world, it's not perfect.This game requires more skill than brain power. If your here for a good puzzle, hoping it will frizzle (yes, frizzle) your brain, you will be dissapointed. There are too many moments in the game where you stand and think, like ""how the hell can I do this"", and the your uncle just says ""like this"". He just points out what you were trying to get, and it makes you feel - stupid. Instead of the legendary ""Ah ha!"" moment that's all over Portal and was in the core design of Portal, there's your uncle, looking A LOT smarter than you, pointing the whole point (bum ta tzz) out. Sometimes, you just want to scream SHUT UP at him.I guess I put you off, didn't I? Not to worry, you'll be on in a moment.However, this game is far from a bad game. The graphics are very original, with a smush of cartoon here and there. The props are designed very well. It gives the whole house a friendly, homely feel. You can see that the game was designed for kids however, but I liked it.The colour palette is well handled, and the graphics change depending in which dimension you are in. It's fun looking at how the things look like in different dimensions. For example, a cube (which is actually a safe), looks like a safe in the normal dimension, in the heavy dimension it looks like a super heavy duty super heavy metal crate. It would look good on a heavy metal concert. In the light, or fluffy in the game lingo, dimension, the safe looks like a woolen toy say for kids from your grandma. The two other dimensions only add image effects to the game, so I want be talking (*writing) about those, and I don't want to be a spoiler.The puzzles, as I said, are not very hard (usually), and require more skill, but the maps are perfectly designed and contain quite fun elements, and you will fly on safes quite a lot.Your uncle, who is ~not~ pleased to have you there, has quite baddass humor (I'll never forget the ""Everyday I'm shovellin'"" joke), but he starts liking you more throughout the game. He talks a lot - read: all the time - but thankfully you can put your  headphones off and turn on the captions when you're fed up.The music is nice, was humming it for a week after, and I got the soundtrack too (which I don't know what idiot set to Windows only). It's profesionally done, and it's not out of the place, it belongs to the game.So that's that. If your thinking the game is for kids, just return to those kid days (not for real damnit, only in your mind), and get this game as soon as possible. Worth every penny, although I bought it with €uros which have cents.And when someone calls you a kid for playing this, just say ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME?"" (I'm sorry, had to put that somewhere)Go and enjoy every moment of this great puzzle platformer game.I want a fluffy Ike.			"

												It took me almost a year to finish Quantum Conundrum. I'm not even sure why because I was really excited to play it. So I pre-ordered it back then, and when it was finally available I played it for 2 hours and then... stopped. I guess it didn't pull me in like Portal once did.That doesn't make it a bad game, not at all. It just lacks that certain charm. The puzzles, however, are pretty cool. So, I decided to continue the game just recently and I have to say the game actually gets a lot better near the end, when you have access to all 4 dimensions (fluffy, weight, anti-gravity and slow). Switching between them while solving these puzzles can actually be very rewarding. It's a great feeling. And while the game lasts only about 6-7 hours, it's long and challenging enough to keep your attention (for most of us anyway ;)).Now that QC2 has appeared in the Steam registry I'm actually really excited again (edit: I guess this will never happen since the studio closed) ! I ♥ first person puzzle games.[Rating: 86/100]			"

												A first-person puzzle game in the same vein as Portal, but voiced by John de Lancie!  (That's the actor who played Q on ST:TNG, if you're a fan of the show.)  The game suits him well, charming with a unique brand of wit and humour sprinkled throughout each puzzle.  It's a delight to play and, while many of the solutions are somewhat rigid, more than a few allow the player enough freedom to come up with their own answers to each obstacle.Unfortunately, since Mr. de Lancie's commentary, as the professor, greatly establishes the mood and tempo of the game, I cannot recommend the DLC.  Ike-Aramba! and The Desmond Debacle fall flat due to their monotony and most of the puzzles in them are less puzzles and more sequences of specific timing where the slightest error--in a belligerently linear solution--will have you pulling out your hair as you try and try again.  At least the checkpoints are frequent enough that you never have to start a puzzle from the very beginning.The short version:  Buy the game--it's really fun, and spring for the DLC if it's on sale.  It's six extra multi-stage 'puzzles' each, but the real fun is in the core game.			"

While I enjoyed the actual puzzle segments, the game veers into reflex trials.  I hate reflex trials.  I play puzzle type games for puzzles, not rote memorization and twitch gameplay.  I know there are gamers who enjoy that sort of thing, but I cannot count myself among their number.I'd love to be able to recommend this, but the reflex trials are just too much for me to see past.

												Quantum Conundrum is a first person physics puzzle game similar in style to Portal. Unlike Portal though it relies HEAVILY on first person platforming. About halfway through the game it shifts from being ridiculously easy to frustratingly difficult. Not the good kind of difficult either. Several puzzles I knew exactly what the game wanted me to do, but couldn't physically do it. Platform jumping in first person just doesn't work. Also the game gives and takes away the four powers you have constantly so it's hard to remember in the heat of the moment which button does what. It doesn't test your puzzle solving skills as much as your mastery of awkard controls and awful platforming. I really wanted to finish this game but it got to the point where it wasn't fun. I googled the stage I was on to see how many stages were left. Sixteen. Not worth it. This may be the most frustrating game I've ever played.			"

But none of them are in the puzzels or the games mechanics. I also found it fairly charming and entertaining (some levels were easier than others, but the shift goals are fun) :)Buy this game if you want a wonderful bunch of mechanics and really well made puzzels. :D			"

												It’s a decent game, I think I Just had higher expectations for it.Don’t get me wrong here, this game is still great and I still think that anyone that enjoys first person puzzle games should give it a go. For me it just wasn’t as fun or satisfying as it seemed. I watched the trailer and was super excited to play this game, maybe I hyped myself up to much, I don’t know, but as I got into in I found it a little meh.A lot of people straight away notice the similarities it has to the portal franchise, and I have seen a lot of people saying it’s a copy or a rip off. Well straight up I just have to put that straight. That is complete crap. The person who made this worked on portal 1 and 2, so you can hardly say it’s a copy, when it’s their own work. It’s got its similarities but it’s a completely different game all together.If you are wondering why I found it meh, I honestly don’t know how to explain it. The mechanics for this game are great, the dialog is pretty amusing at times, the graphics look really good and it had a nice humour to it. I just didn’t feel too great about this game, and after a little while it became a chore for me to finish. It felt like it dragged on a little bit, I didn’t feel like there was any real purpose to the game, from what I remember the storyline was ok but nothing to griping. It’s a game that’s been done fairly well, and I still like it. I just don’t love it. Now that I’ve finished it I doubt I will play it again, and if I do, it wouldn’t be for the game itself, it would be for the achievements. (That I’ve recently became obsessed with getting in games)All in all it’s still a good game, maybe other people feel differently about it to how I feel.			"

												This game is bad. The beginning of this game is bad: you spend ten minutes wandering around listening to a non-stop stream of blather before you even reach your first puzzle, unless standing on a box counts as a puzzle, which it doesn't. The pacing of this game is bad: the six hours I spent beating it felt like fifteen. The writing in this game is bad: John de Lancie spends almost literally every moment cracking bons mots that flunked out of either Meme University or Dad Joke Night School. The gameplay of this game is bad: stacking crates and first-person jumping puzzles are all you get, period, and the designers weren't clever enough to ever keep you from noticing. The design of this game is bad: if you're making a puzzle game and you repeatedly need to have a voice actor point out level features (""Look up, the switch is up there!""), you have failed. The ending of this game is bad: you cross a pit, John de Lancie verbally smirks at you some more, and then you hear a terrible song, because this game JUST CAN'T KEEP ITSELF from failing at literally everything Portal did right five years earlier. This game is bad.			"

I agree with other review writers about this game's focus on platforming instead of focusing on puzzleing, as it actually should be.			"

												This games holds a variety of puzzles with a touch of creativity that makes it stand out on its own. From shifting to different dimensions, to even getting timing down to a key; this games is rather entertaining even for the roughly 7 hours it took to complete.Overall, the game left me wanting more(2 upcoming dlcs sometime soon) and that's a good thing.

												This game is an interesting concept for a puzzle game. You are a kid going to his uncle's (who is a slightly narcisist scientist) when something happens causing a lock-down on the house. Your uncle has a mild loss of short term memory, and can't figure out where he is so he asks you to go restore power to remove the lock-down. In the process you get access to the IDS device that he was working on that allows you to shift between dimensions (More on that soon).The story isn't complicated, but it gets the job done and gets you going where you need to be. The dialogue along the way is cheesy, but in a good way (Though if you are not a fan of cheesy humor, I would suggest muting the voices).The gameplay itself is quite interesting. You gradually unlock 4 (well, 5 if you count the base dimension) dimensions that allow you to modify physics. These are Fluffy (Or, light weight), Heavy (Heavy weight), Slow down (Everything moves at a near crawl, even lasers), and Reverse Gravity. You, personally never are altered (The idea is despite the fact you are going through the rifts, you personally remain physical to your dimension). Now, these mechanics lead to some interesting relationships between objects: A steel Safe becomes able to be carried while in fluffy, You can toss a table in fluffy then quickly change to Slow and hop onto the platform (That normally would be going fast) as a platform across a gap. A cardboard box can be used as a heavy weight using Heavy. Or with Reverse you can have something utilize the bottom of a conveyor belt to be carried along (or quickly switch to keep it floating). It's not as though you just unlock them all as you go along: Each room has certain dimensions availble (though they can be changed via what batteries you find in the puzzle), so they give you a general direction on how to solve it, and leave it to you to figure out how to use your tools to reach the exit.It is worth noting this concept shines in one level in particular: You choose one and only one of the 4 and have to solve the room from there, and based on which one you start with changes the entire solution.That said, the puzzle aspect partially comes from how well you can execute it as well (You can only ""Table Surf"" if you are good enough, after all) so if you are looking for a pure puzzle game, you aren't getting that. That does not make this a fun title though.There are also a lot of neat little features, such as how paintings and such change based on the dimension (Example is a painting of a grandmother where in fluffy her hair is insane, where in slow there is a grim reaper standing behind her). Another is that during death or loading screens you get some hilarious dialogue (Things you will never experience because you died #93487: The Zombie Apocalypse (Though this may be for the best)). There are also little knick-knacks in each level that you can hunt for, given a neat sense of exploration, even if all it does is add little dolls in the main lobby.That all said, there are a few issues. One annoying one is the give-away hints. Your uncle will give you a hint on how to beat the chamber after a while of being in. It's a neat idea, help stumped players get through, but often times he says it after what seems 1 failed attempt (not counting deaths), which means if you don't get a puzzle right first try (whether or not you get the solution) he's gonna chime in and basically become Navi (There is one puzzle where you clearly have to go up, and he constantly goes ""You need to get higher."") If the hints were so dead give-away (Almost shouting ""HERE IS THE SOLUTION"") or he didn't just tell you within moments of entering the room this wouldn't be an issue, but together it can be a bit annoying.Another is some questionable hit detection. Numerous times I've been standing on a ledge where suddenly I just get booted off, or I hit a ceiling that still appears numerous feet away. It can cause some annoying and at times frustrating deaths.The game itself is also rather short, unfortunately. Though it could be positive because that also means it doesn't over stay it's welcome.On a side note I have seen this game compared to Portal. While it has a Portal feel to it, it's not going to quite get rid of that itch, though it will help satisfy it.Overall, a really fun puzzle game and definitely worth getting if you are looking for an enjoyable game.

												This fun and innovative puzzle game will keep you playing for hours. Designed by Kim Swift, who was a lead designer for Portal. Some people say it is similar to Portal, and that may be true for the number of innovations in the physics of the game, the only real similarities are button/cube-based puzzles, which even that has its own twist. In this game you shift the dimensions at your will to make objects fluffy and light, metal and heavy, slowed down, and reversed gravity to solve a huge number of puzzles. Promotional items for Team Fortress 2 were availiable to those who pre-ordered this game, but may eventually be added into the drop system.			"

												Quantum Conundrum is, well, a conundrum. While I was at first drawn in by its Portal-esque humor and gameplay, this game can become quite infuriating It relies heavily on physics puzzles and first-person platforming. The former is difficult to do well, and Quantum Conundrum makes a valiant effort, but certain puzzles are simply broken and rely much on repeated tries before the game deems you worthy to work properly. First-person platforming, however, is impossible to do well. QC is no exception; oftentimes you will know exactly how to finish a puzzle but keep falling off the platform you're on. That's not difficulty - that's just infuriating. All in all, if you like Portal and etc., you may indeed like Quantum Conundrum. And I do like it, but it is a flawed game.			"

												Quantum Conundrum is a great little puzzle-platformer focusing on a boy who ventures into a mansion to acquire a glove that can flux between several dimensions and find his uncle, who is voiced by none other than John de Lancie (who voiced Discord on MLP:FiM). The game is fantastic, straight away you have to solve fun puzzles which will work your brain quite a bit and then get across rooms with a bit of platforming. However, the lack of multiplayer and the lag spikes in between levels can be quite troublesome. Of course, while these faults bring down the game's overall score, I still recommend you buy this game with a reduced price. For a price of around £3 (including DLC and soundtrack) during the sales, pick this game up and you'll spend hours having a good time. It's not a perfect game, but it's still spectacular.			"

												Where Portal and Psychonauts meet.It's a quite fun first person 3D physics puzzle platformer, where you acquire up to four different ways to affect the physics and thus what you can perform on a given level (e.g. the first one is the ""fluffy dimension"", which makes everything on the scene lighter so you can e.g. actually carry all the normally too heavy stuff around; alas, the physics can get wee bit random at times, which may come in your way).Heed my warning though: the platformer part is just brutal and unforgiving. Probably 3rd person perspective would work better.If you try to limit the number of dimension shifts, you need smarts and sometimes patience, so it's good, but I sadly don't see myself getting the time constraints achievement.Also, seems like if you want real closure, you'll have to buy the upcoming DLCs. Looks like there are even achievements for them already in the game!Despite the mentioned caveats, you are bound to have some fun quality time with this gem.			"

												Let's get this out of the way, the game tries really hard to be Portal. Now let's forget about that and try to look at it on its own merits. It's a perfectly competent first person puzzle-em-up, really. The graphics are nice, you have a competent narrator, and most of the puzzles are just about the right difficulty. If you just want some physics puzzles you can really stop reading now, it's worth buying.The problem is that it isn't interesting. The narrator doesn't add anything to the game and the story isn't interesting; you're exploring a mansion to save your trapped uncle, there's no real mystery here (except a small, uninteresting ""twist"" and the end). I personally find this aspect very important in puzzle games, weird as it may seem; Portal (oops, I said it again!) had an interesting story, Infinifactory has an interesting story, Magrunner has an interesting story, and this *really* helps make the puzzles more interesting; you're not just solving puzzles for the sake of it, you have an overarching story and reason to actually persist. Quantum Conundrum does not. There's no attraction here other than the puzzles themselves - which is fine, really, but it drags the game down. It's still worth buying if you want a game where you enter puzzle rooms, listen to the narrator, and then solve the puzzle. Just don't expect it to be funny or engaging.edit: Even if you find De Lancie amusing (I don't, but eh, tastes differ) he isn't in the DLC; they're purely puzzles. This means they're even less interesting, but the general statement of quality still applies.			"

												Quantum Conundrum isn't a Valve game, but it really aspires to be. As everyone by now knows, Kim Swift was one of the key contributors to Portal and it's spiritual predecessor, Narbacular Drop. And you can't help wonder if Narbacular Drop would have turned out a little more like Quantum Conundrum if Valve hadn't turned it into Portal.But her time at Valve has certainly rubbed off. You have a first person perspective, the classic Valve learning curve, a silent protagonist, a guiding voice, Team Fortress-style graphics, and no annoying cutscenes whatsoever.Although it never reaches Valve's high quality-bar, QC is funny, charming, inventive and has just enough variety of puzzles to keep you going. It suffers from being just a little too easy (and I don't think I'm being immodest!), and from a very basic plot which only offers any true feeling of peril in it's closing minutes.What QC does well is to remind you that fun and originality don't have to be confined to indie titles. Well done Square Enix.			"

												It's great that we get more physics based puzzle games. Problem with this game is that the puzzles are not that clever. More than once I ended up overthinking a solution because I just could not belive the puzzles were so dumb and repetitive. The story is so baddly written that it almost becomes annoying and in that sense this game would have worked better without it. You don't really need to think much since the puzzles consits mostly of jumping and grapping objects in mid air. It doesn't help that the movement mechanics are sloppy at best. Visuals and music are really dull. This game is just really boring and I had to force trough it.			"

												A funny and imaginative twist on a few interesting puzzle concepts put together. The dialog and humor are on key, very reminiscent of the type of science-based comedy found in the Portal games. Each puzzle is fairly well put together based around the few puzzle aspects. The puzzles revolve around the possibility to ""swap between dimensions."" Each dimension gives the puzzles a new 'dimension' that it can take on. Aside from the dimensions, puzzles are mostly button pressing and platforming based. A few points are rather buggy or difficult, but otherwise a fun game. The humor alone is enough to get this game, and it will keep you playing through. It's cheap enough to get now, or on sale, so if you like puzzles or good science themed jokes, get this game.			"

												Not sure if I'm in the minority but I really didn't care for this game.  It's unfortunate that Quantum is compared to Portal because it by no means compares favorably.  There are some good elements, for sure, and there's some good humor, but it's mostly just a dull grind.  There are only a few really tricky puzzle elements, and even then they're reused so many times that the meaning is lost.  There are just too many puzzle rooms for the amount of actual puzzle in the game, unfortunately, but even then Quantum was just a short game.So it was stretched out and still too short.  Interesting eh?Another major issue I had was that the different quantum states were handed out so infrequently.  You just don't get enough time with the later ones, and you use the early ones for far too long.  Bad pacing, that.Hell, a lot of the puzzles don't have you use all four anyway.  Beyond that, a bunch are just straight up locked half the time, or you'll unlock them after having completed a small part of the puzzle.  I just didn't care for the level design.At the end of the day, though, you should definitely play this game if only to get a better idea of puzzle and level design.  Play Portal, then play this.  If nothing else, Quantum Conundrum serves as a good teaching device for how not to go about puzzle/level design and pacing.Oh, and percision platforming from first person view sucks♥♥♥♥♥♥  Those parts of the game sucked, and they're a lot of them.  The physics engine is unreliable at best, so sometimes you just repeat the same thing a bunch of times hoping that, this time, everything acts in the way you need it to in order to finish.  I'm not kidding.Final note?  I did quite enjoy the comedy of the game.  Good stuff.  But, yeah, that's a pretty weak sell.			"

My only major issue with this game is that the story was left unfinished and there is no known sequel on the horizon. Though not quite revolutionary, Quantun Conundrum knows what it is and executes excellently.

												Very enjoyable game, if you liked Portal, you will enjoy this equally, if not more in some cases. Great writing, great mechanics. Really does remind me of portal one.Not super long, but for the price its gonig for right now its worth it!			"

												As you probably already know, Quantum Conundrum is a new game from Kim Swift, the creator of Portal. And while it does share a few similarities with Portal (1st person puzzle solving, an omnipresent narrator), QC is a distinctly unique experience. Instead of Portals, the tools at your disposal are 4 ""dimensions"" (fluffy, heavy, slow-mo and reverse-grav), which you can swap between at will. Just like in Portal, each dimension, and the various techniques needed to solve puzzles using them, are introduced gradually. Each of the 3 main levels start out easy, but end up requiring ever-more mind-bending uses of the various dimension shifts to solve. I never found the game to be particularly hard, but you will definitely have to think hard about some of the solutions. All in all, it's very satisfying as a puzzle game. One other note - in addition to puzzles, a significant degree of platforming skill is required throughout (just something to be aware of). Great game... highly recommended!			"

												Having picked up the game during the summer sale I wasn't expected much from the title and even with low expectations I can now see why QC never received much attention. Before buying it, I knew it had John DeLancie doing the voice acting and that really adds character to the game but the game itself is.. well.. it's dull. The game also chooses to lean more towards platforming skills rather than puzzle ability as a large number of tasks involve creating platforms to reach other areas. The difficulty in the game mainly comes from precision jumps rather than your ability to solve puzzles and as such it varies from tediously easy to frustratingly hard. It's also a matter of pacing. The various dimensions are seperated out into different wings of the mansion. The ability to slow time to a crawl is certainly entertaining but that alone does not justify how tedious the soft/heavy dimensions are and you have to trudge through them before you get to that.I picked this up for a few quid and frankly I don't feel it was value for money. Playing with aspects of the Unreal physics engine does not alone make for a good game and this has escaped the developers understanding. It's rare for me to lose interest in a game to the point of not wanting to finish it, but QC managed to be dull enough for me to uninstall it before I reached the very end.			"

												Liked Portal and Portal 2? Don't listen to what the critics say : Listen to the gamers! Quantum Conundrum is at least as good as P1 and P2. It is different; you don't work with portals, but with dimensions. 4 different dimensions to be precise. The game has a playtime of  6 - 8 hours. The puzzles are not THAT hard, but you'll find yourself taking more time to figure them out, than you initially thought you would. I also like the humor very very much. As I said, it's different from Portal but it's funny nonetheless. If you found P1 and/or P2 at least interesting then you HAVE to buy Quantum Conundrum. BEWARE THOUGH : Do NOT pay a cent for the DLC. Both are a waste of time and money! Even if you find youself craving more levels to beat. DO NOT BUY THEM. The DLCs are not the least bit fun!			"

												A very similar game to Portal. A fitting descrption as the original creators of Portal are the masterminds behind this game. Forces you to think in 4 dimensions (or is it eight dimensions?) The humor is still spot-on, in true Portal fashion. I highly recommend this game.			"

												So this is a first person puzzle game much in the same vein as Portal. One of the creators of Portal is also behind this game so there are some similarities. But where Portal was ingenious and funny, Quantum Conundrum is not. The main difference as I see it between the games is that in Portal working out the solution to the puzzle can be a bit hard but once you do the execution of said solution is fairly easy. In Quantum Conundrum it is the exact opposite. The solutions are easy to figure out but the executions can be complex and frustrating. Needless to say, I prefer the Portal-way of doing puzzles.In Quantum Conundrum you often have to time several jumps on the row which can make it frustrating when you  miss the last jump and have to start over again. On the upside, the checkpoint-system is very generous so you dont have to redo a puzzle from the beginning but you usually continue at exactley the platform-puzzle where you failed.I found the game easy and it took me about 3 - 4 hours to complete it. The problem is that it seems that they have opted for Quantity instead of Quality when it comes to the puzzle. If you play the game for an extended period of time (over 30 minutes) you get a bit bored by the fact that every puzzle bare some resembles to the one before it which makes it feel that you are essentially solving variations of the same puzzle multiple times. It works to play it in short spurts but over 30 minutes of gametime isn't recommended.At this point it costs about €9 and I would recommend it when it drops down to $5 and if you have a real craving for a first person puzzle-game. If you haven't played Portal 1 and 2 I would recommend you to do that instead.Edit: Also, I didn't find the game funny...at all. The portal games are laugh out loud funny to me but this game fell completely flat. I found the narration to be more annoying than anything else.			"

												Game feels like Portal with different gaming mechanisms. So, it is quite entertaining. The timed jumps can be frustrating though, mainly due to the first person view. Sometimes, it's difficult to see how far you can go in order to jump - especially under the pressure of time - and you end up wondering if you're doing what is necessary to solve the puzzle or just failing at jumping properly. So it leads to a lot of trial and error where you keep dying. But overall, that's a good game, with interesting puzzles/concepts. This game has a lot of potential; if it had the Steam Workshop feature enabled where players could submit their puzzles, it would become exponentially richer and famous. Ultimately, getting it at a good discounted price (like 75%) is a good deal.			"

												Quantum Conundrum is a first person platforming puzzle game by ex-Valve employee and Portal lead designer Kim Swift.You have control over 4 different dimensions (fluffy, heavy, slow, reverse gravity) where each dimension manipulates your surroundings and objects in different ways.The puzzles aren't exactly hard, but often require good timing and reflexes. QC has a rather funny and cartoon-y art style, which definitely fits the overall theme of the game.On the downside, the level design is kinda repetitive and the devs seemed to use the copypaste function more than they should.Unfortunately, the game doesn't seem to offer that much replay value, so unless you're a completionist, you're probably done in about 6-7 hours. For a fun and polished game like QC, that's still a pretty good deal, though. And with the DLCs already being announced, there's enough reason to boot up the game again and try the new puzzles.So, if you're into first person puzzling, make sure to check QC out!			"

												Despite the excellent casting and intriguing design, this game just isn't very fun.  Once you've figured out the solution to the puzzle, you haveto execute your first person platforming flawlessly to advance.First person platforming isn't fun.  Portal got away with it by making the puzzles static logic puzzles with minor twitch elements.  This game features highly frustrating, twitch heavy, dynamic puzzles that feel contrived.  I prefer my puzzle games to be cerebral; twitch timing can stick to first person shooters in my book.Pass on this one.			"

												I've spent a fair while in this game, both from a first play through, and then to complete the additional challenges. When you're playing through the game's story mode, it's fairly good.You can see that there are plently of elements common to the genre, which you might be tempted to use to draw parallels to ""portal"". There's the crazy mad scientist with puzzle rooms you need to solve in order to progress. But that is where the similarities end. As far as the story goes, while John de Lancie does a good job in voicing the mad scientist [uncle quadwrangle], he provides some humorous quotes. But that's it, just some disconnected quotes. You're shoved into the house, and something has gone wrong. OK, fine, I can run with this. Your uncle is a scientist who invents crazy contraptions. The thing is, it is never explained why there are these vast ""puzzle rooms"", and aside from the dimension hopping you never interact with any other inventions aside from the bots and seeing them in paintings. All this and the story ends rather abruptly with you savingyour uncle but now you're trapped instead, ok that's the end, bye.. Plus, the DLC doesn't really add anything to the story, other than some extra puzzles without any voiceover.As far as the gameplay goes, playign through the game once, and everything is pretty fun. You get to experiment with physics in different dimensions and try to reach the exits. But when you replay it to try and beat the challenges [speed runs, finding collectibles, using fewest shifts], you realise that the physics engine isn't really very good. Frequently the ""dollis"" will spit out cubes in such an inconsistent way that it becomes very hard to speedrun. You'll find that cubes landing on bots sometimes randomly move about, which can screw up a run. It's less of a physics engine and more a sort of functionally-scripted environment. It can get very annoying at times trying to deal with it.The music is quite good though, and the game controls well with a controller, which is saying somethign considering it's a first person game. The graphics are really nice, with a sort of cartoonish feel which matches quite well with the portrayal of the mad scientist and his funny quotes.Overall though, I would not reccomend this game. The physics annoyances is really what kills it. I could live with a mediocre story, but when you consider that the physics makes up a large part of the game it's not really acceptable that it should fail like that.			"

												Quantum Conundrum is a first person puzzle adventure (Portal clone) where you must master four elements (heavy, light, gravity reverse, and time slow) to traverse through the different levels. Thankfully, the gameplay is fun and the puzzles are a decent challenge, because it lacks in several other areas. Boring visuals, laggy moments between levels, and a lackluster story which didn't make much sense to me, plus the narrator berating me every 2 minutes didn't make me feel very welcome.

												[***WARNING: SPOILERS***]Well guys, will tell you this game IN REVERSE. The ending was horrid. Not only do you NOT get to see the professor (outside of pictures throughout the house that is), when you get to the end - and start to free him, the game abruptly ENDS! Thats right - the game stops, a cartoon cut scene explaining that you and him ended up swaping places. Then the credits roll. FAILOK, that said. this game is FKN AMAZING! First off, do not play it right after you finish the PORTAL series. You'll be greatly disappointed, as you will spend a lot of your time comparing the two.  PORTAL is more of LOGIC based puzzles and QC is more PHYSICS based. You have four dimension, you are introduced to one at a time, and are in control of throughout the game. Each one is used to help solve each room you traverse through, as yo make your way down to save your uncle (who, at the beginning got stuck in a different dimension)FLUFFY: makes things light, allowing you to pick up just about any item not nailed downSLOW: More like slo-motion on crack! Its REALLY slow. helps slow things downHEAVY: makes things extreamly heavy - mostly used to solve puzzles that need excessive weight - like switches(these require weirght that the safes cannot produce)REVERSE GRAVITY: reverses gravity - here you really learn about physics.. Music is very nice. and does a good job as background music, as it does not distract your attention. John De Lance was amazing as the voice of the profesor which his cutting sarcasm that makes think throughout the game - what is his real motive.One nice thing I thought was great, is the Proessor would alway give crptic clues on how to solve the room. But the first play through I did (of many) I just took them at face value and mindless patter. silly meLike PORTAL, every where you go makes sense, and the ""puzzle"" feel is NOT there, so you more or less feel like you are traveling to get your uncle, and these rooms are just in your way.Even with the horrid ending, I would still highly recommend this game just for the sheer puzzles alone.

												There's two types of ""family movies"". The ones that anyone can actually enjoy, at any age, with or without kids of their own. And then there's ""kid's movies"", the ones that only young kids can really sit through and enjoy. Sadly, this is the kind of game that falls into that later category. The humor is obvious, boring, and at times it feels ripped straight from the internet. It's aesthetic is the kind that you can tell is trying really hard to be cute, but I certainly don't think it really succeeded. Cartoony, sure, but hardly cute. The puzzles are eazy to figure out, but often frustating and stressful to actually carry out. This is all really sad, because the mechanics themselves are ridiculously good. With some slight tweaking, a bit more testing, and some slight redesigning, and maybe someone taking a new approach to the script, this could have been a really fun, compelling game. But you're just much better off looking for some other puzzle game, one that won't frustrate you with annoying acrobatics, some wonky game design, and the occasional cringe inducing one liner (there's only one character, ALL the dialogue is one liners).Maybe, just maybe, if it's on a really good sale, pick it up. Kid's will love it, I'm sure. If it's just for you, though, I can't say I'd recommend spending more than $3 on this. Some good ideas, not the best execution, nothing too memorable about it. 5/10			"

												Just beacuse its by the person behind Portal, dosent mean that it has VALVe qualaty.The first thing wrong with it is that there are no options. At all. The settings are pretty much stuck at where they start and that isnt nessicarily a good thing. The first thing you'll notice after starting the game is this horrible motion blur that happens when you look around. You cant turn this off and it makes the game incredibly painfull to play. Speaking of play the game consists largely of percision platforming that is influenced my the games various dimensions. Many of you may notice the problem already, but if it isnt clear, percision platforming and FPS games dont generally go well togther. The whole problem being that your unable to see your feet and all that. This combined with the nauseating motion blue effect I explained earlier make the levels painfull to play. I can't recall the number of times It looked like I was going to make a jump only to fall short or overshoot. Go play Portal instead.			"

												This is a game a lot of people, including me, were pretty exited about when it was announced. Unfortunately it falls a bit short of the expectations it set. It just feels like the developers were to concentrated on making a game like portal but different and as a result it comes across as forced. Go look at the descriptions for Portal 1 & 2, nowhere does it talk about how funny the game is. As a result it catches you off guard and is quite hilarious at times. On the other hand you have QC which makes sure you know their trying to be funny which takes away the edge, the surprise. I eventually just turned the volume for the voices down. I feel part of the problem is it seems the dev fell into the trap of having a child main character causing the tone, and subsequently the humor, to tend towards childish. Everything about the game just feels like it was made for 8-10 year olds. All that being said it is still probably worth a play. The mechanics do make for some interesting puzzles and it is different enough from other games to be of value. Just don't expect it to be comparable to the gems that are Portal 1 & 2.

												Bought it during Autumn sales. Been in my wishlist since release date, got the game + DLCs for 5 euros. Doesn't really have the appeal it needs. The rooms are challenging, ok, but there is nothing like the intellectual room design you find in portal. same goes for the 'crazy professor' voice. He is always speaking and trying to make you smile, but it is more like a 'meh?' smile, not even close to the perfection of GLADOS humour (note: Kim Swift is behind the idea). Well, not bad for 5 euros, but definitely not 15 euros. Got fed up with it very soon. I'll leave it on the desktop and see if I'll play some chambers now and then....might as well just go for some puzzle game on smartphone...that's the 'depth' of this game. (55/100 : game not yet finished)			"

												A quite average puzzle platformer, with ""humerous"" monologues sprinkled throughout. I will be perfectly honest; I couldn't get through it. Not because it's difficult (the difficulty lies only in the logic of the puzzles - no biggie) but because I couldn't stand the gameplay and colour scheme. The movement is floaty, and ill suited to precision jumps, and the aformentioned logic of the puzzles have more to do with how funny the developers think they are than established mechanics. Beyond that I personally found the colorpalette grading and hard to suffer through.If you are looking for a colourful comedy puzzle platformer, this is one. I found it to cringeworthy in it's comedy and aesthetics and lacking in gameplay, so I can't reccomend it.			"

												ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!Yes, the basics are there. The concept is there. But...Sweet f*cking Jesus, this game is fun at first, but then it shows it's true nature: desperately trying to make the janky physics work over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over and over and over and over and over again! Especially with the power cores: if you want your game to have mechanics based on physics, which require you to get the core from point A to point B by manipulating said physics, why in the F*CK is the godd*mn core shaped like a 12-sided dice?! Especially when the corners keep scraping single pixels and making you start over again!And the DLC's are even worse! In Desmond's Debacle, the developers thought it was a good idea to add invisible walls for the cores to keep go in the right direction. The problem is that the because of those walls, the cores keep randomly switching direction and COMPLETELY messing up everything you do!And the more you play the game, the more you see the unpolished mechanics. Exactly why do I lose ALL of my momentum when I step off from any object you can ride (as in stand on)? Example: you're riding a safe to get to a platform on a wall above a pit. The safe is flying at the speed of around 30km/h. As the platform is coming up, you jump off the safe to land on the platform. Too f*cking bad, you have now lost all of the momentum, as if you were just spawned there and you'll fall in to the pit to your death. Why? Because f*ck actual physics and f*ck you!I'm sorry, but this game is much, MUCH more frustrating than it is fun. Trust me, I went for the achievements because I didn't want this piece of sh*t beat me. Every fiber of my being hates this game now...			"

When you get the ability to slow time, STOP PLAYING IMMEDIATELY. The game turns to♥♥♥♥♥♥shortly afterwards, as it changes to precision platforming in first person.

												This game is a flawed gem. It's a very innovative way of playing, it's got a weird atmosphere, and the puzzles are very good. The game is visually appealing, and all the dimensions are fun. However the game tends to be repetitive and frustrating at times, and it feels that with some more polish, it could be much better. However at such a small price, it's a steal. I highly recommend it.			"

												This is a fun little game that I recommend you get when it's on sale. The dialogue is funny, the story is interesting, and the gameplay is fun. The puzzles are very simple, but you may still have a little trouble getting some on your first try - the game doesn't try very much to focus on the puzzle aspect, and is more interested in testing your timing skills (which I personally am not a fan of, but found interesting anyway). Even so, the game is well balanced and the pacing is good, so I find it to be an enjoyable experience all the way through.The DLC on the other hand is HORRIBLE. The levels are WAY too difficult, and once (if) you figure out what you need to do, it's usually very tedious or frustrating because you will keep dying. It is NOT fun at all. Do NOT buy the DLC unless you want to torment a friend. I finished The Desmond Debacle and got half way through IKE-aramba before giving up on a timing puzzle that required inhuman precision.For more in-depth commentary and spoilers, you can watch my full playthrough here:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBCsoffCh90rL5X-rLpD9_vheq-uTCGt- "

												I really enjoyed this game, the puzzles were tough and made me scratch my head a few times. The concept is quite original and does require heavy thinking, especially when the game throws you a puzzle that requires all 4 dimensions to complete the puzzle.John de Lancie is great in this game too, he voices your uncle who is a scientist who makes wonderful gadgets and gismos, especially the glove you wear all the way through your journey. (not really a spoiler since it's told in the trailers and start of the game)The music isn't half bad either! Worth picking up in my opinion.However, nothing is perfect... let's get to the downsides, and this is a spoiler on the ending... in a spoiler free way though, I'll just say the ending sucks. All you get is a 30 second clip telling you that your character has been sent to a pocket dimension that your uncle was trapped in this entire time, while your uncle then gets out and tries to fix a problem that he helped you cause because he lost his memory and this problem is going to effect the entire planet. Then it rolls the credits.You may think that sounds awesome but it's explained in 30 seconds, and if you think that's enough for an awesome cutscene explaining that, you're wrong since the cutscenes in this game are set up exactly like the main menus, so you just see a drawing of the house fall into the ocean in an innocent cartoon-y fashion and then it shows the whole planet change colour repeatedly. That's it. No awesome looking climax like in Portal and Half-Life 2.It's a real shame this game had no better cutscene since the game was building the ending to be a nice sparkly bow to a great game, but it didn't which is a real shame since the game is worth it at full price but the ending made me feel like I wasted my time and that everything I did in the game was really for nothing. If the game was designed to be a series of tests that didn't have a narrative or story, then I wouldn't mind it but because it was building up this story, the ending felt very lazy and tacked on to make you interested into buying a sequel that we may never get (and unlikely will get).To wrap it up: The game is worth the full price, but the ending didn't make the game feel worth the journey (even though it is worth playing) and doesn't make me feel interested in buying the DLC. Oh, and the collectible items are really well hidden.			"

												So pretty much, if you loved portal, you're going to love this game. The puzzles are very similar to the style of portal's, and the lead dev also was part of the first portal (surprise surprise). You use 4 different dimensions, which you can change at will, to solve puzzles. Fluffy,  Heavy   Slow Mo  and  Reverse Gravity . They aren't all unlocked from the start, but you slowly unlock each one as you progress through the story.  PLUS, ITS NARRORATED BY JOHN DE LANCIE! JOHN ♥♥♥♥ING LANCIE!How much better does it get?

Reddit-jokes,♥♥♥♥♥♥puns and ""US SCIENTISTS HUH"" jokes are all beneath the shell of this 5 hour game.Putting♥♥♥♥♥♥jokes & pandering to a certain demographic aside, QC is a fairly entertaining game. The artstyle & graphics are beautifully crafted and are Pixar-like in their appearance (though, baffably, there's no in-game AA option) and the gameplay remains solid throughout. Whilst QC is billed as a puzzler, levels have a fair amount of platforming thrown in as well to mixed results.The puzzles themselves are consistently easy throughout, I only found myself stuck on two occasions, with the narrator often throwing hints at you moments after you've entered the level. 4/10. It's too expensive for what it is. (Not as good as Portal XDD)			"

												Man, I honestly wanted to enjoy this game a lot more than I did but the number of things taken directly from Portal and then executed terribly was surprising.Some points:- The GlaDOS/Chell relationship is awkward and inappropriate when it's an Uncle ripping on his 10-year-old nephew/only means of rescue.- Connecting buttons/switches to doors with light-up lines is a good idea when the lines actually lead your eye somehow and aren't just haphazardly placed everywhere.- Exposing the ""outside"" of the “test-chambers” as the game progressed was necessary why?- You even did the part where the player falls down a giant elevator shaft to the heart of the facility? Seriously?- The end credits song was unbearable. Just terrible.That being said; I loved the clever book titles and neat paintings. There were also some really neat levels, and the general mechanics were very interesting. These things deserved much more than an awkward and poorly written first-person platformer.			"

												After playing it for a bit I initially enjoyed it quite a bit, with it's charming art style and ingenious gameplay mechanics mashed together into a brilliant puzzle game.But for me it is just too much like Portal, I don't even want to play it anymore because Portal is better (Portal 2 I mean, not Portal 1). Too many similarities to keep me interested.			"

												I've just completed this game and I can't recommend it at all. This abomination of a game disguises itself with the Day of the Tentacle graphics, but is really an exercise in frustration. The basis of this game, the physics engine, is highly unreliable. Nearly every advanced procedure becomes a gamble. The checkpoint (which is a bad system to start with) saves neither your level time nor your dimension change count. This means: Every level (up to five minutes with ~50 required changes and REALLY tough time challenges) has to be done in one go to get the achievements. You'll waste a insane amount of time. One of the worst ""gaming"" experiences of my life.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.P.S.: Believe it or not. The DLC's are even worse. You'll just want to punch the devs in the face, really really hard....			"

												This game is pretty good. There are a lot of puzzles to get through. There are four different ""dimensions""; light-weight, heavy-weight, time slow-down, and inverse gravity. All four mechanics make for some interesting puzzles. The game is well-paced. It doesn't throw too much at you at once. It gradually builds you up.Professor Fitz Quadwrangle's mansion expresses a goofier side to science compared to the more sinister side to science that is Aperture Science.What grabbed my attention with this game was that it had Kim Swift as director, and I know her to have worked on the Portal series. Glad I bought this game.			"

												While the game boasts stunning visuals, it contains none of the heart and amazingness of the Portal series. In both games, I get plenty of insults but, at least, in Portal the insults were tongue-in-cheek and endlessly quotable. The story does not come to any conclusion either. I couldn't wait to finish the game so that I would never have to play it again and move to something else. I'd rather prefer Portal co-op any day to this.			"

												Quantum Conundrum is one of the many examples of a good idea with poor execution. It has an idea that works, but the puzzles feel like they don't use the mechanics to it's full potential. My other main problem is the platforming. I've rarely seen good platforming in a Portal style physics game, and this game is no exception. Trying to land from point A to point B is an absolute nightmare with a first-person view! As for things I liked, the obvious one is John De Lancie as the narrator. His preformance is absolutely phenomenal and had me laughing through out my playthrough! I also love the visuals in the game! It's a nice bright cartoonish art style that is absolutely great to look at! My favorite thing about the visuals is how stuff like paintings, safes, etc. change depending on what dimension you're in! But overall, the game was mediocre at best, and got quite boring after only 40 minutes of playing. (And I also ♥♥♥♥ing hate Ike)			"

												I really wanted to like this game. When I finished the Portal games I had friends recommend QC to me saying it was sort of similar. And it is kind of. But it's also a lot more frustrating.This game is only fun until you reach a puzzle that is based less on your intellect and more on how how good you are at timing. There have been too many puzzles where I could see what I needed to do, but was unable to do it. If you don't want to spend a long time doing the same thing over and over until you finally get it right so you can progress, don't bother with the game.			"

												This is an okay first person platformer/puzzler. If you don't mind horrible, horrible puns and you're in the mood for interesting brain teasers Portal-style, this will keep you entertained for a little bit. The puzzles are mostly very simple - you're not going to find almost anything that will stump you, but from time to time you'll see an ingenious use of one or two physical mechanics related to your powers. At $20, this game pretty much lived up to its expectations for the price, but didn't surpass them. The story that drives you forward is silly-dumb and will make you wish for a more interesting plot, but it's mostly ignorable. Get this only if you miss FPS puzzle games and you don't want to play Portal again. 2 out of 5 foxes.			"

												I will not mention Portal in this review. Ops. Well, obviously this will rightfully compared to Portal and it's obviously inferior.The gameplay is fine - although unlike Portal, there's a lot of platforming and precision jumping/timing in it - and the design of some of the puzzles is awesome, but in every other aspect the game falls short. Especially the comedy aspect. It's just not a funny game, and seeing it try to be funny constantly while not being so is kind of annoying.So all said, I recommend this game only to fans of this specific genre. Everyone else, go play Portal. And Portal 2. And Anti-chamber, probably.			"

												Cool, fun, quirky, like a Saturday morning Disney cartoon version of Portal. So why the negative review? Because the ending is pretty lackluster. So much so that it ruins the game for me. That is to say, however, as soon as a sequel comes out for this game that perhaps will more adequately tie up the story - get this game. The physics puzzles are very fun and can go from pathetically easy to mindbendingly difficult. I noticed that different people got held up by different puzzles, and many puzzles had more than 1 solution (though only one solution would be the easiest to execute). The characters of your crazy uncle and his extradimensional friend IKE are engaging and interesting, though not really unique. The house itself also has a character, communicated via the paintings found hanging around the grounds. It was a nice touch by the studio to have the paintings change according to which dimension you're in. A fun game for kids and adults alike, as long as you don't mind the ending being a real let-down. Hopefully a sequel will let me change the recommendation in the future.			"

												""I Hope You Enjoy Jumping Puzzles: The Game""This game is basically just a poorly-executed version of Portal devoid of the personality that added so much to that game's exceptional concept. The writing tries really hard to be funny and charming, but fails. The gameplay is pretty mediocre. The story makes no sense, and the environments are very same-ish and repetitive. If you absolutely have to have a physics-based puzzler and you've already played both Portal games, maybe this will satisfy you briefly (it has three or four decent puzzles). But it really, really isn't worth more than 5 bucks.			"

												♥♥♥♥ this♥♥♥♥♥♥If I could downvote this game on Steam I would.  Figuring out the puzzles is easy.  Pulling off the complex timing and repetitive reflex manuvers needed to solve them is maddening.  Being forced to restart from the beginning of a puzzle because of one mistake is the work of the devil.The art assests and level design are the very definition off cookie-cutter layouts, and the music is as bland as it is forgettable.  John De Lancie phones this one in, but he can't take all the blame as the writing is as witless and dry as he portrays it to be.I've actualy encountered game halting bugs while playing, where the game fails to keep track of objects being destroyed through the various dimensional shifts causing me to have to reload certain sections of the game in order to retry them.I can't even recommend this game for kids as death is a constant factor in the game, which is handled poorly with one-liner throw-aways telling you of how bland and stale life is.  Add to the fact that some zones that appear to be safe are infact instant death only makes this situation worse.  In one area you can walk on metal plating and in another area it will kill you without rhyme nor reason.If there was one word to describe this game, it would be ""Bland.""  What made this game so annoying was that I was actually trying to enjoy it, but at almost every turn the crappy gameplay would just get in the way and punish me with death for a mis-step or force me to start an entire room over for a single mis-click.I will attest to being a masocist for challenging games, but there was no hint of a reward that would make me want to pursue playing this game further.  I can easily forgive bad gameplay if there was good writing, music or art to back it up  But this game has none of those things going for it.One afterword:  This game was designed for consoles in mind and it shows.  If that bothers you, well that's even more of a reason NOT to play it.			"

												At times it's actually more of a first-person platformer than a puzzle game, and the physics are actually pretty lousy for a game that depends on physics so much. For example, your character appears to have no momentum of his own, so if you jump while standing on an object, you suddenly stop in mid-air and fall. It's somewhat disappointing and makes the puzzles more frustrating than necessary to solve.			"

												A big disappointment for me. From the Portal's designer I was expecting a challenge for my mind, but instead I was too often forced to jump. it's not easy to jump in first person 3D games, at least for me. At one point I just kept on falling and said ""that's enough"", uninstalled the game and never played it since. I do not recommend it to people who are not good jumpers in Unreal engine powered first person games.			"

												While intriguing in concept, the game just doesn't pull through enough to make it interesting. The areas in which the game is set are very bland, with little detail to actually look at. The execution is alright, if a little annoying at times when you scramble to figure out which button does what, but overall worked. The issue was with the challenge. Some of them were downright simple, while others required such precise timing that it was neigh impossible to pull them off sometimes. There were also other issues such as round buttons having painfully obvious square hitboxes (i.e. the buttons), and rather than being able to run through what should have been an accessible and much faster path was foiled by the hitboxes.

												TLDR: Seems totally reasonable if you play in bounds. Punishes you for breaking the rules.As some of the negative reviews have said, maybe this game just wasn't for me. I'm sure if you play it the way the designers intended, you'd have a great time with it. I don't want to dissuade anyone who wants a nice puzzle game with well done art, which you play while Q from Star Trek makes vague jabs at you from his intercom. If that is your bag, then this game is for you.That said, I prefer treading on the edges of what game designers want you to do (I used to be QA for a game company and it never left my system I guess). I didn't make it to far into the game before it punished me for breaking a puzzle. I'd managed to sneak an extra safe into one of the levels from a previous level. I was hoping for an achievemnt, I would've accepted just solving the puzzle without jumping through all the hoops the level wanted me to, but instead, it just magically vaporized my safe when I took it to the side of the room where safes weren't allowed. As far as I could tell this wasn't the designers not accounting for what I did (which is fine), it was them accounting for what I did and deciding it still wasn't allowed. This bothered me greatly.I hope to still finish the game at some point, but for the time being it has left a bad taste in my mouth, and I wanted to warn anyone who picked this up looking for a game that rewards ingenuity outside of the original designers plans.  Again, if that's not you, this is (probably, I haven't finished it yet) a great game.			"

												You'd think that a game made by one of the key developers of the original Portal would understand that first-person platforming is terrible...  But Kim Swift it seems is not too swift.The game does not focus on puzzle mechanics so much as jumping on boxes mechanics.  From a third person perspective, this would be alright, but it just feels clunky and frustrating so much of the time here.The game does feel like it was done entirely for the console, which is unfortunate.  I would not say it is a bad game, but it is not a good follow up to games like Portal, Portal 2, and Q.U.B.E.			"

This game is more of a platformer than a puzzle game.  Thus it is more about execution than thought.  I personally didn't like the game.

												This is a pleasant puzzle game, like a Saturday Morning cartoon version of Portal. Please take note that it's quite short (finished the story in 7 hours, give or take time being baffled by a room), but the light-hearted sardonically humorous dialogue and art makes up for it.ALSO, if you are a fan of the vocal stylings of John de Lancie ( voice of Q and Discord), you will adore being his nephew. Hopping over unsafe lasers and dodging falling safes while listening to your new inventor uncle advise and patronize you is a most enjoyable mind-testing experience.

												Quantum Conundrum is a suprisingly unique puzzle game.  The puzzles are well made and fairly easy to solve, though they're substantially harder if you're trying to do the speed/min-shift runs. The art style works extremely well for the game.  The environment, including the many paintings, changes when shifting between dimensions, which is a very cool effect.  Quantum Conundrum is narrated by John de Lancie, and he voices your whimsicle, mad-scientist uncle perfectly.  The main game lasted me about 11 hours, and it comes highly recommended as the best puzzle game I've played since Portal 2.			"

												Although the puzzles were sometimes clever, they were also disappointingly obvious most of the time and occasionally frustrating (see: first person platforming). It is often compared to Portal, but the comparison really only holds up to 1) It's a first person puzzle platformer and 2) the objective is to solve the room puzzle to advance. However, if you like the Portal genre, you'll get some satisfaction out of this.The environmental effects when you change dimensions are very well done and were the highlight of the game for me. While I enjoyed my time with it, I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel to flesh out the true potential of this franchise.			"

												An interesting 1st person puzzle platformer, in which the main mechanic consists in switching between 4 dimensions which affect your surroundings. For example: you can make objects lighter to transport them/throw them, make them heavier to break through glass or indestructible.I recommend it simply for the puzzles and the satisfaction it gives to complete a section when you've discovered an entirely new mechanic a dimension proposes, just by yourself. Honestly, there's a lot more into play than in Portal 1 and almost as much as Portal 2, and if you liked those two games, there's a lot of content to entertain you for a while in this game.However, I believe this game has a major flaw: its ending. No spoilers will be given here, but honestly, there is a great, inmensely great build-up while progressing through the final stages of the game. I was genuinely curious as to what was going to happen in the very last puzzle, and started imagining what it could be; but... Nothing. A rather abrupt ending, virtually no final puzzle, and... in retrospect, the puzzles right before the ending weren't even that much of a challenge either. I would have expected their difficulty/completxity to be something much greater, but... meh. I was really disappointed. And I mean, really, disappointed.Nonetheless, it's still a good game, and I really recommend it for those who want to enjoy the challenge and the gimmicks that this game can offer.			"

												Some peoples say: if you like Portal then you like this game. Not really. First and most important - different puzzle ""complete mechanism"". What i mean: in Portal (at least in Portal 2) you need figure, how this puzzle must be solved (main time) and then solve puzzle for a minute; in QC you figure how this puzzle must be solved for a minute and then must do some keyboards ninja tricks (quite frequently difficult and annoying). So, you often facing with a situation, when you straight know how puzzle must be solved, but can't done it, because not so fast and not in the order press keys. And you must repeat, repeat, repeat.Plus poor level environment: just sofas, tables and cabinets with books in ALL levels.If you can deal with above, you can get  fun, because this still decent game and anyway it worth a try.Also recommend ""Flip a Switch"" song from QC Soundtrack.

												As of this writing, I'm only ~25% in, but I honestly feel that's enough to write a recommendation for this.Think Portal, but without Thinking With Portals and instead thinking with Interdimensional Travel. Without a psychopathic AI nagging you, there's a potentially psychopathic family member, voiced by none other than John De Lancie, who provides just as much amusement as GLaDOS does.Drawing comparisons between this and Portal is pretty much the best way to describe it. It's a puzzler with moving things around and physics based puzzles that relate to the current properties of a material. Want something heavy? Lightweight? In slow motion? There's a dimension to solve that puzzle there.I'm playing with slightly bad framerate so the jumps are a little trickier for me, but it's something ignorable to the rest of the gameplay.Brilliant, and I strongly recommend you put down anything nonimportant / nonessential and buy this and play - right now.

												If you enjoyed the Portal series, then you may enjoy this game. It is developed from Kim Swift, who also worked on Portal. This doesn't use the same ideas, but does use being able to change the molecular structure of every item in a level to make things lighter, heavier, slower, or reverse gravity. This creates many different possibilities for levels that haven't been in any other game. It also has a similar narrator. There are awards as well, which are for time, and amount of shifts that are applied.Rating: 8/10			"

Really a great game with Ms. Swift's trademark humor and clever puzzles. While Portal asked questions about space, Quantum Conundrum asks you to combine space with time and even a little gravity and of course makes it all fluffy... but strangely disturbing. For 15 USD definitely worth a try.			"

												This game is a great puzzle game, almost as good as Portal! It has very interesting mechanics to create puzzles, and each puzzle has a lot of creativity involved. The context and story are very funny, it is actually very fun to listen to the narrator and look around at the environment details like paintings and such. The game is a bit short and easy, the hardest puzzle is much easier than Portal's hardest puzzle, but you will find harder puzzles in the DLCs, which I do not entirely recommend because some puzzles' increased difficulty is due to the addition of trial and error to solve, which introduces frustration.

First of all, a significant portion of the game does not involve portals of any kind, but does involve a chuck of simmilar and more difficult puzzles. Also, it's sillier and targeted toward a younger audience. You can tell because when you die, there are life messages, and all of them are talking to younger kids.Overall, if you've played Portal 1/2 and enjoyed it, you'll enjoy this game. If you don't like first-person puzzle games with shooter mechanics, you won't like this game.			"

												This game feels familiar... it feels like Portal!  Kim Swift was lead designer, and it shows.  Sure, it doesn't have the writing of Portal... but that bar is so high.They really poured a lot of love into this game.  Little things aren't necessary to the gameplay but enhance the setting and put a smile on my face.  Paintings change according to the dimension -- go Fluffy and everything is pink and soft, maybe wearing a bunny suit... go Heavy and everyone wears leather and spikes.  Quite silly!  It's also fun to hear John de Lancie's voice.The whole game has a 'relaxed' feel... I've been pacing myself, playing a level or two a day, and it feels right.  Puzzles are straightforward so far; kind of a slow start, but this makes it accessible to people who haven't played Portal.  It's inexpensive, very family-friendly, and is the sort of thing I'd be glad to recommend to everyone from my 8-year-old cousins to my 30 year old friends.  There aren't many games out there that can boast that!			"

												Although the puzzles were sometimes clever, they were also disappointingly obvious most of the time and occasionally frustrating (see: first person platforming). It is often compared to Portal, but the comparison really only holds up to 1) It's a first person puzzle platformer and 2) the objective is to solve the room puzzle to advance. However, if you like the Portal genre, you'll get some satisfaction out of this.The environmental effects when you change dimensions are very well done and were the highlight of the game for me. While I enjoyed my time with it, I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel to flesh out the true potential of this franchise.			"

												I bought this hoping for an experience similar to Portal. 9 hours and beaten, but it was cheap. It's a good game, but it has a major problem: John de Lancie (the PC's uncle) NEVER shuts up. He's annoying enough when he's not giving away the key to every puzzle you come across. I really started to loathe the character while playing this game. I guess the devs figured that they'd take as much advantage of the celebrity factor as possible, but the result is a deeply negative impact on what makes this game fun: figuring out the puzzles for yourself. They should have just asked GlaDOS.			"

												If Portal and Portal 2 are A grade movies, then Quantum is a solid B-.Quantum offers a spin on first-person puzzles being that it is a game based on different dimensions, and how you use them to complete the objective. The dimensions come from a glove you wear in the game, and are activated on-cue through keyboard bindings. The four dimensions are:1. ""Fluffy"" - Makes it so you can lift and throw what would normally be too heavy to handle items.2. ""Heavy"" - Makes items that would be considered ""light"" to instead have their mass increased (weigh more in non-scientific terms)3. ""Slow"" - Basically slow-mo.4. ""Reverse Gravity"" - As it says, items float to the ceiling when activated.The main story revolves around you, portrayed as a young nephew, trying to find his Uncle who is in an unknown location and needs help rescuing. How is it in comparison to a game like Portal?Quantum is missing the ""charm"" that Portal (specifically 2) has. The characters are not as unique or likeable. For example, isntead of Wheatley and GLaDOs, you get a furry animal named Ike and your ""crazy scientist"" uncle. There are no companion cubes, instead they are replaced with cartoon-like safes. The setting is bland; a mansion. And while you go through the puzzles, your uncle keeps chiming in with one-liners you would hear from a high school math teacher.Don't get me wrong. It may sound like I hate Quantum-quite the opposite. It is a very solid game with good mechanics and physics-based puzzles. However, the magic of the game just is not there. Many of the puzzles rely on timing and reflexes rather than thought and careful design. The story is not a life-or-death scenario, but more of a child-friendly adventure.This is a game that I would solidly recommend you pick up on sale, particularly in the 50-75% off range. If you enjoyed Portal 1+2, you will enjoy this, just not nearly as much.			"

												Quantum Conundrum gives a Portal vibe in its mechanics, puzzles, use of cubes, and narrator (I'd argue the uncle is on-par or better than GLaDOS)...probably because Kim Swift, the lead designer of Portal, directed it. The game is great with building on previously-learned material, giving you a new power, then repeating. And the new powers are fun to play around with (there were many instances where I probably did something I wasn't supposed to). The uncle's monologues and the death screens provide excellent comedy. Very difficult time attack/least shifts used/no death runs for that added challenge are there when you finish the game. If you liked Portal (or Q.U.B.E.) or just like puzzles and you're looking for something new and zany, this game is definitely for you!			"

Timeruns, least dimension shifts and collectibles feed the replayability.It's a pretty good game which should have concentrated a bit more on the puzzles instead of jumping and sofa rides.For those who need a numbered rating: It's a solid 85.

												Quantum Conundrum is a suprisingly unique puzzle game.  The puzzles are well made and fairly easy to solve, though they're substantially harder if you're trying to do the speed/min-shift runs. The art style works extremely well for the game.  The environment, including the many paintings, changes when shifting between dimensions, which is a very cool effect.  Quantum Conundrum is narrated by John de Lancie, and he voices your whimsicle, mad-scientist uncle perfectly.  The main game lasted me about 11 hours, and it comes highly recommended as the best puzzle game I've played since Portal 2.			"

And yes, it is just as fun as Portal. And just as challenging but rewarding. And at times, just as irritatingly difficult. And just as addictive. But that said, it is not Portal. So, if you love puzzle games and get your kicks out of solving an intricate level that requires a finely tuned spacial sense, quick reflexes and some good timing (and yes, if you loved Portal), then I do suggest you try out Quantum Conundrum. And oh yeah; that's John de Lancie (Q from ""Star Trek: TNG"") you're hearing. Can't beat that.			"

The context and story are very funny, it is actually very fun to listen to the narrator and look around at the environment details like paintings and such. The game is a bit short and easy, the hardest puzzle is much easier than Portal's hardest puzzle, but you will find harder puzzles in the DLCs, which I do not entirely recommend because some puzzles' increased difficulty is due to the addition of trial and error to solve, which introduces frustration.

												The game is fun enough with physics based puzzles using different dimensions.  Where it falls short is the platforming that it relies on more and more as the game progresses.  It is awkward and inaccurate most of the time. Often I found myself in the situation that although I'd worked out a puzzle's solution executing the required platforming bits took repeated trials.  Nothing is more frustrating that being halted by an inability to perform simple platforming tasks rather than an actual puzzle conundrum.  Although I got pretty far into the game, I think the pain in the neck platforming will cause me to put the game in the ""probably will never finish"" category.  Someday, when I'm feeling up to the repetitveness I may  return to Quantum Conundrum but that will probably not be any time soon.			"

												This game feels familiar... it feels like Portal!  Kim Swift was lead designer, and it shows.  Sure, it doesn't have the writing of Portal... but that bar is so high.They really poured a lot of love into this game.  Little things aren't necessary to the gameplay but enhance the setting and put a smile on my face.  Paintings change according to the dimension -- go Fluffy and everything is pink and soft, maybe wearing a bunny suit... go Heavy and everyone wears leather and spikes.  Quite silly!  It's also fun to hear John de Lancie's voice.The whole game has a 'relaxed' feel... I've been pacing myself, playing a level or two a day, and it feels right.  Puzzles are straightforward so far; kind of a slow start, but this makes it accessible to people who haven't played Portal.  It's inexpensive, very family-friendly, and is the sort of thing I'd be glad to recommend to everyone from my 8-year-old cousins to my 30 year old friends.  There aren't many games out there that can boast that!			"

It starts out great with some fun puzzles and with each dimension being introdouced one at a time. But then the game takes a nose dive as it runs out of ideas and most puzzles becomes a drag of tedious platforming and recycled puzzles. I did come back though, to get perfect time and to find collectibles. So if you're a completionist or achievement addict you'll get some replay value.			"

												Sadly has to sit in the shadow of Portal, which does not mean it is bad. It just lacks that Valve polish and trips over some voice acting that is just trying to hard at some puns. You get the same ""WUUT I KNOW TO SOLVE IT!""-feeling, but not in the same pace as Portal. Most of the puzzled are figured out in seconds and then you spend 10+ minutes to fiddle around with the platforming just to execute your solution. Artstyle is pretty awesome, settings are rather poor, all you get is an option to change resolution. However, the UnrealEngine lets you set things via .ini editing. The game itself is around 5 hours the first way through and then provides speedrun/shiftgoals for every level in the game for the achievement♥♥♥♥♥s. Those are really damn hard and provide alot of extra playtime if you like speedruns.			"

												I went into QC with 2 perspectives in mind: Tycho from PA's and Yahtzee's. 2 very contrasting opinions, and I had no idea which I'd side w/, b/c Yahtzee's complaints were very concerning: That I'd be able to break 2/3rds of the puzzles by simply stacking boxes, or the platforming would be a mess.Yahtzee's complaints were puzzling. I'm srsly & obnoxiously left wondering if he just isn't any good at this type of game, or, more likely, exaggerated to an extreme. I don't think I found a single puzzle where stacking boxes & breaking the system was my 1st guess, or where it was even possible. Then again, I didn't find the game partic. mind-bending as Tycho suggested, either; but it was totally satisfying.I'm mixed on de Lancie's VA work. I love Q, & I love de Lancie as Q, but when he speaks in this game I'm picturing Q when I want to picture the mustachio'd madman of SCIENCE! It's...distracting.Level design is p. exquisite.

												A good bit of fun that I got for 1.50 on a Steam sale. It's quite short and not TOO challenging, but the design is really tight and at that price point one can hardly complain. Some of the sections rely on some pretty deft dimension swaps, which I'm not sure I always cared for, but deaths are minor and don't really upset the game's flow. The game really relies on a few underlying principles and then gradually introduces more complexity. What's nice is it felt like there were multiple solutions to each room, which made it more exciting to experiment. The story is told Portal-style and is mainly just a cute aside to bridge together the puzzles. It's intended to be quite kid-friendly so don't expect much depth in that department. Not everything needs to be a grand epic though and, while it's not going to produce big laughs, the voice of John de Lancie will still put a smile on your face. Good stuff.			"

												What can I say? It's a fun first person puzzle game, and having John de Lancie (Q from Star Trek: The Next Generation) provide his voice made it so much better. There are a lot of parallels to Portal but that is because this game was made by Kim Swift who made Portal. She even came up with the idea for Quantum Conundrum while she was working on Portal. The puzzles themselves are challenging but not frustratingly so. They are physics based and it can take a few tries to get them to behave the way you want them to. There are also plenty of hidden collectables throughout the game, so you completionists out there can get your fix. One of the downsides is that it was a little short, about six, seven hours to beat (I wasn't doing a collectable run). Overall it was fun, witty, and callenging, everything I look for in a game.9/10 would science again.			"

Like the artstyle too.Only downside (apart from the flat ending) is that the physics engine can be a bit wonky, which means sometimes you know exactly what you need to do to solve the puzzle but the sofa doesn't float quite right, or in the right direction and ugh.Still definitely worth it if you like first person physic puzzlers.

												Quantum Conundrum gives a Portal vibe in its mechanics, puzzles, use of cubes, and narrator (I'd argue the uncle is on-par or better than GLaDOS)...probably because Kim Swift, the lead designer of Portal, directed it. The game is great with building on previously-learned material, giving you a new power, then repeating. And the new powers are fun to play around with (there were many instances where I probably did something I wasn't supposed to). The uncle's monologues and the death screens provide excellent comedy. Very difficult time attack/least shifts used/no death runs for that added challenge are there when you finish the game. If you liked Portal (or Q.U.B.E.) or just like puzzles and you're looking for something new and zany, this game is definitely for you!			"

												I'm going to copy my opinion from QUBE, but it is essentially Portal 2 with better puzzles, and a weaker storyline.  Is this a bad thing?  Hellz no!  The alternate dimensions and some of the puzzle qualities that you can do with them (IE have all four dimensions available, but can only hold two at a time) make you have to do some serious thinking and planning to work out well.  This is much better than Portal, because your hand isn't held nearly as much through the game - if you are taking too long to complete it though, you will get audio with a subtle hint, which is nice.Much like QUBE though, there are some wonky physics in it.  One puzzles was especially frustrating because of it, but nothing in this game is a dealbreaker.  For a game that's as long as Portal 2 at only $15, it's a fantastic deal for fans of the genre.			"

												Everyone wants to compare this to Portal, but other than the fact that it's a puzzle game with a narrative, I really don't see that.  But then, maybe they just haven't played many of those games?At any rate, you gain power over the different dimensions as you go along, and are forced to use them to navigate a bunch of contrived scenarios.Unlike Portal, the story doesn't do a good job of explaining *why* each room is the way it is.  It explains the damage, but not the rest of the layout.But it doesn't matter.  The narrative is just there to entertain you while you solve puzzles.  Said puzzles start out extremely easy and don't ramp up in difficulty until about halfway through the game, where they suddenly get quite a bit harder...  And they stay that difficulty through the rest of the game.They tried to give it replay value by having collectables and setting time and dimension-shift goals for you to meet, but but they're completely artificial and I never feel like doing those.

												I have a love-hate relationship with this game.It's a great game and great concept, and the puzzles are well thought out.  Most of the time it's fairly obvious what you're supposed to do to pass a level.  Unfortunately, the game requires good timing and ninja like jumping from platform to platform.  If you're the sort who rage quits after the third time of missing a jump and having to restart from the last checkpoint, you'll hate this game.  I don't normally enjoy games that require that sort of exactness, but Quantum Conundrum is apparently my exception.  I'll put up with the annoyances of missed jumps, although sometimes I have to stop playing and take a break before coming back to the level.This is a game my ten year old daughter and I play together, and often when she realizes what we have to do to pass a level she shakes her head and says, ""Daddy, don't you dare!""  We go ahead and do it anyway, and have a great time with it. "

												Be warned that there were a few game breaking glitches associated with the graphics rendering so if your computer can't handle intensive game graphics, you may want to hold off. Even with the gamebreaking glitch keeping me from playing for several months, I still enjoyed the game overall. It is not nearly as good as Portal, but then again what even comes close? The humor is particularly hilarious, but the sillyness is rather welcoming and it never became annoying. The puzzles are well thought out although not as thought provoking as most other puzzle games, still enough fun for a casual play. Also be warned that much of game is even more platforming oriented that puzzle, two particular levels on the side of possibly frustrating. You will want a controller. This game isn't a masterpiece, but definitely worth a buy.			"

												So if you like action puzzles with a side of comedy (like Portal), then you'll love this.With that said there are some frustrations. Starting off small, there isn't a quit game or log out button. *SAO Panic mode*But the real issue I've had so far is that if your computer isn't up to par, don't bother. I have a decent computer, runs most games pretty well. This one was on the far end of what my computer can handle, but I dont entirely mind it being a little slow. For whatever reason though, if you have low fps, it jacks with the physics of the game, and damn near breaks some the puzzles. For example, in a Stairway to Fluffy, it supposed to set up safes in four nice stacks, but my last stack would always fall over no matter what I tried. Wondering what was wrong I checked up on some forum and found that if your fps is to low then they won't stack properly, and to fix it you had to look away from it, but then it makes it super difficult to be able to turn back around and time the laser to make the stairs.In a couple more puzzles, the low frame rates causes the little bird thing (forgot it's name) to not hold down a button long enough to activate a laser. I spent about 15 minutes wondering what I was missing when I realized that when I looked away something haad been activated.I've only been playing this game for an hour, so I can't imagine how many other game breaking malfunctions this puzzle game is going to have due to low fps, but I don't know if I can take it anymore. And it's not like there's a graphics setting that I could lower.But if you have nicer hardware, good for you. Get this game and tell me how it is.			"

												Good physics/platforming puzzle game. The main mechanic is that you can switch to 4 special ""dimensions"" to alter the physics, e.g. you can make all objects lighter so you can pick them up. In many levels you have to put a heavy object on a button to open a door. There is also a lot of timing and precise platforming, especially later on. The puzzles themselves are clever, but not super difficult. After figuring out what's going on in a level, you still need to make a plan and execute that plan, which is what takes the most time. The narration of the crazy professor (which seems to be aimed at 8 year olds), humanoid robots that make weird faces and the professor's pet give the game a very unserious feel. There is not much of a story. The collectibles are nice. You can replay individual levels and try to finish in a given time, without using the checkpoints and within a limited number of dimension shifts. These goals are pretty difficult and require a lot of attempts. 12 levels are sold separarely as two DLCs.Overall, it's an enjoyable game if you like physics/platforming/timing and don't mind the childishness.

												If you liked the Portal games,  definitely check this one out. Since people are bound to compare to the portal games I'll lay some stuff out.1. The main mechanic is shifting between 4 different dimensions to solve puzzles. This was almost as fun as thinking with portals.2. In the game, your uncle talks while you solve puzzles. Big drawback: he's not very entertaining. At all. Seriously, this was just terrible writing. Only slightly better than complete silence.3. You're required to do some platforming at some parts. I've read about some people getting aneurysms over this, and while I never had too much trouble making jumps, I can see why people would gripe. Other things:+ I really did like the cartoony art style.+ The barfing cloning devices and cat that follows you around were always welcome sights.- Level design was just lazy. When going between rooms, you'll pass clones of the same corridors over and over.- In the last third of the game, there were maybe 2 or 3 areas that I'm sure plenty of people will get annoyed over. Not because they're hard to figure out, but tough to execute.This game will exercise your brain with puzzles that are not too challenging but definitely fun. It's not the perfection that Portal 2 is, but it'll help scratch that puzzle itch.8.5/10			"

												An alright puzzle game with a primary focus in first person platforming. If you don't like platforming in a first person perspective id advise not buying this game. There are so many puzzles that involve you jumping on moving platforms all while manipulating other objects around you including the ones you are on. Expect to die a lot.I didn't like the narritive that much. John de Lancie is just a♥♥♥♥♥♥who tells you how much better he is than you in a pompus rich smug ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kind of way, and not the portal kind of way. Ya, it's similar to portal in terms of progression, but it's just not as good.

												Quirky little first-person game where you're trapped in a building, solving puzzles with a unique mechanic, while being harrassed by a seemingly omnipresent but funny narrator. Sound familiar? Well it should if you've played Portal, the heavy inspiration is very clear. But Quantum Conundrum is more lighthearted and has a much larger focus on platforming. The graphics aren't the greatest, but are decent enough. The story is pretty weak to be honest, but the narrator is good for a chuckle here and there. Overall, solid game I can definitely recommend if you're a fan of the Portal series or puzzle/platforming games in general.			"

This game also involves a hell of a lot of first-person platforming, which is pretty much one of the worst things ever. The graphics are okay but not great. I honestly didn't play very far into the game though due to the lack of humorous writing plus the terrible first-person platforming, but what I did play of it didn't have very interesting puzzles either.

The difficulty is comparable to Portal 1/2...you will definitly have to think while playing this game. And besides: the graphics style is also very nice.For fans of games like Portal and Antichamber definitely worth playing!			"

												5/10, wouldn't recommend, but not because it is bad, there are just much better alternatives.I've completed this games story, and I have no desire to go back for challenge modes (all the same maps) or to find the ""collectibles"".  The reasons I bought and finished this game are all repeated ad-infinitum, and never expanded.   the ""lens flare"" effect in some of the dimensions is awful, sometimes leading me to not be able to see a thing, and I have my contrast set pretty low.  The ending is thoroughly disappointing.the biggest complaint though is that this game tries so hard to be Portal, rather than just being itself.  the last 10% of the game especially.  nearly every single moment took me back to ""yea but Portal did this better""  and a game shouldn't be like that, it shouldn't constantly remind me of something else that I played, it just feels like a cheap rip-off, and makes me think the writers/developers lack any creativity, which they clearly didn't for the first 25% of the game!  it felt like ""well that was a fun conclusion to that game, lets do it too!"" rather than ""this is who our villain is, this is who our mentor is, and this is who our player character is, what would they do, and how would they interact in our story""In conclusion; the game had its own [good] things going, but someone decided that Portal was a huge hit, so lets just borrow the end of that game and call it our own, who cares about the awesome characters we developed, who cares if it makes the narorator/mentor sound bi-polar, who cares... they liked portal!

												It took me far too long to play this game through. I pre-ordered it way back when and, like many other games in my Library, inexplicably stopped after playing a good chunk. Only in the last few days of 2014 did I finally get back to it and complete the last 2/3rds, and I'm sad it took me so long to finish this wonderful game.Shortly after your mother drops you off to visit your uncle (Professor Quadrangle, voiced by John de Lancie who narrates the game in a GLaDOS-like manner), you find that an incident has placed him in some sort of strange pocket dimension and cut off power to his mansion. Using one of his latest inventions, the Inter-Dimensional Shift device (IDS), you push through puzzles to power the place back up utilizing four different dimensions in which the properties of time, matter, and gravity are changed. These dimensions are unlocked as you progress, and can only be utilized when the corresponding battery is in the room. The batteries won't always be plugged in either, meaning sometimes you'll have to retrieve them from another part of the room before you can go forward.I'm not a huge puzzle master, and I'm pretty sure more than once I ""solved"" a puzzle in a way that wasn't meant to happen, but I never found myself hopelessly stuck; it was always just a matter of trying a couple different things until something worked, or knowing what I had to do but having to get it right. The puzzle difficulty felt perfect, hard enough that it felt good to solve and wasn't a boring pushover, but not too hard where I could spend half an hour desperately trying to figure things out. Every time a dimension is added to your roster there's a puzzle or two to help you get the hang of what it does and how it works. I suppose if you're a puzzle master, however, it might seem like child's play.Through the narration of John de Lancie and a beautiful soundtrack there's never a dull moment...not that things can get very dull when you're flying through the air on a coffee table. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I had already purchased the soundtrack...and all the DLC! I don't remember doing that, hm.I'm a little upset at how many negative reviews are on the front page, but I suppose you can't please everyone. The ending WAS lackluster, though maybe it's resolved in some way in the DLC. Many people seem to hate the narration and the physics engine too, but I didn't have a problem with either. In fact I very much enjoyed the constant voice acting, and didn't find it annoying in the slightest. I guess I just really like John de Lancie's voice.Overall I must recommend it. It's cute, it's fun, it's silly.			"

												From the original developers of Portal 1, this game is an excellent spiritual successor. It's not got quite the same character as Portal and the engine struggles a bit with some of the simplist of tasks, but the puzzles are entertaining. For those that are looking from some portal-like fun but are tired of waiting for the mythical third in the series (like all other Valve series), then I recommend playing this game (which is usually on sale in all steam sales)			"

												I wish I could give this game a positive review I really do, but I can't. I loved portal and in many ways this game attempts to be similar with physics based puzzles that you are required to solve in order to get to the exit for each room, and with the added twist that you can shift dimentions to either make all the objects fluffy and light so they can be carried or blown by fans, or extra heavy so they're impervious to lasers, or can activate pressure switches, or another dimention where time runs really slowly allowing to you throw objects and catch them further ahead.  But a number of things let these brilliant gameplay idea down.1) Motion sickness. I play FPS games every day and NEVER have a problem with motion sickness except when playing this game. No matter what FOV I set the game to within 15-20 minutes I have to turn the game off as I am feeling sick and dizzy, I have no idea what this game is doing differently from all the rest, but it is truly dreadful.2) Precision platforming in first person. Throughout the game you are required to jump from safe object to safe object in order to solve some problems, the problem is the controls are so impresise, you can't see your feet and you move as if you're on an ice rink. It's enough to drive a sane person crazy trying to judge your jumps, and in quite a few puzzles if you miss your jump you have to start the puzzle again, some of which require quite a bit of setup before hand.3) Despite having John De Lancie as the voice of the narrator the ""witty"" dialogue is just not witty or funny at all, it just falls completely flat and becomes more annoying the further you get into the game.4) There is very little variety in the design of the rooms and objects, after you've got about 30-60 minutes into the game you've pretty much seen everything you're going to see (with a few random room exceptions), and everything starts to look very samey.Well I've just has another fruitless 20 minutes unsuccessfully trying to jump between 5 safes all in a row and falling off one of them each time, or failing at the final jump to the exit, and yet again I feel dizzy and like I am going to throw up. Call me picky but that's not the kind of feeling I want to have after playing a game.			"

												Whether you like this game will be determined almost solely on how much you enjoy finicky platform jumping in a first-person perspective with no ability to see your character's body. For my part, this grew old very quickly about halfway through the game and the frustration level far outweighed my desire to continue. I actually did enjoy the first levels as the puzzles relied more on placement of objects and lateral thinking very similar to Portal (as many have noted) but this did give way to the first-person jumping puzzles and the beginning of a frustrating experience. I did find myself wishing I could see my character's feet or hands or something to orient myself in the 3D space but alas the game doesn't give you this. I can't recommend the game because I did end up abandoning it due to finding it frustrating rather than fun despite the promising beginning.			"

												Be warned that there were a few game breaking glitches associated with the graphics rendering so if your computer can't handle intensive game graphics, you may want to hold off. Even with the gamebreaking glitch keeping me from playing for several months, I still enjoyed the game overall. It is not nearly as good as Portal, but then again what even comes close? The humor is particularly hilarious, but the sillyness is rather welcoming and it never became annoying. The puzzles are well thought out although not as thought provoking as most other puzzle games, still enough fun for a casual play. Also be warned that much of game is even more platforming oriented that puzzle, two particular levels on the side of possibly frustrating. You will want a controller. This game isn't a masterpiece, but definitely worth a buy.			"

												I'm going to copy my opinion from QUBE, but it is essentially Portal 2 with better puzzles, and a weaker storyline.  Is this a bad thing?  Hellz no!  The alternate dimensions and some of the puzzle qualities that you can do with them (IE have all four dimensions available, but can only hold two at a time) make you have to do some serious thinking and planning to work out well.  This is much better than Portal, because your hand isn't held nearly as much through the game - if you are taking too long to complete it though, you will get audio with a subtle hint, which is nice.Much like QUBE though, there are some wonky physics in it.  One puzzles was especially frustrating because of it, but nothing in this game is a dealbreaker.  For a game that's as long as Portal 2 at only $15, it's a fantastic deal for fans of the genre.			"

												Everyone wants to compare this to Portal, but other than the fact that it's a puzzle game with a narrative, I really don't see that.  But then, maybe they just haven't played many of those games?At any rate, you gain power over the different dimensions as you go along, and are forced to use them to navigate a bunch of contrived scenarios.Unlike Portal, the story doesn't do a good job of explaining *why* each room is the way it is.  It explains the damage, but not the rest of the layout.But it doesn't matter.  The narrative is just there to entertain you while you solve puzzles.  Said puzzles start out extremely easy and don't ramp up in difficulty until about halfway through the game, where they suddenly get quite a bit harder...  And they stay that difficulty through the rest of the game.They tried to give it replay value by having collectables and setting time and dimension-shift goals for you to meet, but but they're completely artificial and I never feel like doing those.

												Never feels like it's insulting you with handholding. Puzzles are challenging, but not enough that I was stumped for long. Only needed help for one puzzle and one hidden item. Definitely requires reflexes on number of puzzles, so be sure you're up to quick action.Enjoyable quirky, however the humor tends to fall flat. I can't tell if it's the writing, the performance, or perhaps even the direction of the performance. I never quite buy in to what is being said.			"

												I was looking forward for this game when I knew that Kim Swift, involved in the development of Valve's Portal, worked on this game too. It seemed whimsical and fun.Unfortunately it actually feels empty and flat. It's like a compilation of discarded gameplay ideas for Portal. Fun, sure enough, but detachted from meaning or context. I was expecting greater character interaction than portal had (judging by the cover), but Ike just stands there on some levels and does nothing but look angry from time to time. The end of the game is a complete letdown: the guy on the cover (the player's uncle) isn't ever seen but as a silluette at the very end. Paintings of his ancestors on the walls give more interaction than him. The final ""boss"" fight is too easy too.The humour might be the best part of this game. The way how things, like the paintings change when you use the special powers, the backstory given for all the characters and how they made fun of popular book titles to fit particle physics somehow is all very well thought out.Summing up, It's a fun game but not one you'd like to repeat. DAMN YOU SQUARE ENIX!			"

												I was looking for a Portal-like puzzle fix when a friend recommended QC.Strange Facility: YesOdd narrator/overseer: Yes (John DeLancie!)Odd ""Support"" Character: YesPuzzles: Yes and YesItem Hunt: YesLow Stress: Yes (time trials are an optional pain)Humorous and colorful, QC is a fun puzzle-platformer game. It is more casual in nature than Portal. Things can get quite Heavy (or Fluffy) at times. Keyboard-mouse works fine, though I did resort to a mouse side-button for really quick activation of an ability. There's also two DLC for more fun. Enjoy! Overdue Update: DLC weren't as fun as expected. No plot or narrator, only challenging puzzles. I'll admit that I didn't get very far, but I didn't feel the same atmosphere that I enjoyed in the main game. If you're looking for challenge, the DLC might be worthwhile. Myself, I've found some Portal fan-creations for my time.			"

												This is a tough game to review. I want to like it more than I do, it's full of charm, but the puzzles just aren't that interesting as I'd like. There is less variety than I would like, and as other reviewers have stated, instead of having all the powers at your fingertips all of the time, the game gives you only what you need.While this can be good to make it easier, it also causes it to be a bit of hand holding, not letting people try to solve the puzzles with everything at their disposal. It's also takes more skill than actual puzzle solving ability. Sometimes I'm just freakin' lost because I have to time things just right to work, and it's harder than it looks.The narrator, John de Lancie (Plays Q in Star Trek: The Next Generation) does a great job with a lot of humorous commentary.I do recommend this game. It's a good game. Maybe not Portal quality, but certainly a worthy effort. 7/10			"

												What can I say? It's a fun first person puzzle game, and having John de Lancie (Q from Star Trek: The Next Generation) provide his voice made it so much better. There are a lot of parallels to Portal but that is because this game was made by Kim Swift who made Portal. She even came up with the idea for Quantum Conundrum while she was working on Portal. The puzzles themselves are challenging but not frustratingly so. They are physics based and it can take a few tries to get them to behave the way you want them to. There are also plenty of hidden collectables throughout the game, so you completionists out there can get your fix. One of the downsides is that it was a little short, about six, seven hours to beat (I wasn't doing a collectable run). Overall it was fun, witty, and callenging, everything I look for in a game.9/10 would science again.			"

												I started off really liking this. It woudl rank 4th in terms of puzzlers for me. After the Portal Series and The Talos Principle Series and aso behind Magrunner. The problem is the physics, or rather my frustration at spending way to much time retrying the jumps that lead to death if you mistime them or misjudge the distances etc which is very easy to do. I enjoy working out the solutions  but I don't want to spend my evenings with repeated jump/death/retry. Also the save points aren't very clear and it's frustrating to have to go back and rework a section you have already completed. I got quite a long way through and then just lost enthusiasm. I woudl still recommend people give it a try as long as you're very good at jumping when the physics is uncertain.			"

Thats a good thing. When it makes you enjoy tormenting yourself and getting the timing just so, when usually such games don't interest you? Thats a great thing. When it's done in a colourful, soothing, and slightly dark tounge-in-cheek way? Thats downright delicious.

												Pretty fun game. The dialogue and story were interesting and humorous. There were some cool puzzles, and a few of them were fairly complex to understand or coordinate. This game has heavy platforming and quick-reflex challenges, which make up most of the difficulty in many of the stages (rather than complex puzzle solving). Quick reflexes aren't necessarily required for the platforming, they're mainly needed for switching between dimensions. The majority of the complicated platforming parts actually happen in the slow motion dimension.Unfortunately, as with most other games in the genre, this one is pretty short. I completed it in under 5 hours despite failing repeatedly on a few of the puzzles, in addition to taking my time to absorb the somewhat-skippable story. I would have liked to see another hour or two with some more puzzles that were mentally challenging rather than reflex-based.Recommendation: Buy it if you love the genre or if it's on sale.			"

												Quantum Conundrum, while fun at first, felt like one of the longest games I've ever played. Maybe that was a result of the fun quickly turning to boredom, or the lack of any semblence of a story, or something else I'm not picking up on, the result is the same: Tedium. If you can grab this game for under $5 during a sale, I'd recommend it purely for John De Lancie's (Q from Star Trek TNG) voice acting and some of the cute puzzles, but there's not enough variety here to make you feel like you've accomplished something every time you clear a room. Instead of saying ""Oh THAT was cool!"" you're more likely to say ""Well thank christ that's over"". Some of the later puzzles are also not very well thought out and require bending of the game's rules to complete. Instead of providing a solution within the parameters of the game, I had to avoid those parameters, or bend them, to get through the last leg of the game. And to think, Kim Swift quit her job at Valve to work on THIS. I can't recommend it.			"

												Made by some of the people who did Portal, going into it this game with very little knowledge of it, I could feel the Portal like elements seeping through the screen as I played along. Even the puzzles make you use the same parts of your brain that you do when playing Portal. It also caused me to feel the same type of brain melting numbness I got when I played Portal. But don't let this turn you off it and think it's a Portal clone. Far from it my friend. Sure you have a quirky overlord (in this  case your uncle) giving you helpful, and not so helpful comments along your puzzle building road, along with, as I said before, the puzzles feeling similar, but thats where it ends. My main love for this game goes to the incredible voice actor, John DeLancie, who perfectly portrays your uncle who's not at all keen to have you in the house putting back together the pieces while he's stuck in this empty non-existential dimension that contains blackness (according to him anywway). It may have been because I'm older but I liked the puzzles in this game. It had that good balance of difficulty but not too much that it makes you rage quit (although I did once or twice have to look up on YouTube for a solution - some of the puzzles are hard!) With that said, I do recommend this game. It helps wake up your brain and is a good little brain worker for those than enjoy puzzles (like I do)			"

												I have rage-quit this game twice now.The first time was because the narrator/guide voice is incredibly annoying. The second time was because the controls are so touchy that in an early room where I've solved the puzzle, I still can't manage to jump and land in the right place without falling to my death up to ten times in a row. To be fair, perhaps there are settings I can adjust to fix this but I'm not motivated to try to (yet).The similarities to Portal are pretty obvious, except I think this game was developed for a younger audience who might actually find this narrator funny.

It's a good game, but it has a major problem: John de Lancie (the PC's uncle) NEVER shuts up. He's annoying enough when he's not giving away the key to every puzzle you come across. I really started to loathe the character while playing this game. I guess the devs figured that they'd take as much advantage of the celebrity factor as possible, but the result is a deeply negative impact on what makes this game fun: figuring out the puzzles for yourself.

												Quantum Conundrum gives a Portal vibe in its mechanics, puzzles, use of cubes, and narrator (I'd argue the uncle is on-par or better than GLaDOS)...probably because Kim Swift, the lead designer of Portal, directed it. The game is great with building on previously-learned material, giving you a new power, then repeating. And the new powers are fun to play around with (there were many instances where I probably did something I wasn't supposed to). The uncle's monologues and the death screens provide excellent comedy. Very difficult time attack/least shifts used/no death runs for that added challenge are there when you finish the game. If you liked Portal (or Q.U.B.E.) or just like puzzles and you're looking for something new and zany, this game is definitely for you!			"

												A good bit of fun that I got for 1.50 on a Steam sale. It's quite short and not TOO challenging, but the design is really tight and at that price point one can hardly complain. Some of the sections rely on some pretty deft dimension swaps, which I'm not sure I always cared for, but deaths are minor and don't really upset the game's flow. The game really relies on a few underlying principles and then gradually introduces more complexity. What's nice is it felt like there were multiple solutions to each room, which made it more exciting to experiment. The story is told Portal-style and is mainly just a cute aside to bridge together the puzzles. It's intended to be quite kid-friendly so don't expect much depth in that department. Not everything needs to be a grand epic though and, while it's not going to produce big laughs, the voice of John de Lancie will still put a smile on your face. Good stuff.			"

												A lot of people are going to compare this game to Portal based on the overall design and style of the game. Unfortunately, that is an extremely narrow point of view and completely negates many of the inventive pieces that are brought into a game like Quantum Conundrum. While its fairly obvious that QC is influenced by Portal (should that really be any surprise considering the individuals behind both games), you are forced into solving puzzles and performing FPS platforming in a way that was never introduced into the Portal series. This creates a unique game experience which has you thinking the whole way through. Admittedly, puzzles aren't as challenging as one might expect, but there is enough quality levels in the base game to keep you occupied for several hours. At a budget price, it's a pretty easy sell and with the prospect of new levels and support coming down the pipe, this looks to be a fun series to help support.			"

												If you've ever wanted to pretend that you're trying to escape from being trapped in a twisted children's playground while Q jabbers at you incessantly, this is possibly the game for you. If you haven't - well, it's still pretty fun. A couple of the puzzles require some annoyingly precise timing and the ending is deeply, deeply disappointing compared to some similar games which I won't name ACOUGHCOUGHPORTALCOUGH but all in all it's quite enjoyable.

												Some peoples say: if you like Portal then you like this game. Not really. First and most important - different puzzle ""complete mechanism"". What i mean: in Portal (at least in Portal 2) you need figure, how this puzzle must be solved (main time) and then solve puzzle for a minute; in QC you figure how this puzzle must be solved for a minute and then must do some keyboards ninja tricks (quite frequently difficult and annoying). So, you often facing with a situation, when you straight know how puzzle must be solved, but can't done it, because not so fast and not in the order press keys. And you must repeat, repeat, repeat.Plus poor level environment: just sofas, tables and cabinets with books in ALL levels.If you can deal with above, you can get  fun, because this still decent game and anyway it worth a try.Also recommend ""Flip a Switch"" song from QC Soundtrack.

												Good: Puzzles are fun and rarely frustrating, with more emphasis on platforming skill and timing than the very similar Portal. Voice acting is perfect and writing is often funny. Very pretty with consistently interesting design. Gameplay manages to have a distinctly fresh feel -- switching between dimensions works flawlessly. Bad: Puzzles occasionally require a consistency that the (decently realistic) physics engine cannot support, leading to struggling with mechanics rather than brain-teasers. One or two puzzles require application of techniques that are not well indicated/taught. Entire hallways frequently copy-pasted exactly. Gamepad controls increase difficulty ten-fold (""what do you mean I can't look and activate a button simulatenously""), and menu support is spotty at best.			"

												Then I flip a switch~If Quantum Conumdrum looks a lot like Portal, there's a reason for it. It's got the same guy behind the original Portal behind its reigns. Plus John DeLancie voicing your voice in the sky- err, pocket dimension.The gameplay makes it easy to feel really smart when you solve a puzzle, and even easier to feel stupid when you don't. Flipping between dimensions is quick and easy, but it's simple to press the wrong button and end up dropping out of the air into a bottomless pit.Honestly, the game is fun, even if it is short, and you should pick it up.

												Quantum Conundrum provides a nice first person physics puzzler to interest people. The gameplay consists of picking up and moving or throwing objects along with changing physics through 4 different dimensions. Along the way are various contraptions that are used in combination with each dimension and platforming elements. Most levels have simple puzzles and platforming, but there are some tricky ones to give a challenge now and then. The story is simple, but features Professor Quadwrangle, a strange and funny scientist voiced by John de Lancie, and his nephew. He provides humor and hints in the game along with some ancedotes and storytelling. The game is cartoony, with big open spaces and giant sized objects perfect for platforming. This fits the style of gameplay right and explains the strangeness of some inventions easily. The music compliments the eccentricity of the manor's set of rooms. For its quirkyness and humor, Quantum Conundrum is a fun and funny first person puzzle game.			"

So let's move on to the rest of the game.And for a puzzle-oriented game, I was pretty pleased. The difficulty  was a smooth curve overall, the graphics delightful, and the humour enjoyably tongue-in-cheek.  I'm not going to discount the annoyance of the rail sections, or the bizarre stuttering that happened as it loaded new areas (seriously game, what the heck?), or the artifical difficulty in some of the later puzzles. Overall a fun way to spend a few afternoons, but I don't reccomend playing more than two hours at a time.			"

												As of this writing, I'm only ~25% in, but I honestly feel that's enough to write a recommendation for this.Think Portal, but without Thinking With Portals and instead thinking with Interdimensional Travel. Without a psychopathic AI nagging you, there's a potentially psychopathic family member, voiced by none other than John De Lancie, who provides just as much amusement as GLaDOS does.Drawing comparisons between this and Portal is pretty much the best way to describe it. It's a puzzler with moving things around and physics based puzzles that relate to the current properties of a material. Want something heavy? Lightweight? In slow motion? There's a dimension to solve that puzzle there.I'm playing with slightly bad framerate so the jumps are a little trickier for me, but it's something ignorable to the rest of the gameplay.Brilliant, and I strongly recommend you put down anything nonimportant / nonessential and buy this and play - right now.

												Quantum Conundrum is a game that takes physics to a new level. Whether it simply be picking up a fluffy safe, or surfing a table in slow motion. Quantum Conundrum has the IDE Glove to do it all!I recommend this game to those who played and liked the any of the Portals, as this game has the roughly the same concept about it. Door in, puzzle, door out. Though, this game tends to mix up the environment, so one room might be perfectly tidy, while the next one could be missing the floor.Quantum Conundrum is a game that I enjoyed and I would recommend it to Portal fans, and in general puzzle fans. However, the game is not as easy as the cartoonish look of it gives. The game can be quite stressing, however.. sometimes the simplest solution is the best solution.			"

												Pretty fun game. The dialogue and story were interesting and humorous. There were some cool puzzles, and a few of them were fairly complex to understand or coordinate. This game has heavy platforming and quick-reflex challenges, which make up most of the difficulty in many of the stages (rather than complex puzzle solving). Quick reflexes aren't necessarily required for the platforming, they're mainly needed for switching between dimensions. The majority of the complicated platforming parts actually happen in the slow motion dimension.Unfortunately, as with most other games in the genre, this one is pretty short. I completed it in under 5 hours despite failing repeatedly on a few of the puzzles, in addition to taking my time to absorb the somewhat-skippable story. I would have liked to see another hour or two with some more puzzles that were mentally challenging rather than reflex-based.Recommendation: Buy it if you love the genre or if it's on sale.			"

It just has a feel of tediousness and samey-ness to many parts of it.The voice acting is great, but the writing feels a bit lacking.The puzzles were ok, and I didn't mind most of the platforming. There were plenty of parts though where there was so much retry-after-failure due to precision jumping that it became aggravating.Maybe it was just because I was doing most of the game in one long run, but by the end, the game felt more like a chore than fun.It is a decent portal-like game overall, but take plenty of breaks while playing.

												Quantum Conundrum is a 3D puzzle game which tries to be quirky, but unfortunately isn't quite there. The game was obviously inspired by portal in many ways - while the fundamental gameplay elements are very different from Portal, in the end it is by and large a 3D puzzle/environment navigation game where you have the ability to mess with the environment and thus make your way through it. Your uncle is the faceless voice which guides you through the game, but he is no GLADOS, and the game as a whole just feels like an excuse to solve a bunch of physics puzzles which are okay but ultimately not amazing.It isn't a terrible game, and you could do worse with puzzle games, but it is no Portal, and it definitely was trying to be. While the switching between various environmental effects - reversed gravity, super heavy objects, super light objects, and slow - is interesting at times and allows for some interesting effects, on the whole the game isn't incredible and you aren't made the less by not having experienced it. It isn't a waste of time, but you could spend that time better on things which are more interesting.			"

												Quantum Conundrum, while fun at first, felt like one of the longest games I've ever played. Maybe that was a result of the fun quickly turning to boredom, or the lack of any semblence of a story, or something else I'm not picking up on, the result is the same: Tedium. If you can grab this game for under $5 during a sale, I'd recommend it purely for John De Lancie's (Q from Star Trek TNG) voice acting and some of the cute puzzles, but there's not enough variety here to make you feel like you've accomplished something every time you clear a room. Instead of saying ""Oh THAT was cool!"" you're more likely to say ""Well thank christ that's over"". Some of the later puzzles are also not very well thought out and require bending of the game's rules to complete. Instead of providing a solution within the parameters of the game, I had to avoid those parameters, or bend them, to get through the last leg of the game. And to think, Kim Swift quit her job at Valve to work on THIS. I can't recommend it.			"

												I am inevitably going to draw comparisons to Portal for any first person puzzle game especially one for which cubes play such an integral part. You don't have a portal gun but an IDS device, no that's not an Iain Duncan Smith device that makes your pensions and benefits disappear but an Inter-Dimensional Shift device to flip between dimensions that give items different properties. A great puzzle game, like Portal, makes you feel clever when you solve a problem but a bad one will frustrate you and make you feel like an idiot. This game does a pretty good job, it is not as satisfying as Portal but it is still good fun. Some of the puzzles require precise timing and can take a number of attempts but do not get too frustrating. John de Lancie does a great job voicing the professor that adds an interesting plot to ties the puzzles together. The game is a good length. The locations designs are somewhat repetitive but all in all this is a good game just not as good as Portal.			"

Until 'jump or die' started.I made it up until sequnce of levels: 'Land of misfit DOLLIEs', 'Who belt it, dealth with it' and one or two next.There was literally NO puzzling in these levels. Just pressing buttons at the right time.Trying to get that damn safe up and down in the air above and beyond lasers was incredebly frustrating.Now I'm looking at the level where I have to jump on sofa and fly through moving lasers above deathly Juice below. No fun, no puzzle. Do or die. But I'd better press 'Exit' and 'Uninstall'.Very sad to see such fun game became such unforgivable FPS platformer. Should read reviews before buy this.			"

												I've read through some of the reviews written, and it seems like the main complaint is that this game is too much of a platformer and not the puzzle game some people expected it to be. I however enjoyed the platforming as much as, if not more than the puzzling. In the beginning, the game does come out as more of a puzzle game, but that changes as you progress further into the game. The difficulty of the game wasn't too hard for me, so I never really experienced that feeling of ragequitting which some people explained in their reviews that they felt, but later on in the game and especially during the DLCs the game requires a bit of thinking and some exploring aswell to help you figure out what to do to advance. The story was alright although it didn't wow me. Also it felt a bit like it was an afterthought rather than being thought through. It felt like the game's ending left an opening for a sequel, which would be interesting to see, and which I personally would probably purchase.I really liked the characters and the fact that the uncle interacts a lot during levels, but also between and tells stories about the different paintings in the manor. Although I did not feel like Ike contributed to the game as much as I'd hope he would. If a sequel does come out, I hope that Ike interacts and maybe even helps a lot more than he did in this game.I bought the game and the DLCs during sales, but I feel that the original price of the game is pretty fair and worth it. I do not feel like the DLCs are worth the original price, since I kind of forced myself through them more than wanting to finish them. There is no interaction with any other character at all during the DLCs so you're all alone during all the 5 or 6 stages of each DLC. All-in-all I do recommend the game, even more when it's on sale.			"

												Decent puzzle game. Puzzle itself its not so hard, but if you want to beat all achievements, it gives sometimes trouble. Similar feeling as Portal with some character voice commenting through the progress, but the story and setting is not so exciting. If you like the puzzle games I recommend this one as price is pretty low now.			"

												John DeLancie is an amazingly snarky semi-narrator. I hear the messages you recieve upon dying in his voice. But, as far as the game goes...it's kinda rough, especially on older machines. I have some serious lag issues, but I expect it with my bare bones laptop from 2012. There are collectables, as well...good luck hunting them down, though. Another fun side in the game is to try and view the paintings around the mansion in as many dimensions as possible, as the results are incredible. And, of course, there is a twist in the end of the game. You might not expect it at all, if you haven't payed enough attention to the game. All in all, this is a solid, challenging, and very funny game.			"

												Quantum Conundrum tries a little too hard to live up to Portal, and falls just a little too short. The mechanics are fun, but they're rarely used in interesting ways. Where portal feels like a maze, Conundrum feels like an obstacle course. Puzzles are often less about finding a solution, and more about excecuting it.It's only got about 6 hours in it, but for $15 you can do worse. The game is obviously a straight console-port however. There are no graphical options outside of resolution available, making it difficult to run without a powerful system.			"

												pros: innovative puzzle mechanics (consisting of fluffy, heavy, slow, and reverse dimensions that can alter physics and objects in the level), stats and collectibles are available for completionists, enjoyable soundtrack, and an art style that gives this game a unique aesthetic.cons: platforming can be tedious, some lag spike issues, better dialogue is desired - because the main voice tells dry jokes constantly and gives hints to a puzzle when you don't want hints. And there is a level near the end where you have to stack 15 boxes to get to a higher ledge... some level designs are definitely questionable. You also can't quick save/save slot, there is an automatic checkpoint save but you can't even load that file, so when you leave the game you have to start from the very beginning of the chapter.Overall, most of the early puzzles are easy and I did find a few that were challenging, some level designs could of been improved, and the single player campaign takes around 5-6 hours. Quantum Conundrum season pass comes with additional DLC missions (reviews on the comments) and a soundtrack folder.  And for those who didn't know, this game was directed by Kim Swift (ex-Valve employee,  designer of Portal).The base game has my recommendation.			"

												This game is a barrel of fun. It really just hits on a whole lot of platforming challenges with inventive ideas. Completely awesome to play. The only real issue I had with the game was the wonky physics engine. There would be moments where your jumps would cause you to skate off a ledge you had just been on. It didn't make a lot of sense to have the gravity arcs of your character be so... off?			"

												(I had a previous review but i don't think it posted so i'll try again)Well, I finished the game. I have to say, it was very interesting to go through. I enjoyed it for many reasons, but many others don't for the same reasons. Some people complained that it was a very slow and tedious to progress, but I thought it was very fun to have to figure out what you needed to do in order to finish the level. Many complained that getting all the new dimensions took to long, but i thought it was smart of them to add in the dimensions one at a time, making it so you understand the best way to use this dimension, instead of rushing through and never really learning the proper/best way. I agree that the puzzles weren't hard, but this game is pretty old. (Yes, 2012 is old for a game.) The puzzle industry around that time was growing, and this was a great game for it's time. The graphics were also really great, again considering that it was released 2012, and was up in the higher game quality. (Some games released at that year were Borderlands 2, Hotline Miami, Halo 4, Assassin's Creed 3, Mass Effect 3, Far Cry 3, MAX PAYNE 3, DIABLO 3, SOMETHING 3 JEEZ LOUIS COME UP WITH A DIFFRENT GAME ALREADY WE DON'T NEED 3 F*****G GAMES... Sorry lost my cool. :) I also agree that the ending was a little anti-climtic, making it kind of a bit hard to want to go back and get all the achivements, but none the less it was an ending that wrapped things up. Another thing would be that we never actually saw our uncle in real life, so that kind of ruined it for me too. Many people said the uncles jokes weren't really funny, but honestly, if you have a real uncle you know that all of their jokes are about as funny as your dad's. (WOOT WOOT just offended a couple orphans here! I am on FIRE!) However even though others complained that the jokes weren't good, i thought they were hilarious, maybe just my sense of humour. Another thing to was that he didn't pretend that you were dumb. He didn't go, ""The quaddrople x Semi- automatic fumpwraplle 3000 acts as a negative contrary triplled definied adhesive towarsd any anti-active semi-metals. Oh, that means it makes two metal thingys stick together reall well."" He would go ""The quaddrople x Semi- automatic fumpwraplle 3000 acts as a negative contrary triplled definied adhesive towarsd any anti-active semi-metals. I remeber the one time my friend made it, but spilled some on workshope table and a piece of metal he was working on, with his hand stuck in between! Oh my, he had a fun time explaining that to the paramedics!"" Instead of dumbing it down for you, he simply made it easier for you to understand what happened or what it does.I think i'm nearing the end of my review now. I'm pretty sure I covered the bigger parts. I think this game would have been amazing if they had added in a world editor so you could build your own little puzzles, and steam workshop support. All in all I rate this game a good 9/10. not perfect but definitely something i would buy again if given the choice. When i read comments that normally sways my verdict if i should get this game or not. I don't want someone missing out on a game or getting a game and not liking it because of my rating. Decide for yourself if you want to get it or not, my rating should just be something that you read and go ""Oh, He liked it. That's good for him."" That's all!Edit: This isn't going to be short. I missed a couple things. I'll try to keep it shorter but i suck at that so... Anyways, people complained about the Physics engine not being very good. I actually had no problem with the controls and thought they were decent enough to use and not be frustrated. It may just be me being used to crudy quality engines, spending my time playing games like- actually maybe i shouldn't mention but you get the point. Another thing people complained about was amount of time it took. I got this on sale for like 2 bucks so i wasn't going to be overly ""Wow, I spent 199.99 bucks on this, it better be an amazing game or else i'll be really mad!"" I thought the play time was great, and yes i know i spent 11 hours on it, but that was because i left it open for an hour or two, and i accidentaly had to re-play 2 hours worth because of steam save file crap that screwed me over. I thought that it was a great amounnt of time on a game i really enjoyed. I also probably missed something else so there may be another edit.			"

												In a similar vein to Portal, this game challenges its players to come up with solutions to puzzles using physics, logic and a little bit of luck.You play as the nephew of an eccentric uncle, living in a remote mansion, who is known for inventing interesting and comical contraptions.I stumbled across this game in one of the multitude of queues I've looked through, grabbed it on a whim, and couldn't put it down for a  good few hours. The learning curve isn't too steep, the voice acting is brilliant, and it really bends your brain to come up with the solutions.Well worth a play.			"

												Sadly has to sit in the shadow of Portal, which does not mean it is bad. It just lacks that Valve polish and trips over some voice acting that is just trying to hard at some puns. You get the same ""WUUT I KNOW TO SOLVE IT!""-feeling, but not in the same pace as Portal. Most of the puzzled are figured out in seconds and then you spend 10+ minutes to fiddle around with the platforming just to execute your solution. Artstyle is pretty awesome, settings are rather poor, all you get is an option to change resolution. However, the UnrealEngine lets you set things via .ini editing. The game itself is around 5 hours the first way through and then provides speedrun/shiftgoals for every level in the game for the achievement♥♥♥♥♥s. Those are really damn hard and provide alot of extra playtime if you like speedruns.			"

												I went into QC with 2 perspectives in mind: Tycho from PA's and Yahtzee's. 2 very contrasting opinions, and I had no idea which I'd side w/, b/c Yahtzee's complaints were very concerning: That I'd be able to break 2/3rds of the puzzles by simply stacking boxes, or the platforming would be a mess.Yahtzee's complaints were puzzling. I'm srsly & obnoxiously left wondering if he just isn't any good at this type of game, or, more likely, exaggerated to an extreme. I don't think I found a single puzzle where stacking boxes & breaking the system was my 1st guess, or where it was even possible. Then again, I didn't find the game partic. mind-bending as Tycho suggested, either; but it was totally satisfying.I'm mixed on de Lancie's VA work. I love Q, & I love de Lancie as Q, but when he speaks in this game I'm picturing Q when I want to picture the mustachio'd madman of SCIENCE! It's...distracting.Level design is p. exquisite.

												From the brains behind the original Portal comes Quantum Conundrum. I am recommending the game for that fact alone. For those of you who have played Portal, this game roughly features the same premise. You play as a boy who wanders into his Uncle's ""lab,"" gets a ""gadget,"" and then you have to get from point A, to point B in order to ""leave.""For Portal lovers, there are little bits of of Portal-y goodness that shine through at times, but trust me, this is NOT Portal... and I mean that necessarily isn't a bad thing. The fact is, these characters (especially Ike) grow on you; and while they may not be GladOS level quality, there are some great script moments in the game. All in all, I guess what I'm trying to say is that, if you liked Portal at all, give this game a shot. Portal, it is NOT, but it's got a flavor all its own, and still gets a recommendation from me.

												The design for everything is like a Pixar film: bright, colourful and charming. The gameplay is a lot like Portal: easy to come to terms with but requiring out-of-box thinking at times.The plot -- or rather, speech -- you're constantly berated with is like a bad culmination of both: unending one-liners, bad puns, non-sequiters and dissenting jabs at your ability(s).You're treated to four different filters, or dimensions as they call it, that impact on the world around you: fluffy, heavy, slow and reverse. Naturally you can only use one at a time but require multiple in order to solve the puzzles before you. Transporting large objects, for example, requires that you make it light (fluffy), throw it, slow down time, run round obstacles, switch back to fluffy and catch it again. The ways the game has you using these different dimensions in unison may not be initially intuitive, but they certainly arent illogical.Its got that same wonder and feel to it that the original Portal did. I dont think the gameplay elements are strictly original, but the way it handles and presents them (much like its pseudo-ancestor) provides much satisfaction that it makes a rather hard thing to dislike. It perhaps skirts a little heavy on Portals tailcoat, but it'd be a wholly different thing if it didnt.You won't feel bad for playing it, but you may feel a little guilty for giggling at the portraits in the games when viewed from different dimensions.

												Quantum Conundrum gives a Portal vibe in its mechanics, puzzles, use of cubes, and narrator (I'd argue the uncle is on-par or better than GLaDOS)...probably because Kim Swift, the lead designer of Portal, directed it. The game is great with building on previously-learned material, giving you a new power, then repeating. And the new powers are fun to play around with (there were many instances where I probably did something I wasn't supposed to). The uncle's monologues and the death screens provide excellent comedy. Very difficult time attack/least shifts used/no death runs for that added challenge are there when you finish the game. If you liked Portal (or Q.U.B.E.) or just like puzzles and you're looking for something new and zany, this game is definitely for you!			"

												Where do I start? This is a fun puzzle game,  with puzzles being as hard as Portal 2's PeTI levels, although some of them are pretty easy to figure out once you get a hold of the game mechanics.Speaking of which, the ways that you use the five (yes, five, normal's a dimension if you hadn't noticed) dimensions are neat. Wanna lift a crate? Fluffy dimension. Need to weigh down something with a cardboard box? Heavy dimension. Do you want to fly across the room on a piece of furniture? A mixture of slow motion and reverse gravity oughta do the trick.There are some similarities between this game and Portal, some of which are obvious such as rooms of the mansion being like test chambers, the areas between said rooms involving chit-chat with someone speaking to you over the intercom and so on and so forth. The only thing that really separates this game from Portal is the difficulty curve, which spikes too high at times.TL;DR - Nice game. Some frustrating moments, but overall it's fine.			"

												A good bit of fun that I got for 1.50 on a Steam sale. It's quite short and not TOO challenging, but the design is really tight and at that price point one can hardly complain. Some of the sections rely on some pretty deft dimension swaps, which I'm not sure I always cared for, but deaths are minor and don't really upset the game's flow. The game really relies on a few underlying principles and then gradually introduces more complexity. What's nice is it felt like there were multiple solutions to each room, which made it more exciting to experiment. The story is told Portal-style and is mainly just a cute aside to bridge together the puzzles. It's intended to be quite kid-friendly so don't expect much depth in that department. Not everything needs to be a grand epic though and, while it's not going to produce big laughs, the voice of John de Lancie will still put a smile on your face. Good stuff.			"

It has quirky humor, the level designs get increasingly more mind boggling as you progress. The story is very simple, yet still great fun.The constant commentary of your eccentric Uncle is amusing.Ike is cute as a button, 'Buuup!'All in all, a really well made game and experience.Its not expensive at all, so buy it!

												Quantum Conundrum - a game that sit somewhere in shadows of its more popular puzzle game brother - Portal. And while both of those video games are 3D puzzle games with platforming elements, the similarity really ends here. The concepts of the two franchises are different and I wish people would stop comparing them or claming that Portal will always be a better game without even playing Quantum Conundrum. If you're a fan of the genre, you will enjoy Quantum Conundrum even though it might be a bit too easy after playing other, similar titles. But, enough of that. It might be already clear, but I did enjoy Quantum Conundrum A LOT. And I probably enjoyed it a lot more than Portal 2. Yes, the story is pretty much a filler, it doesn't go anywhere and the ending is a set up for the sequel (which hopefully will happen although I doubt it...). Yes, the puzzles are mostly pretty easy and after getting tricky they still can be solved in under 30 minutes, But I still enjoyed my time with Quantum Conundrum...Its concept is interesting. The game gives the player the control over the enviroment instead of one particular thing (as with Portal and QUBE). It plays with physics letting you make elements weight more or less, slow the flow of time or even the entire gravity of the room. And it does so in unexpected ways such as makes you throw boxes so you can basically fly through the level using the gravity or lets you bounce on the platforms using a couch that you can make heavier and then lighter to fling yourself upwards. Those little mechanics that make the player say 'yeah, that clever' and then use those mechanics and mix them up in another level of the game. A concept of dimensions gives a bunch of possibilities for those mechanics and (again, hoping for it) there are a lot of paths that a sequel might take. The puzzles are never too hard. Something I dislike about puzzle games is the difficulty curve that gets really high after a while without letting the player understand what he should be doing. Quantum Conundrum teaches the player its mechanics and does a good job at it also bringing back things introduced in previous chapters in the later ones. The player never gets stuck for good or frustrated that he can't figure out a solution. The levels go by pretty fast and it gives the player the feeling of progress which, of course, pushes him forward through the game. I never felt like the game is too easy. It gave me a good challenge showing me what I can do and then mixing it up and making me do it. I never felt mad at the game for having some riddiculus solution for a puzzle. It wasn't complicated. It was always a simple concept. As for the story, well... I didn't really care too much for it and I don't think it is a bad thing either. The story was just there as a filler, the narration was okay and I see people really liking the professor. It just wasn't my thing, but it also didn't overshadow the gameplay. Everything is presented in a really lighthearted way, the graphics are bright and colorful and the overall game has a lot of character. So what about the negatives? There are negatives. As I've mentioned previously - the story is just a filler, it doesn't go anywhere and since the checkpoints bring you back to a set spot, you often have to listen to the same voice clip over and over again. The puzzles are simple, but not too simple and Portal veterans might breeze through the game. There are also corridors between levels that act as hidden loading screens and a ""story time"" kind of deal. Those get repeated pretty fast and they're mildly annoying. The fact that they are in fact just a window of time for the game to load the next map, also might result in a bit of a frame drop from time to time. Also, I should probably mention that Quantum Conundrum loves platforming a lot more than other 3D puzzle games. Something you should probably have in mind. Overall, I had a fantastic time with the game. It wasn't anything amazing, but it has a lot of potential and character to it and I wish we see a sequel one of these days.			"

												It's like Portal, only instead of creating portals, you literally change the universe around you to get where you need to go in 4 ways, by making everything light, by making everything heavy, by making everything slow and by making everything give the finger to the laws of gravity.There certainly are a lot of headscratchers with this one and I love how they went with the premise of being trapped in a wacky mansion rather than making you a test subject. As an extra bonus, you get the voice of Robert De Lancie encouraging you to keep going!If you liked Portal, you'll like Quantum Conundrum.			"

												A lot of people are going to compare this game to Portal based on the overall design and style of the game. Unfortunately, that is an extremely narrow point of view and completely negates many of the inventive pieces that are brought into a game like Quantum Conundrum. While its fairly obvious that QC is influenced by Portal (should that really be any surprise considering the individuals behind both games), you are forced into solving puzzles and performing FPS platforming in a way that was never introduced into the Portal series. This creates a unique game experience which has you thinking the whole way through. Admittedly, puzzles aren't as challenging as one might expect, but there is enough quality levels in the base game to keep you occupied for several hours. At a budget price, it's a pretty easy sell and with the prospect of new levels and support coming down the pipe, this looks to be a fun series to help support.			"

												Sadly has to sit in the shadow of Portal, which does not mean it is bad. It just lacks that Valve polish and trips over some voice acting that is just trying to hard at some puns. You get the same ""WUUT I KNOW TO SOLVE IT!""-feeling, but not in the same pace as Portal. Most of the puzzled are figured out in seconds and then you spend 10+ minutes to fiddle around with the platforming just to execute your solution. Artstyle is pretty awesome, settings are rather poor, all you get is an option to change resolution. However, the UnrealEngine lets you set things via .ini editing. The game itself is around 5 hours the first way through and then provides speedrun/shiftgoals for every level in the game for the achievement♥♥♥♥♥s. Those are really damn hard and provide alot of extra playtime if you like speedruns.			"

												A one-of-a-kind, challenging and truly refreshing first person puzzle game.As you progress through the levels, you gain control over four different dimensions in addition to the normal one (fluffy, heavy, slow and reverse gravity), which you need to take advantage of in order to complete the sometimes very tightly timed puzzles.First person puzzling and precision jumping on the Unreal engine felt a little awkward to me at first, but once mastered, this is a really enjoyable game from beginning to end.Would recommend to anyone, especially fans of the Portal franchise.

												Eh. It was a good game. But honestly, I don't know how good. Worth the 5$ I spent? Absolutely. Worth more? Maybe. You decide.The one issue it really faced was the lack of puzzle variety. Launch this here. Jump there. But now do it with lighter objects! And then with objects that fall up! If there were more dimensions that really felt different, interacted more often, and allowed more freedom of puzzling, the game would have hit me much harder.Other issues being that there's little room to just futz with the dimensions, and that there aren't really enough of them. Sure they could've limited you to 4 at a time still, but they could've put in more than 4. As is, heavy and light honestly felt like two sides to the same coin, so it was really just 3 dimensions.On top of that, if the dimensions weren't prescribed to levels, or if the developers didn't try to shoot down any varying solutions to the problems (either by making dimensions unavailable or by silly placements of walls) then the game would have felt more like a puzzle game instead of an execution game. I don't mean a game kills you, but you usually instantly know what you need to do with what you have, and you just have to do it to beat the level. It was like how Portal 2 felt after playing Portal 1. The game was enjoyable, but the exploration was gone. All the white walls were replaced by shiny paneled walls with a white panels obviously sticking out in one area.And to add to the Portal analogy, the story didn't carry me through as strongly as the Portal 2 story did. And the game's aesthetic wasn't as pretty either. Not to bash on a small company, but the same idea has been done better by other people for cheaper cost to the consumer.The Uncle was a fun character, but the puns can get sigh worthy, the ""surprise"" in the story is foreseen by the end of the first chapter, and basically the game's feel relied more on quick chuckles than anything else.I think to sum it up, this game felt like it was made for 8 year olds. Fantastic for them, but sadly not advertised to them. Worth a look if you want a casual puzzle experience and find it on sale, but don't expect too much out of it.			"

												Quantum Conundrum is a 3D puzzle game which tries to be quirky, but unfortunately isn't quite there. The game was obviously inspired by portal in many ways - while the fundamental gameplay elements are very different from Portal, in the end it is by and large a 3D puzzle/environment navigation game where you have the ability to mess with the environment and thus make your way through it. Your uncle is the faceless voice which guides you through the game, but he is no GLADOS, and the game as a whole just feels like an excuse to solve a bunch of physics puzzles which are okay but ultimately not amazing.It isn't a terrible game, and you could do worse with puzzle games, but it is no Portal, and it definitely was trying to be. While the switching between various environmental effects - reversed gravity, super heavy objects, super light objects, and slow - is interesting at times and allows for some interesting effects, on the whole the game isn't incredible and you aren't made the less by not having experienced it. It isn't a waste of time, but you could spend that time better on things which are more interesting.			"

												I'm going to copy my opinion from QUBE, but it is essentially Portal 2 with better puzzles, and a weaker storyline.  Is this a bad thing?  Hellz no!  The alternate dimensions and some of the puzzle qualities that you can do with them (IE have all four dimensions available, but can only hold two at a time) make you have to do some serious thinking and planning to work out well.  This is much better than Portal, because your hand isn't held nearly as much through the game - if you are taking too long to complete it though, you will get audio with a subtle hint, which is nice.Much like QUBE though, there are some wonky physics in it.  One puzzles was especially frustrating because of it, but nothing in this game is a dealbreaker.  For a game that's as long as Portal 2 at only $15, it's a fantastic deal for fans of the genre.			"

												Everyone wants to compare this to Portal, but other than the fact that it's a puzzle game with a narrative, I really don't see that.  But then, maybe they just haven't played many of those games?At any rate, you gain power over the different dimensions as you go along, and are forced to use them to navigate a bunch of contrived scenarios.Unlike Portal, the story doesn't do a good job of explaining *why* each room is the way it is.  It explains the damage, but not the rest of the layout.But it doesn't matter.  The narrative is just there to entertain you while you solve puzzles.  Said puzzles start out extremely easy and don't ramp up in difficulty until about halfway through the game, where they suddenly get quite a bit harder...  And they stay that difficulty through the rest of the game.They tried to give it replay value by having collectables and setting time and dimension-shift goals for you to meet, but but they're completely artificial and I never feel like doing those.

												I picked this up the day after playing the demo, and after reading a lot of reviews that make complaints about different parts of it. The demo is a good representation of the final product, with there being mostly just more of everything in it in the full game, including anything that annoys you.Worst part: Whenever you are required to make very precise jumps, mostly because a lot of the objects you jump on are not simple shapes and can get in the way. Getting stuck on a sofa at a key moment and plummeting to your death is not fun.Best part: Dimension shifting is awesome and unlike anything I've seen before and the way it alters the appearance of the entire environment adds to this. You owe it to yourself to at least try the demo.Bonus: Take one of the batteries from Ike when in the slow motion dimension to hear him make a sound worthy of a true interdimensional beast.			"

												This is a tough game to review. I want to like it more than I do, it's full of charm, but the puzzles just aren't that interesting as I'd like. There is less variety than I would like, and as other reviewers have stated, instead of having all the powers at your fingertips all of the time, the game gives you only what you need.While this can be good to make it easier, it also causes it to be a bit of hand holding, not letting people try to solve the puzzles with everything at their disposal. It's also takes more skill than actual puzzle solving ability. Sometimes I'm just freakin' lost because I have to time things just right to work, and it's harder than it looks.The narrator, John de Lancie (Plays Q in Star Trek: The Next Generation) does a great job with a lot of humorous commentary.I do recommend this game.

												Probably Portal's only competition. It's very much so the same game, but instead of portals, you get to mess with different dimensions. Each dimension changes the characteristic of objects in the puzzle. For example, if you can't pick up a metal safe, switch to the Fluffy dimension and it weights enough to be picked up.

												NOTE: For review with screenshots, please visit http://microfloppy.net/2014/12/30/quantum-conundrum/You are a young boy who are sent to visit his crazy scientist uncle. Some experiment has of course gone wrong, and with help from your uncle you run around the house trying to set things right.Each new set of rooms is a puzzle that you need to go through. To help you solve the puzzle you have an “IDS-device”, a glove that you can use to shift dimensions. For example, the first dimension you will be able to shift to is the fluffy dimension, where everything becomes super-light. Safes becomes nothing more than big pillows that you can juggle with ease.With time you get more dimensions to switch between and the puzzles becomes more difficult. It’s childishly fun to play around with the different dimensions and the game is filled with jokes and funhouse esthetics.If you have played Portal you will feel at home in Quantum Conundrum. You go through a room, you have a number of obstacles, you carry a device that will help you. However, I find that Portal is more about figuring out the solution while QC is more of getting the timing and jumps just right. The puzzles are less complex and the solutions are not as clean as in Portal.Without comparing it to Portal however, QC is a good puzzle game. It’s simple and fun entertainment for basically all ages. The dialogue makes you smile and the rooms look cool. Changing dimensions makes the room change appereance as well, and sometimes I find myself just looking at paintings while changing dimensions to giggle at the differences it does.There are some downsides to QC. One thing that keeps irritating me is the physics engine. Many of the puzzles depend on you jumping or throwing objects. This can quickly become frustrating as objects don’t always fall in the same way. For example; in one of the puzzles you let three safes fall in order to jump on to them later. The safes fall and tumble differently each time which meant I had to redo the same procedure several times until I the safes fell as I expected them to.I can also imagine that some of the jumping/timing sequences can be quite difficult for gamers that are young or not that experienced.Another downside is that Quantum Conundrum has a tendency to hold your hand a bit too much. In more than one level I hadn’t more than stepped into the room before my uncle started pointing me in the right direction, saying what I should do. I like to puzzle out my own solutions and having someone just giving me the answer takes away from the fun.Still, if you haven’t tried Quantum Conundrum it’s really worth a playthrough!8/10 awkward noise generators "

												The comparisons with Portal are perhaps too easy to point to. This too is a first-person puzzle game with a touch of humor and the use of crazy and original mechanics to move around and solve each ""room"". It too has an eloquent and at times hilarious narrator following your actions and guiding you. It too has tons of little humoristic details spread throughout the environment that you can choose to ignore or you can choose to tirelessly search for and explore.You may say that's a bad thing, for a game to piggy ride on the very effective premise that Portal pioneered. But I also think that if you're like me and after replaying Portal for the 20th time you suddenly wish that only there were more games ""like"" it, then this game is definitely for you.			"

												So, this game's good. Great, even. There is, however, a major flaw. The game is horrendously laggy on even mid-level systems. It's fixable with a tiny bit of googling though, and the game is worth the effort. I'm now running the game at a comfortable 40-50 fps, so don't worry about it too much.

Definitely requires reflexes on number of puzzles, so be sure you're up to quick action.Enjoyable quirky, however the humor tends to fall flat.

												I picked this up the day after playing the demo, and after reading a lot of reviews that make complaints about different parts of it. The demo is a good representation of the final product, with there being mostly just more of everything in it in the full game, including anything that annoys you.Worst part: Whenever you are required to make very precise jumps, mostly because a lot of the objects you jump on are not simple shapes and can get in the way. Getting stuck on a sofa at a key moment and plummeting to your death is not fun.Best part: Dimension shifting is awesome and unlike anything I've seen before and the way it alters the appearance of the entire environment adds to this. You owe it to yourself to at least try the demo.Bonus: Take one of the batteries from Ike when in the slow motion dimension to hear him make a sound worthy of a true interdimensional beast.			"

												When a game forces you to realize that you have to time jumps in adherence to the different temporal states and velocities without making you realize its making you think that? Thats a good thing. When it makes you enjoy tormenting yourself and getting the timing just so, when usually such games don't interest you? Thats a great thing. When it's done in a colourful, soothing, and slightly dark tounge-in-cheek way? Thats downright delicious. My surprise at who the companion voice actor to this game turned out being was the wry-voiced cherry on top. If you haven't grabbed this by now, add it to the top of the list of treats to get in a future Steam sale!			"

												It's a first-person puzzler that has some fun gameplay elements and neat puzzles. The story is nothing to write home about, and the ending is a bit disappointing. I disliked the professor character, who seemed to be their answer to Portal's Glados, but just came off as annoying and unlikeable. Unlike Portal, this game didn't have a mystery to drive you through the game. Despite it, I did enjoy the art style. All in all, play this if you really just want a pile of clever first-person puzzles to play and don't care too much about the presentation.			"

												If you've played portal and loved it, you are gonna like this too. It's a puzzle game, yet the puzzles were quite easy to solve. Don't get me wrong, some of the puzzles took me a little longer than others, and they do get gradually harder the longer you get. Although it's rather short, the story is okay, nothing too special.I completed the main story in less than 5 hours, wich is alright considering it cost me less than 3 eur on sale. I believe there is some extra levels, you can unlock by finding blueprints scattered, around the different story levels. Didn't look into those though, so can't really talk about them.Did I have fun? Yes indeed.Buy at full price?If you like puzzle games, sure. I like puzzle games and I waited for it to fall in price. But it's still worth full price in my opinion. "

												(I had a previous review but i don't think it posted so i'll try again)Well, I finished the game. I have to say, it was very interesting to go through. I enjoyed it for many reasons, but many others don't for the same reasons. Some people complained that it was a very slow and tedious to progress, but I thought it was very fun to have to figure out what you needed to do in order to finish the level. Many complained that getting all the new dimensions took to long, but i thought it was smart of them to add in the dimensions one at a time, making it so you understand the best way to use this dimension, instead of rushing through and never really learning the proper/best way. I agree that the puzzles weren't hard, but this game is pretty old. (Yes, 2012 is old for a game.) The puzzle industry around that time was growing, and this was a great game for it's time. The graphics were also really great, again considering that it was released 2012, and was up in the higher game quality. (Some games released at that year were Borderlands 2, Hotline Miami, Halo 4, Assassin's Creed 3, Mass Effect 3, Far Cry 3, MAX PAYNE 3, DIABLO 3, SOMETHING 3 JEEZ LOUIS COME UP WITH A DIFFRENT GAME ALREADY WE DON'T NEED 3 F*****G GAMES... Sorry lost my cool. :) I also agree that the ending was a little anti-climtic, making it kind of a bit hard to want to go back and get all the achivements, but none the less it was an ending that wrapped things up. Another thing would be that we never actually saw our uncle in real life, so that kind of ruined it for me too. Many people said the uncles jokes weren't really funny, but honestly, if you have a real uncle you know that all of their jokes are about as funny as your dad's. (WOOT WOOT just offended a couple orphans here! I am on FIRE!) However even though others complained that the jokes weren't good, i thought they were hilarious, maybe just my sense of humour. Another thing to was that he didn't pretend that you were dumb. He didn't go, ""The quaddrople x Semi- automatic fumpwraplle 3000 acts as a negative contrary triplled definied adhesive towarsd any anti-active semi-metals. Oh, that means it makes two metal thingys stick together reall well."" He would go ""The quaddrople x Semi- automatic fumpwraplle 3000 acts as a negative contrary triplled definied adhesive towarsd any anti-active semi-metals. I remeber the one time my friend made it, but spilled some on workshope table and a piece of metal he was working on, with his hand stuck in between! Oh my, he had a fun time explaining that to the paramedics!"" Instead of dumbing it down for you, he simply made it easier for you to understand what happened or what it does.I think i'm nearing the end of my review now. I'm pretty sure I covered the bigger parts. I think this game would have been amazing if they had added in a world editor so you could build your own little puzzles, and steam workshop support. All in all I rate this game a good 9/10. not perfect but definitely something i would buy again if given the choice. When i read comments that normally sways my verdict if i should get this game or not. I don't want someone missing out on a game or getting a game and not liking it because of my rating. Decide for yourself if you want to get it or not, my rating should just be something that you read and go ""Oh, He liked it. That's good for him."" That's all!Edit: This isn't going to be short. I missed a couple things. I'll try to keep it shorter but i suck at that so... Anyways, people complained about the Physics engine not being very good. I actually had no problem with the controls and thought they were decent enough to use and not be frustrated. It may just be me being used to crudy quality engines, spending my time playing games like- actually maybe i shouldn't mention but you get the point. Another thing people complained about was amount of time it took. I got this on sale for like 2 bucks so i wasn't going to be overly ""Wow, I spent 199.99 bucks on this, it better be an amazing game or else i'll be really mad!"" I thought the play time was great, and yes i know i spent 11 hours on it, but that was because i left it open for an hour or two, and i accidentaly had to re-play 2 hours worth because of steam save file crap that screwed me over. I thought that it was a great amounnt of time on a game i really enjoyed. I also probably missed something else so there may be another edit.			"

												Good game. Funny as well. On the other hand, don't be fooled, this ain't a puzzle game. Only the minority of the situations requires you to stop and think about what to do. You'll probably quickly figure out what to do and spend more time actually trying to do it. The dimensions, while employed in interesting ways, could be more varied than ""Allow you to pick this object"" or ""Triggers that pressure plate"". The Slow-Motion dimension, though, has some very peculiar uses. It's a game that will test your timing and your plataforming more than it will test your wits. Plus, while the characters(or character, seeing as the Professor is the only character who expresses himself in any significant way) are fun, the ending left a bitter taste on my mouth. Kinda like ""Why the hell did I go through all that?"". It's a shameless sequel hook without providing any conclusion.			"

The puzzles are good, not too hard, but not so easy that I could fly right through them. I see a lot of potential here, if they are planning a sequel, they should try to do the same thing Valve did for Portal 2.

												After playing about an hour of this game, my brain was completely fried. I bought Quantum Conundrum after suffering from Portal withdrawal, and I was so happy when I found it! I am a lover of puzzle games with great stories and characters, and Q.C. excels in all those things! In Q.C. you play as the grandson of an inventor who has been working on a secret project that no one knows about. One day when you go to visit him, you notice he is missing and being the annoying nosy kid you are, you go searching for him through his gigantic mansion. Eventually he contacts you from another dimension in the same house. He informs you of his secret invention seeing as that its the only way for you to save him. A glove that can allow you to switch between dimensions in order to save him. This game is fun and quirky, with cute characters and a fun simple story line. Its really hard though! I got stuck on levels for weeks trying different ways to complete them, but the game does a great job of motivating you to proceed forward. You will be frustrated, you will want to break a whole in you computer but eventually you will see the solution and get through it! 9/10 for any fan of  great puzzle games similer to my favorite game Portal. The only reason it didnt get 10/10 is because I thought the mansion could have been a little more detailed and instead the rooms were kinda repetitive in design, but that doesnt really effect the impact of the story on the player at all.

												I've read through some of the reviews written, and it seems like the main complaint is that this game is too much of a platformer and not the puzzle game some people expected it to be. I however enjoyed the platforming as much as, if not more than the puzzling. In the beginning, the game does come out as more of a puzzle game, but that changes as you progress further into the game. The difficulty of the game wasn't too hard for me, so I never really experienced that feeling of ragequitting which some people explained in their reviews that they felt, but later on in the game and especially during the DLCs the game requires a bit of thinking and some exploring aswell to help you figure out what to do to advance. The story was alright although it didn't wow me. Also it felt a bit like it was an afterthought rather than being thought through. It felt like the game's ending left an opening for a sequel, which would be interesting to see, and which I personally would probably purchase.I really liked the characters and the fact that the uncle interacts a lot during levels, but also between and tells stories about the different paintings in the manor. Although I did not feel like Ike contributed to the game as much as I'd hope he would. If a sequel does come out, I hope that Ike interacts and maybe even helps a lot more than he did in this game.I bought the game and the DLCs during sales, but I feel that the original price of the game is pretty fair and worth it. I do not feel like the DLCs are worth the original price, since I kind of forced myself through them more than wanting to finish them. There is no interaction with any other character at all during the DLCs so you're all alone during all the 5 or 6 stages of each DLC. All-in-all I do recommend the game, even more when it's on sale.			"

												I would not recommend this game, especially if you're a fan of the Portal series. Lots of people are saying that if you like Portal you'll like this game but that was not the case for me. After a few hours of gameplay I figured out the reason I didn't like this game is because it relies too much on platforming and it floaty. For example I would die 20 times trying to land on a safe in the fluff dimension because my characters momentum would continue long after I left of the forward key.The dimension's were a very cool idea, but the game is poorly implamented. Also on my system with an Nvidia GTX 760 I had framerate drops down to 20 FPS in some areas.			"

												I played it through to completion so it must be fairly good! I like the puzzles a lot, having the four different dimensions (not in the spatial sense) means puzzles are pretty varied. Writing isn't laugh out loud funny but it made me smile. Like the artstyle too.Only downside (apart from the flat ending) is that the physics engine can be a bit wonky, which means sometimes you know exactly what you need to do to solve the puzzle but the sofa doesn't float quite right, or in the right direction and ugh.Still definitely worth it if you like first person physic puzzlers.

												John DeLancie is an amazingly snarky semi-narrator. I hear the messages you recieve upon dying in his voice. But, as far as the game goes...it's kinda rough, especially on older machines. I have some serious lag issues, but I expect it with my bare bones laptop from 2012. There are collectables, as well...good luck hunting them down, though. Another fun side in the game is to try and view the paintings around the mansion in as many dimensions as possible, as the results are incredible. And, of course, there is a twist in the end of the game. You might not expect it at all, if you haven't payed enough attention to the game. All in all, this is a solid, challenging, and very funny game.			"

												I've read through some of the reviews written, and it seems like the main complaint is that this game is too much of a platformer and not the puzzle game some people expected it to be. I however enjoyed the platforming as much as, if not more than the puzzling. In the beginning, the game does come out as more of a puzzle game, but that changes as you progress further into the game. The difficulty of the game wasn't too hard for me, so I never really experienced that feeling of ragequitting which some people explained in their reviews that they felt, but later on in the game and especially during the DLCs the game requires a bit of thinking and some exploring aswell to help you figure out what to do to advance. The story was alright although it didn't wow me. Also it felt a bit like it was an afterthought rather than being thought through. It felt like the game's ending left an opening for a sequel, which would be interesting to see, and which I personally would probably purchase.I really liked the characters and the fact that the uncle interacts a lot during levels, but also between and tells stories about the different paintings in the manor. Although I did not feel like Ike contributed to the game as much as I'd hope he would. If a sequel does come out, I hope that Ike interacts and maybe even helps a lot more than he did in this game.I bought the game and the DLCs during sales, but I feel that the original price of the game is pretty fair and worth it. I do not feel like the DLCs are worth the original price, since I kind of forced myself through them more than wanting to finish them. There is no interaction with any other character at all during the DLCs so you're all alone during all the 5 or 6 stages of each DLC. All-in-all I do recommend the game, even more when it's on sale.			"

												While some could call it a poor man's Portal, I still found a lot to like about this game. The dimesion switching mechanic is really interesting and makes the puzzle solving in this game way more in depth than what it looks like at face value. I would recommend this game to fans of Portal, or if you're trying to scratch that physics-based puzzle itch you've got.			"

												Be warned that there were a few game breaking glitches associated with the graphics rendering so if your computer can't handle intensive game graphics, you may want to hold off. Even with the gamebreaking glitch keeping me from playing for several months, I still enjoyed the game overall. It is not nearly as good as Portal, but then again what even comes close? The humor is particularly hilarious, but the sillyness is rather welcoming and it never became annoying. The puzzles are well thought out although not as thought provoking as most other puzzle games, still enough fun for a casual play. Also be warned that much of game is even more platforming oriented that puzzle, two particular levels on the side of possibly frustrating. You will want a controller. This game isn't a masterpiece, but definitely worth a buy.			"

												I have a love-hate relationship with this game.It's a great game and great concept, and the puzzles are well thought out.  Most of the time it's fairly obvious what you're supposed to do to pass a level.  Unfortunately, the game requires good timing and ninja like jumping from platform to platform.  If you're the sort who rage quits after the third time of missing a jump and having to restart from the last checkpoint, you'll hate this game.  I don't normally enjoy games that require that sort of exactness, but Quantum Conundrum is apparently my exception.  I'll put up with the annoyances of missed jumps, although sometimes I have to stop playing and take a break before coming back to the level.This is a game my ten year old daughter and I play together, and often when she realizes what we have to do to pass a level she shakes her head and says, ""Daddy, don't you dare!""  We go ahead and do it anyway, and have a great time with it. "

												Good physics/platforming puzzle game. The main mechanic is that you can switch to 4 special ""dimensions"" to alter the physics, e.g. you can make all objects lighter so you can pick them up. In many levels you have to put a heavy object on a button to open a door. There is also a lot of timing and precise platforming, especially later on. The puzzles themselves are clever, but not super difficult. After figuring out what's going on in a level, you still need to make a plan and execute that plan, which is what takes the most time. The narration of the crazy professor (which seems to be aimed at 8 year olds), humanoid robots that make weird faces and the professor's pet give the game a very unserious feel. There is not much of a story. The collectibles are nice. You can replay individual levels and try to finish in a given time, without using the checkpoints and within a limited number of dimension shifts. These goals are pretty difficult and require a lot of attempts. 12 levels are sold separarely as two DLCs.Overall, it's an enjoyable game if you like physics/platforming/timing and don't mind the childishness.

												It's impossible to talk about this game without mentioning Portal, so I'm not going to try.This is a great puzzle game, similar to Portal in overall format: Go through rooms, solve puzzles with a reality-bending device, put cubes on switches, open doors, avoid lasers, all while being taunted by a narrator. Same basic schtick, but there are some important differences.There are two ways to gauge the difficulty of a puzzle game: Difficulty to figure out the puzzle, and difficulty to carry out the solution. While Portal's puzzles are typically very easy to execute after you determine the solution, this game relies quite a bit more on timing and accuracy. A lot of reviewers have criticized this, I personally quite enjoy it. This isn't to say, however, that the puzzles are simple. I would put the quality of the puzzles themselves on par with Portal 2.The plot of this game is rather thin, and serves the sole purpose of getting you into the game. The narrator is the voice of Q from Star Trek, essentially with Q's personality. Again, some people might hate this, I liked it. For a while. Eventually, the same jabs, jibes and insults got rather old. And just because the plot is an excuse-plot doesn't excuse the way the game ended.Speaking of things getting old, there is zero environment variation to this game. The areas between major puzzles could be literally copy-pasted from each other. At one point the narrator makes a joke about this. Protip: Making jokes about your lazy game design isn't cool, it just makes you look lazy. That being said, I adore the art style as a whole. It's whimsical and cartoony, in a time when games are either trying to be super-realistic or 8-bit. There is a great amount of detail in the game world, and nothing shows it off more than the detail you can find with your first ""power"". There are portraits on the wall, and the pictures themselves can change in amusing ways as you manipulate reality.There are also two DLC packs for this game. Each of them seems to advertise going on an adventure themed around one of two side-characters from the game, but this is a bald-faced lie. They are simply puzzle-packs, each containing about six unrelated puzzles, with the final mission of the pack including the puzzle pack's namesake as an insignificant component of the puzzle. Adding insult to the injury, there isn't even any narration in the puzzle packs. Even a simple silly  attempt at threading the puzzles into a narrative would have made it better than it was, but alas. It was not to be.That being said, the puzzles in the DLC packs were quite fun and I liked them a lot.This review may have sounded negative, but I enjoyed this game wholeheartedly. If you like 3D puzzle/physics games, you should definitely consider it. However, if you're the type who gets infuriated when you know how to solve a puzzle but can't actually pull it off, you might want to be careful.			"

												it is just not good, at first it is fun but the puzzles became real quick a shore. to in the lines, it has to be done in that way and there is no other way to solve it, and finding that way becomes a shore after a while, that is the vibe i got. and that comes from someone that LOVES puzzels, but this one is just to straight this is the way do it that way. okay i understand it has to be done in a fashion that the game is made for but give a bit more the freedom to think outside the box. not recommended			"

												I like these type of puzzle games I thought the comentator was entertaining to listen toedit: why I liked this puzzle game is because it behaved a lot more like a platformer than an actual puzzle game. I really like both genre's this game have a portal like thought process to it and finding a solution then doing it felt rewarding to me			"

												Good way to spend a weekend. Rougher around the edges than Portal, but the puzzles are still good. Great sense of satisfaction as you learn the capabilities of each dimension. Final act was a bit too short. I'll be working on the shift goals while I wait for the DLC...			"

												If there was a neutral rating I would rather use that. But since Steam accepts just Yes or NO (and I see the glass half full rather than half empty) I recommend it. The game tries too hard to be humorous like Portal, but it isn't. To be honest the game would be much better if the narrator would just shut his mouth.The puzzles on the other hand are fun. Those requiring platforming can be a bit wonky at times though.Get it in sale IF You like puzzle games.			"
