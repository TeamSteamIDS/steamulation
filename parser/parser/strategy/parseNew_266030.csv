												This is NOT a free-2-play game.It's a DEMO of a game. You find the exact same limitations in demos as the 'free version' of this game places on you. To put it bluntly, you are not going to get more time out of this product than you are from a demo of any other game UNLESS you start buying boosters.The question then comes, of course, is it worth it to buy boosters?For me, looking at prices and taking my experiences while trying out the mislabeled DEMO, the answer became a resounding NO.Doing the story missions (which I did to get every unlock possible in the demo) was somewhat ok. A bit repetitve at times, due to the limitations of the game, but at least the battles were somewhat balanced.Ability to get cards for free seemed limited to the few you got in the limited amount of solo-play missions available. The only currency in the game is hard cash, and it's not something you can 'earn' by playing (not in any games I tried at least), but purely something you pay to get boosters.Most of the time when I queued up for online battles against other players, it told me that nobody was available to play against. So I had to alt-tab and do random stuff in a web-browser while trying to even GET games going online against other players.Any of the battles I tried against other players were horribly horribly mismatched. There was no way the deck I was supplied with as a 'freebie'(or demo player) would compete with the decks of people I met (every one of the ones I met seemed to have paid and played for a while, given their levels and cards). Randomization also have a huge effect on battles, meaning what initially looked like a balanced battle (as the ones I encountered in the solo missions) can turn onesided very quickly by a combination of cards gotten and mana orb placement. Battles that are already onesided can become extremely pointless beyond hope because of this too (like where my level 3 drake was put up against a level 30 drake by the matchmaking).Unless you are planning to spend ALOT of money over a period of time to buy boosters as time goes by, steer clear of this one. The variety also seemed close to non-existent in the games I played, despite meeting levels and drakes of different types. The poor balance, non-varietyof battles, lack of ability to progress without paying for it (coupled with the prices per time you actually consider if you should purchase something) ultimately turned me off from the game once I found out that I had exhausted the demo of its potential in a matter of 4 hours...Some cute ideas, but ultimately flawed in execution on how they go about trying to handle the 'distribution model'.

												Drakerz really wants you to spend money, as half the monsters are locked behind paywalls (and there arn't that many to choose from). However, the game is poorly translated from French, is kinda buggy under its clean interface, and the card text isn't easy readable at higher resolutions. The unskippable and insulting tutorial tried to break on me twice, and the game itself crashed once for no apparent reason. The option to buy physical cards and combine them with a web cam for augmented reality is interesting, but given the above problems I really can't advise anyone to give it a try.			"

												The first 3 times I start the launcher nothing happens after I click the 'Play' button (in French).Normally I would have deleted the game by then, but I decided to give it the fourth try, and guess what, it succeeded!And then massive wall of text in French appears.FFS I gave up. Sorry for not understanding French. I will keep this as a 'No' since I can only judge this game by its Launcher. At least until the game has a bit of acceptable translation.			"

												As far as I can tell, it's not F2P (there's no way to get more cards past the common ones without paying), it's really just a demo until you buy a starter. And buying a starter deck alone isn't actually possible, you have to buy two at once.The gameplay is interesting and different enough, though there is a large element of luck as with most CCGs. The story mode (""legend mode"") is limited to the first 6 battles per drako, and you have access to 3 drakos.The translation is okay... It's not the sort of professional standard I expect from games, with errors in many places and some things just plain not translated, but it's really obvious what's meant so it's not much of a hinderance.Overall, you can have some fun with it (as with many demos) but this isn't really F2P.

												Hello, i really like your game but the problem with it is the next one.You focus too much on the profit, and not on hook and/or please the players.My recommendations, if you make it and i think you could make it, it's a change on the system.First - Points or gold in the game, the first one so the players can pay to get ""x"" in-game gold so they can buy special stuff (Like a deck with 100% chance of getting an epic card or a legendary card) and the other one, a money that the players can earn while they won duels, so you can buy decks too, but with 25% or 50% of chance of special cards, also the thing that you can buy skins for the summons.Second - make a few more summons free for the newbies, then others that can be bought with the in-game gold or real cash (Mostly), and for last if you want, some VIP (Not the majority)that only can be bought paying the game, or maybe in reward of some kind of tournament.Third - to have 3 kinds of duels, the first one, friendly where two players face each other, just to have fun and gain more xp on the game, the second, duels against random players from a list, where beside getting xp, gain in-game gold, and for last, ranking duels, where you can gain xp, in-game gold, and obviously scorepoints, climbing the ranking ladder (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, etc).Once you have done all this stuff, republish the game with the advertising you decide, in this way you will get things that give you profits, and players to spend.

												Not genuinely ""Free to play"", in my opinion, as it requires you to go out and buy cards before letting you do anything at all. Literally was only able to make an account then it told me to go buy a real pack of cards, which aren't even sold in my area let alone in English as far as I know. The game itself, or at least the first screens it gives you, is also in full French and doesn't seem to have an option for English either, even though it says it has English fully integrated. The concept is good but the company behind it didn't do it justice with this game.			"

												Not really as fun as its advertisement. You are given a choice of using 1 out of 6 dragons, with each dragon having a basic super power. You battle an opponent dragon in a sumo ring and hammer the crap out of the opposing dragon until it runs out of HP. It's like a lesser Pokemon fight.PROS1. DragonsDragons are always enticing but that's is all there is.2. NoveltyIt's definitely new.CONS1. It's not funIt's really draggy as most the game is trying to dish out damage and manuveur to the opponent's flank.2. PaywallThose dragons don't come free.3. VR/Augmented RealityNope.

												Despite the entire issue with the games initial download and installation (to call it horrible, nightmarish and painful would be understatement), I found the game to be really interesting. The game essentially has two components: an augmented reality one, using a webcam and physical cards and a virtual only game (which currently is what you are playing on steam). The actual gemplay revolves around using your creature to battle the other player, using a mixture of physical attacks and spell cards. In many ways, you can think of it as using cards to fight with pokemon.Be warned that the game is, in essence, pay to win due to the CCG nature of the game. Furthermore, since you are drawing from a deck, you are hit a little bit by RNG as well. On the negative sides, I find the English translation to be lackluster and the developers really need to spend the money to fix that before it would be accepted by an English speaking country. Furthermore, there are a lot of bugs in the game as well, but seeing how this IS an open beta version of the game, then I'm fine with that at THIS time. Overall, I found myself rather impressed by the game and I am currently considering putting some money up for it on kickstarter.			"

												DRAKERZ started of as an augment reality trading card game, in which you need a webcam and actual physical cards to play the game, but they added a 'virtual mode' which you can play the game with a keyboard and mouse without the webcam and physical cards, which is good because options are good. Playing the game for a bit i had fun playing it, and i love how there is movement and directions to worry about and control rather than only focusing on numbers and stats, plus it looks great graphically speaking. If your having problems with the download (i also had it) just reset it and hope it doesn't get stuck again (unfortunately that's how i solved my problem but solved never the less)

												It is a really good card game, with a good feeling too the game-play. A nice strategy and a good visual impression. And don't freak out if you find everything in it to be in french, there is a very small english flag in the upper left corner of the log on-screen that will solve most of that issue ;-) IT IS however NOT A FREE-TO-PLAY. As the way to earn cards in free-to-play mode is too limited still. And I feel that you will have to invest, atleast to get a foothold in the game, before you can play it properly. But if you are looking for a good card game to put your money in this is probebly not a bad choice.			"

												DRAKERZ-Confrontation, looks well made and goes with a unique Augmented Reality ""theme"". The game has pretty graphics but at least for me, the pretty models and UI were not enough for me to keep playing. I experienced a ton of bugs, my game got stuck in french no matter how many times I set it to English. there was no tutorial for me, and there were a ton of launcher issues. So far they have fixed the launcher issues pretty quickly. You should try the game yourself, who knows what state the game will be in a week from now, or even a month. We may hear screams of P2W, or moans of despair over bugs and crashes. Over all the game is interesting and I am curious to see were it goes but at the moment I wont be playing it much if at all. you should try it aswell though because its worth a look.			"

												Overall I would say this is a good game. There are a few bugs that prevented me from trying out the daily tournaments. The game is pay to win, this is a fact. You get to pick a creature that you want to play with and they give you another 2 free to play creatures to play around with. You get the free to play card pack and it works pretty well if you can wisely use your mana and get good card draws. In order to get other creatures and other cards you have to buy the packs though, otherwise you won't get very far in the story mode or when versing other people online.There is no other way to get new cards, so the ""free to play"" aspect only goes so far. If they gave players a way to actually earn cards it might be a great game.			"

												VIEW:I would say No to this game in my view this game is great graphicaly which is something outstanding to see for once but I was expecting way more from this game only to be disappointed from the lack of creatures you actualy play. The cards them selves In which you use only serve as a support role and buff to the creature you had picked or playing. So if some of you are looking for a TCG where you can have various creatures to play this is not the game you are looking for it is centered around limited number of creatures.PROSGreat graphical appearanceGood approach to a TCGCustomization of creature appearanceTitle appearanceGood battle mechanics   CONS:Very limited amount of creaturesCards are mostly only a support role to the creatureA lot of the focus is on purchasing cards (Have not seen any way of obtaining cards other than purchase cant be 100% accurate on that one.)Translation still needs a bit of workCONCLUSION:To me this is still a 50/50 kind of game but for now from me it is a no.

												I have only played this game for a short amount of time but it’s already my favourite TCG. The movement system adds a whole different level of strategy to a card game that would otherwise be very boring. Also the fact that you only have one monster makes the game less confusing to manage and play, yet takes nothing away from the strategy. Although the game had problems at first with download it’s something you should expect as it was just added recently and something that can be fixed quickly. I really hope this game stays around for a long time.			"

												It's a tactical positioning game where you only get one character, with cards that almost exclusively do boring things to your numbers. The gameplay is made extra slow by attack animations that get longer rather than more intense when you do more damage, and a focus on nudging your character's card until it's exactly in the perfect position.

												DRAKERZ-Confrontation 7/10 (with alot of hope for the future)The concept is sound you have one monster card and you move it around a set arena to defeat the opponent with flanking and cornering. Your deck of 40 cards is made up of spell, weapons, interuptions, etc to add a intense battle experience. But the concept I apprechiated the most about this game is its sheer connection with the player. Let me explain. When playing TCG's or RPG's we gain the most connection when we create the character. For TCG's its deck types. We connect with a type of most or style and make it our own. In RPG's we like to place ourselves in the role of character going on adventures. This game ( be it very little at the moment) dose both. You create a deck to your play style and pick a monster that fits you, but then the game takes it a step further and allows to to alter that creatures apearance. This may seem a small thing but to those of us who watch animes like Digimon or Dragon Drive where you have one monster and thats all you get. This little step allows the player to connect to their ""Drako"" making it yours. As of right now there are only 6 Drakos in the game but every part from wings, to wing color, to claws, to horns can be changed. This game is only starting out and there are issues with translations but I for one am going to see it through and hope this game can pick itself up and stand tall with the big name TCG's.			"

												it's a completley new experience in the card game genere. I would highly recommend because it feels like pokemon(don't hate) but at the same time feels like i'm having ravageous monsters f*** eachother up. YOu don't have to pay to play, or even to win it just comes down to skill and tactics. So i this moment i would say GO Felis ♥♥♥♥ em up!!!!!			"

												It's an awesome concept that they took and made into a game. Giant monsters and cards? Hell yea! Customize your monsters to your liking? Hell yea!Pay to win? Hell no. Unless you're willing to put real money down, this games terrabad. You get stuck against people who payed like 100 dollars to get the high tier cards, and trash the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you because they now belong in a higher tier.7/10			"

												This is what i think afther the first 2 hours of game play i will play more to give a better reveiw and chnage this post every 1 hour of game play i put into it.This game is very play to play you only get cards and boosters my paying realy money , besides a few preset cards for playing story mode it trys to force buying the  rl cards on you when it would be better off  doing somthing more on the lines of infity wars. where cards and booster can be bought with in game money. the games a bit on the on weirds side to boot and seems the Real cards are rather pointless sents you cant play the game with out a computer and webcam. i gve the game a 2/10. whould have been fun if it wasnt just a gaint money grab.

												This is a really fun little game, and is great for a free-to-play. However, one thing that ruins the game for me is a few minor errors when it comes from translating the game from French into English. Whilst this is only a minor complaint, and I know from personal experience that translation is not easy, I would like to point out that the few errors existing in this game could potentially confuse players. Otherwise, I have really enjoyed my experience playing this game and will definitely play some more when I have the time :)			"

												With the first few bit that I've seen and played, I have to say that it's been a very long time since I played a TCG that I actually enjoyed a lot. It built up from Pokemon, to YGO, to MTG but that was many years ago. This game caught my attention like PS3's Eye of Judgement (which unfortunately I can't find many people to play it, though it may be problems on my end) and feels like it has a bit more strategy to the game. I do like the idea that you are not only able to play the game online with digital or paperback cards, but you can even play with others locally without the computer (though you don't get all that interesting visuals).I haven't received my physical cards yet, but to what I've seen and heard the artwork has been done very beautifully. I do hope that this game will continue to expand and become the next MTG or at least a worldwide game that will live a long time. I know it's just beginning, but I am hoping to see some interesting new creatures and strategy works for it.My final rating: 7/10Though the game is great, I feel that there can (and will) be more improvements.  One of the things I would like to see is the game feeling more lively when you're doing combat and going through the phases. And as people do say on the forums, there are still some things needing translating but other than that I think it's off to a decent start. I haven't run into the problem of the launcher not working so I can't say any of my frustrations about that, but I will give this a 9/10 when the game is fully released with all that fixed :)			"

												I see a lot of peple saying bad things about the launcher and langague problems but when I downloaded it the launcher finished its update in less than two minutes and I was able to play. When it came to language I noticed some words were not translted yet, but most of it is in english and if there are any words still in french (I think thats the language) its not too hard to understand what it means, or what the button does unless its a name. The game works GREAT.Drakerz is definitly a NEW type of card game, not just because it can be played in augmented realty (which is optional), but also because the machanics of the game are something never before seen (Or at least that I have have seen) in a card game and trust me I have played a lot of TCGs. Its all about your one Drako, your monster, your pet, your friend who you try to keep alive in battle. Theres no giant clutter of monsters on the feild that you have to keep track of, just one. The way you play is by moving your Drako across the battle feild, where you have to think very tacticaly on positioning and keeping your resource (Mana) in check to use special move against your enemy.Now remember this game is still pretty new and it was made in a different country so of course there are going to be some issues, but that dosent mean you should walk away from the game. The team working on this game are actually doing their best to improve the game for others and are always answering questions so dont be afraid to ask too if you get a weird problem accuring.Drakerz is definitly a game worthy of looking at if you like card games, or even stratagy games and even if you dont it might have some aspects or simplisty that any gamer would like. The best part is that you can play for free with the virtual starter pack and three free drako they give you, even if you go against people who have bought cards you still have a chance to beat them like I have. The cards you get are actually really good and the other cards you can get from the campaign mode only make your deck better. GIVE THIS GAME A CHANCE and if you already left it, GIVE IT ANOTHER CHANCE. I cannot even properly describe how much fun this game can be. Its totally worth it.			"

												It's crashed twice in a row, at the same place, during the tutorial.EDIT: I don't know what's wrong but the game crashes doing the tutorial and because the tutorial is compulsary to play, I haven't been able to see anything else.... anything else except the constant adds bashing me in the face since the first time I signed in with over priced pay-to-win cards and monsters. The translation... was not seamless. The ""Engrish"" makes reading abilities and stuff sometimes impossible and understanding how the game works difficult.Obviously, this game is great. Even just the fraction of the tutorials I got through were fun. This experience is UTTERLY RUINED by the pay-to-win system that funds their game, the Engrish that makes comprehension impossible and to make it worse there are constant adds being blasted in your face. Save your time and if you're silly enough ... the money. Do not download this game.			"

												I just got through with the tutorial, and it already doesn't make any sense. You have to name your ""Drako,"" but it gives no indication in-game or on the site as to if it will be ALL your ""Drakos,"" or just the one. It also doesn't say whether or not you can choose another at any time. So I gave the name I wanted for another one to the one I had.Even when choosing a Drako, it says that you have a premium starter... this is false. You don't have anything, so ignore it. You can choose one of the first three, even though none of them seem to be any ""better"" than the rest.But, forgiving the in-game French (even French error messages on account creation), the only thing I can't stand as far as I've been willing to play, is the end-of-match hissing. The Meleon (their names are awful, by the way) hisses, growls and stomps in an infinite loop on a two-second intereval. It's the same sound, and it repeats until you're totally done reading all the post-match text and move on.			"

When you get into game you will have a starter deck that is ofcourse free. And i strongly recomend buying cards( mostly virtual card if you dont really care about the physical cards, since virtual is cheaper). Try this game out and see if you like it it is really unique. not at all like other tcg. and if you like it support them and buy some cards :)			"

The Virtual option is nice but you still have to BUY physical cards as the main way to get new cards (there's no ingame money to buy vitural cards, or any way to buy virtual cards) The only good part about this game is that it looks nice. Alot of mechanics aren't explained properly too.Also only 3 of the beasts are pickable as free.			"

												i tried playing this game. the game is mostly in french even wwhen english is selected.. it was hard to find out how to start because of the french as well as the fact that one of the game modes is serious mode where you have to buy a deck using real cash. overall it looked really cool but you just cant release an ""english"" version of a game when 80% of it is still in another language.i recommend this game to anyone that speaks french, otherwise i dont recommend it.

Despite the greatness of its own style of gameplay that brings the TCG type of game up a new level, there still a slight problem with the launcher as mentioned by most of the players who played this game. I already facing the problem when patching the game via launcher which is it keep failing about each 10mb of patching so I need to resume the patch each time it fail. Plus, this game is not really free-to-play as described because each augmented deck can be play as you pay for it so the free version only gives you limited set of cards in your deck which is helpless for you to survive through the campaign and even harder in multiplayer mode where only those who pay can win the game.

												A real card game with many dimensions !You can chose your monster (Drako) among 06 : Felis - Gorok - Kwartz - Meleon - Furkhan and Ogam.Each drako has a diferent power that lets you play with many combinations of cards.The game is free to play and you can get many virtual cards with the story mode. After that, you can easily carry to play against real players :)Several mode are available in this game (history, tournaments, challenges ...) and of course the opportunity to play with a friend and his webcam provided buy some real cards will recall that many hours of play on games like this: pIf you want more information on the action of the game, follow the link :https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/968346344/drakerz-augmented-reality-tcg/posts/858888---------------Pour les Français, Essayez, vous l'adopterez à coup sûr ;)			"

												I really liked this game, it had potential. The idea of trading cards combined with Augmented reality just seemed so good. The community was one of the friendliest game communities I had seen. The Drakos are costumizable in that you unlock different colors for wings, tail, horns, etc. I left for a few months, but when I came back, I was shocked to find the lobby showing 0 players online. A game I wanted so badly to succeed is now empty.  I will recommend this game to represent the fun it was when the community was more active. "

												The game still has a weird soundcard glitch that destroys your ear unless you reload the game a few times to get rid of that annoying bug. You can play the first newbie tournament, use 3 dragons but obviously without the real cards that you must purchase, there is nothing else for you to do. It is like playing a demo of a game but without the chance to test their AR features without purchasing. It is not a Free to Play, just a demo. Overall I enjoyed playing it until I beat the newbie campaign but nothing else. It has potential but its niche is restricted to the tabletop cards to squeeze it fully. Graphics are OK, sound is glitchy as hell and too repetitive, gameplay is enthralling but nothing else beyond that. Purchase the cards and enjoy the tournaments and unlocked potential you can't enjoy for free.			"

												Alright... Let's be honest, this game is not really a free to play.However, I really like it ! I follow the game since his very beginning and I always had fun and a real challenge playing it, even with my basic cards.Yes you may have to pay if you want to unlock the full story mode (doesn't interest me) or having cards a bit faster and I agree with people complaining about that, it's a kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ part.BUT what if I told you there is an other way to win cards ? The playable story parts give you cards when winning, 1 for each completion and actually only like 10 free but it's a good start.Then practice against people and take part of an online tournaent, 1 each hours and saturday's tournaments winner earns a virtual booster.This game is not totally free-to-play, the way to have more cards is either money, either skill, I personally do have the second one and I'm waiting for some challengers.PS: the game freaking need an active community, lobbies are empty as hell :/			"

												Ok. Let me put it this way. This game is cool. We've needed an AR type game like this for pc for a long time.My issues is thatFirst of all, the game will sometimes jsut not open when you hit paly and tell you it stopped responding.Secondly, When you try to do the forums for answers and help. There will be no response. I don't know why this is but i feel like the game is dead.			"

												I found some of the cards to this game yesterday, remembering the fun times I had before it was released on Steam...So I re-downloaded it, and connected with my old account..no one was on. I could only do the single player matches versus a computer... So is this game now officially dead ? If so, then I'm terribly sorry for those players who used to play, or want to play, yet cannot use the game's multi player potential...:(			"
