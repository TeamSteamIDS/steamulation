												Full metal jacket meets Loonie Tunes. A whole lot of fun, reminiscent of the old Cannon Fodder games. Overall it looked GREAT but the controls, since this was ported over from a touch interface, were a bit lacking. After the publisher read so many comments about this short-coming they added the ability to use keyboard / mouse for controlling your characters. I would have preferred Twin-Stick controls but I'll take what I can get here. :)After the update I have been loving this game greatly. Game loads quick, gameplay itself is quick to pick up, and the graphics are, cartoony but, fantastic.If you enjoy leading some characters around shooting and blasting things you'll have a great time with this title. Also, since everyone must join the bandwagon (and I, for one, love them for it), this game also includes a zombie survival mode. Maps are a bit small for my tastes and it gets a bit hectic sometimes leading your ""snake"" of men through the environment and zombies, but overall a ton of fun.In summation, buy this game (on sale or full price) today and support a developer providing great games, and, who listens to their player-base.

												I am currently trying to get thru my backlog of games, which means I have around 2 thousand to play. Chose this game (thanks Josh) installed it, and felt like it was going to be another one of those budget pieces of crap. I could not have been further off base with that assumption.You begin each mission with a brief overview of your objectives. You get to see your squad, and how many people you will be bringing along for the mission. You can buy single mission upgrades, as well as training that lasts from mission to mission. Once you have selected your squad loadout, and upgrades, you begin. Cute, colorful graphics work well, along with some nice explosion effects. Purposely cartoony sound effects and voice acting fit the theme.  Varied mission objectives keep it interesting. Default controls are completely mouse driven, and are terrible. Switch over to WSAD movement and mouse controlled firing, and it controls perfectly. $5 for this hidden gem. Wait for it to be on sale if you must, but Id pick it up at full price. Awesome.			"

												It pains me slightly to give this a negative review, but it just isn't quite good enough to justify the endorsement. It's not a bad game by any stretch, more mediocre than anything else - and it may appeal to big fans of the genre. I just wasn't particularly taken by it.Although it's an iOS port, Tiny Troopers is far from poor and the dev deserves props for patching in some additional control options to overcome teething problems left over from the initial touch interface. A small thing, but always good to see. The game plays exactly as you think a casual topdown shooter would - you track through relatively simple missions with your squad, following along in a string ala Cannon Fodder. Unfortunately, the similarities pretty much end there.There are quite a few missions in the game and trying to get three stars on all of them would be a reasonable challenge by the standards of an iOS game, even if they do get samey fairly swiftly. The zombie defense mode is also surprisingly fun for a little while. The graphics are cute and the humour is there, at the very least - the game seems reminiscent of the 3D Worms games in both senses.Ultimately though, what's fun for an hour or two quickly gets stale - and that's why I can't recommend this game. Worth picking up on sale if you like the genre, but otherwise this one seems destined to clutter bundles. Tiny Troopers, I salute you for your efforts but I can't banish Cannon Fodder from my mind. Perhaps that's on me and I shouldn't be making so many comparisons, but that's just how I feel. It suffers the same fate as the numerous Lemmings clones have over the years - even today, they suffer by comparison to the original.			"

Tiny Troopers - A simple, cute and challenging little war game which is very similar to Cannon Fodder in terms of mechanics and gameplay, but has a health-bar system to make things a little bit less punishing, so if you like that series of games, you will likely enjoy this game too, I definitely did!Tiny Troopers is a top-down shooter which was originally developed for iOS, earlier versions of the Steam edition left lots of evidence that this was a quick port, but patches and updates have really improved this game to benefit PC players such as making a new and better control system (WASD Movement with Mouse Aiming), fixing some smaller errors such as grammar/typos and re-adding the Zombie game mode (accompanied with achievements as a bonus). So, if you were thrown off from buying this game because of older reviews that were posted before the changes were made (such as TotalBuiscuit's review), please consider trying the current version on sale, it is freshly polished and has been vastly improved.Tiny Troopers is a lot of fun, the Command Point system along with the Ranking and Leveling add a nice touch to make the game feel a bit more progressive. Individual trooper levelling makes a return and works essentially the same way as it does in the original Cannon Fodder games, each mission a particular trooper survives and completes will provide them with a new rank making them tougher, stronger and improve his weapon capabilities. There are a total of 30 missions in the campaign, 10 missions per chapter. Once these are complete, there is a Campaign+ option to try and challenge yourself further giving this game some replay value, the Zombie mode is a nice touch too to give yourself something more to do.There isn't much else to say here. The game is really enjoyable, while not exactly groundbreaking, and is a great game to play if you're looking to get into something quick and fun for a low price. It takes no time at all to get yourself clued up on how to play as the tutorial takes no longer than a minuteto complete because of the simple controls, meaning you can jump right into the action almost instantly. Also just for the record, this game is superior to Cannon Fodder 3.For £3.99, I defeinitely recommend this game. When it is on sale, I can't recommend this game enough.			"

												It's a strategic shooter that is very similar to the Amiga's classic Cannon Fodder. It's a mobile porting for PC, simply and funny, recommended for casual game lovers and retro gamers.

												Buy it if it's cheap.It's entertaining, but don't expect it to be as good as Cannon Fodder 1/2. It lacks the fluidity and speed present in CF, also you can't split up squads. Such a comparison would usually be unfair, but Tiny Troopers is basically an unashamed attempt to be an ""inspired by Cannon Fodder"" type of game. However it's better than the real Cannon Fodder 3. I'd also say it's better than Foreign Legion or Bunch of Heroes, so buy it if you were thinking of buying any of those. (If you're looking for something slightly less arcadey, look up 'recruits'. It's been greenlit but is not on the store yet. It's on Desura though. Also lookup running with rifles)The campaign is weird. There's a persistent set of points/money used, which is gained by completing missions. But if you repeatable fail missions not only do your troops die (and therefore you get poorly skilled replacements) but you don't get any money. You often need to spend money to get some one-time only extra troopers, but if you fail the mission and therefore they die. It's as if the mission has cost you negative money! The game has an angry-birds style ability to choose to replay previous missions (complete with a 3-star rating) so I imagine players can grind old missions for money if they need to cash to buy some uber-force for later ones. I didn't have to do that when doing 'campaign 1'. A quick google and I see it's an iOS game with IAP. Now I'm not surprised by the odd campaign structure. ;)The mouse controls are tricky to use, but very faithful to CF if you've played it. With the mouse, you click and ALL troops immediately go in that direction. If you want to walk one way whilst shooting the other a great amount of mouse dexterity is required (especially to keep a constant speed up). This was one of the major sources of difficulty in the original Cannon Fodder on later bullet-hell style levels and one of the main adrenaline producing factors. Switching to WADS removes that sense of urgency but presents its own problems. (They're also non-rebindable, grr). The keyboard controls are strange and differ from the mouse controls in that all the people no longer move at once. They turn it into a semi twin stick shooter crossed with 'snake'. i.e. you only move the front guy and the rest follow, meaning that if you change direction most of your squad will staying in place for a second or so as the lead guy moves past them, which makes them easy bullet sponges for the enemy. It's pretty annoying.I don't know if that quirk of the WADS control scheme is to make it more 'balanced' (as all troops instantly moving in the same direction would substantially reduce the likely-hood of your trailing guys getting shot yet be easier to control), or if it just wasn't thought about at all. Also: The camera is a bit annoying when shooting, especially on the zombie level. Overall it's quite fun. If they were to up the walkspeed of everything, make the projectiles slightly smaller, make the projectiles faster, make better walk animations, and fix the annoying WADS snake issue I'd say they'd have a very entertaining games on their hands.

												Great game on the mobile version, but it's not really worth your money to buy the PC version of Tiny Troopers... I mean, you can like download the mobile version of Tiny Troopers for free or something. There's Tiny Troopers 2 on the phone already too.It will get boring quite fast, so you should turn away. Though I'm glad I bought this game thanks to the Summer Sale of 2016, but it's time to get my 99 cents back.			"

												This is a fun little game about a rag-tag pair of soldiers that, through a series of missions, rise through the ranks and have more and more specialists available to their squad.The gameplay itself is fun, and is diverse enough so that you won't bore too quickly. Though some of the missions seem to drag on, running from place to place, the majority of them are quite easy to do and countinue on.Nice game, consider this if you have a spare dollar or two.			"

												I have Tiny Troopers 2 on ipad. It's good. I found Tiny Troopers on Steam along time ago (about when i made my account). Today it was on sale, i had some money and got this hell-of-a game. I finished chapter 1 in about 2 hours but that was probably one of the best 2 hours I have had. There is alot to do in this game like, do the campaign, get the achievements and play zombies. This feels like CoD with a Warcraft-ish twist. Zoooooooombies. Zombies is fun. You kill zombies. You survive for a while. You unlock a gate. You get a new troop. You get some drops. You survive more. You unlock more gates. You get more troops. You survive even more. You unlock no more gates. You died to that chicken while you were trying to kill the vomiting zombie and dynamite zombie. 10/zoooooooombiesAlso, when will Tiny Troopers 2 come to Steam. And Tiny Troopers is a bit over priced (unless you have the power of, SALES)			"

												This is brilliant! It's such a simple but fun game.If you remember the game Cannon Fodder it's similar but more comical and more fun.Obviously you can't use a joypad with a game like this but using mouse and keyboard works perfect especially if you choose the WASD to move and mouse for firing and specials option, the other option is click to move your troops with the mouse and doesn't work so wellIt's one of those games that you will restart missions but want to go back for one more go. You'll get frustrated almost completing a mission then getting blown to bits by a tank you didn't see or walked into some hidden explosives. I've heard it can be completed it in a 2 or 3 hours but don't let that put you off its still value for money. It's definitely worth the £4.I'm guessing this will play on just about any PC or laptop.			"

												Tiny Troopers has a tendency to blur the line between cheeky cartoon violence and horrifying child soldiers. There's plenty of playful allusions to pro-war propaganda and action hero stereotypes, but there's also goofy, childish voices choking out their dying breaths. It's hard to say if the game is playing towards a peculiar sense of humor or if it's trying to build some kind of satirical statement. Either way, that part of the experience is as effective as it is forgettable, just enough to stumble the mood but not quite enough to halt the fun. Troop formation and movement is based entirely around following the leader in single file, so the game quickly becomes a bizarre version of Snake involving bullets and explosives. The campaign is very short, but it ends just quickly enough to avoid overstaying its welcome. After thirty levels it does feel like Tiny Troopers is out of new things do with its formula, which is why it was such a pleasant surprise when Zombie mode turned out to be more than a depressing reskin. The survivor-styled mode reduces the game down to its essential parts and actually grants more control over troop composition than the main game. This extra mode was the perfect cherry to cap this short, silly, (if somewhat disturbing) arcade-like experience.			"

												Screw the metacritic score, this game is fun. I believe it's a mobile port because I played this on iOS first. If this is a port then it is one of the best ports I have ever played. Graphic options, windowed mode, resolution options, sound options, control rebinding, proper control prompts, it's all there. Even the little things like ""tap"" being changed to ""click"" were taken care of. I am actually trying to 100% this game and it hasn't been boring.			"

												This game delivers simple action with a dash of humor only requiring a modicum of skill to fully complete the missions.  There are several control schemes to choose from and the controls are done well and shouldn't be a problem for anyone.  The Zombie mode is made up of one map and you unlock gates that lead to the other members of your team, and as you piece together this team you fight off waves of several types of zombies including chickens and kamikazis to name a few. I have enjoyed my time with this game and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good romp through a series of small battles with a handful of destructive weapons and units at their disposal.

												Tiny Troopers is based on the venerable Amiga classic Cannon Fodder to such an extent that it's pretty much a bootleg of it. Which is not a bad thing purely of itself, although it is casualized and streamlined to ""get with the times"". Now that could be a bad thing depending on how much of a purist you are, and how attached to the original Cannon Fodder might you be. Luckily for me - and the game, too - I am hardly attached to the original (despite having some sentiment for it) and thus I managed to enjoy this experience.Part of this casualization stems from the fact that the game was initially developed for mobile devices and ported to PC only at a later time. So the finer points of game design such as how difficult the fights are, or - more precisely - how many opponents might be typically visible at one time are steeped in the realities of touch controls, small screens and the mobile game audience (I'll mercifully leave it at that).Before we leave the subject of the game's heritage, I'd like to touch up on its visuals. They're 3D, yes, but a very particular kind of 3D that an experienced eye will immediately identify as ""mobile 3D"". Which generally boils down to being blocky, unimpressive and focused on performance (low poly).  Which, in turn, means that no effort was spent on improving the visuals for the PC port - or not enough effort, anyways. The saving grace of these visuals is a smart, cartoony art direction that makes good use of the limited resources available to it. The result is that the game looks ""acceptable"" on PC, kinda like you would expect an indie game to look.The original Cannon Fodder tried to convey an anti-war undercurrent in its design and humour. It backfired as it was misunderstood by some and caused controversy, but not the kind the authors intended. I hope those rotten peaceniks learned their lesson, but if not, I can at least see that the developers of Tiny Troopers learned that lesson in their stead. No such triteness is detectable here, the game is pure, nonjudgmental entertainment. It evokes the kind of cheerful imagining of war most of us had when we were kids, similar to what I recently experienced when playing Battle Group 2. Indeed, the target audience here appears to be very young.There are 30 levels, each available in 3 difficulty settings. This makes the game somewhat short but not tragically so. These are available as part of a campaign with soldier progression and permadeath (sans Boot Hill) or as standalone missions to farm currency. There is also a survival mode dressed up in zombie trappings and some sort of NG+. The difficulty settings are well apart of each other and offer a varied experience. In the achievement department, ""Battlefield Triage!"" requires a few hours of aggravating grinding but the rest are straightforward.I had fun with this. I'd recommend it for a few laughs and some nostalgia, preferably when a discount is available. It's a mediocre game, but I've seen much worse.			"

												ASWD to move, left click shoot, right click alt fire, 1-2-3 for special weapons options, call in support for dollars, it's very very basic even for a touch-pad port.As it's been said, the ""campaign"" is nothing more than disjointed, generic missions played sequentially. Missions on maximum difficulty can be completed effortlessly the first time you see them, provided everyone but your main unit means nothing to you. I'm guessing that the ""challenge"" is that you can only control the head of your squad and all other members move like a snake behind him. Therefore, when you are trying to avoid fire, you have to do so in a way that does not allow the other members of your party to get hit when they arrive at your location two or three seconds later. Basically, it's inevitable that your main unit will be grossly overpowered and everyone else will be new and inexperienced.Really, I would sum this game up by saying it's just not very good and be done with it. However, it's struck me right from the main menu that this is intended to be something like 3D, isometric Call of Duty for eight year olds. I don't really mean that in a condescending way, and this isn't really a game that I'd give and eight year old to play unless I was trying to explain military strategy of the Iraq war (run in with thousands of troops, shoot up locals, watch your troops die, and accomplish nothing yet make a lot of money). But really, the maturity level conveyed and depth from the game definitely makes me think ages 8 - 10 and lord knows I can think of better options than this for somebody's childhood.			"

If you enjoyed this review,consider giving it a thumbs up!Pros+Interesting shop itemsYou can buy a multitude of different items and soldiers from one of two shops. A before mission and during mission shop each with their own items. You can buy things from rockets and grenades all the way to reinforcements and different soldiers for use on the next mission.+GameplayThe game plays very well and you have a choice between using your mouse,a touchpad,or WASD to control your units.You can have up to 5(?) people in a squad but you control them as one cohesive unit.The enemies aren't the brightest but they certainly aren't braindead.+CollectablesIf you enjoy collectables then you will love this game.There is a multitude of collectables ranging from medals you can use to permanently upgrade your troopers to dogtags that give you extra currency you can exchange for different shop items.Cons-GraphicsOk,let's adress the obvious,the graphics.Technically,the graphics are not good at all but from an aesthetic point of view some may find the graphics cute or fun.The models aren't very good looking at all and most of them have more than enough rough edges.-ObjectivesEvery mission has an objective,be it kill target enemies,destroy target vehicle or building,ect.The objectives are pretty damn bland and there isn't exactly a whole lot of them at that. -Perma-DeathAlright this is something that really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. If one of your squadmembers dies in a mission they are dead for good. This wouldnt be a problem if the game didn't have missions where you end up pinned down or absolutely overwhelmed by enemies.I remember one mission where you had to hold a small area against enemies coming from four directions. They just kept on coming and ended up overwhelming us due to the little to no room I had to move around.If you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to join my Steam Curator Group at  Mudkips Gaming "

												Normally I don't like phone ports going on to Steam but this is one of the few exceptions. I bought the game on a whim as it was only 89 cents at the time and was surprisingly happy. The graphics style of the game is ""cute"" and the simple gameplay is quite addicting. I personally like how your units have a name and rank up as they battle through missions. You also can call in support in various ways and even shoot chickens! Another thing you can do is purchase bonuses for your men for the mission like armor, scopes, extra mags and more. If it is on sale I would get it as it is worth the few cents in order to buy it.R.I.P LCpl TommyYour death by a tank shell to the face will not be forgotten.			"

												This game wasn't for me. Luckily I got it on sale. Top-down cartoon war simulator. I very quickly lost interest and found it repetitive and boring, even after putting in about an hour of gameplay. I would not recommend this, even if it goes on sale.

												It's an easy simple game. Short but fun. The con is the baseprice and the replay-value.It's not worth €4.99, because it is really basic, just get it when the game is on sale.The zombie-mode felt like a mweh endless boredom. Sadly, there was no story behind the troopers either, but that's what you get for 4.99			"

												Pretty goofy and fairly relaxing game, definitely something I can see casual gamers enjoy. There is a bit of a puzzle aspect to it in some degree while completing missions through obtaining certain tools required and/or decide what to bring for the mission. But overall it has for me mostly been either a test of patience to take a mission in my own pace and attempt to beat it without any upgrades for more challenge while making sure every soldier stay alive, or grinding up some cash to buy all upgrades and try to stomp the missions head on.Once you figure out a few mechanics it's mostly played on ""autopilot"" (meaning: doesn't require much thinking at all) besides the occasional times you need certain tools and take certain routes to make it a bit easier for yourself. But even those can most of the time be dealt with straight on if you want to and understand the game mechanics well enough to use them for your advantage. It is far from a difficult game, and I only tried it on the hardest difficulty when trying to get a feel of what the game was like.In my personal opinion, this game could have been more optimized and they could have made several mechanics much smoother, but overall it is somehow pretty charming with its goofy graphics, sounds and silly comments here and there. It's not really a bad game, it just simply isn't made for me.I really don't think this is a game people should buy unless it is on sale or if they notice that the genre suit them too good to pass up on it. However, if you just want a relaxing way to kill time and it's on a big sale then who knows?On a sidenote: they should really fix the duplication glitch where you are able to bring two specialists to a mission. I found it by accident and realized it had a 100% chance to occur during certain circumstances. It really takes the fun out of the game when it happens... and the fact that you are able to do it really easy intentionally can probably make some people unable to avoid abusing it, which may ruin their experience with it.

												The controls make me want to kill myself. Their is no apparent storyline. The missions are linear and unoriginal. The in game money barely matters. The idea of squads was cool at first but then your squad dies over and over again as you fail time and time again, and a newer crappier squad is generated for you (your squad gains experience over time and ranks up). Normaly this would not be a problem if the missions werent so hard that you would die three time before finally completing one. The graphics feel like they just enlarged the graphics from my iPod touch and called them ""stunning"".			"

												Tiny Troopers is a casual third person shooter.  You control one or more trooper with the help of additional specially skilled troopers (i.e. medic, machine gunner, special ops, etc...) and the help of extra weapons such as grenades, rockets and air strikes.  The graphics are cartoony and really well done as they lend themselves well to the atmosphere of the game.  The sounds are really good with nice background noises, a nice touch.  There are 30 missions, obviously each getting tougher and three different difficulty levels.  Once you beat the game, you get the new ""plus"" edition which intensifies the game even more.  On the higher difficulties, this game surpasses the casual and becomes an intense action game.  The storyline is forgetable at best, but it's the fun action that makes this game fun to play.Also, a zombie mode was added later on for those that enjoy a good survival gamemode.  Definitely a game that I'd recommend playing, this was a fun one to play through.			"

												This is actually a decent top view action shooter. The gameplay is very similar to Foreign Legion: Buckets of Blood, but I found Tiny Troopers to be much more fun. During the short 3 chapter campaign, you accumulate points to spend on non-permanent upgrades including a specialist soldier. During the missions, you pickup usable items like grenades, RPGs, and air strikes. Then you collect medals to spend on permanent recruitment upgrades. Your characters gain experience as long as you keep them alive; if they die, you get new fresh troops. The game does lack controller support which would make the gameplay even better, but you can't go wrong for $2. Did I mention the endless zombie survival mode?			"

												I have been spoiled by the superior game play on iOS, because in many ways, the PC version lacks the polish and playability of the handheld version.Initial impression:Zombie mode - the screen moves around whne you move, making aiming much harder than it needs to be. Given it is a very small area you are fighting in, this is an artificial constraint built in.Campaign: Money is the lifeblood of the game, so when you run out of money, it's game over. So why the developers decided to slug you $50 every time you kill a chicken is beyond me. ARE YOU TRYING TO TAKE THE FUN OUT OF THE GAME ???Oh, more artificial contrainsts  - escorting NPC's means not deviating AT ALL, or they die. To add insult to injury, you lose $500.This makes sense in a game with IAP, to encourage players to buy more coin, but as there is none in this version, SO WHY ♥♥♥♥ING HAVE IT ?If your team gets killed - too bad. No replaying the mission, revives, nothing. So you make a mistake that wipes out your uber promoted soldier ? Too ♥♥♥♥ing bad. Yes, I know it is the same in the iOS version but does it *have* to be ? There are many things they could have done to make TT a much better game on PC, but instead it's just a cheap cash in with most of the fun cut out of it.Stick to the iPhone version - it's more fun, has more uniforms and gear. This feel like a cheap knock off.			"

												For its price tag this little game is great, it's just like cannon fodder except more zoomed in and animated.  The only downside to the game is that if you have 3 or more guys in your squad on hard difficulty, the trailing guy tends to die in the mission because of the ""snake"" movement of your team.  Still awesome little game, great for ""in betweeners"" like when I'm at work and just need a 15 minute timeout from coding.			"

The game is a great little top down shooter that you will keep coming back to but won't play for hrs at a time unless you really love this type of game .

												As many have said before though a few got the machine it 1st was seen on wrong. This is like the Original Cannon Fodder game that came out on the Commodore Amiga back  in 1993. Was a great game then and this is so similar it makes a good game now. Fully recommend if you are after a pass time game.For anyone who played the Original Cannon Fodder, Do you remember the main theme song and is there a link for it anywhere?			"

												Solid little game for 5 bucks. Two game modes, campaign, and zombie(at the bottom of the screen) and you can replay campaign missions from the mission tab.Campaign opens with a brief overview of the mission, followed by buying a loadout for that mission which includes 5 separate one time boosts that stack, 1 of 5 specialists, and permanent boosts that are bought with a secondary game currency(medals) found throughout the levels. When the mission starts you will likely want to buy map intel from the command menu so that you can see where the cheap ambushes are going to come from, because the fixed camera angle can lead to some cheap deaths. The perma death of your soldiers though is a nice touch(they always get replaced though), you can become very invested in keeping the little guys alive after a few missions.Zombie mode, single map, survive as long as you can, every 5 waves you can collect another soldier that will respawn(at their panel) after a bit, periodically you get air drops of grenades, rockets, airstrikes and med kits and the enemies drop coins which count towards your score, they disappear after a short while.Couple gripes, camera angle can lead to some cheap deaths as enemies will often shoot you from off screen before you see them, especially from below.One instance of falling off the map in the snow area which forced me to abort the mission, this lost all the boosts and the specialist I had bought, that irked me a bit.Overall a very fun game.

Wave 29 the second time around, so I feel like I get the way this game works and I think it is excellent. Spent only $1.24 on it, and it is one of the most fun and time killing games I have played in a while. It kills time in a good way, not with long loading screens (Ahem, Bethesda), not with long exposition (I'm sure there's some company out there), and it doesn't take too long to get the hang of it (Dark Souls).

												It is a nice game to relax - nothing more. I think, the game itself was ported from mobile devices. Not that this is something bad but you get what you expect. Missions are not hard, pretty repetative. The good thing you do not have to farm achievements a lot and if you get lucky - 6 hours is more than enough to compelte the game and get them all. Get it on sale and play to forget about the hard stuff)			"

Just as Cannon Fodder, when one of your men dies, he is replaced by a new lower ranked soldier. So it's a plus if you can keep your men alive so they rank up and get boosts to range, damage and health. And since they have names, you will be devastated when you move Col.

Two game modes, campaign, and zombie(at the bottom of the screen) and you can replay campaign missions from the mission tab.Campaign opens with a brief overview of the mission, followed by buying a loadout for that mission which includes 5 separate one time boosts that stack, 1 of 5 specialists, and permanent boosts that are bought with a secondary game currency(medals) found throughout the levels. When the mission starts you will likely want to buy map intel from the command menu so that you can see where the cheap ambushes are going to come from, because the fixed camera angle can lead to some cheap deaths. The perma death of your soldiers though is a nice touch(they always get replaced though), you can become very invested in keeping the little guys alive after a few missions.Zombie mode, single map, survive as long as you can, every 5 waves you can collect another soldier that will respawn(at their panel) after a bit, periodically you get air drops of grenades, rockets, airstrikes and med kits and the enemies drop coins which count towards your score, they disappear after a short while.Couple gripes, camera angle can lead to some cheap deaths as enemies will often shoot you from off screen before you see them, especially from below.One instance of falling off the map in the snow area which forced me to abort the mission, this lost all the boosts and the specialist I had bought, that irked me a bit.Overall a very fun game.

												Yeah yeah, I know, not even an hour of play yet, BUT, I feel like I get the gist of this game.I love how easy it is to learn, I like how fun and fast paced it is, I started off with the zombies mode, because ZOMBIES! and did pretty well. Wave 29 the second time around, so I feel like I get the way this game works and I think it is excellent. Spent only $1.24 on it, and it is one of the most fun and time killing games I have played in a while. It kills time in a good way, not with long loading screens (Ahem, Bethesda), not with long exposition (I'm sure there's some company out there), and it doesn't take too long to get the hang of it (Dark Souls).

												It is a nice game to relax - nothing more. I think, the game itself was ported from mobile devices. Not that this is something bad but you get what you expect. Missions are not hard, pretty repetative. The good thing you do not have to farm achievements a lot and if you get lucky - 6 hours is more than enough to compelte the game and get them all. Get it on sale and play to forget about the hard stuff)			"

												Another port to PC with no care for quality. This game might be fun on a mobile device w/ a touch screen, but using a KB + Mouse, it's just frustrating and boring. The game basically teaches you how to be an inept tactician by encouraging you to exploit dumb AI. Just get behind a corner, fire a shot and wait for the enemy to run into your ambush. Yeah, it's about as entertaining as watching snails race.Pros:-It's pretty!Cons:-Enemies shoot you from off-screen-Perma-death - seriously? (Troops can be shot by enemies that are off-screen, and you have perma-death?)-Movement is horrible-The targeting is horrible-No controller support-Controls are frustrating-Constrained camera-Dumb AI (Just imagine Lemmings w/ guns)Luckily, I only wasted a dollar on it.

												This isn't really that good.  Most of the features are poorly implemented.  The only thing that is remotely worthwhile is the shooting part of the game, which is maybe 6/10.My biggest gripe is that you need to control all of your soldiers in a brainless snake-like chain.  Why?  This is not how soldiers would behave in a hail of gunfire.  I couldn't even bring myself to finish the game.It does just enough right but only barely.  Buy it only on sale.  Again, hesitant thumbs up ONLY if the game is on 80% discount or more.			"

												More like Cannon Fodder than Cannon Fodder 3! When your squad members die, they die so there is no reload from last state and start again. So if you have Staff sergeant in your squad, keep him alive if you can! Good game, just that for more efficient combat, it would need aswd movement. Right now you just point and click while you shoot. This leads to casualties and makes higher difficulty settings not fun to play at all. Developers should add aswd movement option for the PC, even though this is originally made for some handheld devices.			"

												Experience the horrors of war, but on a more adorable level.  Tiny Troopers is a squad action game where you control a small unit of presumbably American troops in a presumbably Middle Eastern part of the world.  You can equip your squad between missions and hire extra specialist units depending on the mission. Your controls are the keyboard and mouse in a top down view where your cursor indicates the direction your troops are pointed and will fire.  A refreshing change from all of the Medal of Honor / Call of Duty Clones out there.			"

												Now that this game is getting a bit of publicity I figured I'd rewrite my previous 5 second review from almost a year ago into something a bit more informative.To start off I hate to writing a bad review's about games in general, but in all honesty I would not reccomend this game. It does what it says it does and can be actually a lot of fun for the first few minutes, the problem is it gets old quickly and feels more like a free flash game than something you'd normally buy on steam. It doesn't hold much replay value and after about an hour you've seen all the game has to offer. I wouldn't say it's terrible by any means it's just insanely repetitive, with that said, there are hundreds of other games on steam that are absolutely amazing that I would reccomend in a heart beat, even at a lower price range. In the end its just personal preference, but IMO, I would reccomend spending your money elsewhere.			"

												it's simple, it's fun, it can be horribly chalenging if you play only with mouse, and you are more vurnerable with a full squad than with 1 or 2 guys... cause from the 3rd to 5th WILL get shot farily often cause the squad moves in a snake order, wich means the further back, the later you move, the later you move the easier it is to get shot by the bullets the first 2 managed to dodge fairly easily.but the bottom line, very fun, zombie mod is in a smal area with 5 smaller areas all conected forming the whole zone... the amount of times you will get in a tight spot is quite amazing... sure the shots go trough and hit the ones in the back... but you WILL get locked down on a tight spot...on yes you will!good game, not an exagerate price, got it at 75% sale so even better			"

												Tiny Troopers puts you in command of a team of small soldiers. Guide them through 30 deadly missions with varied objectives: destroy enemy armoured formations, save hostages and eliminate enemy generals, to name but just a few. Your troopers will face enemy infantry, snipers, technicals and even tanks. The casualty rate is going to be high but there’s an endless supply of fresh recruits to step up and fill the ranks. Those lucky troopers who survive from mission to mission will be promoted, and each new stripe they gain makes them tougher. To increase your troopers’ chances of survival, use Command Points to give them better equipment, reinforce their team with a specialist like machine gunner, medic or delta force and call in support drops during missions. War might be hell but this is the funniest way to fight in one!			"

A few months later, I got lung cancer. Doctors said that it was not from smoking, its not inherited etc. It was from this game. This game will make me die, since i wanted to. And my wish became true.			"

												A fun little game that would keep you occupied for a few hours. Sound is good and the graphics are OK. There are 30 missions to complete and a zombie survival mode for undead fans. I recommend to buy this game, but only when on sale.			"

												Pretty simple and enjoyable game!I really like this game for its simplicity and straightforward missions and tacticts needed for finnishing missions. One thing that could be improved. The hitbox is somewhat small and the shots that should've hit didn't touch the enemy at all. The zombie mode is my favorite, it's very addicting and fun!			"

												I recomend this game at any price! This is my go to game when I just want to have some crazy relaxing fun. The perma death that happens to your troops is very interesting acpect of this game. Graphics are super fun and really good as well as for the game mechanics.			"

												Tiny Troopers is a Cannon Fodder clone.The original Cannon Fodder's roots were a satircal play on the pointlessness of war. It was fun, but also brutal at times. You cared about the soldiers you leveled up and felt sad when they died. It was (is) a video game classic.Tiny Troopers lacks the original's humility, irony, satire, level design, strategic thinking and artistic variation. It also misses a few key features from the original (splitting troops, vehicles, hidden mines, graveyard) BUT it's quite a fun clone to play, so I'm recommending it if you get it on sale.			"

												Should have named it Kerbal Security Militia .   The Game is freaking FUN FUN FUN.. Their Zombie map is as fun as♥♥♥♥♥♥o' Dukey.Needs more zombie maps.Needs to be scrip[ted where you can move while firing.It does get your blood pressure up though..  Yes you can pause it.. intermission should be added along side a CO-opA 3-4 man Co-op  would and weapon purcahces or custom configs purchases  needs to be concidered.FEW games get my approval... But not only does the game have great potential.. as is... still way worth 5 bucks.I always say to back STARCITIZEN engine to revolitionise gaming industry first...     BUT this is a neet little gem. horizonrangers.teamspeak3.com    If any mature peeps out there not scared to make friends. Drop by .   horizonrangers.teamspeak3.com "

												Reminds me a lot of Cannon Fodder.The gameplay is simply and somewhat addictive.It's good to play even if you only have 5 - 10 minutes for a quick playthrough, that's usually enough for one mission.I'm not usually into cartoon graphics but they work really nice here.			"

												""OH MY GOD! They killed Kenny!""""You b@stards!!""If you hated Cannon Fodder 3 but liked the style, this game might be for you. I personally give it an 8/10, well worth $5 or less, especially considering that other games sell for what they claim is so much more. (I'm looking at you, No Man's Sky. You need to seriously un-f!ck yourself, and the best way you can start is with the price tag.)			"

												Funny game from few years ago, first time played on PS3 and was really nice. So time to replay a bit just to remember the old times.The campaing mode is good, gameplay is a bit poor but well is a game without any science :P			"
