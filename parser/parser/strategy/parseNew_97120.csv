												If you're a fan of RTS games this one is a doozy.  It is a nice break from the regular population limit and generating resources model and instead you create companies and use cities to generate + or - levels of a resource.  Companies and outposts cost resource levels and if you go negative you lose gold over time.  With the addition of heroes and leveling and varied units it's certainly worth your time.			"

												KAG is my favorite RTS.  I've been playing it since it came out in 2001 and only recently downloaded the Steam version to connect with friends who had lost their CDs (I have one signed by the devs... I know, I'm a KAG geek).  It has some of the most dynamic AI and gameplay of its day, and games never feel old to me no matter how many times I play them.  I really enjoy the company dynamics, the presence of techs, and the way you can create your own units, maps, and AIs to customize the game to your taste (look up KMod if you're interested).   In fact, my partner and I have created 7 epic campaigns that we play all the time, each featuring different Kohan and types of challenges.   Tinkering with AIs is also great fun (look for The Awakening fan site to download tons).Anyway, I recommend KAG if you like retro games and want to try something different.  Have fun!			"

												An amazing unrecognized innovation in the rts/grand strategy genre. Part of a golden age of the last generation of pc strategy games when the 2d formula had been refined refined and innovation was the order of the day. For some unfortunate reason these wonderful games had mixed results in the next generation, think Stronghold, Empire Earth, Kohan 2, etc.Simplified but good resource and city management, very refined squad level controls with a fully functional experience, moral, and terrain system. Enough rpg elements to make things customizable but not too involved or important to distract you from the larger strategic picture. Wonderful classic pc fantasy style graphics. One of the features that still impresses me about this game today is that you can play on huge maps with tons of other players on a robust random map generator, this makes almost every game feel unique. Lots of factions and ways to play the game, if you are enjoy strategy games at all, pick this one up.			"

												What is it about this game that makes it so good?  The random maps?  The squad-based controls?  The RPG elements?  The city-building component?  Micromanagement that's fun and not overwhelming?  Good co-op play?I'm not sure.  But I can't get enough of it.			"

												I just love this game. I've never actually written anything on a game before. This game makes me want to do so.It's cheap and amazing. The fact that the graphics are a little old doesn't deter me at all.Do I wish they were better? Yes.Is it far less important than the amazing game play? Yes.LAN games of this make me very happy.			"

												I recommend this with a proviso. It was a great game when it came out Lo These Many Years Ago, and it's still a great game and a wonderful piece of design. There also isn't really a modern equivalent which does the same things. However, on Win8 (and possibly other moderns OSs) it's quite glitchy and suffers from strange slowdowns which make it, if not unplayable, rather less fun than it could be. So, modern buyers beware.

												I have HUNDREDS of hours before this came to steam, so dont look at my hours on record.  This is one of the best most overlooked RTS games every to come out. it is VASTLY superior to the socalled KohanII.The RTS game has simplistic city management, where you have 'cities on the map' that have slots for buildings that you build, but you do not have to micromanage where they go etc... they are 'in the city' they give you benefits like being able to recruit better units or resources, etc.Resource management is also unique, although it is technically divided up into Wood, Stones, Iron, and Magic Khaldunite, each have a monetary value and will be imported when they are lacking.  so gold is the only real 'resource'.  It updates per second, based on your income.  If you want to build spearmen troops, each unit squad within the unit will take one of the wood for example, so if you have 5 wood produced, you cn make a 5 spearman unit with no penalty, if you make 6 in there, then it will cost you some of your gold income every second to 'supply' the extra wood, etc.Comabt is also EXCELLENT, the units each can take damage, but also have a unit morale.  Once their zone of control overlapps an enemy unit, they will engage, sending frontline units up while rear units will bring up the rear with raged attacks of possible or charge in secondly if not.  The only order you can give it when to retreat and where to retreat to (or to rout, where they flee willy nilly) if they get broken morale, they will flee without the order.  you have to return them to friendly supply zones for them to restore their combat effectiveness.  Terrain matters, formations matter, Defensive outposts can provide extra garrison and supply zones... special squads can be added to units to change how they fight... The single player campaign is honestly mediocre, but the multiplayer and battles in this game are still some of the best I've ever played and that's over 12 years since it's been released.I can't recommend this enough.

												Kohan was one of the best online strategy games I had played with a great group of players who enjoyed each others company. I was part of a clan called HC, not the biggest but we had a great time giving the veteran players a run for their money ^.^. Still play it from time to time so anyone who does and remembers the HC clan feel free to add me on steam			"

												A game that was released back in 2001, yet still has people going back to play (in fact, there is still a small but active MP community which still plays this game!)That alone says how good of an RTS it is.In fact, it amazes me that no RTS has been released since that combines what Kohan does (although the Dawn of War series comes close, it was a lot more about micromanaging battes and how fast you can click to activate special abilities).Key concepts:- city management, and the cities generate all your resources- company based combat structure, where companies can heal back to full health over time (as long as even 1 unit survives and returns to your bases).- companies and heroes both level up and become more powerful and stronger- once units enter combat, you not longer have control of the unit (barring retreat and rout).  This severely reduces the effect of ""microing"" (clicking like a madman).  It also makes battle tactics like flanking to kill enemy support units much deadlier.If there's one con to this game, it's that it has a default resolution and doesn't support widescreen (stretches out the images, making them look ugly).

												To me this game was as clear and ingenious as games could be. 15 Years past and there's still no other game (or rather RTS) that could compete with this gem. I think it created itself a category, that still have lots of vacant seats. At least I haven't seen that many decent ""contestants"" to bring similar formula to this level of play. Even direct sequel couldn't get near enough! What else here to say...			"

												I wanted to play an old classic but this is not what it seems. I simply cannot get the game to work on my monitor. The resolution requriments are so off-the wall that I can no longer run the game anywhere above 3 frames per second. It's unplayable for me. Be careful if you are looking to buy this game on anything at or above windows 7. This game is best played on windows xp or an older operating system. Now I am sad.			"

												Amazing old game - but difficult to get multiplayer / windows 10 to run smoothly...... Best fix I have seen is in the forum, whereby you add some WINE dlls to get win 10 running - multiplayer requires some additional effort (LAN only works for me)Bottom line - if you have an older PC and just want to play solo - give the game a shot on sale - well worth it, I have probably hundreds of hours on this game before it even made it to Steam. If you want to play Multiplayer or have Windows 10 - it's probably better to find an old Command & Conqueor as they will be easier to setup & play with others.			"

												A truly great RTS game with a macro-scale focus. Units are grouped into companies which must be carefully crafted, can be lead by a hero, and will stay with you throughout the game, gaining experience and so forth. Smart design calls such as stationary units gain a defensive advantage if they stay in the same spot over a long period of time, as well as the retreat/rout/morale system and zone of control means that positioning is very important in Kohan. Additionally, terrain plays a huge role, as different terrains have very large effects on combat and movement, and natural chokepoints are crucial to hold for similar reasons.Cities are condensed into single buildings, which house a number of 'component slots' that are filled by buildings, and again the design forces careful economic planning, for instance focusing on gold income for the long-run or pumping out valuable resources such as iron to fuel a war effort. Resources in the game are not cumulative besides gold-- meaning that you are rarely encouraged to sit back and do nothing in the game. The game also comes with several large campaigns, a random map generator, a custom scenario editor, fairly competent AI (with the ability to make your own / download them online), and extensive modding tools. There are a huge number of heroes, secret technologies and monsters to keep the game fresh game after game after game. Besides this glowing review, I would point out two flaws:1. A faltering online community. The game is old, and few people play anymore.2. The game is somewhat unbalanced. While the game is usually tight, there are a few degenerate situations, and on very large maps the game is very unbalanced. However, you can play on very small maps to fix that, and much of the game imbalance can be addressed via modding; personally, I advise a mod which increases the gold penalties for going negative with your resources, as well as making resources scarcer.Still, it is a game worth playing, and better than its successor. I hope we see a worthy sequel someday.			"

												Simply, one of the best RTS games by even today's standards.  Recently played on-line for over 4 hours with zero issues. If you are a fan of ""thinking"" RTS games where strategical decisions are as impotant as the tactical ones, then this game offers it all. The AI is superb & can be tweaked to your liking via text files for an endless supply of all types of playing styles.The multiple victory conditions, outstanding RMG, excellent UI, wonderfully stable game play, excellent end game stat screen, a video file to watch your/other's replays, modding is possible, etc, etc. This game was done right.
