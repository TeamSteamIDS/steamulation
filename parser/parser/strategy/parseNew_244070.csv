												Bland, limited & repetitive gameplay is what you can expect from Sid's Ace Patrol. I really tried to enjoy this (I put in the time!), but it has none of the 'one-more-turn' addictiveness of his other games.So why is it so bad you ask?Each map looks almost identical, graphics look like direct port from mobile platform, the mission types you can count on one hand & the game itself is very short covering 24 missions across 4 campaigns. They can go quick too! You do not feel there is any progression as you go through as the game centres around your score; having little in the way of feeling like you are winning a war. There is no territory to defend or conquer instead you choose from 3 random missions then up to 4 pilots to progress through each level. Pilot & plane upgrades are rewarded as you proceed through your game, but only really make it easier to win & that isn't really a strong point when the 'Legend' difficulty is not really very challenging. Legend (besides boosting your score) just makes it more frustrating than anything else since the opposing pilots get big stats boosts making it take a painfully long time to shoot them down yet much easier for you to be shot down.Tactically you will find many dogfights are reduced to both of you flying around in circles for multiple moves until the AI decides to fly out giving you an opening to attack. You can try different tactics but it always comes back to 'circling' from my experience. Once you get behind someone it is very hard for them to get away (unless they're an Ace pilot), and likewise when the roles are reversed. It makes the first few turns of your engagment most important, but then very predictable after that. To add to this, I also couldn't play this on my old PC with ATI graphics as it wouldn't render the display, showing all white, so I have only been able to play recently since I got my new PC with NVidia graphics.All said & done, I can't help but to ask myself why Sid would put his name on such a sub-par game, let alone make a sequel! Also milking it further by charging almost twice as much locally in AU @ $8.99 instead of US @ $4.99 (still well overpriced for what you get if you ask me).Very disappointing! :(If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!

												Back in the day, Ace of Aces was a book-based air combat game. Each player would select an aerial maneuver in an attempt to gain a positional advantage over their opponent. Based on the comparison of the maneuvers chosen, each player would be directed to turn to a page in their book that gave the view from their cockpit and another series of maneuvers from which to chosen. Sid Meier's Ace Patrol uses the power of the personal computer to do the same thing.Sid Meier's Ace Patrol is a simple one or two player game simulating air combat in World War I. The game avoids the immersive experience of a first-person flight simulator and the more complex physics that the experience brings. Instead, the game uses a hexagon based movement system with a view of action from the side, much like a board game. Flight physics is simplified by giving the player a selection of ""legal"" maneuvers so you don't have to worry about pushing your pilot or aircraft beyond its limits. Airspeed doesn't play a factor in the game and altitude is generalize to one of four levels (well, five if you count the ground). It was very easy to learn the game's mechanics despite the lack of documentation. There is a tutorial and hints are displayed at the beginning of each scenario.The game itself is set up in a campaign style. The player selects one of four nationalities (British, American, French or German) and a special skill for one of their pilots. During the game, players manage a squadron of four pilots, selecting skill upgrades as pilots increase in experience and aircraft upgrades as the squadron completes missions. The player has the option of switching aircraft types for each pilot between missions. Aircraft have five characteristics that they are rated from one to five to allow players a general understanding of each type's performance against other aircraft.Covering the years between 1916 and 1918, the player's squadron participates in four campaigns with six battles each. Each battle presents the player with 1 to 3 different missions with varying degrees of difficulty and reward. Missions are performed either over friendly territory or enemy territory. The location of the mission will determine what side of the map the objective is on. Landing behind enemy lines will result in your pilot being captured as a prisoner of war and unavailable for the remainder of the campaign. Crash landing in friendly territory will result in injuries that will keep the pilot out of battle for a number of missions. Missions available are randomly selected with the exception of the final battle which appears to always be a ""boss fight"" against an enemy zeppelin and its fighter escort.I found the game to be a highly enjoyable simulation of air combat with a small element of asset management. Missions are short and the entire game can be completed within few hours. The randomization of missions for each battle provides extended replayability. Sid Meier’s Ace Patrol is a simple game with a simple interface that is a delight to play.			"

												This little gem is actually quite intereresting. Made for smart phones and Tablets originally but ported to the PC and beamed into our collective HD using the magic that is STEAM Ace Patrol is about two things. Biplane Hex Combat and more importantly fun.Gameplay is basically this. You pick a nation (UK, France, Imperial Germany or America!)  and each nation has a selecton of randomly generated pilots with aeroplanes of the era and you dogfight the enemy using a turn based hex combat system. Your squadron can have up to four Pilots who fly a series of randomly generated missions over four different offensives against NPC pilots who like your own can be captured or forced temporary out of the war to repair their damaged crates. Both friendly and enemy squadron Pilots unlock RPG-esqe skills, upgrades for their planes and learn special manauvers that give them the upper hand in combat. Oh and as the offensive progresses so does air technology for both sides. You might be flying easy one moment and then the enemy has a fancier crate with another set of wings and a bigger gun to keep you on your toes!Combat itself is pretty simple, get a good shot under or behind the enemy plane whilst not exposing yourself to the dangers of their wingmans guns or AA gun fire. You are graded with a score system that is tied to the general STEAM achivements and online leaderboard for said game. To increase the score obviously you'll have to ratchet up the difficulty level (or be lucky enough to get a Pilot with the DOUBLE SCORE ability).The other feature to keep you playing again is once you complete a Offensive with a certain nation the first time you unlock famous WW1 Ace Pilots with their own biplane livery schemes.Bugs wise I've only encountered one and that sometimes you have some trouble clicking on a hex, this gets really fiddly when your Pilot has a million manuvers and you really don't want to select the FORCE LANDING one. I expect this is to do with it being more of a Tablet game really. Also, some of the art assets are slightly bland (Don't get excited about seeing the Offensive Victory screen more than once)  despite the fact they did their best locked more or less in a single location.Is it worth buying though? sure, why not if you want a addictive but slighty short turn based aeroplane game . But for the best value get it in a Sale and make sure you pick up the rather decent WW2 Pacific Campaign sequal at the same time.			"

												I bought this game right when it was released, but I suppose I forgot about it for a while, while I had plenty of other games to play. Two months have passed, and today I finally realized it was time I tried it.... and damn! It's actually a fun game!Having Sid Meier's name in the title, I expected this game to be heavy, super-deep and difficult to learn, kinda like Civilization, but it's actually pretty simple, intuitive and easy to get into. I've only been playing for a few hours, and while I'm sure the more advanced missions and the harder difficulty levels can make the game very challenging and complex, it's very begginer-friendly on 'easy mode', so I'm quite happy that for once, I put my ego aside and started with the lowest difficulty level (I usually choose ""Normal"" or whatever the medium difficulty level is called).Ugh, not sure how to summarize this, so I'll just go grab something to eat. C'ya. :P			"

												Ace Patrol feels like a port of a mobile game with no challenge. In a mere hour, I blew through half of the missions. You get to see the mission grid, much like other mobile games. You get four pilots / planes and pilot them on missions. Mostly blow up other planes. Sometimes, blow up tanks or zeplins. The game is turn based and played out on a hexigrid with each plane getting a certain amount of spaces based on their speed or altitude.As you progress mission after mission, your planes / pilots will level up and gain skills you can chose from. You will also unlock upgrades to equip to your 4 planes. These skills feel useless and very subtle. You don't need the skills or upgrades before you get them. Never once did I feel like now that upgrade will totally help me do better.This is just a very dull game. The maps look identical. The only real thing you even need to concern yourself with each map is enemy territory that will shoot you down, but enemy territory is so sparse, that you'll barely run into it. Plus its easy to avoid. The only way to hide from an enemy is hang out in clouds, but since you operate planes, you cannot really stay in clouds since you'll always be moving.Avoid this game. Maybe on a phone it would be more fun to kill a bit of time with, but on PC, its just too easy to blow through.			"

												Ace Patrol is a turn-based air combat game. If you've ever played a civilization game in your life you will instantly recognize the hex grid across which you direct your squadron. There are some really neat concepts here; each pilot has their own flight competencies which enable them to take increasingly more aggressive maneuvers. As you navigate the battlefield you must take into account all of the factors one normally would in a flight combat simulator. From the angle of attack and altitude all the way to the direction you’re currently banking, every aspect affects the options you have for your next turn.It’s a neat game, but I would love to see it brought back with more graphical polish and a more robust tutorial. During my time playing, everything felt very disjointed and fragmented. It’s not a bad little strategy game, but doesn't feel fully realized.			"

												Great early game but as you progress on and have some 30 missions under your belt then you will really start to wonder why you play this game. Achievements? no way unless you really like to grind. Tactics? yes sure i guess. you have a lot of moves available at this time and you use them constantly. Quite bland and does not contain the 'one more mission' -bait. I suppose this can be recommended with caveats. Know what you buy when you fork over cash for this. 6/10.  "

												While it might be a great mobile title (like  Steambirds [www.steambirds.com] and Flight Control) it's a very poor desktop PC game for a host of reasons:- it's a hurried exact port, with an engine resembling Flash, carrying very odd problems like complete broken graphics if i'm running Fraps or EVGA software, flickering menus if Winamp's running in brackground.- gameplay cluttered with buttons and the dogfighting planes on the neighbouring hexes, making very difficult space orientation, and moving the camera (3D) doesnt help much since it's very unsmooth (feels like 10fps)Basically a great concept from Sid, but the the monkeys who ported it for PC weren't fed.

												8.5/10 great little casual.Don't be thrown by the ""Sid Meier's"" part. This is a game that you can pick up and run with in a coffee break, but will still draw you in for the long sessions. Originally made for mobile devices, it's short sweet and simple. this is reflected in the price, so it's easy to buy with no regrets. The Graphics aren't amazing, but they don't leave your eyes bleeding. Things kinda look like the things they should look like, and the style reminded me of ""WINGS"" waaay back in my Amiga days. The controls are fairly straightforward, and the icons make it obvious. (a twisty arrow beside you means ""roll this way"" an arrow curling upwards means ""Climb"" etc) so there is no need for a long training mission, just enough to check you can click and tell how to shoot the enemy. The different factions and their planes are given special commands or abilities which fit in without intruding (some turn faster, some have better guns, etc) If you see it on sale, remember that you can download it faster than you read this review. I guarantee it'll make a train journey fly past, (especially in 2-player hotseat mode) or make a nice break between ""serious"" games on your rig at home.			"

												There's no getting past the fact that it's a port from a mobile device, but it's still a fun game.I love the turn-based aerial combat, and while the missions aren't exactly ground-breaking, they are quite a bit of fun.  You have to think ahead a bit and try to anticipate your enemy, as well as manage your objective, which isn't always just ""kill all the bad guys"".Unfortunately, and this is a big unfortunately, the game crashes. A lot.It crashes at the end of a mission, which is about the worst place possible. It will let you play through the whole mission, and when you've won (or lost) it will just crash to desktop, and you have to reload and start that mission again. And then it might crash again anyway.It was crashing around every second mission or so.I enjoy this game. I think it's great fun... but I cannot recommend it, purely because the constant crashing ruins it. On the strength of this, I've had to regretfully request a refund.			"

												This Game is Great! It's like the Panzer Corps of the sky (although with less pieces and less missions). Its a lot of fun and it never really gets old as you will always be competing to get the best pilots possible! Ever seen the Blue Max? Now you can fight to win Germany's highest aviation medal in this game! The war develops and so do your planes. Ace Patrol Pacific sky's I also highly recommend because its more missions and more planes! Plus there are acutally battles where your planes keep damage points until the battle finishes, so you have to be careful. I hope they continue this game series because its really fun! Need to enterain yourself for a few minutes? Then this game is perfect! It's got hotseat to so you can battle against your brother, sister and your friends! But wait what about all those bad reviews saying that this game has lots of glitches and every mission is the same? Thats not remotely true in my opinion. I've never had a single error and I doubt the majority of players do. None of my friends have had those problems either. The game is extremely simple and its fun to play. You can pick it up in ten minutes and be an expert player in a day! Wont it get really old then real soon? No, it wont! You can adjust the difficulty and it actually changes the way you have to play the game. Shure, that applies to almost every game with difficulty settings. You can also change your nation and each nation dosent play the same. I've found Germany and the United States to have the hardest campaigns. France and Britian get pretty good planes early, the Germans too, but in most missions the odds are stacked against the Germans. The United States has a troublesome time getting the good balanced planes that players crave (the triplane has more guns but it goes down in flames a lot)Anyway, I want you to ask yourself (if your considering gettting this game). Is it worth it? Based on this description, does it captivate my attention? If yes, then look no further. If no, you should probably whatch some gameplay, and if thats not enough, then try to see if you have a friend who will let you play for a while. Its a great game, almost like an animated board game at times, and I've had a great time playing it so far!			"

												Ace Patrol can be best described as an WW1 air combat board game that are PERFECTLY adapted to the computer world. All the complex stuff is done by the computer. Your job is simply to choose the best moves that will bring you victory, by best utilitizing the capabilities of your men (and ahistorically, women) and your machines. That is tactical command done right. You take command of a squadron of planes belonging to one of the four nations in WW1: US, Germany, UK, or France, and you choose four pilots. As your pilots gain kills, their skills will grow, giving them a wider repertoire of moves, as well as special ability, such as ability to escape from enemy prison, bonus damage when firing long-range, and so on. The planes appear at historical times, which gives temporary advantage to one nation or another as technologies advance. Some planes have certain special capabilities that should be exploited, such as fast climb, high altitude capability, and so on. The actual tactical maneuvers are your basic turns, climbs, dives, and so on. However, later advanced maneuvers such as ""falling leaf"" makes the plane impossible to target (or limiting damage by enemy gun pass), or gives you greater turn rate, allowing you to target or dodge more effectively. The game is turn-based, which means one plane move at a time, all of yours, then all of theirs. All the ""legal"" moves are shown on the ground using blue icons, with green icons showing moves that will allow you to shoot at enemy planes. The one that does the most damage is the green icon with the green cross-hairs. However, it is NOT always the right move, as it may not get you away from a pursuing enemy, or let you line up for a subsequent attack on a different target. The missions will often involve objectives such as bomber escort, ground attack, recon, and more. It is not just dogfights, although that's a lot of the game. Other factors that affect your air battles include cloud cover (diving into clouds to get away from enemies, but also reduces your maneuver choices) and ground anti-air guns (both enemy and friendly) which you can often expoit to your own advantage on your side of the border. The campaign is a series of missions that you can choose from a list offered. All in all, Ace Patrol is a fun little game that is surprising deep once you learn the intricasies, and at this cheap price (I paid a lot more when I first bought it) it's a must have. Each battle is only a few minutes long so save and enjoy it in small doses.			"

												This game isn't quite as complex as some of Sid Meier's other titles, but it is surprisingly engaging and fun. The farily simple controls (steer plane forward, dive, bank, and later on, ace maneuvers) mixed with the variety of game mechanics (choosing appropriate planes, upgrades, pilots, etc. for the mission(s) at hand) allow for a huge replay value, and interesting and fun gameplay. I have only played the game through once, as France, but I plan to beat it again at least once as every different country, and see the new options that come with fighting for a different side. I would reccomend this game to anyone who liked the Civilization games, or similarly structured games, but wants a slightly faster and lighter game.			"

												Sid Meier's Ace Patrol is a fun, although highly unrealistic at times, turn-based strategy game set during The Great War (aka World War I). How much you enjoy it, however, depends on several factors, all of which shall be discussed in this review.The first thing many gamers on Steam will notice is that the graphics aren't particularly high-res and the options menu within the game is severely limited. You can't even set the game's resolution and as far as I can tell, there's no anti-aliasing at all.The reason for this is because SMAP was originally an iOS title.What's the difference between the iOS app and the PC game? The mobile game is free, but requires that you pay for additional content. The PC version demands payment up front, but there no additional fees, optional or otherwise. The iOS version also uses a touch-screen interface as well, while the PC uses the mouse.The game's audio is quite nice, especially the sound effects. Whenever you move one of your planes you hear the associated propeller-driven engine noise. It even changes depending on damage or what maneuver you're attempting to pull off. The music fits the game, although I turned it off. This wasn't because it was bad, but because I generally dislike background music in games. Unfortunately, your pilots' voices (the few times they speak) are sometimes weird or just plain buggy. One of my German pilots had a voice that sounded like someone had slowed down an old tape recording. It was amusing, but somewhat creepy at the same time.The gameplay is standard turn-based fare, with some RPG elements tossed in. While in combat, your planes move over a hex-based battlefield, and have to keep an eye on their location. If they pass over an enemy base, for instance, anti-aircraft guns will fire at them. Fly into the clouds and you'll have temporary cover. Your position also determines when you can fire at the enemy and how much damage you can potentially do. Attacking an enemy from a higher altitude generally inflicts more damage on them, just as lining up shots while on their tail. Likewise, trying to attack an enemy while head-on or from a lower altitude does less damage and exposes you to return fire.The RPG elements come into play by leveling up your pilots. They can gain rank and medals, including ace status. If you win missions and have less than 50% damage on any pilot, you gain a bonus that can be applied to any pilot. These bonuses improve weapons, flying, and armor. After a certain number of kills, each pilot gains a callsign, which denotes a  special ability, some of which are offensive and other defensive. Examples of offensive callsigns include ""Deadeye"" (long-range attack and better accuracy) or ""Executioner"" (potential to kill enemy during first attack) while some defensive callsigns are ""Lucky"" (anti-aircraft guns do no damage to you) or ""Grease Monkey"" (repairs plane faster). Each airplane also has its own stats, which gauge its speed, maneuverability, climbing rate, diving rate and hit points. Some planes have extra features, like a rear gunner or a machine gun mounted on the top of aircraft itself. These features let you shoot behind or up above you, when normally you could only shoot straight ahead. If one of your pilots is shot down behind enemy lines, he'll be captured and become a prisoner of war. All prisoners are automatically exchanged every Christmas, although its possible for a pilot to escape. If your pilot was shot down within friendly territory, he'll be sent to the hospital and have to heal up before flying again. Finishing the mission with a severely damaged plane also necessitates repairs, which temporarily removes your pilot from active duty.At the beginning of this review, I also noted that SMAP is unrealistic at times. How so? Well, for starters, you can play as one of four nations when playing a new game: American, British, French, and German. The problem with this is the campaign always begins in 1916, one year before the United States entered the war. In addition, there are active-duty female combat pilots, when there were none at this time (or at least, none officially part of those four nations' armed forces). No pilots ever die, either. They can be captured or wounded, but that's it.Of a somewhat more minor nitpick in regards to realism, the ranking structure makes no sense at all, and fails to take into account each nation's differing ranks and language. I know this doesn't really make a difference in the game as rank is meaningless and imparts no benefits of any sort, but it's still annoying if you know better.So... would I recommend this game? Yes, but only if you really like turn-based strategy, and the military and history inaccuracies won't drive you up the wall.			"

												This is a nice game for breaks but nothing like all other Sid Meier games. The gameplay is very repetitive, but at least refreshing new in the begining. Altough turn based, the planes can only be moved in dependence of the last movement. So you can't fly forward and turn 180° in the next turn unless you pilot learned the Split-S or Immelman Turn. Also the planes behave differently, some are more manouverable, others faster. So you can get a few hours of entertainment out of this game, but don't expect anything like Civ (gametime spent wise).			"

												It's a good game prototype or concept, and even if it's not the case, that's how it looks like and how i feel playing it. However, i can recommend this game because even that way you can enjoy it a lot like me, and the asked price is very low, mostly if compared to other games from the same developer and/or publisher.You start choosing the German or one of the three allied nations from WWI: British, French or American - each one with an specific perk and different planes to fly. Then you choose from a variety of missions to run - like Ace vs Ace, escort, bombardment and defense missions, to cite some - leveling your pilots and granting upgrades and new maneuver trees to use with them in the turn-based hex field.Ace Patrol have a lot of resources, but they are just concepts of a potentially deep bad♥♥♥♥♥strategy game. At the actual stage you must face it more like a casual than a strategy game, and may experience some frustration at realizing that not a polished, not even finished game as it is.You can finish a campaign on easy difficult in about 2 hours, but the achievements are really exciting to pursue, and the gameplay although simple and glitched is very engaging and funny.

												     Sid Meier's Ace Patrol is the first of two Ace Patrol games (the second being Pacific Skies), and is, to me at least, the better of the two games. To sum it up, Ace Patrol is a light strategy game where players control a 4 man squadron on the Western Front during the First World War. It's not a bad game, but it has it's quirks. Here's the details:     Graphics - The first thing players see, and what gives the biggest impression because of it. Graphically speaking, the game is either sort of cool or really ugly depending on your preference. A lot of people say the graphics look like a Android ported game, and, from what I understand, it's because it is an Android port. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the game is more about tatics and strategy than graphics. I think the cartoon esque graphics are fine, and they seem to fit the game, even if they are somewhat glitchy at times.Rating: 3/5     Gameplay - Gameplay is fairly good. I find myself having that one more turn addiction I get from other Sid games, although not to the same affect as I would from games like Civilization. Gameplay consists of cotrolling a squadron of up to four pilots in tatical air battles over the Western Front. The goal of each mission varies, with everything from balloon busting to escort duties being available.Squadron members can ""learn"" new maneuvers, which makes them more effective in combat. The same happens with enemy squadrons, which means the game gets progressively more challenging over time. Unfortunately, this means if you haven't been able to upgrade a squadron member, he\she becomes rather useless as they basically become cannon fodder. Overall though the replayability is fairly high, even if some missions are bit repetitive.Rating: 4/5       Sound/Music - As can be expected with a game like this, music is basically non-exsistent. There's some at the beginning and end of each mission, and some for the menu and that's it. What's there isn't bad, and music isn't really needed. Sound on the other hand is really good. There's sounds for everything. From machine gun fire to explosions, it all sounds pretty good. There are a few bugs where the sound gets garbled, but this can be overlooked as it doesn't happen often. Rating: 4/5      Overall, the game is good as long as your willing to overlook a few glitches and to some extent, depending on your taste, ugly graphics. Gameplay is solid, and the game serves it purpose of being a light strategy game. If your looking for a more casual gameplay experience, are just looking for a decent WWI game, or just want to try one of Sid Meier's gaming experiments, I recommend it. If, however, your turned off by cartoony graphics or shallow gameplay, then I would skip it. Overall rating: 6/10			"

A world war I air plane stratagy game that was trun based. I'm in. Well, loaded the game on my pc and hit play. Picked out a pilot and got them customized to my liking. Started the first mission..... AH where is the ground..... umm I seem to be missing my plane as well. I think this might cause a problem. Kinda hard to come up with a stratagy  when you cannot even see your plane OR the enemy planes for that matter. No good. I finished the first mission. Not sure how but I did. It appears that you can replace the texture pack for the game but if it will not load the original one do I want to go to all the effort to put in a new one... not really. I have not found a solution for this yet. If it is easy I may modify this review. SO. Buy at your own risk.			"

												Delightful turn-based air combat. Every turn is an agonising choice as you choose between maneuvers. The game mechanic of trading altitude for speed and advanced maneuvers is breathtaking in its clarity, simplicity, and plausible authenticity. The early days of air combat lead to a game of jousting and attack runs, both sides clawing for altitude and position, weaving in and out of clouds and flak zones, trying to line up a shot or trick the enemy into lining themselves up for another pilot's power dive kill shot. Taking to the air knowing you're facing a supremely skilled enemy Ace is a daunting prospect as he dances his bird across the sky, crossing your engagement lines in a lightning sprint and performing daring aerobatics to bring himself up into your squadron's six, but even the best pilot can find himself hard pressed if he lets himself get caught at low altitude, exhausted by constant high-gee flying.It's a light, tight, satisfying game that shows its mobile roots on the surface but the underlying design shows an understanding of what makes a game work that dwarfs most AAA releases.

												I got this game as part of the humble bundle, had I known it was this much fun I would have bought it sooner. It plays almost exactly like a miniatures game game called wings of war, which is well worth a look if you can find it. Ace Patrol is a fairly straight forward turn based game in which you take control of a ww1 pilot there are several different upgradable aircraft to take control of along with several pilots with their own special abilitys, some start with advanced manuvers others with a greater firing range. After the initial training you can select from several different missions some let you control more than one plane as you complete missions you can earn new sets of manuvers. The game play is very simple the map is dived up into hexagons in these hexagons are arrows which you click to move your plane each arrow allows for a different manuver forward slow or fast bank or roll left and right increse/decrese altitude along with any special ones. You automatically attack when in range of an opponent enemy base's will also attack you if you get in range youy can also take advantage of cloud cover which limits your movement but you can't be attacked.This is a fun simple strategy game that I think most people will enjoy even those who aren't brillient at stratergy like myself			"

												Score: 8.5 / 10Recommend Price: $10.99 or lessA fantastic title that reminds me highly of Fantasy Flight Games' X-Wing Miniatures series, Ace Patrol is a turn based strategy game focused on WW1 air combat. Each side takes turns performing various maneuvers with a handful of aircraft from America, France, Germany and Britain. Most missions are simple, ranging from one on one ace combat, reconnaisance, bombing and zepplin attacks.Pilots add another layer of strategy as they level up with successful kills. Each level allows the player to choose from three different sets of maneuvers for that specific pilot. Should the player keep damage levels above 50% in a scenario they will gain a part unlock to attach to a plane. This comes in the form of accuracy, damage, speed and maneuverability upgrades. All in all, a wonderful game with high replayability. Recommended at any price! "

												Awesome game! Played it for 4 hours straight on a first install. Graphics are not high quality, but the gameplay does make up for that a lot. This game has got the Sid Meier's feel of gameplay all over it. A lot of tiny variables you need to account for before making a move. The only thing that bugged me is that there is no option for changing the resolution. The resolution is quite low. I guess that stems from the origin of this game. It was originally created for the iPhone. Apparently changing the resolution may be possible with a config.xml in your User's appdata folder (C:/Users/[yourusername]/AppData/Local/AcePilot/config.xml). I read that in the description of a youtube screencast here: 


YouTube™ Video: Sid Meier's Ace Patrol 

			Views: 13		

			You can set the window resolution by going into the config.xml file in the ..appdata/local/AcePatrol folder and editing the width and height.		

  I did have the folder, but not the xml file. I am too lazy to write something on a trial and error basis or to send an email to the devs, so I am playing it really low res. If the gameplay rocks I do not care about the graphics so for me it is not an issue. I do not know if the devs will implement a possiblity for changing it. I bought the game on sale for €2,50 so it was a cheapy. I bought ""Ace Patrol: Pacific Sky"" also, but I will play that if I have finished this one. Highly recommended!			"

The only thing that bugged me is that there is no option for changing the resolution. The resolution is quite low. I guess that stems from the origin of this game. It was originally created for the iPhone. Apparently changing the resolution may be possible with a config.xml in your User's appdata folder (C:/Users/[yourusername]/AppData/Local/AcePilot/config.xml). I read that in the description of a youtube screencast here: 


YouTube™ Video: Sid Meier's Ace Patrol 

			Views: 13		

			You can set the window resolution by going into the config.xml file in the ..appdata/local/AcePatrol folder and editing the width and height.		

  I did have the folder, but not the xml file. I am too lazy to write something on a trial and error basis or to send an email to the devs, so I am playing it really low res. If the gameplay rocks I do not care about the graphics so for me it is not an issue. I do not know if the devs will implement a possiblity for changing it. I bought the game on sale for €2,50 so it was a cheapy. I bought ""Ace Patrol: Pacific Sky"" also, but I will play that if I have finished this one. Highly recommended!			"

												This game is a wonderful introduction to computer gaming for somebody who has never played a game before.  The maneuvers are easy to figure out, and the explanations are helpful.  It's played on a ""turn based"" system, so the player has time to figure out what to do next.  Or at least what to TRY next!  And there are periodic awards for achievements--to keep you trying.  I played the game from beginning to end and really had fun.  I'd like to figure out how to zero out all the badges so I could start all over!!			"

												Suprisingly fun. I have not played through the whole campaign but it really reminds me of a digital ""Wings of War"" game(Wings of War is a minature tabletop strategy game)The turn based mechanics make it very challenging to anticipate your opponents moves. Missions are interesting and fun.Though over the course of gameplay I can see it getting fairly repetitive.I did take issue with the fact that through leveling you go from Ensign (an officer rank) to Corporal (an enlisted rank) to Lieutenant (an officer rank). No period military had such a structure so it was a little odd. Anyway, if you like turn based strategy and aircraft, play this game			"

												Sid Meier doesn't make bad games and this is no exception. It's simple and short yet infinitely fun. I wasn't sure about the graphics when I looked at the previews because I typically like my wargames detailed and ultra realistic, but the design in this game just works, especially for the period. I was also worried about how fun it would be to play a dogfighting game that was turned based, but again Sid finds a way to make it work beautifully. This title is well worth the cheap price.			"

												A fun little game with basic though pleasing graphics. I particularly like the pilot portraits and the selectable colour schemes.The game isn't tactically very deep, nor will you be playing it for months, but it's not meant to be. A good value light weight strategy game, ideal as an introduction to the genre or for a quick strategy fix if you've only half an hour to spare.Playing through a single campaign (of which there are four) is easily done in an evening. There's good variety in the missions, considering the size of the game, and enough to keep you entertained through to the end.			"

												This has surprisingly quickly become one of my favorite games. I have always loved what Sid Meier cpomes out with, but WW1 and Aeral combat was a sheer calling for me. The game has great simplisty, due to it being an App Game for iPhones and the such. However, the depth of stratige to the combat makes it, I feel, a brain tease. I love this game, hands down. Hope more games will be added to the ""Ace Patrol"" series. This game is for those who enjoy a quick, easy to learn game on a quiet afternoon. I also reccomand it for WW1 aviation enthusiasts, not for nessisarly the accuracy, but the sheer enjoyment of watching little biplanes fight to the death.			"

												Ace Patrol is good fun. If you can look past the ugly mobile-phone-graphics it's a pretty deep game with plenty of strategy and tactics. Choose between several missions and complete the objectives using one or more (max 4) pilots. Make enough kills and your pilots will level up allowing them to use more/better maneuvers during battles. This can be critical later on in the game. You'll also be able to unlock perks by completing secondary objectives. This, for example, allows crashed pilots to get right back into action after being captured by the enemy forces. And yes, better planes can also be unlocked.Ace Patrol isn't a very long game and it's best played in short rounds, but like I said, it's good fun.[Rating: 71/100]			"

												Note: Summary at the bottom of the review.Ace Patrol is the first of the (currently two) Ace Patrol games. While its successor tackles WW2, this takes on WW1 where the strategy involves maneuvering your plane into the best possible position to shoot down the enemy. As you progress, nev maneuvers, planes and improvements become avaliable. The game is a casual one, but while you cannot expect much depth or complexity from it, you can expect it to be a fun pack-up-and-play game. And in all honesty, how many WW1 Air Combat TBS games are there out there? The originality of it alone deserves mention!Another thing that should be mentioned is that your squadron will have female combat pilots. While I applaud the inclusion of female pilots on the principle of it being awesome, I am puzzled why Firaxis neglected to include an option to disable them for those that want to preserve some historical accuracy.Pro:*Fun little TBS air-combat game.*Includes female pilots, yay!*Casual pick-up-and-play style.Con:*Lacking in depth and complexity.*No option to turn off female pilots for those wanting historical accuracy.*Not a lot of customization when it comes to graphics, etc.Summary:Ace Patrol is worth its asking price, so long as you do not expect a great amount of depth, complexity or historical accuracy. That being said, it is a fun game set in a very interesting era of aviation! 5/10 -Recomended.For more recomendations and reviews: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/strandedkerbonaut#curation "

-Quick Review-Sid Meier's Ace Patrol is a Turn-based strategy game that uses small squad tactics with different types of planes as you fight through World War I. Sid Meier's Ace Patrol was developed by Firaxis Games and released in 2013.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  You know how World War I goes in your history classes? Yeah, pretty much the same story here. So instead of giving you your history class again, here's the basic gist that the story relevance to the video game follows: There are breakthrough in technology on both sides that give the Axis or the Allies a technological advantage over the other, you should take advantage of when these occur before the other side catches up and you're forced to rely on tactical maneuvers, again.Game Play: Sid Meier's Ace Patrol fills a unique strategy game ""niche"", this is the first game that I personally have played where it's all about flight combat tactics. Depending on different positions your planes will do more or less damage; if you're attacking from a flank or behind the enemy you'll do more damage. If you're firing while banking away you do less damage, or depending on the range you are from your enemy you might do greater or lesser damage.Achievements: The achievements generally require a great deal of commitment to first, learning the game mechanics, and then accomplishing successful campaigns with the different nations, earning ____ amount of victories as each respective nation, Victories with pilots, and defeating the harder difficulties. (this game is already plenty hard on easy difficulties by the way)Price: Sid Meier's Ace Patrol is priced at $4.99, that's a fair price for the game, and for people who may find this game very enjoyable it's a great deal! Unfortunately this game will only appeal to certain gamers, most people won't grasp the subtle nuances or simply be pushed away because of the complexities of the game itself.Conclusion: I recommend this game to people who already know they Enjoy strategy games. I suggest watching a few videos on how to play before making a final decision to purchase. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game... but there's just nothing that will grab and keep the normal player playing.			"

												I want to say good things about this game.  It might be a great game.  I wish I could say.  Unfortunately, I cannot get the game to work, and am unable to resolve the graphics problems with support.  This is a simple game, yet demands new hardware to work right, with no sign of a patch.  I say this as a huge fan of Sid Meier's work since the 90's. that this might be the only Steam game I was disappointed in buying.   Eventually I will be able to actually play the game, but until then, I can't say much good or bad, except for the difficulty with getting support for the game.			"

												The first thing I have to say is do not be put off by this game because it's a port from the IPHONE. AGAIN I REPEAT DON'T BE PUT OFF BECAUSE GAME IS A PORT FROM THE IPHONE!Now that I have told you that, let me tell you why you need to get this game if you like taticle turb based strategy games such as Frozen Synapse where you attempt to get into the best situation possible so that you may obliterate your enemy, than this game is for you. Here are the basics. You control a squad of 4 WW1 airplanes. You do missions ranging from shoot down all enemy pilots to protect your recon plane. You must than issue orders to your pilots based on their abilites and manuvers to complete the mission. Use each of them to cover the other. Deal with altitude, cloud cover and evasion. In other words, the combat is deep and satisfying. Missions can take anywere from 5 minutes to 15 minutes depending on how you play and how risky or safe you play. How much gameplay is there? I've played 3 hours so far, still British (which is the first nation you get to play as) and just started the 3rd level out of 5 (I believe) After that you get to pick the next nation you play as which has different mission types, locals and planes. The graphics suit the game just fine, a bit cartoony but not over the top cartoony. The planes have nice modles as does the ground. But your not playing this game for the graphics, your playing this game for the combat. Again, think games like Frozen Synapse or Advanced Wars mixed with the Hex Based grid system of Civilization V mixed in with Altitude, upgradable manuvers, cloud cover and hours of fun and strategy.The game never feels cheep when your plane is getting shot up. More than likely there was a way to forgo the situtation you are in, but you can undo turns, keep going and get your self out. Some missions only allow 1 pillot while others require all 4. But you have to manage your pilots. Each pilot has a different skill set of manuvers ranging from rolls, loops, ace moves and many more and even a special perk such as being able to shoot from farther away, copy all plane upgrades or escape from POW camps. So you have to look at the mission your going to do and pick the best pilot(s) for the job.There's still so much that I didn't cover in this review because I havn't even touched the surface of this game. Am I filling this review full of BS and lies? No. This is all true and better than I can explain. Should you get this game? If you like deep tacticle strategy games, than yes.			"

												No fullscreen, no higher resolution, no anti-aliasing, no anisotropic filtering.No settings to speak of, really, which speaks for it's quality as a port from mobile devices.This game is by no means a bad one, Sid Meier rarely fails to meet expectations, but it requires a little TLC in the port department.As for the game itself, I haven't played much, but it seems like a basic turn-based world war dogfighting sim of sorts, and if that interests you, you likely won't be dissapointed.As I say, I've played very little, don't take my word for it.

												A good game for what it is - casual, tactical adaptation of board game about two small flights of WWI planes trying to outmaneuver and shoot down one another.  It is *not* ""Civilisation with planes"" or anything close; people who saw Sid Meiers name and came here looking for another long strategy full of management and compelling player to play ""one more turn"" before quiting are in wrong place.  Ace Patrol campaign is more a series of scenarions each about 15 minutes long, connected by campaign mechanism just complex enough to give sense of continuity. It is not a faithful representation of WW I, either, but I'd say more faithful than not :). The Good: The game mechanics make sound representation of planes behaviour in the air; most of tactics and moves you need to win would make sense in historical fights (if not always between planes presented). You don't have feeling that you are playing abstract board game that uses plane icons to represent pieces. Despite it being a turn game, the feeling of movement is always present. I'd even say I've learned a thing or two about Boom and Zoom tactics when playing  a squadron of SPADs against Dreideckers - knowing it needs patience and discipline from pilot is one thing, seeing how many turns it takes in turn game is quite another. The short but satisfying scenarios mean you won't spend long hours over this game, at least not continously, but makes it good game for short breaks while doing other things, especially office procrastination :) . It does not mean it can't be played for hours - happened to me - but you don't need hours of free time to play it.The Bad: While the way game represents the planes characteristics and behaviour in the air is mostly sound, putting the roll rate and sustained turn rate in single ""maneuvrability"" stat (which seem to govern how easily plane changes direction, IE roll rate) leads to some breaks from realism. For instance, the way to defeat Albatros with ""maneuvrable"" Sopwith Camel is not to outturn it, but to outscissor it - historically, it might be the best way to snach a defeat from maw of victory :). It's still a possible situation between two different planes and Ace Patrol is a board game that is not supposed to be realistic, but it still ruins the immersion.The Ugly: Each of four featured nations (Frenchm Britons, Americans and Germans) has choice od six plane types to fly, and the way planes have been chosen is idiosyncratic to say the least. The decision to shoehorn Americans (who skipped most of tech race of 1916-1918 and did not have own early plane types) as full-blown faction is probably to blame here; we have French flying planes they designed but never used (Hanriot HD.1, Nieuport.28) , Americans flying iconic French and British planes they barely used (SPAD 7, Sopwith Triplane, Sopwith Strutter - to add insult to injury, N.28 was widley used by Americans while french made more use of Triplane than Americans). Thanks to campaign mechanics, sometimes we see unhistorical fights like F.kker Eindeckers vs Bristol Fighter. It still makes a fun game, but much less immersive than it could be.			"

												This is basically a turn-based WWI air combat game.  A turn-based dogfighting game seemed a bit of a strange concept to me at first, and this game takes some getting used to, but it's actually quite fun so far.  It's proved to be harder than it seemed becasue there are so many moves the little planes can make (and I'm probably a lousy pilot too).  You also have to watch out for flak guns shooting up at you from the ground.  But as you gain victories and experience during the missions (strafing ground targets, shooting down balloons, dogfighting with enemy fighters, intercepting bombers, etc.) your pilots will get promoted and you can upgrade your aircraft.  I'm still learning the ropes, but it's an amusing little game so far.  Definitely worth buying, especially if it's on sale.  Have fun with it!  :)			"

												Ace Patrol is a fun little hex-based air combat game set during World War I. It is important to keep in mind that this is a casual game. The gameplay is not especially deep or complicated, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. It is easy to pick up and play through a few quick missions if you don’t want to get sucked into a full-blown, drawn-out strategy game like Civilization V or XCOM. (Not to say that the gameplay of Ace Patrol isn't incredibly addictive, because it is.) Missions take just a few minutes to complete, and there are roughly twenty-four missions per campaign (There is one campaign for each of the four playable nations). During a mission, you maneuver your little squadron around the playing field to complete the objective, be it shooting down enemy aircraft, destroying supply convoys or escorting reconnaissance planes. But it isn’t enough to simply shoot down other planes as quickly as possible by selecting the move that gives the most damage… doing so might put your plane directly into the enemies' line of fire. Instead, you will need to decide the best course of action of how to destroy the enemy planes and still bring your guys back (relatively) undamaged.Ace Patrol is quite fun, however, there are a couple of downsides. The graphics are so-so (I find they have their charm). And even though there are “campaigns”, there is no storyline or narrative, which is a bit disappointing. You level up your pilots, add upgrades to your planes, fly out on a mission, come back to base and repeat, so you never really feel a sense of purpose or connection to your pilots. At the very least, it would have been nice to see a few historical fun facts or something. And because there are a limited number of mission types, eventually you may find yourself flying the same missions with only different configurations of clouds and friendly/enemy territory.If you are looking for a pick-up-and-go casual game to play every now-and-then or a “light” strategy game that does not take hours to beat, I highly recommend giving Ace Patrol a try. Although it lacks the scope of other turn-based strategy games, there is still great potential for “just one more mission!”			"

												A excellent turn-based strategy game.The focus is on the aerial combat of World War 1 and in the game, you control a squadron of 4 pilots.You can select between playing as the US, Britain, France and Germany which affects the planes you start with.Like mentioned, the gameplay is turn-based and you play through a number of Operations, which are sets of 6 missions and you have a choice of 3 missions at each interval, all with differing objectives which eventually lead up a final mission, usually destroying a large Zeppelin of the enemy force.The game has a lot of customizing to it, with nameable pilots, colourable planes and of course, new planes that become available gradually. Your pilots are customizeable in the way of promotions and special medals, which allow them to learn new moves like Power maneauvers, Slide, Roll as well as a number of special Ace skills.It's a fairly short game but i still found it very entertaining.

Summary: turn-based aerial combat in WW1 setting.From the description it's hard to see how a game like this could be so compelling but it actually is.  You control a group of pilots fighting in the front of WW1.  Each turn, you get a set of possible moves for every pilot.  Some are basic, like flying straight ahead fast or slow, banking left or banking right, climbing or diving.  As your pilots build up skills, they get more advanced manuevers like half loops, Immelmans, slides, and spins.  Each move limits you to the next possible set of moves, factoring in altitude and plane condition.  Moves that bring you close to the enemy give you the opportunity to fire--or be fired at.The appeal of this game is its puzzle-like quality.  The emphasis is less on action than it is on tactics.  It's a pretty cerebral game.  The missions are varied, too, and range from straightforward air combat to strafing runs to escort missions to aerial cover.Rounding out its play value is the skill tree, new airplanes, pilot personalities (both for your own squadron and the enemy's), upgrades.Highly recommended!

And Yet it as depth, it's fun, historically perfect and addictive And darned good value for that tiny price. As a bonus, it's very light and can be played above other heavy programs while you wait for those.			"

												Heavily simplified civ gameAce patrol is about unit tactics. In the campaign you start with four pilots as they face off their foes in World War one. You can customise your first pilot's voice and portrait who will go on the first mission. Each pilot command their own plane. As you progress through the game you can unlock new planes, which each have varying stats. Your pilots will also level up during the game. As they do you can select an ability for them to learn which varies between their movement during play. If you meet certain requirements, you can unlock perks for pilots after each mission which includes improving accuracy and defence. Each plane has a set amount of health. When your pilots get shot down, they remain unavailable in later missions until they are released. Injured pilots may also be unavailable in later missions as well. You get to choose different mission types in campaign:  defence and attack. In defence missions, you basically have to defend a certain building or units from being destroyed by the enemy. In attack missions, you need to bomb/destroy a particular building or unit. As you win one country's campaign you unlock another one (you start off with playing as the British)Combat is turn based. You generally select your units and move them on the highlited pads. Certain pads may glow red, indicating that you will shoot at the enemy plane when you move there. You will be provided with the amount of damage you will do to the enemy plane. Furthermore, you can only shoot at plane from the front and to the side only, so you need to turn around if enmy planes are behind you.There isn't much music to this game. The title screen music is like classical 'Civ' games, but there is no tracks during gameplay. Your pilots may say a few words, but they are forgettable anyway.If you enjoy basic civ game which only focuses on unit combat then you may like this game. If your expecting a 'civilisation' game, you will DEFINATELY be dissapointed.  "

												Interesting little game, it's a turn-based tactical game, very basic in its design - set in Europe during WW1, you can choose to play as the British, French, Americans or Germans.In terms of challenge - On easy there is very little skill involve - simply get behind your opposition, not in front of them, and continue to shoot them until you've defeated them. As you increase the difficulty the challenge really does ramp up and you will need to plan what manueveres to upgrade your pilots with and understand how and when to use them, it becomes like a chess game.The set up of the game is that your participate in 5 battles, and there are 5 engagements within each battle. They are literally just randomly generated engagements based off the same 4 engagement types - Combat Air Patrol, Search & Destroy, Recon or Escort. However you can choose from one of 3 engagements offered, this means you can choose to challenge yourself or avoid doing that one engagement type that you've become bored of. There are also some random bonus or ""Challenge"" missions which get thrown in too.Overall if you like turn-based tactical or even if you're just a fan of WW1 it could be and interesting way to waste a few hours.

												I've played this game outside of Steam so I'm not judging it only based on the playing time showed above. Ace Patrol is a nice game, all in all. Not worth a lot of money, so buy it during Steam Sale. I say it's not worth a lot of money because Sid Meier could have done better.PROS:- The maneuvers and the differences between the planes literally give the player a lot of room to play. Knowing your planes and those of your enemy is important in using your maneuvers effectively, especially with higher difficulty settings.- Gameplay is quite straightforward.CONS:- The graphics are a bit childish for the most part.- Too arcadish. Don't expect me to care about the life of my pilots when some of them have these silly faces. Don't include female pilots. I don't care about political correctness.- Lack of strategical decision-making. You can choose between 3 missions, select some pilots and upgrade them. You don't really have influence on a strategical level.- Don't play for too long, it could get a bit repetitive. That said, it's not really a con.So, the game is okay, but as soon as there is a game like this that is historically more accurate, graphically more attractive and strategically more challenging I will probably never play Sid Meier's Ace Patrol again.

												 You engage in turn based combat against enemy pilots during WWII. Each pilot who comes back gains experience which can be used to upgrade their planes and most importantly, with new ariel maneuvers. The core of this game is all movement and positioning. First time I've seen movement be such a core mechanic in a turn based game. Very clever and to me, very original. If you like turn based tactical combat and want something different that hints at true strategic depth this game is definitely worth a purchase.Highly recommended.			"

												Ace Patrol is a fun little hex-based air combat game set during World War I. It is important to keep in mind that this is a casual game. The gameplay is not especially deep or complicated, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. It is easy to pick up and play through a few quick missions if you don’t want to get sucked into a full-blown, drawn-out strategy game like Civilization V or XCOM. (Not to say that the gameplay of Ace Patrol isn't incredibly addictive, because it is.) Missions take just a few minutes to complete, and there are roughly twenty-four missions per campaign (There is one campaign for each of the four playable nations). During a mission, you maneuver your little squadron around the playing field to complete the objective, be it shooting down enemy aircraft, destroying supply convoys or escorting reconnaissance planes. But it isn’t enough to simply shoot down other planes as quickly as possible by selecting the move that gives the most damage… doing so might put your plane directly into the enemies' line of fire. Instead, you will need to decide the best course of action of how to destroy the enemy planes and still bring your guys back (relatively) undamaged.Ace Patrol is quite fun, however, there are a couple of downsides. The graphics are so-so (I find they have their charm). And even though there are “campaigns”, there is no storyline or narrative, which is a bit disappointing. You level up your pilots, add upgrades to your planes, fly out on a mission, come back to base and repeat, so you never really feel a sense of purpose or connection to your pilots. At the very least, it would have been nice to see a few historical fun facts or something. And because there are a limited number of mission types, eventually you may find yourself flying the same missions with only different configurations of clouds and friendly/enemy territory.If you are looking for a pick-up-and-go casual game to play every now-and-then or a “light” strategy game that does not take hours to beat, I highly recommend giving Ace Patrol a try. Although it lacks the scope of other turn-based strategy games, there is still great potential for “just one more mission!”			"

 Fun, little game I have very fond memories about two specific titles from the past - Over The Reich and it's sequel Achtung! Spitfire. Ace Patrol does look a bit like those games, but with more colorful/kid-friendly approach.  After a few hours of gameplay I can honestly say, It's not even close to level of grand those aformentioned games represented. Ace Patrol feels like a mobile game (and it is a mobile game too). Gameplay is a mostly fun, turn-based dogfighting with light rpg elements. Scale is a first dissapointment -  you won't command more than 4 planes at once. Most of the time, missions involve two or three of your pilots. That's just sad - no chance for grand strategy battles. Rpg elements are barebones. There's no real way to customize your pilots - you just make them better and add new skills. The same with new planes - every time you get a new one, it's better then the previous.  If you hope for a long campaign - you can finish all missions (diveded into 6 offensives) in around 2h. Single mission takes around 5-10 minutes to be completed.  Offcourse the main goal of the game is to win the war on the highest difficulty setting, but most of us, will be perfectly happy with medium. Ace Patrol can be punishing at times. You are not obliged to win every mission, but failures will cost you.... points. Yes, it seems that Ace Patrol is more of a score attack game. Sure, shot down pilots will end up in hospital for a while or be captured and put into POW camp for the rest of the offensive. Also, failing missions will change the final outcome of the offensive. Nevertheless, it's all about your final score, not about ranking up your pilots or enjoyable mission objectives.  After finishing the game with one of the factions, I'm not really interested in playing it again. Factions don't really differ from one another,  so replaying the game as Americans or French changes nothing. Also, i don't think there's enough variety in mission objectives or rpg elements. It's just so basic and bare-bones.  TL,DR :Ace Patrol is perfect game for ""so-so"" score. Middle grade. There is no ""mild recomendation"" in Steam Reviews. Yes, i would recommend it. I was pretty negative, but it's fun little game, for a 3 or 4h. It was a nice distraction, opened in a small window, on my work computer - just to finish a mission between sending emails and making phone calls. I'm dissapointed it's not fleshed out as i hoped it will be... but i guess i need to dig up old copy of Achtung! Spitfire to scratch my itch.			"

												I'm an achievement hunter and got this in a humble bundle. I was surprised how much fun it was!!!The first campaign, is quite challenging, if you're up for the achievement task of getting 150,000 points for the campaign. Choose between various levels of difficulty, where each adds to your score multiplier. Winning a mission on highest difficulty is not a walk in the park.Unfortunately after the first campaign you will basically have learned all maneuvers and seen it all. Going for the remaining achievements is not more than a mere repetition of the first campaign. Still recommended if it's on sale and/or if you're looking for solid short-term dogfight-fun!			"

												Simple, fun, cheap strategy game about world war flying ace shooting each others in the sky.Don't expect grand strategy or world-spanning campaign or something. This is a simple game about planes that take turn maneuvering according to their stats and trying to position themselves to get those sweet, sweet critical hit at enemies.And it teaches you about Immelman Turn. You might get bored at it after 5 campaigns or 10 hours, but hey, for the price and the fun you get at those time, it's totally worth it.			"

												This game is fun for the time it last and for the price you pay.  Its not a complex game and I think Sid Meiers should watch more on what he puts his name on because the historic accuracy and the simplicity of the game is clearly not of a CIVILIZATION level.  I expected something more .. hmmm... ''constistant''.The mechanic is simple.  You select a certain number of your pilots to do a mission in a choice of three missions.  The pilots gets kills and when they reach a certain level you get upgrades on them.  You also get a few upgrades on planes if you perform better.  Basically, its a turn-based positioning strategy game.  You shoot when you are in a good position and you are a pigeon when you are chased.The game has no luck factor so its pure strategy.  Still, its way too simple to be very interesting for a long time.  I've gone through the game at the level 4 difficulty (out of 5) on my second run and sticked to it after.  There are not enough plane choices (5 per factions) and you only have 4 pilots under your command.  They can be wounded, captured or grounded by plane repairs ; reducing your missions opportunities to ZERO.  The worst of all is that you have have FEMALE pilots.  Not that I don't like women or think of them as inferiors but this REALLY cut you off from the historic immersion.  Thumbs down for this ''politically correct'' choice.The planes have a few differences but this could have been more significant.  You can customize their skins with ''ace paintings'' but they are all dull and very generic.  There are almost nothing to unlock and replayability is limited to 4 ''goes through'' (each of the four factions).  After that, its soporific.One of the best aspect of the game is totally lame because of the camera auto-zoom that you can't remove.  You can replay your battles in pseudo ''real-time'' to watch how the fight happened but the auto-zoom will focus on shooting then get back to field view, then refocus on shooting then come back to field view, etc... and you lose all the fun of seeing the whole battle as it switch every 4 seconds from a point of view to another one.  Really, this game had a lot of potential to be a gem but the fact it has been designed for commoners rather than history fanatics kills it.  The history side is BS, the strategy side is too easy and repetitive and the replayability is close to none.I cannot recommend this game because it does not enter a classification to please anyone.  Its too simple for strategy fans, its too inaccurate for history fans and its too repetitive for hardcore fans... maybe for people who knows nothing about WW1 ...  Graphics : 4/10 - (Sprites, its all right but plain and dull)Sound/music : 2/10 - (Almost inexistant or just very generic and unremarkable)Replayability : 3/10 - (Repetitive and limited)Fun factor : 6/10 - (For the 15 hours it will last)OVERALL : 3/10Conclusion : Too easy, too inacurrate compared to history, repetitive, limited.  This was probably a good Cell phone game but on PC it lacks polishing and diversity.  You paid 5$ and you get what you paid for : something to kill a few hours. "

												I just cannot start the game. On my Windows 7 Dell laptop w/Sandy Bridge, the games starts, and when it looks like it's going to run.. it closes on its own. Then, I get ""Failed to start game app already running"" error message. On Windows XP desktop, I just get ""Failed to start game. unknown error"".I googled and tried many different remedies, and none of them are working.Verifying integrity,installing \Steam\steamapps\common\Pacific Skies\_CommonRedist\OpenAL or vcredist,unchecking Enable steam community in-game option, etc.Same thing goes for both Ace Patrol and Ace Patrol Pacific Skies.There are many open discussions on steam communities for the same error. And 2K games seem to be aware of the error since September, but failed to provide the remedy. Although I like Borderlands, this is not very good customer service.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Update: I have another desktop with i7 and discrete AMD graphics card.  On this PC, both games ran without any problems.  I am still disappointed by the fact it doesn't run on my laptop w/Intel graphics.  This is a strategy game with less than 150MB in size from a reputable developer / publisher.  I didn't have this kind of problem from many indie titles I own.			"

												A fun, casual strategy game.Gameplay is turn-based dog-fighting set in WW1. It's not very deep, but still satisfying. You have a variety of maneuvers available to your pilots, and as they level up you gain access to fancier abilities. Missions are never too difficult but if you're careless, your pilots will get shot down quickly, resulting in capture or injury.The overarching campaign is relatively simplistic, with several chapters. Victory is determined by whether or not you won enough missions in a chapter. If you win enough chapters, you win the war.Unlocking new planes and upgrading planes brings variety.Overall, this game is more than just a time waster, but not really heavy strategy. I would love to see a more complex game built on these mechanics.			"

Some additionnal stuff is available if you succeed to finish nations campaigns. If you expect a simulator like game, pass your way, this one is more based on tactics and strategy. A mission  can be played  in less than 30mnShould you like previous boargames, you may wish that they had developped some add-ons with new planes, new WWI countries and more elaborate campaigns.			"

												This game is a great way to kill an hour whenever you don't feel like the full on commitment of Rome Total War or some other month long epic.  The graphics are pleasant, the aircraft fairly realistics, the ground representations even show German tanks that look like an A7V. The variety of ways to modify a progressing pilot can be fun, and the effects different aircraft and skills have on your tactics can be challenging.  As in real life, the introduction of a new plane may not actually suit your way of doing business, so you may find some pilots flying the newset while others stick with an older variant.  The missions get a little samey same, but hell, you can always up the skill level when you feel ready.  Planning your pilot skill development is worth a little time.  The fact you can be UK, US, France or Germany means there is plenty of variety.  Well worth the outlay.  Game of the year it is not.  A great game to play anyway?  It certainly is.			"

												So far I have finished it only once. I'm very surprised (in good way) with Sid Meier's Ace Patrol. I mean, it's not the newest game from Firaxis and yet there are not many reviews. People are complaining about how repetitive it is but in my opinion, it's not so bad. Even if this game is kind of lacking some in deep mechanics, looks really simple and most likely casuals will have more fun playing it than hardcore gamers, but it still is an enjoyable turn-based strategy. The only thing that could make you keep playing it for longer time are achievements, since there isn't much of variety in missions, maps, and such. The price for Ace Patrol is fine, and if you still think it's too expensive, wait for some sale. If you are fan of this kind of games then you should for sure give it a try.			"

												The game is a TBS, where you move your planes on a board.You have 4 pilots, which you can: - Choose plane type for (you get 1 new plane type each location)- Upgrade, when they get enough kills for the next ""level"" (types of manouvers they can do) and plane upgrades (if your planes take less than 50% damage)- Give 1 special skill each, after a set number of skills. These pilots can also suffer from injury (shot down), repair time on their plane (heavily damaged plane) and captured by the enemy (shot down over enemy territory.)It is a simple, easy to learn and fun little game, with 4 nations to choose from (US, UK, France and Germany). If you like TBS games, I highly doubt you will dislike this little gem. 8/10PS: The game crashes unless you take the following steps:1. Have the game executable run in compatibility mode - Windows 82. On the same screen in properties for the executable, check off the box which says: ""Disable display scaling on high DPI settings""			"

												Honestly, this felt like a mobile game. BUT, that's not a bad thing. I had my fair share of entertainment from this (mini)game, and I'd say it's worth the small price tag. I guess it's subjective, but if you have a bit of spare money, you should totally try this out!			"

												I often turn to games that start with ""Sid Meier's"" when looking for an entertaining stategy game. Ace Patrol is not the worst Sid Meier's game I've ever played but it does have it's flaws. This game was originally developed as a mobile game and was mostly intended for tablet users. Now that it has been ported without any real enhancments for the PC version it doesn't feel complete. It's a very simple strategy game but the reasons it's simplistic feels like they were intented to improve / simplify mobile gaming and controls. It's not a bad game but their are a lot of other options for PC that would be more rewarding in the stategy department. I'm not recomending this game over all but I will say that it is very cheap and if you are just trying to kill 15 minutes it's not a bad choice. If you have the option to buy the mobile version that may be a better choice.			"

												A relatively simple game to pass some time when you don't want to get deeply involved in a game, but don't want to devote twitch skills either. It's a turn-by-turn light-strategy game, with minor factional differences - not enough so that you need to develop a specific strategy for each faction to achieve victory. The game feels like a phone game, honestly - it may be one, but I'm not arsed enough to check - which isn't necessarily a put-down. But it's got about that same level of quick learning curve at the expense of strategic depth you'd expect of a phone game.I purchased this as part of a larger Humble Bundle. As a pack-in or on sale, you could do a lot worse if you're looking to kill an hour here and there.			"

												I picked up this game as part of the Sid Meier's Bundle and I have to admit it did not interest me at all. However, I was plesantly surprised to discover how fun it is. Sure, it is never going to beat Civ and you won't put 40 hours into it, but you can probably finish every campaign in 10 hours or so (I have done two and halfway through the third) and the combat is fun, especially if you grew up with turn-based strategy RPG's like me. There is very few RPG elements outside of pilots leveling up and earning new moves. Combat is simple at first but gets more complicated as you go along and earn more ""moves"". Watching the replay is fun as you see all the turn-based stuff you did in real-time and it looks pretty epic. Sadly, the missions are repetitive variants of ""kill all enemies"", ""escort or protect this thing"", ""destroy this enemy base/train/thing"" or the ""ace vs ace"" one of one battles. Still, pretty fun for $5.			"

												Save and save often as this game will randomly crash more than enemy pilots after a successful mission. Aside from that it's a lot of fun building your rookie pilots up to grizzled fighter veterans who know every trick to avoid enemy fire while strafing at anything within range.			"

												I got it for less than a dollar,  but am still frustrated. I had played it on iPad, so I knew it was a casual mobile game and was fine with that. The reason I can't recommend it is that it constantly crashes. It crashed on me twice yesterday, once today, a couple of times the time before that that I played. It crashes, literally, during every play session. Play it for more than 15 minutes and it crashes. You lose all unsaved progress when that happens. Instead of being a relaxing casual game, it just makes it stressful and frustrating.			"

												The game reminds me of all my table-top battles.  A simple game yet challenging game.  However, there are graphic bugs, the game crashes and automaticlly closes.  Frustrating to say the least.  Don't buy if you want to spend money.  If it comes bundled, its your chace to see a Sid Meier's game that is not the same high standard as the rest.After a few more tries, and a couple of updates, it works well.  Perhaps it was the initial bugs but works well now.  Takes away all the dice rolling and calculations of turns and all.  Recommended for those who want a simple game, yet with the option of making this more challenging.			"
