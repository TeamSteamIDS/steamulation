												I've just played through the campaign and I'm obliged to write a meaningful review now.First I'll tell a little about the game.The best way to describe this is a Total War-Warcraft-Heroes of Might and Magic mix, where you can't control towns, but only buy troops from them and carry out quests. Something very similar is perhaps Praetorians.Every troop (units are broken into troops, you can't control soldiers individually) gains its own experience and can be upgraded in a town when it reaches every 3 levels.Monster dens are scattered around every map (the campaign is broken into maps) specificially for grinding experience, money and items, which can be equipped on units.The most powerful units are perhaps battle mages - you can control them individually, they have multiple useful spells to  cast and they fire destructive area-damaging spells like they're semi-automatic artillery or something. Though it takes long to grind XP to upgrade them to the maximum level.The player's main character is presented as a spirit flying in the air in front of the camera. He can't participate in the battle directly. He gains XP along with the player's army and just hurls spells.Here are controls for the camera:WASD or arrow keys or move the cursor to the edge of the screen - to move the camera.Hold ctrl+WASD or arrow keys - rotate the view. This actually gives the impression of first-person view.You can pause with Space, and you can't move the camera while paused, but you can still rotate.Right-clicking on a troop instantly brings the camera to it, even when paused.I noticed that the mana does not play any role. It's never spent when I cast spells. Nothing ever happens when mana becomes 0. I'm allowed to cast spells which cost more mana than I have at max. So leveling the mana skill is a waste of XP.Units sometimes get stuck on cornerns of the terrain. It doesn't happen too often, it can be fixed by manually moving the unit to the other side. But it is damn annoying.Music suddenly interrupts all the time and only resumes playing when a battle starts. There's a volume slider in game options, but no checkbox to switch music on/off so that you could restart it.You will not be able to play this game on normal speed, because in that case it is too boring. The speed can be regulated with (+) and (-) keys on the number pad of the keyboard. I couldn't find this option anywhere in the game settings or explained anywhere, so I'm writing it.Not a single crash has occured. Brilliant.Now, the actual review.First off, the tutorial doesn't cover 90% of gameplay, you have to figure it out on your own. Difficulty of that depends on how many RTS games you've played.The kind of mage you choose before the start of the campaign only affects the starting skills and spells you get. And the avatar icon, yes. Everything else is the same.The campaign is extremely, punishingly difficult at the beginning and becomes too easy starting somewhere from the middle of it. Saving often is adviced, because suddenly you might lose a battle mage, which is too valuable. Using multiple save files is adviced, because sometimes you can get unexpectedly cornered by overwhelming enemy troops, who were just passing by and you happened to make company with them.The quests are completely uninspired: go there, talk to that person (you can't even choose replies in dialogue), bring that item over there, escort a slow♥♥♥♥♥wagon from point A to point B. And completely nothing happens while you escort a thing or go from A to B. Nothing. At all. And the wagon is sloooooow.... Seriously, most part of the game is walking around the map. You can tell your army to move somewhere and go away from the keyboard for 3-4 minutes. On maximum game speed.The voice acting is really good, although that wolf howl is a pain for the ears, and some voices (goblin's) are not so great.The cutscenes are something like in Warcraft 3, except really poorly done (I mean it, year 2003 is in no way an excuse for this) - you can tell it even by how the camera is flying around. Very often it's showing a single place and flying around it for 40 seconds, and nothing happens. Absolutely nothing happens. The characters are just standing, playing their completely out-of-place idle animations, and the camera is rolling around and ugh... No words can explain this.The graphics don't seem to be designed to look good, even for 2003, except for a few models and unit and special effects animations. The faces of the elves are especially ugly, but maybe they're supposed to be? The map models are incredibly plain - just textured ground (thanks God, not plain ground - it contains hills, bumps and stuff). Occasional trees and rocks and buildings, but in limited quantities. It does manage to set the mood, though.The plot.. Um. I can't say I'm disappointed, because somehow it seems fitting for a fantasy-themed game, but let me explain. It is all fairy-tale cliche mostly. The missions are brutally straight-forward: we need to do something in order to achieve something, in the process we learn new information and get new tasks to do.  The plot does get confusing in the middle and in the end, when seemingly random names of mages of the Guild of Mages are mentioned. Near the end it hardly makes sense even.The only things that can be interesting about it is how new information about what's going on is revealed to the player (although it may appear kind of stupid..and random). The most exciting things are perhaps intermission cutscenes, they are really well done. They contain drawn black-and-white images, with amazing voice-over (sadly, without subtitles, but you probably won't need them). It looks beautiful.The core combat mechanics, combined with RPG elements, spell-casting and rock-scissors-paper tactics, give an exciting mix. The game is not boring during battles and you may really want to slow the game speed down (unless you're grinding on monster mobs) and get to microing your ranged units away from melee attackers. The battles are the main part of the game, and it turned out although not perfectly, but still incredibly satisfying.I recommend this game only to those who enjoy RTS, grinding and leveling, and who have enough patience to bear the plot, old graphics, generally slow pace and bugs.

												A combination of RTS and RPG genres. You assemble an army, complete quests, fight enemies to make the world a safer place and save it from annihilation. You have a wide variety of available troops from human, orc, elf and goblin races including close range fighters, long range troops, mages and even heavy artillery. Also possible to add demons to your army. As you fight enemies, you and your troops gain experience. Your troops get stronger with each level of experience and when a unit reaches level 3, you can upgrade them to a better unit, but demons can't be upgraded and have only one level. Upgrades can be done in any available town of the right race (human troops get updated in human towns etc.). Not all kind of towns will be available though, since you will travel to far away lands.You aid your troops with spells, healing and empowering them, summoning Magical spirits to aid them. You also have a wide variety of damaging spells you can use on your enemies. Spells require mana to be cast, with no mana you can cast only the spells you put in quick access (F5-F9, F10 summons Magical spirit and can't be changed). After casting a spell from quick access, it takes a while to regenerate. When you gain experience, you can use it to learn new spells, learn new skills or upgrade your max mana, mana regeneration or maximum army size and more. When you reach a new level, a new set of spells gets available. There are three schools of magic available - Nature, Chaos (fire) and Energy. You can study them all or you can choose what spells you wan't, but spells have dependencies, that is, to learn a higher spell, you must first learn the necessary lower spells.  The dependencies are indicated with vertical lines that connect spells.The towns also can level up, to do so, they need resources - wood, stone, food and gold. The town has peasants who work in mines, sawmills and windmills and delivers the resources to town. With every new town level, new set of troops gets available.The game itself proved to be fun and interesting. Just as I thought that it has became boring, it spiced things up, thus keeping me entertained. There are also some hidden surprises, like a chance to add a demon to your army. The game is old and it's noticeable via the graphics, but it runs smooth and it doesn't hurt the game play. I can't tell about the other languages, but at some parts English dialogs were terrible. Overall I would recommend this game if you like RPG or RTS games, this game certainly delivers what it's supposed to.			"

												One of the rare strategy games that I liked (along with CnC Generals and a few more). Well written story, pretty bad dialogs, not really balanced as you can have so much gold and troops easily, and a few other glitches / bugs but all in all 9/10, because I just liked it lol			"

												The game itself is poorly made, and doesn't really make sense. Might and Magic may have some pitfalls that you can't overcome due to technicalities, but at least it's playable to a point and enjoyable. This game is just horrible. It's really cheaply made. The interface doesn't really make sense. A good game is one with depth but also one that you can more or less intuitively learn the controls for. This is not one of those games. It's shallow and hard to understand how to even play at the same time. The worst of both worlds.			"

												A lot of grinding and a lot of walking. Difficutly ranges from easy to ""maybe suicide isnt such a bad idea"". The story is bland and only there to take you from level to level, but it does its job.There are a lot of cool spells and most of them even have a use. Spamming fireballs and healing alone isnt enough.Sometimes a unit gets stuck in a corner, then you just have to bring the whole troop back to unstuck it, which can take a while. The biggest problem of the game is the walking, which is sooooo boring. But the combat makes up for that.Oh and sometimes the music just ends for no reason, happens quite often.  "

												This game's concept has real potential. Personal magic abilities that you can level combined with RTS elements really do seem like they would be interesting. But this game's implementation isn't polished enough to find enjoyment in the concept.The UI is very clunky, some menu items couldn't even be read. The sound is painfully monotonous - ""Yes!"" and ""At your command!"" became so annoying, I just had to turn all sound off. Would have been nice to have a ""Unit feedback"" slider or even toggle.But really it was the gameplay that made this painful. A common bug I experienced was a unit getting ""hung up"" on something invisible, and a few members of the unit would stay behind, and the others would move at a snails pace with the formation. That was basically a level-restart situation. Also the game involved soooooo much marching. The ratio of time spent marching units between objectives and actually doing interesting things, like fighting and casting spells, was way off.So, potentially good, and it might be worth it for the curious. But for those looking for a fun RTS, I cannot recommend it.			"

												I've spent many many hours into this game before it was even on steam.Here's what you need to know about the game before you get it : The tutorial is very poor.That's why I've dropped some instructions below.The game is difficult and that's one of it's charms.Difficult but not frustratingly-impossible to beat.All you gotta do is upgrade and preserve your forces as best as you can. This is one of those games that begs for a remastered edition. It's a one-of-a-kind RPG+RTS experience. You get to play as a mage (well .. the spiritual projection of his body sort of).You earn experience and gold throughout the campaign,which you use to upgrade your skills and your army. There's a pretty large variety of spells you can cast to protect / buff your forces or weaken / damage your enemies. The graphics are pretty dated,but there's artistic integrity to the whole thing and it just blends,especially with the soundtracks. The story is pretty interesting,but it could have used some more depth. The combat gets really difficult as you progress through the campaign.That's one thing I love about it.There's no easy mode.You must figure out a way to get through each level and you must conserve your gold so you can upgrade your forces and have back up in case you lose men.Also I strongly suggest you collect all the artefacts from each level,that are scattered across the map.You'll get bonus experience for killing the monsters guarding them + gold.You'll need all of those as the game gets really hectic around mid-levels.You MUST study your enemies' weaknesess in order to preserve your number of troops.Undead mages are the biggest threat in this game,followed by zombies.You must freeze the mages and rush your forces to kill them first.Also zombies are pretty much defenceless in close-quarters ... dropping some hints so you don't quit on level 1.A tip from me : Use the healer as a character,you can't afford to lose troops in this game.If you lose an elite squad,you'll have to restart the level and make sure you keep them in tact,because you'll need elite,experienced troops with artefacts for the future levels.There are a couple of levels that backstab you and grab all of your forces,leaving you some 0 experience fresh squads,but their disappearance is connected to the story.- - -TL;DR :Pros:Great RTS+RPG game concept,that's well executed.Large variety of units,spells,artefacts and a lenghty campaignAwesome game design - model,environment,effects and sound just blend very well.Prime example of artistic integrity.Pretty hectic and difficult campaign.Cons:No tutorial .. just preserve and upgrade EVERYTHING! Find artefacts and stack up gold!Pretty hectic and difficult campaign.This is Single Player's plus and minus.The multiplayer is dated and doesn't run very well.If you wanna try the game,get it for the Campaign!For people who haven't played this game in their youth/when it came out,the game might feel really sturdy.Some bugs with music fading in and out ; single soldiers from a squad getting stuck in the terrain,dragging the whole squad down ;4/5 from me .. Get this game if you're into oldschool games!			"
