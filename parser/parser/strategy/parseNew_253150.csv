												Halfway is a pretty looking sci-fi turn-based strategy RPG, otherwise known as an instant purchase for me. The game looks, runs, and sounds great, with its pixel style retro look and low key, mood setting sci-fi soundtrack. Without even playing, I could tell this would be something I would enjoy on principle alone, but then I played it.The game flow is par the course for the genre. You move, they move until one side is dead. However, in Halfway, the mechanics are the first stumble. People who've played in the genre can guess the nuances: there's cover bonuses for you and the enemy, certain weapon types perform better up close or far away, and each squad member even has unique statistics and abilities. Some can cover more ground, others can take more hits. Very quickly, however, I realized that while all the pieces and formulas for a great game are there, Halfway seems to have skewed the numbers diastrously. Spot an enemy out of cover down a hall, well within your weapon's given effective range? Expect a base 25-30% chance to hit: that's all. You can, fortunately, give up your squaddie's move for that turn in exchange for increased accuracy, but wait, it merely climbs to 50-55%, if that. Expect several turns where neither side will land a hit. Then you need to spend AP to reload, which makes firing without that accuracy bonus pointless. Oh, and now the enemy's shields are back up. Whoops, now you're out of ammo. Yes, in a game where you're at the mercy of 10-50% chances to hit, you are stuck with limited ammunition. In one mission, I spent fifteen minutes chasing two enemy units around a circular room. They couldn't hit me, but I had run out of ammo from missing my own attacks as well, so I had to resort to punching them to death.Well, perhaps my two scrubs would grow up to be gunslinging badasses. I was wrong. I pushed on, and soon my squad jumped up to five. While they all had various, interesting specializations, the game was still taking far longer than it needed too, and not just for the mechanical failings stated above. Halfway is also lacking in several minor mechanics that, when paired with its skewed mechanics, it all build up to an annoyance I can't deal with. No auto-ending turns, no auto-switching after a squaddie uses up his turn, no access to options unless you're at the title screen, very little explanation for the statistics.Halfway would be a spectacular addition to the genre. It almost seems silly to not recommend it solely because hit chances are too low, but while playing, this creates such a maddening environment that I cannot stomach  playing for more than a mission at a time. Guns are useless, and cover and tactics doesn't matter when you're chasing mutants up and down hallways to beat them to death. Playing like that shatters the mood of the game and the point of the genre, and as far as I'm concerned, that is inexcuseable.			"

												I really wanted to like Halfway, I really did. The game has amazing pixel art and a great soundtrack - my favorite since Dustforce's! However, let me bullet point why I feel Halfway is just a ""Halfway"" done game.1- The storyline starts off with a cool half-life type premise. Aliens invading from another dimension. And it happens when the ship jumps, its a cool concept. But the game does not tell you anything for 5 hours of play about why this is happening. For me this was just too much investment to learn so little.2- Combat starts off neat with each character you control having a passive ability and a unique ability to them. The way you increase your power is by equipping better weapons and using stims to increase stats permanently. The problem is that there is a serious lack of variety in weapons...the only thing different between the guns is their range and damage output. This gets boring very quickly as you find out that sniper rifles are the best in every situation due to their long range, ultra high damage, and mid-range magazine. There is no real reason to equip any other gun you get. The same can be said about the armors as well. The game trivializes its own item choices and hampers you with a very small inventory system so that you do not want to keep any other guns around.  3- Repetition of design. This game is a linear story with static level design. There is no randomness about this. Now this is not a flaw by itself, but it becomes a flaw whenever each level is the same as the last for five hours. There is very little character interaction, story developments, and interesting combat challenges that make the levels fun. I had fun for the first two hours as I learned the game. My last three hours have been boring and repetitious. Combat is not very interesting as there is not a lot of elements to engage you to move your troops around. You basically shoot until you hit, not needing to get to better cover or use a weapon at the right time. This made me cry as a tactical gamer.4- Itembase. After each mission you get to go to the store to buy goods but you can never buy anything worthwhile, just ammo, shield, medikit, and grenade refills. This sucks! The store gives you nothing to look forward to and should be a reward mechanism in the game. This makes the store feel like an after thought...why not just cram extra refills of stuff in each mission and skip the damn store.TL DR - The storyline, combat, items, and character interaction all suffer from a lot of repetition. I love xcom, the ufo series, jagged alliance, and a lot of other story driven/tactical based games like mass effect..and even indie games that bear a lot of repetition of combat like risk of rain...but this game never does anything interesting with the game foundation it sets up.

												I initially did not buy this game due to Friggleswitz's review.  I couldn't find much data about Halfway; not from reviews online, not from videos on YouTube.  After he revised his review to be more positive, I decided to buy it.  I'm really glad I did.The ""complaints"" about this game are doing it a grave injustice.  For 11 dollars, I have zero complaints.  The storyline is interesting, the characters each have their own personality and abilities, and I love the music.  Thematically, it reminds me of System Shock 2 or Dead Space.  What irritated me most was the complaint about characters not leveling up.  Every game nowadays seems to include xp and leveling simply to have that mechanic in the game.  It doesn't matter if it adds anything, gameplay-wise; it's just a matter of having numbers that get higher.The way Halfway handles progression is by giving you better weapons -- plasma rifles and flak shotguns -- and it works well.  I don't feel a lack of game without experience points.If you're on the fence and NOT expecting an AAA title, but rather a solid and fun game from an indie developer, then I strongly recommend Halfway.

												I was late to playing this game, so I didn't have any of the bug problems other people seem to be complaining about.  That said, it's a really well done game about 50% the way through, and then the whole system falls apart at the end.  Really poor balance of gear and stat buffs vs. the enemies, so the only way to get through to the end is to kinda put everyone on overwatch until you can create a hallway of death your enemies will blindly charge into.  There are also several characters you have the option of bringing with you that are just huge liabilities to your team, while others are quite overpowered.  Overall ""Halfway"" was a really appropriate title.			"

												Having just finished Halfway, I can say this is an incredible game. From the soundtrack, to the unique enemies and battlefields, this game always leaves me guessing. I soon choose favorites among my squad, which was a mistake. The new types of enemies made it very difficult to roll out with the same squad every battle and expect to come out ahead. Although this 8-bit game doesn't reinvent the turn-based strategy wheel, it does change things i feel are for the better. Unlike X-com, your squad doesn't level up based on combat experience. There are stims which increase attributes and weapons to be found on almost every map. No one dies, they are rendered unconscious until combat ends, (which doesn't always mean ending the level) Recently there was the addition of a map editor, which i have yet to try, but I'm very excited to dive into. I've been told that there will be a place where you can upload your own maps, and be able to play on other's. All in all, this game was exciting (and freakin difficult) until the very end. If a second Halfway happens, you can be sure I'll be picking it up. Hell yeah I recommend it.			"

												Halfway is a horror/survival/tactical squad combat game that is part Aliens, part XCOM lite. The plot is simple enough... You are aboard the colony ship on a journey to another planet when you were awakened in a dark ship, signs of combat everywhere, nobody around. What is going on? What happened to the crew of thousands? As you explore the ship, you encounter / rescue other survivors, each with some special abilities, and enemies that seem to have taken over the ship. Can you figure out what is going on, and find a way to get out alive? The game is drawn in an 2D view with a complete cover system, and the somewhat low-res look is retro-ish and rather charming without overly distracting. The game lets you walk around in ""real-time"" until enemies are encountered, then it becomes a turn-based game where you and enemy alternate turns, all of his units vs. all of yours. You will also have to rummage through containers looking for supplies, such as health kits, shield rechargers, better weapons, and grenades. Occasionally you'll run into hypos that will enhance your stats. Each character has 3 stats: health, agility, and aim. Health is your hitpoints, agility is how far you can move per turn, and aim is how well you aim your weapon. Combat is simple: each character has 2 action points per turn. It can be spent on shooting, moving, or misc actions such as ""use medpack"", ""reload weapon"", and so on. If you have no visible target you can also set your guy to ""retaliate"", which means s/he will shoot at any enemies that fired on him/her during the enemy turn, but only once.  You can mix actions, like shoot then move, move then reload, and so on, or just make a long-distance dash. There is no ""reaction fire"" or initiative in this game, only retaliation fire, which can be somewhat frustrating to veteran players of other turn-based tactical games. But once you get used to the mechanic it works just fine. There are multiple types of enemies as you advance through the plot, and the difficulty starts ramping up, but you also get better weapons to compensate. The simple Mk I weapons don't do that much damage, but are adequate against the weak enemies you encounter. By endgame you have to wield Mk III weapons that do much more damage. you also encounter armor that initially provide little protection, but by endgame you'll encounter Mk V or even Mk VI armor that provides tremendous protection, but enemies can do a lot of damage as well, and is heavily protected. Cover mechanic is very important, as a ""full cover"" imposes a -30% to-hit penalty on enemy shots, and that can be significant. Half cover only gives enemy a 15% penalty. Your armor can reduce incoming damage as well as outright absorb damage with its built-in shielding. The shield automatically recharges after a few turns, and if you can't wait that long you can use a shield recharge pack to recharge it at expense of 1 action point. They come on small (5 pt), medium (10 pt) or large (20 pt) sizes. Similarly, medpacks, also comes in small / 5, medium / 10, or large /20 sizes except they heal your HP. Each character also comes with a special ability. One guy has a ""radar"" that can reveal all bad guys on the map (obviously that's moot the next turn, but it's good to have an idea). One can paralyze an enemy for several turns. Another can overload an enemy's shield (i.e. no shield for X turns). Yet another can teleport. To win the battle you will need to figure how how best to deploy the assets that you have, be it grenades, armor, weapons, but also the special skills of each member of the team. Usually you can only deploy 4 members out of 8, so choosing whom to bring and how to equip them is a major consideration. Fortunately, as mentioned before, you are welcome to search the boxes for supplies. You can also recycle anything you no longer need (like obsolete weapons and armor) so you can use the energy to synthesize stuff that you do need. Killing bad guys also yields additional energy. The enemies in this game have different tactics. Some dance at a distance, some rush, but all are nasty. If one of your team members had fallen in combat, don't worry just yet. If you can defeat the current batch of enemies, the member will recover (with 1 HP) at conclusion of that combat phase. However, keep in mind that each mission can have multiple combat phases. As you explore the ship, you can go on ""side missions"" which will yield additional loot, and adds to the background of each character. Having completed the campaign, I'd say I enjoyed this game quite a bit. It is occasionally frustrating, but usually due to my poor tactical sense or lack of preparation (bringing the wrong team members or wrong equipment). If you like the tactical turn-based combat genre, you should give this game a try.			"

												This is a fairly slick tactical game in the vein of X-COM.  I'll keep this short:Pros:- Nice graphics in a pixel-style with a lot of complexity if you stop to take it all in.- Great soundtrack.- Satisfying gameplay.- Interesting armor options with stat boosts.- A few secrets here and there.- Decent cover system.- Perk system (each teammate has their own active & passive perk).Cons:- The ""retaliate"" feature is interesting yet flawed and could really use an ""overwatch"" to round out the tactical options.- The UI and controls can be touchy/janky at times and it's never quite clear how best to exit out of screens such as container looting.- The ending is a bit more anti-climactic than I would hope for, and the story hints at much bigger things than are ever fully revealed.- You enemies often seem like they have much better accuracy that even your most upgraded teammates, which can make the game feel unfair at times (somewhere around the last 1/3 of the game especially). - Once you start getting upgraded sniper rifles, there is almost no reason to use anything else.- Occasionally a piece of cover seems to not really give much cover at all (the angle at which frontal cover becomes negated is not clear).My playtime was approx 15-18 hours on the first playthrough.Overall I definitely recommend the game to anyone looking for a tactical game with a medium length, if you can overlook some jank and less-than optimal design decisions in terms of rounding out your tactical options.

												I was surprised Halfway hasn't gotten more attention, what with XCOM and other turn-based squad games being so popular in recent years. The promised sci-fi stylings and tactical combat made it an easy sale purchase for me, despite the lack of buzz around it. Now that I'm nearing the end of the game I think I can understand why it flew under the radar, but I also think it deserves a little more attention for what it accomplishes.Halfway starts you off in control of Morten Lannis, a space marine-looking dude aboard a junky colony ship called the Goliath. He's come out of cryosleep way too early only to find the ship overrun with some very unfriendly types, and it's up to you to help him survive. The way you do this is very similar to how XCOM or the recent Shadowrun games operate. Outside of combat you can move around freely, talk with people, and loot containers. Combat is turn-based, with each of your characters having two (and only two) action points per turn. These points can move them around the grid maps (distance dependent on their agility stat) to find cover, attack enemies, reload weapons, use items, and so on.It's a very familiar system with only two real stand-outs, the aiming system and the Retaliate option. Veterans of XCOM will notice that the hit percentages in Halfway are really, really low. Starting out, you're going to see a lot of 40-60% shots even from just a few squares away. The reason for this is that you can add action points to your attack to boost its accuracy. A one-point assault rifle shot may only sit at 50%, but adding your other point might kick it up to 75%. This is less important for shotguns but vitally important for sniper rifles, which have very low base percents but get a huge jump from the second point, simulating the need to set up and aim. As for Retaliate, it replaces the familiar Overwatch response with a sort of revenge, where your character returns fire only if attacked. It's not a bad idea but has very limited functionality in practice, and you're usually better off healing up or reloading if you have an extra action point to spend.Additional characters will join you as you progress, each with their own stats and special abilities. There's plenty of gear to find, including armor (which uses Halo-style recharging shields), grenades, and stimpaks which can permanently raise character stats. You'll need to use everything you find because enemies in this game do not screw around. The campaign spans about two dozen missions, some optional, some multi-part, and all pretty harrowing. Enemies follow the same rules you do, terrible hit percentages and all, but very quickly the game starts stacking the numerical odds against you. By the mid-game you'll be facing up to a dozen foes at once, with the potential to lose a character in a single turn if you're not careful (dead characters revive at the end of combat).This is where the game starts to grate, because not only is it a long haul through tons of enemies, there's not much variety to the enemies or the combat. For the first 5-6 hours, you're going to be blasting melee dudes and ranged dudes. Only after the halfway point of the game will you start seeing things other than dudes, but this includes things like heavily-armored turrets that only really add to the frustration. Failing a long mission after a bunch of samey combat is incredibly discouraging, and there are some missions in the middle where this is very likely. Missing three 80% shots in a row is very much a thing that can happen, and I definitely went back and forth between enjoying and raging at Halfway for a few nights, I'll admit.After my last bout of frustration, though, I soon found myself eager to get back to the story. For all the flaws of the combat, the story and atmosphere of Halfway is fantastic. Each of the characters is unique and they all have important relationships that play out through the plot. The banter between them is excellent, with plenty of genuinely funny moments. Even the basic ""ship under siege"" plot has some interesting twists to explore. All of this is told against a surprisingly deep backdrop of dystopian future society, where people are separated by classes and basic human rights have been reduced to an alarming degree.The pixel art is top-notch, with smooth animations, cool visual effects, and fantastic little details to find on every map. Sound is up to the task as well, with some really meaty weapon and hit sounds and a somber soundtrack reminiscent of FTL or Risk of Rain. The interface suffers from some bugs, however, making it hard to click on certain option or map elements, and it's bad enough to be distracting. Between that and the combat frustrations I did consider giving up on Halfway a few times, but I'm glad I stuck it out. For the price it's a rich and engaging strategy game that'll last you 15-20 hours, provided you have the patience to push through the rough parts.			"

												The story is interesting but ultimately the game fails because the design is BAD. The game labels itself as an RPG, but there are very few, if any RPG elements. All encounters only have one flavor: Combat. And even in combat, most of the levels have very few solutions. In other words: Try to find out what the designer intended, and if you don't, restart the level. This becomes especially true later on in the game where when your team is very underpowered and enemies become abhorrently hard and come in large numbers. The game features a save system that only allows you to save at your ""home base"", meaning that if you missclick and cause one of your characters to walk somewhere in combat you didn't mean to, you'll have a great chance of failing the encounter and you'll have to start over. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME, it is unfortunately abysmal in its execution. There are many better games out there if you want turn based combat, like Shadowrun (the RPG, not the FPS). Do not get this game, you will be disappointed.			"

												Halfway starts with a lot of potential but in the end fails by about 1/3 of the way into the game.The game relies on too many enemies and a lack of supplies to make the game ""challenging"".  Before the halfway point of the game I found that the combats were simply too unbalanced to make the game enjoyable.  You are often found needing to use half your team or more to kill one base level opponent when the team is typically out-numbered 3 to 1 while the opponents inflict an equal or greater amount of damge to your team.The designers probably intended creative use of terrain to be an equalizer except the cleverly programed AI uses the exact same tactics and seems to have much better ""luck"" when it comes to hitting their targets.  I lost track of the number of times that the heroes missed with a 70-80% to hit chance.In the end the game ends up a series of combats that degrade into cycle of constant take damage-heal-take damge without the ability to inflict sufficient injury on your opponents in return before being overwhelmed.

												First impressions of this game were; wow, a retroish 2d strategic scifi rpg. Very nice graphics, sounds and music! The game starts and for a while everything is great... but then the plot is getting boring, some seriously unbalanced battle elements are introduced, boring enemies, very stereotypical characters and the whole game is already well over the halfpoint. You can't predict what kind of stragey/team/equipment you need for each mission, and the whole play is mostly guess-and-fail; trying something little different and failing again... at the beginning the enemies are almost too easy and after some missions they are way too numerous. Using time to plan missions over and over again is not worth the empty  plot. The first game that comes in comparison is Shadowrun Returns, which is actually the same game in principle but with different engine/story/characters/etc. Actually this game made me hope Shadowrun Returns would have been made with this game's engine, and with dragonfall story/characters/gameplay balance. That would have been perfect.			"

												Finishing the whole game i will now share my thoughts:The game itself is very good, and though a bit short if you grab it on a sale you´ll be more than pleased with what it has to offer. Rather simplistic but entertaining in its own way, with good aray of characters, each having his/her own personality.The difficulty can be frustrating at first, but once you get a bit more into the meta game and learn how things work, you´ll get used to it, even so it can be challanging at times. The graphic is pretty neat, you can see its been made as best as possible while maintaining the pixel like vibe.Now i would love to see a second installment of this game, but some things that were lacking in this one would have to be ironed out.*Longer play time*More side missions, maybe even randomly generated*TRUE leveling system, instead of using stims*Greater Variety of enemies, more items.*Continuation of the story, more fleshing out of the characters.These are mostly things that i found lacking, and should these be addressed properly i would love to buy the next one.Overall i recommend this short, yet fun and challenging game, Might surprise you rather nicely.

												Halfway is game where you control a squad of characters aboard a Dead Space-like space ship. The gameplay is turn-based strategy as soon as you encounter enemies, meaning you will need to use action points to move your characters into shelter, reload weapons, fire weapons, use health, etc..As long as any one member of the squad survives, you can even go on if one of your squad mates is killed.Gameplay is very reminiscent of the original Fallouts or X-Com.The story campaign is basically your standard Alien invasion plot, but the actual missions are well crafted and not too long. In between combat you can explore the environments and learn more about the main story.The story is well written and all characters have their specific voice. In combat, everyone has a unique special ability, so you can adapt your gamestyle using this.The visuals are good, pixel art style but with nice features like line of sight (enemies are invisible if they are not in view of any character), interesting screen effects whenever a character is hurt or has an psychologically episode, and the soundtrack is fitting.A very charming game and one I'd recommend to any tactical RPG fan.

												Okay, this game is heavily XCOM inspired. Which is something I like - turn based tactical strategy is something I dig. And this game is pretty neat and simple.But there is something funky about how percentages are calculated. I played a LOT of XCOM on Ironman Impossible. A. LOT. I know what it means to roll on numbers. But Halfway is seriously overcalculating my shot percentages before the shot actually goes out. 74% usually feels like 40% based on my experience. I raged-quit after my dedicated sniper missed 3 of those in a row, followed by a 90% shot that failed. Protip: Expect anything, ANYTHING, under 100% hit chance to miss. Also, don't assume this same rule applies to enemy. If they can hit you, they will probably hit you. Spec your characters to have a high aim chance, give them heavy weapons, and armor with damage mitigation. Dodge chance and movement rage are underwhelming as stats. Health stimpacks may not even be worth it. You want all your characters to operate as tanks - just make sure to carry extra medkits. Now you may be thinking that I'm unlucky, or that I'm a sore loser. I ain't gonna change your mind on that, so feel free to ignore all of this. But I am pretty dang sure there is something off about the numbers I'm being shown - and I'm hoping that it's not something added in for artificial difficulty.I want to like this game. I really do. But I'm just kinda done with it after getting regularly f----d in this regard. It's beyond frustrating. "

												One of those games that needs a 'maybe' recommendation.Halfway is a squad based, turn based tactics game. Everyone has two actions, move twice or move and shoot or just shoot (and add movement to the accuracy of the shot %), or use items etc.The story starts off interesting enough, a decent if cliched idea is there but it is never expanded upon. Squad interaction is limited, although there is supposedly tension between the squad members, very little comes of it. It feels an incomplete story, one that moves but never quite gets anywhere.The battles themselves are fun at first, but become an endless grind of frustration. Shots miss with alarming frequency, even high % shots miss so often that really, there's no actual reason NOT to take a low % shot, because it feels as if it is just as likely to hit if you fire at 1% or 99%.On top of that, weapons are unbalanced. Shotguns require closing the distance, and suffer such extreme penalties to aim % that it is not really feasible to regularly use them without putting your squad in considerable danger, especially as a shot from 4 tiles or less isn't always likely to get you anything more than a 50% hit anyway, less if the enemy is in cover.Rifles are the 'average' weapon, but pale in contrast to the superior sniper rifles, that can shoot from miles away and benefit from your squad being static. The mechanics even support it, because you can add your movement points to the shot %, it is usually far better to stand still and take a single shot each round, rather than move and shoot at all.Mechanics of the fight never really change, it is generally 'kill all the things', and even the method of the enemies appearing (a plot point) wears very thin after the 20th battle in a row where you reach an objective only for the 'event' to happen and enemies spawn out of nowhere for a battle to begin.There are a number of squad mates to use, but only a handful are generally useful to bother with. There's no levelling system, though you can adjust character stats with items, they inevitably become stacked towards trying to get them to shoot with a reliable shot %.As such, this is a decent but severely flawed game. It requires considerable patience to get through, and can be insufferably frustrating to deal with. Worth trying on sale if you're a massive fan of the genre, otherwise be fairly warned.			"

												I'm writing this review only minutes after finally completing the game and on the whole it's a thumbs up from me. It's normal to look back and remember the game fondly but I'm not going to pretend that Halfway doesn't have it's share of frustrating problems. Your enjoyment of the game is going to depend on how well you manage said frustration.First make sure you turn off the dialog sound as it becomes grating very quickly, follow that up by turning the footsteps volume down and make sure you are changing between your characters with your keyboard numbers. Next be prepared to accept that your going to miss a lot of shots on your enemies in the game due to the wonky percentage numbers.Now on to what you can enjoy! The game really picks up as soon as your start filling your squad out and each encounter against the enemy can be quite the tactical tug of war. If you enjoy turn based battles where you are going to have to think about the potential consequence of the moves you make then Halway is certainly for you. Said encounters can be quite slow paced at times but then that's all going to depend on your style of play and what squad members you bring on missions.Side missions will pop up from time to time as you make your way through the main quest and these will normally lead to new squad members, items such and medikits or weapons and armour. They are a decent dsitraction and it's not possible to miss them (they show up in bright yellow) should you be a completionsit like myself :)As for the story? It's a decent enough story that deserves seeing through until the end with a bit of mystey thrown in alongside your usual space fare. The music as you can tell by the trailer is great and really captures the struggle you face against an enemy that often outnumbers you.Finally - remember to take all of your squad members in to the final mission! Makes it a lot more managable.			"

												When i purchased this game i went in pretty open minded not expecting much. Im a big fan of the Xcom games and Halfway claimed to be the next closest thing, This of course is not the case. The combat system is relatively similar to Xcom, only  there are a lot of flaws and can't help but feel that the game is broken.The accuracy system doesnt seem to be very consistent. Some times when an enemy is round the corner from you, it will let you fire at the enemy with a very low accuaracy rating or will say the target is not visible all together when it clearly is, it is quite temperamentel. Regardless of this minor problem the system still seems flawed. A member of your team could be standing two tiles in front of an enemy with no cover an you will still only have around 30% to 40% chance of hitting them. Although you can upgrade the aim of the character with stimpacks which are rare an dont seem to do much as well as sacrificing a go to improve the accuracy, the accuracy system feels frustratingly flawed.When it comes to enemes, nine times out of ten they will have the advantage with improved aim, damage and movement. The enemies tend to go head on rather than flank you unless of course you wonder into an ambush. It seems the shots they take barely miss and the amount of tiles they can cover are a lot more than any of your characters regardless of upgrades.To be fair, for all the faults, the game could have probably redeemed itself with a decent ""overwatch"" system. But no, disapointment is still upon us. The game uses a crappy ""retaliate"" system in which a player will only strike an enemy if they are fired upon while the enemy has their turn.I wanted to like this game, unfortunatley all it is is an extremely watered down Xcom game with all the flaws and none of the perks. 4/10			"

THE LOWDOWN:Halfway is a team-based strategy game with tactical elements infused in a Sci-Fi (movie inspired) theme, story and setting.  Lending more than just a cursory nod to the cult classic Laser Squad, this indie title sees you take control of a lone space marine onboard the spacecraft Goliath.  Out of control and lost in space the ship has been taken over by hostile aliens and randomly makes FTL jumps to who knows where.  The objective is to locate missing survivors, weapons and equipment in order to take back control of the ship across a single mostly linear campaign of around 30 missions.  Gameplay mostly consists of two phases; team and inventory management at a temporary base in one of the ships locations; switching to mission locations where simple objectives must be met, combat takes place and equipment can be scavenged.  Along with the management aspects combat is perhaps the game's biggest draw, making use of different firearms, grenades, unique soldier abilities, ammo conservation, healing with med-kits and a basic cover system to shield your team as they manouevre into position to flank visible enemies.  Exploration and mission set-up takes place in real-time.  Combat encounters are turn-based and are shown from a semi-isometric perspective.  Success sometimes depends on the personnel selected for the mission.THE GOOD:+ Great setting/concept.+ Superb story narrative.  Well-written and perfectly conveyed through character dialogue.  No boring blocks of texts.  I loved it!+ Fast, fun, balanced combat mechanics.  Some depth but if you pick the right team can be easy to beat.+ A mix of easy and difficult levels.  There are some that are really well made and use dynamic elements such as teleporting or hidden enemies that lie in wait to ambush the team.  Adding that extra element to the challenge.+ Great end-boss encounter.  Difficult but fair.  A far-cry from so many other games of this type.+ Very slick interface that allows interchanging of items between team-mates or containers a breeze. Very similar in style to the Endless franchise of games.+ Team-mates dont die, they are merely incapacitated until the end of combat.+ Allows missions to be restarted from the beginning or the previous segment when at home-base, so you can reequip, re-arm, buy equipment from a dispenser or choose a different team.+ I started out thinking this would be a short game but came away thinking it was about as perfect a duration as Ive experienced in an indie game; at around 23hours.+ Doesnt need a state of the art PC to run.+ Zero problems/bugs encountered during playthrough.THE BAD:- Graphics dont look so great on higher resolutions.- Character boosting is done using stimpacks. Making a mistake can be unforgiving.  Make sure you know which soldiers you want to use for ranged or close combat and max those out.- Enemies dont drop items.  They are only found in containers.  Probably the games worst feature. <sigh!>- Linear campaign means its not even semi-openworld.  There are seven optional mission though to allow you to gain some special items and a few extra pieces of equipment.- Once you visit a location grab everything because you can never re-visit it to grab anything left behind.   Would have been good to have a map mechanism to collect stuff with some sort of random event possibly occuring.- No undo button.  Too easy to make a wrong move resulting in getting punished.- Most missions allow you to collect everything from containers.  There are a few that will force you to leave before you get the chance.  So make sure that you move squad members to containers during fights when you eventually get ""all"" prospective team-mates.- Some interface issues when playing in windowed mode.  Mostly on what or where the window is centred on.- Cannot move soldiers into same hex as incapacitated team-mate.  So if faced with entrenched enemies and you cannot move in to engage in hand-to-hand combat, and you have no ammo - you are basically dead.AND THE ORDINARY:* Cutesy pixel-based graphics.  Not really my sort of thing but you may like/love them!* No manual saves.  Uses checkpoint saves after mission start or completion.* Loved the very nice (Bladerunner inspired) soundtrack that matches the pace, feel and mood of the game.  Just a pity there arent more and varied tracks.* Straightforward achievements makes this a possible candidate for achievement hunters but, some are missable and can require an additional playthrough to obtain.  There are a few ""secret"" achievements so be prepared to either ""stage"" them or complete them on a subsequent playthrough.VERDICT:From its Bladerunner inspired theme and SF movie inspired setting.  To its Laser Squad play-style, Halfway is a superbly made and fantastically enjoyable game to play.  Even though I found a few faults with the game I absolutely loved playing it.  It has some very accomplished design and gameplay mechanics that more than fondly bring back memories of the cult Laser Squad game of yester-year.  I'd say its one of those superior Indie titles you should consider if you can overlook the pixelated graphics which even I admit are well-drawn and cute.  There is a decent amount of content for the campaign though some more would have made it a slightly better game.   Overall its an easy title to miss in the plethora of games available on Steam.  Yet it is one that Id  easily recommend if you like squad level, turn-based tactical gameplay with a decent wad of inventory management.  Even with or without a minimal discount its well-worth picking up.Waiting patiently for a sequel! :)			"

												Good but frustrating.Game started out great, was challenging, had to manage supplies and decide what role characters will play in missions. The further you get into the game the more often you'll find yourself with unconsious teammates waiting until the battle is over if you win. And Squad Sizes are always no more than 4 to start the mission with, even though you have 8 people to choose from. There is also a 5 level limit to how often you can safetly level up your characters, after that it will either make them stronger or alter another stat entirely for better or worse.But then the unthinkable happened. A boss fight requiring me to play as four set people, with two other squadmates I barely used during the game. So I ended up with one person who could aim decently, two shotgun guys that couldnt get close enough to anything before they died in an open room, and another girl who I was thankful she could just shoot bullets in the enemies direction. Top that off with enemies I had to use my most powerful sniper rifles just to put a dent into and it quickly became disaster. The game throughts you for a loop as at this time your so used to only having four members on the team on mission, but it allows you to play as all eight, the mission may actually be doable now.The music is excellent, story is decent. My only complaint is a steep challenge, but game is fun playing a couple of missions every day.			"

												This is turn-based game clearly inspired by XCOM:EU, featuring a retro feel and a touch of the “Aliens” movies atmosphere. The game starts well, story wise: you wake up in huge ship without remembering what happened, it seems like most of the crew have turned to monsters and from time to time the ship does a hyperspace jump seemingly at random. It's up to you to figure out what is going on and hopefully find some survivors along the way, which you do in a linear mission path (with some optional missions) that progresses the story, alongside some dialogues in-between.The problem here is that the gameplay mechanics are very simple and not very engaging. There are no character “classes”, each character is a unique individual (you meet more along the way), featuring an active ability and a passive ability. Active abilities like if a shot hits it does more damage, a guaranteed hit, teleportation, self-heal, stuff like this. Passive like extra inventory space, bonus healing with medkits, reloads don’t use an action, etc. You can choose between different armor suits with different stats (aim, agility, health, shield strength, armor), and weapons, but I’ve only seen 3 weapon types: assault rifle, “short range” (shotgun-like) and sniper. Along the way you’ll find better versions of them, but that’s it. Also, you have to bring ammo packs and medkits in enough quantities, which adds an element of resource management that seemed more like a chore and a nuisance, rather than providing interesting strategic choices. You can find various stim packs along the way which give permanent boosts to the stats of one character, but I only felt like aiming was truly relevant, because of what I'll mention next.The enemies I encountered were only the zombie-like husks of the crew, and turrets. The zombies pretty much just run around randomly, the AI is very strange. Your units have low movement and weapon range, the weapons are weak and inaccurate, you fight mostly in cramped corridors and rooms, so the fights turn into looooong crapshoots where most shots miss and so most of the time it's just simpler to run into the enemies to use melee attacks, which always hit. It doesn’t seem like there is any strategy involved, like flanking bonuses, there is no destructible environments, and the abilities you have for your units don’t enable any synergies between them. You can’t tell between the different enemy “types”, and you can’t tell their HP, weapons and damage. And it’s frustrating to realize that it’s better to do 2 guaranteed melee hits (1 AP each) than to fire with full AP (2 AP) for more accuracy, which is very unreliable. Even trying to get close for a shot at close range, supposedly with better accuracy,  is bad, which is not helped by the fact that the movement range is so low.XCOM's ""overwatch"" is replaced by ""retaliate"", which makes a unit shoot back at an opponent that shot at it, and only in that case. But since the A.I. pretty much shoots you from random places, namely long distances, and since your weapons' range is mostly bad, you usually don't hit anyway. Also, without a ""proper"" overwatch, there is no element of zone-control, which is accentuated by the fact that the enemies walk around seemingly at random, as I mentioned, so, again, the enemies pretty much roam around randomly and confusingly.All this adds up to gameplay not being very engaging and after fighting through 11h of it, trying to hold on, not even the story kept my interest going, so I sadly decided to stop playing the game.PS: Also, this game supports but doesn't recommend 1920x1080, only inferior resolutions, and you can tell, since at 1920x1080 the graphics look a little warped sometimes, and the text is small and hard to read.

												First half of the game runs quite smooth, nice settings, nice art, you'd like to interact more with the environment, combat seems to work. A lot of work went into the game and also some good ideas. You feel on a space ship, lighting is just right, decos are Sci-Fi enough, some variations in enemies - melee and ranged, adds interest, sounds are correct. Reading the update news you'll see the effort that went towards balancing the game.Then, ""halfway"" through the game, things change and small glitches become major issues.The story loses interest as dialogues become corny. Team members do not evolve, you'll find some drugs increasing their stats, but you can only use five of them.New weapons have just slightly better stats, even _special_ weapons have just slightly better stats.""Overwatch"" doesn't work - my team hit once in a 19 hours game (once as in only one time). The low hit rate added to low inventory space and low ammo available in any level, means you'll have to use the two action points for each shot, limiting dramatically any strategy to ""run OR shoot OR recharge OR use special power"". Melee becomes nonsense, as any team member out of cover is immediately put out of combat.Levels get longer and longer, ammo stays the same. Once blue and orange armored enemies arrive, combat becomes a drag. Because of the sheer amount of health they have, their shield comes up once or twice before being able to kill them, if and only if all your team member can shoot at the same enemy.Opening the wrong door means one or two of your team will be put out of combat. In a game that saves between levels you are good to start again.You can't see the amount of health of the enemies, if your team members can't shoot or don't have the enemy in their line of sight. I'd like to move and have a last shot at one enemy, but is he dying or in full health? Has his shield regenerated? You can't tell, and one wrong move means the level is lost.Screen centres automatically while you are trying to target enemies farther and farther from your team. At each shot. While you are trying to find the guy.Mouse cursor can't select buttons just under it.Most reviews are truthful and offer the same comments. The same arguments are used for and against the game, so make up your mind. I spent 10 hours playing and enjoying the game, then 10 hours on the last two levels, without finishing the game. It was not worth it. "

												I am almost through the game but I would not recommend it. The story reminds me very much of System Shock 2. The gameplay is cumbersome and very repetitive. There is a lot of dialogue to read (white on black....my eyes like that). Inventory management is gruesome. If you are full of stuff, you can't put stuff on the floor to grab and use a medkit that is in a locker. You have to for example reload your gun to open an inventory slot.The biggest problem is, that the missions are all the same. Grab your sniper rifles (you don't need much else) and kill everything. Cover, tactics, special abilities are not really important.The game is  linear and there is no character interaction possible. It's only 10 € but still...could have been better. Would be a nice game for a tablet maybe.Have a look at one of my videos to make up your mind:

												The current (v1.04) version of the game i cannot recommend.The whole game has the feeling of an open beta. The art work and game principals a very nice, butthe game balance and dynamics are completely off.Battles, and take up more than 90% of game time are no fun. As reviewed by another user, the onlysuitable tactic is to load a characters shields, and knock down enemies in close combat. Dont bother withthe weapons, they seem completely useless. Enemies will hit you from other side of the screen where u can hardlysee them, and you own characters will miss enemies standing a few feeds away from them.All characters must have had very strong martial arts training :)I guess the developers had no time to test the game and rushed for a early release.

												There is more heart crammed into Halfway's beautiful pixels and wonderful game design than I've seen in most AAA titles. I'm super happy to recommend this game, which is really what indie gaming is all about. Somehow on a team of three people they've managed to provide a rich and engrossing experience.I really hope they consider expansions, or using the very nice game engine here to create new worlds.My only gripe is the lack of a feature to automatically switch to the last available action or auto-end turns, which is really pretty standard in turn-based games and gets a little irritating to handle yourself after a while. It can screw up the pacing. But ultimately this is a rather small complaint.			"

												Halfway was a tough tactical TBS game (at least the later half was). It still has a long way to go as far as balancing goes but thankfully the devs have been hard at work balancing the game over multiple patches.Prior to today's balance patch for the final missions, the game somewhat depended on RNG regarding gear drops. I wasn't too thrilled with that after playing the game twice to uncover more secrets and therefore more gear. Fortunately, that same issue has been alleviated with the patch.I would have liked to see greater variation in the character stats. It would be beneficial in my opinion to work with stats in the hundreds rather than the tens so that you could see a major difference between characters. When working with low stat pools, even with stim packs, the characters tend to become similar. The only thing left to differentiate their usefulness is with their passive and active skills.Aside from a few random crashes here and there on the first day of playing, the game was good overall. I thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of the last few missions pre-patch and I'm hoping others can enjoy that too. "

												I was excited for this game after I saw a Quick Look video for it on Giantbomb[www.giantbomb.com]. It seemed to have everything I like. I like indie games, I like pixel art, I like sci-fi, and the footage I saw reminded me of XCOM mashed up with Aliens (one of my favourite movies of all time), so I figured I'd give it a shot.Unfortunately, this game does not deliver. The combat is slow and grindy, the UI is clunky, the inventory management is a pain, the story is uninspired, the characters are completely flat, and the dialogue feels like it was written by a twelve year old.It's a shame, because this game has a lot of potential. You shouldn't be able to go wrong with a game focused on XCOM-style combat, but this game manages to take that winning formula and dial it back a notch. Most notably, this game lacks an Overwatch feature, and instead has ""Retaliation"", which can be fine, but only if an enemy decides to target that specific soldier. This makes it difficult to plan any sort of tactical maneuvers aside from ""sit in cover and shoot when it's your turn"". And, unfortunately, that isn't even fun because many enemies are hit-point dumps and are tedious to fight.In addition, the RNG feels broken - you seem to miss all of the time unless your projected hit percentage is over 80%. I don't know if this is a bug or not, but it was extremely noticeable, especially in the earlier levels.The game's environments are beautiful and highly detailed, but beyond that, there is a marked lack of content. There are hardly any interactable objects aside from a few switches and crates, and the game is sorely lacking in enemy types. After five hours into this game, I have only fought zombies and turrets. That's it. There are no security robots, no drones, no aliens, no corporate troopers or anything that could spice up the variety at all. There are a few different zombie types but they are mostly indistinguishable aside from different colored uniforms. There aren't even any passive combat elements like traps or land mines. All you do is plug one zombie after another, in battles that can take a long time to finish.Another strange note I feel I should mention is the music. While well composed, it felt oddly depressing for some reason. I'm not exactly sure why this is. Perhaps I just felt that slow, languid synths just didn't fit the theme of an action-horror game.I think it's quite telling that this game has been available for a year, but only 5% of people who own it have acquired the end-game achievement. Also, this game is fully Steam-workshop enabled, but there are no mods. Like, at all. One person has made a spanish language translation, but otherwise, there seems to be absolutely nothing available.I'm sad to say it, but I regret buying Halfway. I don't know if I'll finish it. I'm a real sucker for sci-fi (even bad ones), but playing this game has felt like a chore, and I'm not sure I want to dump more hours into a game that has disappointed me at every turn.Buyer beware.

												As much as I wanted to have some weapon variety in the game, it becomes apparent to me from the other reviews (both positive and negative) that the only weapon that actually matters is the Sniper Rifle. As the SN is my favorite weapon, I never head out on a mission unless I have at least Sam or Jenna in my party (usually Sam for the guaranteed crit with Headshot). Little did I realize that RNG is very deceptive in this crap game.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the setting and story and all that. My biggest beef comes from the design of the encounters. The small fry are no problem, but in the later levels, I find myself having multiple issues with the insanely stupid hit chance. In one mission alone, I had three out of four characters miss with a 75% chance or greater in consecutive shots while enemies deal better damage and hit with better ""precision"" despite two conditions: my characters are in full cover and are almost on the other side of the room, far out of operational range for ranged weapons (or so I thought). Multiple times, I found myself raging hard at shots that would otherwise be hits (especially in XCOM; I've never had high hit chances miss multiple times in a row).As for the design of levels, the only difference is the maps. Beyond that, the game conveniently has the ship jump just to spawn enemies. At one point, the game throws nothing but tough melee characters (complete with hard-as-steel shields, which waste one turn just trying to drop them on one enemy) that bullrush your party and hit like trucks in melee. Oddly enough, the damage ranges on the weapons tend to roll the lowest values in melee combat. The same can be said against the armored enemies, which have 1) tough shields, and 2) high damage reduction, which your party has no access to in any gear in the game.I really wanted to enjoy this game. But the difficulty wall slaps you in the face with an incredibly unfair RNG shot system, bullet-sponge enemies in later stages, questionable LOS system, and relatively useless characters later on (not to mention the virtual lack of any actual RPG elements in the game beyond the equipment and ""special"" abilities) make Halfway a promising tactical game that ran a suicide mission and ultimately failed. Skip it.			"

Everything else is unreliable and useless crap.- second half of the game, you will start missing a lot for some reason, while enemy hits you as much as before.- There's no real RPG element to this game- no matter how you would want to use strategy and positioning, 90% of the time when encounter starts, your soldiers will come out on their own and stand in the open due to an in-game cutscene. That's just dumb and infuriating.- I did not know 75% hit chance means ""miss 4 times out of 5""			"

												A short tactical turn-based game set in a sci-fi universe. It's similar to games like X-Com, though I would say probably not nearly as difficult. Character growth is entirely gear based with the exception of items called stims, which increase stats permanently. The game is fairly linear and has an intesting story, though said story is wide open for a sequel to explain things. The game will probably take around 12 hours to complete if you read and do everything, though it'll depend on your skill level.The art style and music are nice, and definitely help the game sink deeper into the tone of the story. The game isn't really difficult unless using the ""New Game Plus"" mod, but unfortunately it doesn't seem like progress carries over, so it's mostly pure masochism mode as there are scores more enemies and they all have higher stats. That mod is optional, though. There are a bunch of modding tools, but there doesn't seem to be anyone making anything with them which is a shame.The only criticisms I have are: Fairly linear, with exception of single stage side missions Lack of enemy variety Shallower mechanics for a turn-based game Camera is kind of sluggish unless using WASD Some minor bugs, like incorrect text in tool tips, etcThat said, Halfway is plenty fun and doesn't drag out despite my criticisms.

												I understand that high quality tactical RPG's are few and far between, that people are desperate for a good tactical RPG  like Wasteland 2 , X-Com or Divinity Original Sin. I understand that despite my warning there will be some of you who still buy this game anyway, I just hope you don't pay full price because the game is definitely not worth what they are asking.I should note ahead of time that I am far from one of these easy game carebears, I absolutely love and absolutely need a solid challenge, like the challenge presented by X-Com and Divinity Original Sin. I like to be knocked back a peg and forced to strategize about how to approach a fight for the second time. It isn't the diffiulty of the game that angers me, its the blatant abuse of the Random Number Generators as a lazy mans means to add challenge to the game. I suspect they tweaked the RNG's in a rush as they ported the game to PC, so that they could attract the hard core PC Gamer crowd to their failed mobile game.If decide to purchase and play this game, be prepared for your character building to feel utterly worthless, in theory and in practice. Be prepared for your 75% hit chance shots to miss 75% of the time and expect your enemies to score criticals every other turn. I am stuck halfway through my second attempt at a playthrough , because I chose the New Game + mode thinking that I could build my characters and equip them well enough to survive. Instead what I got is characters with the best gear possible, nearly maxed agility, in cover and still being hit for 16 shield damage on the first hit and then killed on the second hit from ""1"" singular basic enemy and the mission I am stuck on shoves 24 of them into a tight space where they corner you. I cannot find a video of how to defeat this challenge, because it is impossible to do regardless of how your characters are built and armed. I played it 55 times, before I finally gave up . Oh and when I finally gave up, I was almost to the point of tears of rage, something I have never felt before as a result of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t video game. I am sure that the easier difficulties would be equally as pathetic, for the opposite reasons.As far as the rest of the game goes, the storyline is somewhat interesting, but pretty basic and it seems vaguely familiar for some reason. The character development and or character building is pointless or non-existent, the graphics are one step above pixel art. The combat interface is cumbersome and the hit boxes on your inventory are frequently off, causing you to frequently move during combat and always at the worse times, when you were in your inventory screen trying to reload or move an item over to another character. The save system is annoying and only allows autosaves which only happen prior to a mission and after you get back to your home base. Items like Medkits, Shield Repair Modules and Grenades are waaaaay too scarce and cost waaaaay too much, considering how difficult money is to come by in game and how mandatory they become mid to late game.If your looking for a good tactical RPG in the 15$ price range, there are so many better options like Underrail and even Fallout 1 & 2 if you have never played them before. I wouldn't waste a red cent on this steaming pile of dog♥♥♥♥♥♥ I expected so much better than this from Chucklefish, I trusted them and they let me down big time. I bought this game days after its release, after seeing it advertised on their forums. Since it was Chucklefish, I didnt feel I needed to see reviews before buying it and it turned out being a grave mistake.			"

												It's one thing to make luck such a huge portion of the game.  It's another thing to lie about it to the player.  I did some number crunching and found that, after nearly twenty hours of play, shots listed as being between 50-75% chance to hit will hit between 40-45% of the time with only marginal improvement beyond 75% until, of course, 100% hitting 100% of the time (at least they got that part right).  It is extremely disheartening to lose a level after missing four 70% shots in a row and having your entire team wiped and having to start from the beginning.  This is on the easier difficulty.  Many of the aspects of this game are very promising.  The atmosphere is good, the graphics are serviceable, the story is intriguing enough to keep you going but only if you ignore truly awful gameplay.  Most will find nothing but repitition and frustration here.  On top of that, the UI is mind bogglingly terrible.  There are no options while playing the game, only on the main menu and you cannot save the game manually in order to reach that menu, you must quit out of the current game and hope it auto saved at some point near your current spot.  You're better off finding a different game.			"

												If you're the type of gamer that grew up with an SNES or enjoyed the turn-based classics from that era, this may be something you'd be interested in. I read somewhere, somebody had described this as XCOM with a dash of Aliens, and that's not too far off. The gameplay goes fast enough, with gritty, galactic noir throughout. Percentages, a cover system, ranged and melee, even action points. This isn't exactly formuliac, as it's something we'eve never seen before, but it feels familiar to the player, and draws in sci-fi and action fans alike. These indie wonders are true gems in an otherwise graphically-dependent era in gaming. This game deserves to be played.			"

												I really want to like this game. I am a huge fan of Turn based tactical RPGs ala Xcom. The graphics are neat in a throwback way. The concept is cool. However the probabilties just don't seem to make sense. The game is like reverse storm troopers. I will be behind cover firing at 71% and miss twice. Use another guy who has the enemy in a cross fire at 68% who will miss twice and the enemy in the middle will deadeye me every shot until i am dead. :) Also I hate that you can't do an (attack of opportunity) You can only do retaliate (which only allows saved action points to return fire if the enemy fires at you) which they don't do, they fire at your character who does not have remaining action points. I think they game has great potential, it just doesn't seem to be cooked enough yet to the point where i had fun playing it. I got to the prison cells and just got bored :(  I wish that wasn't true.			"

 A Mixed Bag When I purchased Halfway I thought I was getting a pixel-based XCOM, and to a certain extent, it did live up to that. The game runs smoothly, and its eye-catching pixel art combined with a low-key soundtrack are definitely its best qualities. But how does it play?The basics of combat are standard for the genre. One side moves, then the other side, etc. There's hidden enemy movement like UFO , and each character has a unique abiility.  But, Halfway really doesn't do anything different or interesting with combat. It's as basic as at can get with no environmental hazards  or traps. Sure, there's cover, but compared to its peers in the genre, Halfway implements it pretty poorly. Long-ranged enemies will move so they are 45 degrees from a character's cover and the cover penalty stops applying. The developers should really increase the angle that the cover penalty applies to. Honestly, the cover issue wouldn't be such a big deal if not for the RNG.I usually don't complain about RNG. I had no problems with Blackguards 1, a game maligned for its RNG. Sure, I missed a a few 90%+ attacks in that game, but nothing felt egregious. This game, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ My characters were missing 80% shots on the regular. Even when the text says 60% chance to hit, it feels more like 25%. You can increase accuracy by using both actions for a character, but leads to the cover issue from above. If both action points are used up, the character is stuck in that position, and the enemy, who seem to have a better hit percentage, will light him/her up diagonally. You really start to feel the effects of the RNG about 2/3rds into the game, when the game starts sending armored units with bloated health at you. My final large complaint about this game is the horrendous ui. It feels as though they made it with tablets in mind instead   of a mouse. The buttons are so small and it just feels cumbersome.I guess I should also talk about that plot. It's some banal sci-fi♥♥♥♥♥♥ Its kind of like Aliens I guess? It's just meh though.So, after complaining I did above, I still gave this game a thumbs-up. Why? Well, I would give it a thumbs-neutral, but even factoring the frustrating RNG, the first 2/3rds are quite fun even though it becomes a slog after that. I hear this studio is doing another TBRPG with a pulp setting. I look forward to see if they can improve upon Halfway when it releases.			"

												Hi guys,If you were ever wandering weather you should get Halfway game or not here is my humble recommendation of it.I hope it will clear your mind from all kind of hessitation.I know the graphics is Pixel-ish and my 5y old son calls it "" fizzy"" but graphics for me is not essential. The thing that drag me into this game is :story ,music ,and greed for adventure that Halfway promisses.I absolutelly have dived into this game .From the very beggining I got drag in a story that minute after minute got more excited and unpredictable.I have played a lot of tactical games but this one is a gem.Everything about this game is perfect for me ,this is the game I would love to design If I was a game dev.The action menu as I call it is design very neat ;when you press right button a pop up menu appears around your main character and here you can choose your actions.The dialogs are good and dont sound shabby ; loot is important and by all means don't skeep any lockers ,boxes or crates cos you may loose a very significant piece of armor or weapon.If you go further in game you gonna get new members willing to join your group .Every one of them  has different attributes that will help you go through rough times.Your temporary ""base"" when you get to it will offer you medical center ,shop ,general store room ,and a map where you can plan your missions.  I am still discovering this game but I have wanted to share with you guys my humble opinion...Do not hesitate ,Halfway is worth to buy it...Love it .Dan.			"

												Great graphics! Interesting story and sound design. The game itself is great in the beginning, but there is a lot of waiting involved after your turn, while you are waiting for the enemies to move. In the beginning its surmountable but when you start playing with tons of enemies you are can literally be waiting for a full minute for your turn. Even if the enemes are in the ""fog of war"" You will have to wait around, looking at nothing. Im missing a way to speed things up or skip this.I liked playing it for a while and would like to complete it but its literally a waiting game. You do a few moves.. and wait for an eternity while the computer does its moves. In fact so much that I couldnt get my self to play anymore and Im sad to say i couldnt even finish the game.			"

												Halfway is a pretty fun game for a shallow good time. Having logged a little less than 40 hours into it, there isn't really any replay value, which would be fine if it were a deeper game, but the encounters become repetitive very quickly. There are some side areas where you can score equipment that isn't on the ""main"" path through the game, but the environments of being on the same ship  and fighting the same enemy types over and over (the game does throw a couple curveballs at you later in the game) just makes it not worth recommending.Overall, a VERY solid effort from the devs and if you *really* like games like XCOM or Fallout Tactics (turn-based mode), then this is worth checking out, but don't expect much depth or actual RPG elements.

												The style, art, story, music, and characters are all FANTASTIC! BUT this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥punchingly brutal. If you enjoy getting your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pushed in then this might be right up your alley. In all seriousness, it falls short of good and enjoyable in so many ways. The gameplay is severely limited by the lack of a few essential mechanics.-THERE IS NO CHARACTER PROGRESSION. Characters do not gain experience, stats, level up, or perks AT ALL. There are some rare items that can permanently boost your stats, but the improvements they grant you are MARGINAL at best. -GIMPED OVERWATCH-Many later levels boil down to gear checks, ie- DID YOU STUFF YOUR INVENTORY WITH MEDPAKS and GRENADES BEFORE DEPLOYMENT? IF NOT, PREPARE YOUR♥♥♥♥♥♥-CAMERA SNAP BACK. WTF, I put the camera where I want it. Please do not whip my view back to center on the character after any action/selection. I actually got motion sickness from this horrible camera 'feature'.-UNSORTABLE INVENTORY/STORAGE-EXTREMELY LIMITED AMMO/SHIELD/MEDPAK resources.-MOSTLY LINEAR, with a few optional side quests that may actually deplete your resources instead of providing you with more.I really wanted to enjoy and finish this game, but the Bullet Sponges, unavoidable surprise ♥♥♥♥♥slapping, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ clenching just won't allow me to. Nice try devs, you hit some aspects like a nail on the head, but maybe you need to be reminded that a 'game' should be fun as well as challenging.  Overall Rating: 6/10			"

												A small and enjoyable turn-based strategy game, with interesting character banter, graphics and fitting soundtrack. It is kinda light on the game mechanic side of things (HUD could need a little work) and towards the halfway /last third of the game enemies can become a little tough to take down but overall I enjoyed my time with it. There is a good amount of detail to the spacestation you're on, from the design of it itself, the debris and specially the bullet casings and shells staying on the floor after shooting. I'm not a huge connoisseur of guns and their workings, but seeing that huge pile of metal after your gatling gun finishes business is something I appreciate. "

												TLDR: A hidden gem!  The most fun I've had in a game in the past many months.I purchased the game due to a friend's recommendation.  Oh my was it worth it!!This is a turn-based strategy game with tactical squad-based combat.  Despite its pixel art style, the game is surprisingly atmospheric and contains a nice story that kept me interested throughout the game.This is NOT a rouge-like game, and the level design is simply excellent.  For the 18+ hours that it took to finish the game, I did not find any repetitive elements; each mission feels unique and purposeful.  Furthermore, the story did a great job propelling me forward.In terms of the gameplay, all characters have an active and a passive skill.  Different missions will require different team members.  However, there is no need to worry about leveling them up evenly because there is no experience system; you improve their stats by equipping them with better gears and giving them items that brings permanent stat boost.I find the experience satisfying, but if I have to find something to criticize, it will be the lack of death penalty and its limited replay value.  However, with the introduction of modding options, I am sure that there will be new reasons to boot up this game!			"

												Why this game is getting a ""Mixed"" tag is beyond me.  I am not a Turn-Based Strategy expert gamer; however, the elements of RPG, Retro, Turn-Based and Sci-fi peaked my interest.  The music in the game makes you feel like you are on a ship in space where danger lies in every corner.  The sprite animation is great.  The environment on every level is erie.  You will second guess opening a door because you have no clue what dangers may await you.  The dialogue with the characters throughout your quest is engaging.This game is not complex and fun to play from beginning to end.  As an Achievement enthusiast, I recommended this game.  The Achievements are not difficult to obtain, as you can obtain same in one play through (the Cake Achievement is the only one you really have to look out for).			"

Bizzare and probably imperfectly implemented RNG nature of shooting accuracy system made me frustated a few times because it created barely beatable difficulty spikes at some points of my walkthrough.

												Tentative yes.  I would recommend the Shadowrun Returns franchise over it, however.People complaining about miss percentages are probably suffering from confirmation bias.  I felt like I was landing 50% shots about half the time, 80% shots way more often than not, and so on.  Remember that distance and cover play a big role, because it's, you know, a game about that.Very, VERY rudimentary character progression in the form of stimpacks and equipment upgrades.  Stimpacks have a limit to the number you can use and increase a stat by 1 (with I think 4 advanced stimpacks that increase two stats instead of one).   There aren't enough to kit out the whole party.  Equipment upgrades are more logical.The tentative yes comes from how the game doesn't have that much depth.  This is a good thing (easy to pick up and put down) and a bad thing (towards the end you're making dangerous plays to just finish up the combat already).   There are also some balance issues, but they are minor between characters.  The balance issues stem from ""half of your team is going to be using sniper rifles at any time, because they pack a heavy punch and also they have the longest range.  It's really not fair to the short range weapons that are basically the same damage output but have a third of the range (though I did find the Mincer III to be worth using).  AI is relatively easy to confuse once you've played a bit.  I used the teleporting character in the final battle to basically tie up most of the enemies. Another con is that there are very few enemy types: there are some palette swaps of the zombiesque crew members, some palette swaps of the turrets, a special other kind of turret, tank-armour-esque zombiethings, a spoiler, and spoiler x2 + spoiler x2 +1.   There's not that much tactical diversity to be gleaned from there, though they do a surprising amount with it.The graphics are beautifully drawn pixel art.  The sound is iffy but the soundtrack is solid.  The story is pretty obvious and frustrating as it doesn't resolve any of the character arcs.  None of the character tension comes to a head, and at the end it appears everyone is separated with no real resolution - just a ""congrats, you survived."" It's a well done little game, and if it sounds interesting to you, try it out.  It's obvious a lot of soul was poured onto the project, and who doesn't like a game where the devs cared?  Just make sure it's the kind of game you want to play: a tactical turn-based slog through a derelict spaceship.Oh, it also has modding tools!  The modding tools look really solid.  Unfortunately, there's only 4 mods in the steam workshop; one is a rebalance of the game, and one is a ""get more inventory space.""

												This is a decent 10-15 hour turn-based tactics game. It was enjoyable enough, but while playing through it I couldn't help but think it needed something more. It's fairly simple and could have used some more complexity and variety. It plays like a simplified XCOM (2012) with added inventory management. Equipment is found during missions, and there's a couple of different varieties of weapons and armor but it's mostly a case of straight upgrades. You find 8 party members, each with one unique passive and active ability, and with stats which you can upgrade using a limited number of stims you find. Most missions will only allow you to bring 4 soldiers though.Towards the end it starts to drag on a bit as you've seen all it has to offer, but soon after that the game ends so I suppose it was a good length. There's not really any replayability since it's a linear game with no random levels, although there are a few optional side-missions. The difficulty is good, fairly hard with a few spikes but managable if you're familiar with similar games. There's also a Hard mode mod you can enable if you wish.It's a polished game, with gorgeous low resolution pixel art graphics and good, atmospheric music. The story and setting is okay but nothing special, it's fairly generic with stereotypical characters and mediocre writing. Good enough for a strategy game, I guess. The user interface is a little slow and cumbersome to use, could have been better but you get used to it.Overall it's a pretty good game for the price, it's not very complex but if you want a light turn-based strategy/tactics game it's a pretty good choice.

												Good basic indie game. Basic X-Com/Xenonauts with a decent story and mechanics. Cover system isn't perfect but it works. No overwatch, it's replaced with a counter-intuitive ""Retaliate"" option that lets you counter attack but not shoot when the alien/zombie walks in front of you.Enter ends your turn.1 and 2 switches between squad members.Tab brings up some sort of troubleshooting log?WASD moves the map around.Space bar opens up tactical menu.R reloads.X targets and then shoots at nearest enemies.I is inventory and character panel and should be rebound for easy access. Take some time to read the two first soldiers' special abilities, they're pretty good.ALT highlights all objects you can interact with. VERY USEFUL.At 1600x900 on my Razer Blade 14"" it looks a bit miniaturized, I suggest playing on a lower resolution for good visuals on a laptop. No bugs so far, and mostly good teaching mechanics to get you on a very gradual learning curve. EDIT: I highly recommend 1366x768 resolution, looks much better and easier to read text on a laptop. Speaking of text, the dialogue is well done, well paced and not at all wordy. This is a combat game/simulator that's reasonably fast paced, welcome relief if you, like I, didn't enjoy the talking talking talking of otherwise very good Divinity:OS.May be a bit overpriced but if you're a fan of turn-based or squad tactics games or games with decent story then you could do a lot worse than this, so hit up Steamalerts.com and set up an email alert to buy if the price drops to what you're willing to pay. If I wasn't excited about this game then I'd have set it for $10 buy.			"

You explore the ship gathering survivors trying to survive and escape!Graphics are sprite based and a bit basic, but they get the point across well enough, combined with the music to create a decent atmosphere.Game-play is age old turn based action points. You want to reload, thats an action point. Combining the usual snap shot and aimed shot premise.Inventory could use some work to make the weapons a bit more interesting rather than shotty mk2 is better than shotty mk1.Not got time for X-COM, play a few levels of Halfway to get your TBS fix!

												This game is really uneven. I love the pixelart graphics, the music and the first X-Com games nostalgia that comes with this title. However, on every step Halfway seems to do the right things not well enough. The low budget scares the player at each corner (details in cons). I recommend this only to players in love with tactical strategies with isometric view and pixelated art.Score: 6 (+1 if you loved X-COM games)/10pros:- beutiful pixelart graphics- good music- feeling of a story (for some time)- interesting combat (for some time)cons:- about 6-7 unique enemy models (counting in a boss and one kind of a turret that only looks differently). Diversity is built through colours and different equipment (that does not show on a model - i.e. sniper vs grunt)- a very disappointing ending (""wtf? budget ended too early?"")- not very engaging individual stories of the team members- no interesting equipment - a tank armour seem useless, only scout with high shields seem to be good- all in all boring - ""oh, look - another jump with enemies all around, what a surprise...""

												Halfway is a simple, efficient, beautiful, and deliberate turn-based game that somehow has appealed to me even though most other turn-based games, except chess, have frustrated me otherwise. Its sci-fi plot and music are also extremely fitting, and the dialouge, although limited and short, matches the situation the characters are in and represents each person quite well. Resources are limited and the choices one makes within battle or preparing for one may have huge ramifications on if later levels are completed or not. However, there are a multitude of frustrations. The difficulty curve of the enemies increases extremely sharply within the last few levels, and some may even have multiple stages. While the special moves of characters are reliable, the 'soft stats' (specifically aiming) of a character are confusing and are not quite clear cut. Calculating the hit chance on a target seems to be somewhat better than chance, and don't make sense a lot of times, but this may be due to the fact that the developers attempted to balance certain gun types against each other so all gun types would be used, each for their own scenarioes. However, as a World of Tanks player, such hidden or incalcuble statistics are all too common, leaving me to mostly recognize Halfway's strengths and its synergy of setting, sound, and gameplay.			"

												Enjoyable from start to finish.  I particularly liked the mission structure which allowed me to  get in about an hour of gaming, accomplish a few things, move the story on a bit, and then released me back into the real world.  I could then come back in a night or two, pick up right where I left without a bunch of save game juggling, and do another couple of missions.  I look forward to the next installment (hopefully) in this series.			"

												Beautiful pixel art, x-com vibes, a fair enough sountrack, an OK attempt at a plot, there is a lot in Halfway that I really enjoed. Alas, the most important element, namely gameplay, ranges from frustrating to unsatisfactory at best. Combat involves no tactics whatsoever, and will eventually boil down to landing a lucky shot (against all odds and logic and the overly optimistic ""chance to hit"" predictions) or hoping that the enemy will miss (which won't happen as much as it will happen when the player is shooting).There is no viable strategy that one can use to go around this. Furthermore, even as as early as 12 hours into the game, combat feels really boring, as well. There are, basically, three types of enemy only: turrets, melee and ranged. They will systematically spawn randomly around you, and they'll hit you much with greater accuracy, while being nigh-unhittable themselves.If I were to give this game a numeric score, it's be a 5/10 at best.

Recommended: This is definitely one to add to the 'get it on a sale list' - it's a solid game with well-designed mechanics and a moderately compelling story that, perhaps lampshaded in its title, seems to run out of new ideas halfway through.  It is however most assuredly worth a look if you like a more tactical sort of RPG.Full review is available here[www.highlandarrow.com] "

												This is a good game. It's one of those games, where you can really feel the developer's love and care. The pixel art is great, as is the action and the achievements are really easy to get. Without spoiling I will say that the story was okay, but they used the lame structure of:- what's going on?- we need to figure out what's going on- oh my, there're so many strange things happening- it doesn't matter what's going on, we have to get out of hereEnd it with a possibility of a sequel ... and I would love to play the sequel! 


Great art for a nice game. Hope for a sequel.

												In the beginning I was trying to play tactically smart; retreating and luring the enemy trough a long hallway with a scout, while snipers were at the end, instead of fighting it out in the room where you met the enemy. Funneling tactic: good for killing charging crazed enemies. As in, from a tactics point of view I decide were to fight, not a spawn or cutscene.Then, the space to fight in got smaller, meaning less room for retreating tactically. I learned to not open all doors (ai can't open them) to create chokepoints and avoid my squad being flanked etc.Eventually, I managed to safe all characters, next mission was to get supplies. There, in a room with little cover, I got frustrated and had to quit playing. I play my games carefully and tactically, never rushing into the open. During this mission, enemies spawn in your back. No problem, I figured out another chokepoint (just like in a castle, you can place your squad that only 1 melee enemy at a time can attack). Then, another wave comes and my squad leaves this perfect spot for a small room with 3 entrances for the enemy to charge trough! I defeated this enemy wave all but one, who I sent 13 and Lannis to chase down. Easy kill, but then... a third wave and they are both completely surrounded! The game wanted me to stay in that small room? Shooting it out with an enemy who retreats into cover, without advancing forward (and try to flank etc.)?I love turn-based games but I can't play games like this. The game's art, music, atmosphere and excitement are all there! A little bit more character background could not hurt either. However, the tactical possibilities in the game are not good enough yet, compared to Total War, Xenonauts, Battle for Wesnoth etc.			"

												Nice, but static pixel art that doesn't represent armour or weapons tries to obscure the uninspired design of a turn-based X-Com wannabe with bullet-sponge enemies instead of ai.You don't need to have taken even a basic course of Tactics 101 at the Academy, but you do need perseverance to endure it all the way until the expected and tiresome final boss-fight and unresolved story ending.

												has a good potential but this accuracy problem is ruining the experience.The art and atmosphere feel like a good juxtaposition of dead space and x-com.However, gameplay and scenario do not meet up to the standard. I understand that the conventional turn-based RPG may become slow-paced, but the accuracy is just killing everything. 82% and misses two consecutive shots. sure x-com does have this moment, but not as much as this one does. Eventually the gameplay goes into few characters running into enemy headbutting and the others with high accuracy shooting. Not much of strategy, rather barbarian-going medieval. The system of using higher tech items, not exp points is another discrepancy.Unlike other rpg-styles, players get to loot items for better spec in a replacement to level system, but because of this system, killing enemies does not feel necessary but irritating often. If there is no reward for hunting, then what's the point? If players were to get loot from downed enemies at least would make sense, but the items are provided from lockers and boxes. A market without selling any weapons (aside from grenade i guess) or any gears. A story that derives into mystery ends in mystery abruptly. Has a great potential yet lacking in gameplay and the story.			"

												Halfway is a turn-based tactical combat game, with heavy emphasis on ranged attacks and cover. It’s pixel art style is common in recent indie games, but there’s something about the level and character design that evokes older games rather than newer, trendier releases. If anyone’s old enough (or clued up enough on their classic games) then Halfway might be a strangely nostalgic affair. As a straightforward sci fi mystery/horror though, the story is fine. It’s a bit Event Horizon blended with Aliens and Doom, and it pulls you through to the end. No matter how clumsily handled, abandoned space ships are cool. That’s just a fact. There is some minor character progression, generally through small stat boosts and weapon upgrades, but for the most part, the focus is on how best to arrange members of the team in order to maximize damage output and minimize incoming threats.I really like Halfway. As a turn based strategy game with a great atmosphere that offers a steep but engaging challenge, it’s a good game. It’s still a bit limited, but I want to play it. Again. Right now. And that’s surely a good sign.			"

												Great little gem that made me decide to purchase the Humble RPG Bundle, Book 1.Halfway is a turn-based strategy RPG set in a sci-fi setting aboard a wandering colony ship. Something terrible seems to have happened and a good portion of the story is set around discovering what is going on and trying to find other survivors.At times the cursor acts a little strange, but it's nothing more than a minor annoyance. I appreciate the pace of the story and each character having their own personality.All in all, I highly recommend this game, especially if you manage to get it in the RPG bundle with other titles which look rather promising as well (though I have only played this game so far).I plan on making some mods for the workshop, this will be the first game for which I've done so.

Jenna Wallace is FAR better than any other character with her insane Berserk Skill. With a good sniper she can kill 7+ enemies in one turn.

												Low Tech retro-gaming but if you are looking for a turn-based squad-oriented RPG you can't go far wrong. The game is pretty linear but the story and characters keep it going for what it's worth. Combat is interesting and decisions are thoughtful. The downside is while there are different colors/""levels"" of badguy, the number of actual different opponents you can almost count on one hand. There really ought to be more enemy variety especially for a game as long as it is. All told though, I enjoyed it. No regrets.			"

												Having a lot of fun with the game.  Story and art has a lot of personality.  I'm usually not a fan of this art style but it grabs you in the right places.  Described as XCom meets Aliens is good start with maybe a touch of Elysium.  Some minor crashes but WELL worth the money.  The Hero powers and actives are well thought out and give some breadth to squad layouts.  I played for 4hrs and thought it was 1!  Did I just feel a jump...... A few minor issues and I only point these out because how much I like the game: I didn't realize reloading used up the entire ammo pack; it should based on ammo count; inventory should be part of the context attack menu,   Inventory exit button should be close to the inventory window.  Cover is unclear for diagnol shots,  Field of view is sometimes confusing.  So far enemies always tend to rush which makes waiting in a defensive cover the clear strategy.   Still all these issues are part of the appeal, no tutorial, just jump in because the SHTF!  The discovery process is part of the game!Great game!  Looking forward to getting to the end "

												If you are looking for a tad of nostalgia and enjoy a decent story this game is worth the money. I would have enjoyed more, and hope the game makers will do just that. Continue on the story because I want to know what happens after the ending. I am one of those people that is a sucker for multiple endings, romance and in general everything bioware has done for the RPG games. This game has nothing of the sort, there are information and side missions to be had for gear and stimpacks with in the game by talking to your companions but nothing else. A bit of information about their backgrounds and the like and I do enjoy that part. But it also left a desire for more of a story. The Gameplay is decent as well, the importance of cover and tactics is there but I feel that some characters are far better than others.I would give it a 7/10I had a great time and enjoyed the story, felt it could have been done better or bigger as it where, not graphic wise I find the Graphics fun and nostalgic, music was decent. But the story.... good but with a little bit more work it would have been freaking fantastic. definatly worth the euro/dollars to buy it. Thumbs up to the guys that made this, I hope that they will continue the story of this game. "

												What I liked - It's like turn based Alien BreedWhat I disliked - the game doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing work. It has thrown out about 12 ""unknown exceptions which have crushed Halfway's soul"" .... all in this one level near the start. This combined with the obnoxious setup where you need to finish a level to save the game means that this bug is entirely deal breaking as I can not progress any depth into the game with that crap going on. ""Humorous"" error messages are amusing... mildly... the first couple of times I see them, but when it is every 5 minutes ... nope nope nope.  And every single time it was the same issue.... the game handler can only cope with one enemy making a move at any given time as they go in order, but when the code went to stack an enemy move there was already data where the new data was meant to go..... so the code panics and crashes the game..... to my amazement this even happened when there was only ONE enemy left on the level, which basically really does just boil down to half-arsed coding fail.  Which is inexcusable, when it is this frequent. I also am not wild about the clunky controls. I probably would have played it through and found it ok if it actually worked, but since it doesn't I give this game ten squelchy turds out of ten.			"

												If ever I felt a need for Steam to have a middle ground between ""recommend"" and ""don't recommend"" I'm wishing it did for right now. An open palmed ""Stop, and wait a bit"". The quick of it is that Halfway is a completely solid, if a bit bare and plain, Tactics RPG with a futuristic Sci-fi setting and beautifully done Lo-fi artwork. It's completely worth playing . . . but it will be worth playing a LOT more in about a month or so. The long of it is as follows: The Good- A meaty little campaign that's going to clock in around 10-16 Hours over 30+ missions, which for the cost of the game is than a buck an hour. So, a pretty good value!- Neat little Sci-fi universe that gets more interesting as the game moves along. It's reminiscient of System Shock 2 and Dead Space, but with a growing sense of its own identity. - Really great 16-bit style Pixel art that looks like it's a mix between Tactics Ogre, The Chaos Engine, and Aliens. Seriously, the game looks fantastic for those who like this styling. - A small but excellent set of musical tracks that are very ""Vangelis from Blade Runner"" inspired, which is very high praise as far as I'm concerned. - Good ol' Turn-based Tactics gameplay! Ranged XCOM or Jagged Alliance style! Find the best angles and cover and blast away at your foes!- For the most part, some very good level design. Most of the stages I found to be a lot of fun and I was never bored by them.The Bad- The core fundamentals of the Tactics gameplay are solid, but fairly basic and a bit unfocused. There's not a lot to set this game apart from its competition other than a replacement for ""Overwatch"" that's a bit disappointing and the game lacks it's own unique hook to the concept. It's kind of ""Meat & Potatoes Tactics"", and you're going to want to add pepper . . . but there's no pepper!- The RPG character progression elements seem stripped down enough for an XCOM game without individual characters, but this game has developing individual characters, so these elements never feel like they gel together. - The different weapons don't really feel all that different, other than optimal ranges, and there's an obvious ""best"" weapon with the sniper rifles once the game hits the halfway point. - The tuning/balance is very bonkers. The first third is too easy, the second third feels about right, and the last third spikes up the difficulty to often frustrating levels. On top of that, there are many strange difficulty spikes that just happen out of nowhere here and there because of inconsistent variations on turns the player has no control over. - In general, the game is very linear and scripted and offers little in the way of choice making for the player. The Ugly- The last boss battle needs an overhaul. - The game has been fairly buggy at launch, and it's still missing promised modding tools. It really feels like the ""Soft Beta Launch"" situation that Early Access was meant to abolish, and that early adopters as basically acting as QA for the game. The Betty - To be fair, the devs have been friendly and prompt about dealing with all the issues and criticisms presented to them, and the game's potential and longevity is going to skyrocket once the modding tools are released. - However, there are no actual Betty's in the game as of yet.

												Forward: Halfway is an awesome little game.  I picked it up on a whim and ended up glued to my computer for the remainder of the day.If you're a fan of XCOM and FTL, you'll get a kick out Halfway's gameplay mechanics and art style.  Halfway is almost entirely story driven with little replay value (I finished in 15.5 hours), containing opportunities to interact with the crew, upgrade your party's equipment, and play with a few stats.  Without spoiling anything, I would have liked to see a greater risk-reward element in the decision whether to take optional side-quests, because right now, you'd be stupid not to take all of them.  Overall, the difficulty level feels just about right, with a possible exception for players that strongly prefer to equip short-range weapons--there are areas of the game that are harder to complete without an effective means to eliminate enemies at a distance.  This is a problem that XCOM circumvented by providing Assault-class soldiers with solid mobility and resiliency perks.  While Halfway's three run-and-gun characters *are* more mobile than everyone else, that mobility is arguably insufficient to make using their short-range weaponry fun and effective.  In short, Halfway is an unqualified recommendation from me (not something I find myself saying more than once every year or two), and hope to see the developers apply their abilities to similar titles in the future.

												In space there is the creation of Jump Drives, a system for jumping from destination to destination, but what happens if the jump takes you to a between state of being, and in that state you are no longer safe. What if in that state if you have a specific type of neural implant you can survive this type of jump to all those who don't they either go crazy or get killed? In this game you will need to take a truly rag-tag group of individuals and somehow find a way to take control of a ship that seems to not only be in a ""halfway"" state, but seems to continue to jump to other ""halfway"" states. Halfway is the creation of the development team at Robotality.Graphically you are going to be transported back to an era dominated by pixels, and I'm talking about the games that had pixel art that looked amazing. You will have to get through many different levels, all with different layouts, there will be some of the same stuff population the levels, but overall you are going to have to keep on your strategy hat as you try to map out your actions across the levels. Every character has a different look, and they have a different personality that I think kind of shows in the way that they look. I can definitely tell you that that also applies to the enemies as well, though its more of a, ""okay I can take these guys"" vibe all the way to ""well I better get EXTREMELY lucky if I'm going to survive these guys"". I also appreciated the fact that you got to see your Home Base change throughout the game, it makes it feel more realistic, and it also is more accommodating as you gain characters through the game. The last thing I would like to point out is the map, it did exactly what it should do, it told me where I could go next and then also showed me the amount of progress that I had made by showing completed areas.Alright so the soundtrack is nice to listen to for a while, but it really starts to grate on your nerves if you are stuck fighting battles over and over again. I also really started to dread the sound of certain shots being fired at me from enemies.The controls are pretty straight forward. This is a turn based game so the majority of the time you are going to be using just the mouse, but there are a couple of hot keys that you can use if you want to pull up inventory, or do an special action.Alright lets get right into the game, shall we. At first I was very interested in the story, the mystery of what was going on, and the different personalities as they clashed during the game. The problem was the battle mechanics. At first it was middle of the road in difficulty, you could take a couple of hits, or accidentally not be in cover, and survive, but late in the game it became OVERLY difficult. I do not understand how 4 straight times when I have a chance greater than 70% to hit a target I miss every single time. I also don't understand how I can have the best weaponry I could find and I only take away 30% of an enemies shield and they release one shot and I have no shield. I feel like the developers were looking to have a very tactical/strategy game, but forgot to take their finger off the difficulty piece. This is one of the few games where I have actually had to give up playing because I can't get any further. It takes an enemy 4 well placed shots to take down even the strongest of my party members, but it takes 15 shots to take them down. I wish I was exaggerating, but there are some enemies that if you don't hit them for max damage every time you are going to be reloading more times than they need to kill you.There are some other mechanics in play, such as inventory management. When you have a gun that only has 4 bullets, and then you have a maximum space of 8 in your inventory you now have to factor in the fact that you are probably not going to be able to heal yourself if you want to be able to fight for then entire area. There's also the fact that the loot is randomized so there are times where I received 5 pistols in a level, I've never used a pistol the entire game, and they are much lower in every stat than what I already have equipped. Another mechanic is the stimulant piece, this is kind of like leveling up your character in a specific attribute, be it aim, agility, or life. Funny thing though, even if you have the best aim, apparently you can still be handicapped in comparison to other players when it comes to percent chance to hit. There's also a limit of stimulants that you can apply to a single character, if you go above that number there's a chance that you could really mess up the character's stats.So in the end I think the story is great, the art is great, the feel of desperation is real, and enhances the game, but there are too many inconsistencies, and some really bad logic behind some of the mechanics. This is why I have to say that this is a game that I hope can be fixed, or given a little make over in a couple of ways. If they do that they have ONE HELL OF A GAME, but until then they have a game that gets a 6.4 out of 10.			"

												Halfway really worked for me. After a slow start, this gem of a Turn-based SRPG really settled into an awesome sci-fi groove. I like the pixel art, the combat is fine, and the ambiance is well above par.The advancement is loot based, but fairly deliberate. The inventory management is the closest thing to a complaint I might have. Overall, it's an amazing effort for such a small team. If I had made this, I'd be proud. If you enjoyed Xcom, give this a try. It's not as deep, but the value is there. Give these folks a budget like Firaxis has, and I bet you they'd deliver. Zero regrets; would buy again.			"

												TLDR - Fun lightweight tactics game that doesn't require number crunching, has a compelling story, and isn't terribly difficult but still punishes you for making poor decisions.I really enjoyed the weight of this game.  As someone who rarely finishes even the main storyline for a game I found this game to be of a perfect length with a story compelling enough to keep me coming back till the end.  The difficulty scales up well and enemies are diverse enough to keep you on your toes when new ones do show up.  The pacing never had me bored, once I felt I had figured out a good strategy the game threw something new at me.  The developer knew it wasn't X-Com and didn't try to be.  If you enjoy tactics games but don't want to play something quite so lengthy or meaty pick this game up and give it a try.			"

												Halfway is a sci-fi/survival horror/TBT game. It is a bucket of fun! The graphics are retro 8-bit, but the music and sound effects are smooth.  Controls and gameplay are relatively simple and easy to understand.  Although cancelling an action is sometimes difficult.  The only other negative I would give it is that since the board is made up of squares it's sometimes difficult to know what things will be in your line of sight or not.Overall however this is an amazing game from a fun indie company.  There's plenty of references to other sci-fi games.  The tactics are varied depending on which characters are on your team.  I've sunk around 16 hours into this game and jsut now appear to be beginning the last third of the game.  For the price, the experience has been more than worth it.			"

												A middling tactical top down shooter. Poor graphics of retro pixel art. Story are well told but unfinished. The mechanics are good, but the difficulty is cheater for the abuse of the teleportation of foes: almost all arrive so, ruined the tactical factor: sometimes player can not deploy his squad at will,because the game do it. The placement is important matter, because as every character has two actions per turn, if the team is misplaced can be overpassed soon by a superior numbers of a foes that can appear anytime, anywhere and in sucessive waves with a annoying flash. There are varieties of weapons and armours, but only a couple of each are usefull. Game is short and sometimes crushes, but so all, is fun. Buy with a huge discount.			"

												Quite a good game. Could have used a few of the things that lovers of XCOM and Shadowrun enjoy (toggle-able crouching, saving AP to use auto shooting for when enemies come into view etc).The lack of manual saving is to this games detriment as it makes several levels annoyingly difficult when a simple reload would have done the trick nicely.If the devs are reading this, put manual saving into this game. Your game NEEDS IT.			"

												An indie hidden gem.... This game is absolutly amazing. Just wanted to add that this game, is one of those under-appreciated masterpieces, where you feel alone amongst many, begging to be heard, ""this game is really damn genious!!! guys!! people!! people..."" Btw wrote this while listening to the amazing soundtrack... inspired in BladeRunned it really really suits the game and creates the best matching vibe possible.It brings some of the best mechanics in XCOMM together with some legit aspects of Breach n Clear // Doorkickers.This tactical strategy game, has no useless moving turns or excessive stats to learn and memorize... It is simple and challenging. Without saying much, you are in a massive ship, drifting in space and fighting ""whats left of your crew"". The story is definetly intriguing, not because of originality (yea yea deadspace) but because of the way they deliver it. With surprises and mystery, you gota ask your crew, do extra missions and what not, if you wana uncover the plot. Or just jump straight to action and shoot shoot shoot.With 8 different characters, each with a passive and an active ability, the secret here is forming a good team for each mission. There arent many stats nor gear types, just enough to get you thinking strategically, since the game is definetly not for begginers.Encounters arent about different enemy types, but about being overwhelmed. There will always be more enemies than your crew. So you will have to bait, you will have to make risky moves.Some points that are definetly worth mentioning are:ammo here is a thing, your chars have inventory so you gota think about the weapon magazine and how much ammo they have. A really challenging concept that breaks those monotonous turns in similar games, where all you do is entrench and shoot with 30% hit chance.The ambient is amazing. Seriously they deliver the Space loneliness better than a handful of triple As (alien isolation im looking at you...). With everything tied together, the vibe is amazing.I definetly recommend this game to strategy fans.			"

												I can appreciae some RNG in my tactical games, but more that a little and it gets really anooying whena great strat gets ruined by a hit chance you could do nothing about. And this game is guilty of that more than most. Thought missing shots in Xcom was annoying? It will happen 3 times as much in this game. If you can handle that than go for it, the rest of the game is enjoyable, but it was just so frustrating that I couldn't take it anymore.			"

												Halfway, for me, is something of a mixed bag.  As a big fan of turn-based squad strategy games, a genre (despite its resurgence in recent years) that remains somewhat slimly populated, this title quickly grabbed my attention.For those who appreciate good pixel art, the visual style and artistic quality will be hard to overlook - it's very good.  Some say that graphics mean little when measured against gameplay - and while that's a debate worth having, I value what aesthetics contribute to the atmosphere, just as a good score can get inside my head when watching a film, irrespective of the quality of the script.  The visuals also say a lot about the care and attention the developers have invested into their project.Sadly, gameplay is where I was left feeling a little underwhelmed.  The environments often feel quite constricted, and strategic opportunities limited - which ultimately means that combat encounters don't have much 'individuality'.  They feel repetetive - particularly later in the game, when the opponents and encounters remain all too familiar.In spite of my criticisms, I'll be among the first to buy this developer's follow-up title (Pathway: In Search of the Lost Element), as they clearly have talent in spades - and there were excellent elements throughout Halfway that reminded me that it was very much less than the sum of its parts.

												Could have been a really good game, great story and game play.  Shame.  But it suffers from that problem that all tactical turn based games have, only it's much much worse. You have a 50% chance to hit?  right?  now i think i remember from 2nd grade, that should mean i should hit 1 out of 2 times give or take.   Nope, in this game that means you will hit 1 out of 10.   Ok, i'll just get closer....o good my hit chance has now gone up to 100%!  so......it wont let me shoot, i only then have the option to use a ""melee"" attack, which means hitting the nearly invincible enemy with a pillow.    Ok Ok....i'll try from just 2 squares away, close enough to increase my hit chance, but far enough away not to get the nerf melee attack.  Yay, my hit chance is now 55%!   Also, the enemies have like a 90% hit chance when they're standing on the other side of the map behind a wall.    They can also move farther than you, and still shoot, while you can only move or shoot twice per turn.  Makes a fight that should last 5 minutes go on for god damned eternity.  Again, this massive flaw is found in all games of this nature.  But this one takes it to the point where it's just frustrating and unenjoyable.			"

Characters are varied, atmosphere is suitable, and fights are satisfying.One thing i'd add is a manual save feature so i dont have to retalk to everyone in the base before i start a mission.

												So I'm coming towards the end of Halfway (I presume) and thought I'd talk about it. I ran through it on the hardest difficulty.It's a simple squad TBS with RPG-lite elements, one that would work rather well on a mobile platform I think. But it doesn't feel like a mobile port, nor does it feel too simple to bother loading on your PC. Streamlined might be the term.There's probably nothing in the combat you haven't seen before, with each character getting two actions to move or shoot and they can be combined for a single more accurate shot. You have half-cover and full cover, with corners allowing you to step out to shoot before returning to cover where enemies can't see you (corners are key to victory). Each character has a passive ability and an active ability, along with some base stats you will be given limited ability to boost over the course of the game, but generally they're going to do at the end of the game what they did at the beginning but simply better.Rather than the typical overwatch you have retaliate. You don't fire on enemies as you spot them, you'll only return fire if fired upon. I thought it would be useless, and generally you'll want to spend your points, but it really helps keep the combat mobile and prevents it bogging down into two sides staring each other down.The way ammo handled is a nice touch. Different guns have different magazine sizes, but all ammo fits all guns and a reload exhausts an entire magazine no matter how much ammo was left in your gun. That four shot sniper rifle might be powerful, but it's going to plow through ammunition.The maps provide a nice variety in which to battle, some tight maze spaces, some a series of rooms, some long corridors, some wide open. You're given plenty of opportunities to make the terrain work for you, and like with most TBSs of this type you should be prepared to withdraw to stronger positions rather than mindlessly holding your ground and taking the best shot. When♥♥♥♥♥♥goes bad, it goes bad fast. Enemies do a lot of damage compared to your shield and health values at the top difficulty and with three or four hits you'll be down.Enemy variety is weak; there's shooty mobiles, close-combat mobiles and turrets. It varies the mobiles a bit by introducing shields and then later armour along with the ability to attack twice, but by this point I'm feeling that I'm ready for the game to end as I'm playing out of the same tactics book each battle. It doesn't help that the armoured enemies drag out the battle by being huge bullet sponges at the same time as the more powerful assault rifles have huge damage ranges leading to a feeling of unnecessary randomness.I found that as the game went on the usefulness of various characters changed, which I liked as it helps with introducing variety. Early on it was all Linda and her shotgun and self-healing, but as shields came into it I found I stopped using her. Likewise, other characters who I found useless became invaluable as better equipment came along. Right now I have at least three characters I would never go on a mission without. However, sometimes you're forced to because the game imposes a limit of 2-4 characters depending on mission, and some missions will have mandatory characters so you have to use pretty much everyone at one time or another, forcing you to learn how to use them and in some cases realise that ability you wrote off is actually pretty good.The story and the characters themselves are incredibly flat. It starts out promisingly with a little mystery, but it soon moves into generic sci-fi territory. The characters themselves are dull as dishwater; you can talk to them between missions but they don't have anything interesting to say. Likewise, they will sometimes converse on missions (especially their own optional side-missions), but again it's a case of speaking a lot with nothing to say. Most frustrating is how the game actually builds up a series of relationships between all these people, but the writing isn't capable of doing anything with it.The lack of character identification is easily the most disappointing part of the game because you don't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about these people and their struggle, it makes it a series of TBS puzzles in a game which should deliver more.All-in-all I think this was reasonable fun, and I'd recommend picking it up on sale if you're hankering for some squad TBS.

Posted: July 22, 2014
												So my early review of the game was a little unfair. The graphics, story, characters, and atmosphere of the game are all great, I've enjoyed them and look forward to finishing the game. This game has a lot of potential, but in its current state isn't fun/challenging until you are 75% of the way through the game. I can't give this a thumbs up yet, but THE GAME SHOWS TONS OF POTENTIAL.Edit 7/25/2014 : Due to active dev support to address game issues that I have brought up, I will be switching this from a 'Not recommended' stance to a 'Recommended' stance. This game is still has a lot of issues, but they are fixable, and it looks like they are actually going to take the initiative to fix them. Beware, the gameplay is still feels like I'm playing a beta, but the game is now completable and later levels are quite enjoyable. So here are the problems:Weapon Issues:Weapons are poorly documented in game so you are never really sure what range a weapon is good at. Adding in visual cues on the combat squares or an effective range stat in the weapon item page  is desperately needed.  Firing outside of your weapons effective range causes accuracy to fall dramatically. This is most noticable on short range weapons since short range weapons are only effective if there is one square inbetween you and the enemy, when adjacent it just melee attacks, and every other range has horrendous hit rates until end game weapons.The game has an option to use two ap points per shot to dramatically increase accuracy, but it is an easily missed feature unless you are reading every bit of the tutorial. Breaking this feature into a dialog that pops up when you click to attack an enemy to choose between a one AP quick shot and a two AP aimed shot would be a much better option.Lack of documentation:How cover works is confusing and needs to be explained better on how it actually functions. After 11 hours of play, I'm still not sure if I'm actually getting any bonus from being in any cover that doesn't break LOS. And how does it work? Does it subtract against the enemies hit chance or does it get multiplied against an enemies hit chance? How much does having +9 agility improve the reduction when in cover? Please add an ingame guide that is sort of like the UFOpedia in xcom. That way us the player can actually make tactical decisions. If a player doesn't understand the games mechanics, he can't make any tactical choices. No tactical choices makes for an irritating gameplay experience. Look to Fire Emblem if you are confused as how to display that information to the player. The advanced combat stat window in Fire Emblem makes it super easy for the player to figure out what is going on, and it can be toggled on and off depending on whether the player wants that information.Special Abilities:Some character special abilities are are completely overpowered and practically mandatory in end game. All the other non-op characters have abilities that could be super awesome, but since they cost one AP to execute, they serve little function inside of combat. Since these abilities already come with a cooldown penalty, having an AP requirement on many of them is just pointless.For Example, If you took the AP requirement off of the Mad scientists teleport it would actually be usable, and somewhat effective in combat. Taking off the LOS requirement and just allowing the character to teleport within a fixed distance range would take it from functional to on par with Gina's Paralyse. Gina's Paralyse also needs to be balanced; turn it to 1 ap with static one turn cooldown, and reduce the paralyse to 1 enemy combat turn, and it goes from OP to just tactically useful(since a character that only has one AP left is probably rarely going to be able to hit their target)Items:Items are uninteresting as they are right now, and there are very, very few items. There are lots of weapons and armor, but the only difference is how much damage they do, and their accuracy. functionally they all do the same thing. It isn't like one type is good against shields, or another good against armored targets, or maybe a certain one uses only half the Action points. No, all exactly the same. Armor has little variety as well, and since health pools are so small the rounding error will probably make the difference between Tank-Mark-II and Tank-Mark-IV almost unnoticable. Damage to shields also seems not to get any bonus from armor. So shields seem to take full damage QQCharacter Progression:No character progression mechanic severely hinders player investment in the characters. The closest thing the game has to progression outside the gear it gives you, is rare stat boost item candy, but your characters can only eat five safely. After that point, they seem to overwrite eachother. So if you have character you really like, but they are as weak as butter against bullets, well, sorry, no matter how much effort you put into getting them alien kills, they will always be as crappier than an OP character that you've never taken on a mission. Sorry mister hacker guy and mad scientist, I'm never taking you out cause you fall over dead 24/7. Sorry mister big human experiment guy, I love your melee passive, but you have no way to recover like linda does.Gear progression is a poor substitute, since you can transfer gear to other characters at any time.So it is a bunch of balancing issues, and some parts of the game need to be expanded.  The game could be really, really good with a couple mods or official patches.			"

												I am enjoying this game very much. The music is good. The style of gameplay is great for any tactics gamer. The artwork is nostalgic and moody. It's a tactics horror survival game on a massive ship... In space!I like the exploration of the game. Supplies can be gathered and swapped in combat or at your base camp. Explorers are rewarded with surplus ammo, precious equipment, vital med packs, and rare stims that permanently increas your characters' stats.The way the story is told, through characters with speech bubbles, is reminiscent early rpg's. Minus the dialogue options you find in most games today, but in most games, branching dialogue provides little effect or benefit on the execution of game play. This games tells a linear story about the survival of crew members, who wake up on a ship full of chaos. Sweet and simple.I hope to see more games like Halfway in the future!			"

												A good one. Classic turn-based tactics with a story. Waiting for an add-on. Maybe needs some additional features in customising the characters and some more thought on the final boss battle but otherwise worth the money.			"

												Alright tactical rpg. Enemies are perhaps a bit too vulnerable to funneling and your two snipers will often be the two teammates you decide to bring along for 90% of the missions.			"

												I want to like this game, but it's completely imbalanced. You start with 2 characters, and get set up against about 4-8 in the first few levels. No big deal, until it becoms apparent that your characters couldn't hit the broad side of a barn while it was in plain sight, while the computer can hit you behind ""full cover"". Changed tactics, rushed and hit the cpu with melee, and for some reason, my attacks do 1 hp dmg while the cpu does 4-6 hp per melee. Considering one of your starting chars has 12 hp total (the other having 16), this means you can literally be 2 shotted in one turn if you let the cpu touch you. Maybe I'm supposed to just gobble medpacks while spraying ammo and praying it hits, but I'm not really into that.			"

												The game feels like a mix between Fire Emblem and Xcom, with a few twists, your weapons do not break and you are a bit limited on the character customization, whoever each character plays a different role and has different strengths in weaknesses which is very similar to how Fire Emblem dealt with things.The game feels easier in the beginning, however the difficulty starts going up at the right times, the controls play alright, the enviroment, the animations look top notch.With a bit of bug fixing and with the extra things they want to add like Game+ or playing the game at harder difficulty and the map editor they want to add, I am sure players will be able to come with their own campaign settings in the future and increase the replayability of the game.I highly advise people trying this game out, specially if you are a fire emblem or an Xcom Fan.8/10			"

												Halfway is a hugely disappointing game.  The camera and controls were not well thought out.  The weapons and armor are very basic, as is the character design.  There are roughly 4 different types of enemies, and they all use recolors of the same skin.  Oh, but they each stand a little differently.  The writing is bland and unimaginative.  And these aren't even the biggest problems.The two big sins of Halfway are the sub-par combat, and some of the worst RNG I've ever dealt with in a game of this type.  For the combat, the devs use a very flimsy story point to 'disguise' the fact that enemies are just dropped in to the map at will.  The only real progression in combat difficulty comes from the amount of enemies spawned, and how many waves come before a mission is finished.  There are three or four different weapon types in Halfway, but only the sniper shows any real usefulness.  Best damage, best range, best accuracy.  The other weapons in the game only differentiate themselves by having lower stats in those areas.I can't express how important it is to get the RNG right in a game like this.  And Halfway gets it very wrong.  The chance to hit is just plain ♥♥♥♥ed.  I've missed 4+ 90% or greater shots in a row, and made just as many under 50% in a row.  I eventually learned to ignore the percentages completely and take any shot I wanted.  I hit just as many sub-twenties as I did eighties and nineties.  I found that I got the most successful hits in the 30% - 36% range.  Line of sight is also incredibly unreliable, making it almost impossible to judge whether changing a character's position will leave them with a clear shot for the second half of their turn.As a final aside, the mid-mission interludes are probably the best indicator of what kind of game to expect here.  These interludes are a chance to manage your inventory and make character selections, but they can happen anywhere in the game.  I'm not complaining about being given a rest from the tedious combat, just pointing out that returning to HQ between an apartment hallway and the apartment you are entering is a great way to destroy the flow of your narrative.  It's even more jarring when this 'rest' occurs whithout even having to change rooms.The saddest part of all this is the fact that Halfway IS a finished, polished product.  The concept itself is great, there are no major bugs that I could find, and the textures and tiles that do exist are actually very dynamic and interesting to look at.  The bones are all there, Robotality just forgot to add the flesh and musculature that this little monster needed to be a true success.  All-in-all, I was too bored with the lack of progression/development to actually finish Halfway, leaving me with the overall feeling that Half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥might have been a better choice for the title.  Oh, and the ""lovely atmospheric soundtrack"" touted in the game's description is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke.  If you do pick up Half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥(on sale, I hope), make sure to play with the music on mute.  It's worse than repetetive, and I'm fairly certain it's part of the game's attempt to beat the player by driving him/her to suicide.  The sound made by the last bullet you'll ever hear would easily be a great alternative to this games soundtrack.			"

												A hidden gem type of game. Heavily inspired by the newest Xcom game, it's a turn based strategy game featuring a 2 action point system for shooting, moving, using items, etc. Battles take place in square tile maps.It features a great style of 2D pixel art, specially the environments, which feature a lot of small, nice details. The sountrack is amazing and heavily inspired by the works of Vangelis in Blade Runner.The core gameplay is solid and accessible. Veteran TBS  players will find that there isn't that much depth, but it's fun nonetheless. One thing that I missed initially is that there's a stealth component where the AI actually detects your units via sound and line of sight.You will get access to 8 playable characters, each one with different base stats and unique special abilities. While I think the character could be more unique, they are different enough.Equipment progression is in my opinion the weakest aspect of the game. It's mostly linear and there isn't much variety. The balance could also be a bit better, with sniper rifles being a bit overpowered and short range weapons being a bit underpowered. It's mostly fine though.The campaign is mostly linear, with a couple of optional missions. The plot is nothing groundbreaking, but leaves you wanting more, specially after the ending. Looking forward to Halfway 2 if that ever happens. Oh, and after you beat it, I suggest replaying it with the NewGame+ mod. It makes the game significantly harder and fun (to me anyway).Very recommended game, specially at the low asking price.			"

												This game is annoying as RNG can get. I really wanted to like it. I love the art style, I love the music and sound effects but engine is so uterly broken I was unable to enjoy it. It basically boils down to restarting level a number of times until luck turns your way which is not likely. I played this game long time ago and gave up after realizing that game does not have any progression other than getting Gun X Mk.II and that's about it. Not only that, but for the first 7 hours or so game failed to explain these flashes they call jumps but kept using them as a cheap and dirty way of spawning yet more enemies who have incredible luck hitting you across the map when you consecutively struggle to hit 80%+ few tiles away.After seing a huge number of updates I decided to give this game another shot hoping all this RNG nonsense has been improved. While previously I went through signifficant portion of the game, this time I struggled with first level. It was mostly ""bad"" luck. My characters kept missing, enemy kept hitting impossible shots which ignored my shield.Am sorry, but at this state I can't recommend this game to people. At least not if you value your nerves.			"

												With 12 hours on record, I can say that I did enjoy the game for the most part. Pros: Fun tactical combatPretty interesting charactersDecent StoryCons: Gets extremely repetitive, to the point where playing it becomes a nuisanceExtremely annoying combat statistics - 50% hit chance for a shotgun to the face for example, or 80-90% hit chance and you miss multiple times in a row - but alas, that is the double edged sword of % chances.I feel I got quite a bit of value out of this game, but not 13 dollars. I'd say more like 10 dollars. the game progresses rather nicely, but there seems to be a ""wall of difficulty"". ie. Once you get so far, combat becomes extremely annoying and increasingly difficult, to the point of being stupid and unfair - the first time I noticed this was doing the mission for the black dude (Sam i think) to get food from storage. You beat a wave of enemies that hit extremely hard. Your turn you can miss or waste your time moving. Then you get beat to an inch of your life, finally killing them all, only to spawn another wave of HARDER enemies. These enemies hit harder then the last wave - and you can only carry a certain number of items per character - so don't think about having tons of medikits to heal either. Not only that, you can use a medi kit to heal and get Crit or hit 2 or 3 times in a row and die right afterwards so it's pointless. But once you beat this wave, NOW you seriously are out of supplies. But ALAS, ANOTHER WAVE SPAWNS of the same caliber enemies. Although I beat that mission - it was NOT satisfying, it was extremely annoying and sapped the fun out of the entire game thus far. The game became a nuisance, repeating the same harsh combat wave after wave of enemies who usually hit harder and with more accuracy, becoming unfair and annoying. (not challenging and rewarding)For the repetitiveness, harshness, etc. I do not recommend. But do not get me wrong you will enjoy this game ( and the price is decent, although 10 is better imo) but be prepared for when you advance in the story, it WILL get repetitive and very unfair.

UI is very basic. The mechanics of the turn-based and character system are simplistic and rudimentary. The writing is a little painful at times, but not that bad besides that. You can't save at any time, only auto-saves meaning when you begin a mission you are commited until it is finished.			"

												Pros:-Looks polished, with lots of attention to detail. For example, the movement is smooth, and there's even animations of the shells dropping to the floor when you shoot at a... monster... mutant... thing?-Simple, yet cool looking battle interface-Good lighting and non-intrusive yet compelling music provide a great atmosphere-Good pixel art-The turn based battle gameplay is engaging, but not rushed-Tense, but not scary-Futuristic look and feelCons:-The scripting is awful. I probably could have written better material, but I didn't buy the game for the talking-It's not as challenging as I would like. There's no penalty for losing a team mate for some reason-The levels are all predictable. Go here, collect some supplies, activate this switch or retrieve this person, and inevitably encounter some monsters, kill them, go back to base to heal, repeat-There aren't really any ways to level up, except for stimpacks, which give minimal benefits and are extremely rare-There's no character creation and minimal customization. All the armors look the same, and there's no way to change any aspect of your characters' appearances.-The exploration in the game is very linear and feels like you're being guided. Aside from the odd side quest, there's no freedom in exploration as far as I've gotten. Could be bad for the replay valueOverall, it's an entertaining little shooter/strategy game that can keep you occupied for a while. For $12.99, you're not getting ripped off. If and when this game goes on sale for $5-$8, it'll be a great addition to your collection. Nothing revolutionary, but it's a solid game and it's fun. There are a few aspects that are lacking, but overall, it gets a thumbs up from me.			"

												Already one of the best turn-based strategy games I've played this year. Here's my clincher when it comes to games like this: you need to have a cover system and implement some sort of overwatch. X-COM set the bar high in this regard. However, this game has a cover system and retaliate, which I will settle on in place of overwatch. The art is great; I love pixelated games. Music fits the style that they are going for. Dialogue is simplistic but intriguing; it doesn't slow down the game. But the combat system is really where this game shines. Some people are complaining that there isn't character customization, but there is to a degree. You can customize using weapons, armor, and single-use stat boosts. I've also started two games so far; and the characters seemed to have different starting stats, so there may be randomness in this regard as well.I do agree that the devs should implement an exp system on this sucker, but do not let that hold you back from playing an otherwise excellent game.****Update: 7 hours in and still having fun. For $12, I definitely feel like I got my money's worth. It feels like X-COM and Sword of the Stars: The Pit and a baby and then threw in some plot from Dead Space. I have really high hopes for where the devs might take this game in the future.			"

												This game is garbage.Generally a 78% chance of doing something means 1 time out of four you fail, 30 times in a row is statistically a no-no.Your characters get to move about 8 spaces if you don't want to attack, the enemies get 10 sqaures to run around and then electro-punch you repeatedly in the face, all in one turn.There is never a reason given for only allowing 4 team members per battle, given that you usually fight 10 enemies per battle with multiple battles jammed into each mission, this seems asinine.Don't buy this unless you enjoy efforts in frustration.

												Overall a decent turn based strategy game. 7/10.I waited to finish this game before reviewing it so I could give my full opinion.The graphics and interface are absolutely fantastic. The environment the game sets up is great and I will definitely be playing more once the mission creation tool is out.The first 50% of the game is filled with extremely easy missions to help you learn the controls / collect characters for the game. I was pretty disappointed with this and thought it was way too easy. The later game definitely makes you think before you act. You can't brute force your way through most of the later levels. However, I was able to beat almost every level in a single attempt and no levels took more than 2 times to beat. I would really have liked a bit more of a challenge.The concept for the game was really cool but the actual story telling was sub-par. From what I understand the game developers are German so this might just be a poor translation.The items you pick up in the game feel extremely generic. There are three types of weapons ""Short Range"", ""Assault Rifle"", and ""Sniper Rifle"" each of which works well at a particular distance from targets. There are two (maybe three) different names for each of these and then a ""Mark I"", ""Mark II"", ""Mark III"", etc... as they become more powerful. The amount of ammo each can hold varies and is the only thing that keeps you from simply picking the biggest weapon as they tend to have few rounds per ammo consumption. I would have liked to see more variety here.The armor is pretty much the exact same as the weapons. There are three different types of suits: Scout, Assault, and Tank. Each provides some stats and shields. I did manage to find some ""special"" suits that were very different from the base ones which was nice. I'm assuming when the user created content comes out, we will see some very cool stuff.Each character has a unique set of abilities and ""level up"" through stim pack injections. Some people didn't like this as you are limited to 5 stims per character. But, this keeps you from simply making a single super character. I like the ability to level your characters in this way as it gives you more control over how you want to play them. Maybe you don't want to play that character as a tank: give them lots of aim so they can shoot from afar. In each level you have some required characters but then you get to choose additional characters to bring along. This was neat as you felt like you could mix / match abilities. However, most of the abilities didn't really seem to complement each other. Instead, you choose abilities for a particular mission (assuming you failed it previously).  It would have been nice to be able to replay missions with a different set of characters without having to start the entire game over (or maybe unlocking free-play after you beat the game would be nice).In general, I really enjoyed the game and was definitely worth the price.

												I have to say, Chucklefish has become has become the indie publisher to watch for me.  So far Halfway harkens back to Amiga turn-based shooters.  The story is interesting enough to place me on this giant space hulk, and it's challenging enough to make me watch how I use my resources.If you're a fan of old school turn based strategy, I think you'll enjoy Halfway.

												Overall: B+Pros: Simple but effective tactical play. Variety in player unit abilities. Customization affects playstyle.Cons: Interface can be clunky. AI relies on numbers/swarming to overwhelm. No manual for details.The simple nature of the game makes this easily learned, though the lack of a manual to explain details means you have to figure out as you go. An annoying flaw is getting a new unit with a new ability, but have to immediately engage in combat without knowing what the ability does. Once you understand details, game play is steady series of small squad missions against increasingly strong enemies.Story arc is entirely text scripted. Some portions are lengthy to flesh out characters' personalities and interactions. Mostly this fills out mission set-up, as the briefing is entirely choosing squad and mission. Without the text, missions would be entered blind. The missions series is very fixed with few 'side quests'. Replayability, currently, looks to be low.Based on the variety in game, the potentional of this game is immense. Weapon variety is notable, units' abilities are varied already and mechanics imply a lot of subtle changes are possible. I expect in-depth player campaigns to expand the game and replayability.			"

												Boring and repetative level design and problem with difficulty balancing. Everything looks the same. The titleset is extremely limited, though lighting alleviates this somewhat. The enemies, however, are unimaginative and repeat themselves over and over and over and... well, you get my point.There's a thin but nontheless enjoyable story that won't win any prizes but keep you interested enough to want to pogress,Until you can't that is.The game is designed to be something to sink your teeth on, something toough - and that is fine, I like a challenge - but there are points in the game where frustration sets in to the point that you'd rather be cleaning motor gang lavatories than play this for one more moment.

												Squad-turn based tactical combat. Great retro sytle, SFX, Music. Not as complex as X-Com, but worth your time if you're a big fan. Eight characters, they all have 4 stats, health shields, agility, aiming. Each one has one active and one passive ability. There isn't any crouching or elevation changes, but full and half cover. You start out pretty terrible at aiming so there is the frustration of rolling misses. Enough items to keep it interesting, buffs, medipacks, gernades, guns and armors. The variety of enemies I've encounter so far (I'm only halfway =P) hasn't been that many, but it seems like their stats are varied. The story's good so far, but I don't know whats going on. Waking up on a ""abandon"" spaceship is a great plot device. Maps look great.			"

												A 2D X-Com clone that smacks of classic Alien Breed in art style. Totally cliched but consistant storyline and characters keeps the action moving along nicely. The gameplay is fairly solid, but the game itself is actually pretty easy and doesn't require much in the way of tactics to succeed, you can charge, barge and bungle your way through most battles without losing and I was rarely ever lacking for the basic three combat supplies (shields, ammo, medkits) though having to transfer items back and forth constantly to juggle your limited inventory can get to be a real pain. All in all it's a pretty good game.But I cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone because it was published by Chucklefish and they are truly loathsome and despicable company worthy only of our unending rancor.And before anyone asks, the game was gifted to me.

												Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like this game, I could not. While the art style is very cool, the story itself is a bit too milquetoast (zombies on a space ship omg) to  carry the game when the tactical gameplay itself is lacking in depth.  The art itself - while it appears quite nice in static screenshots, is lacking in depth and interest. A bit of parallaxing here and there, with some background animations would have gone a long way to selling the world. In practice, everything in the world feels very static. The fixed width ""Chunky"" walls and no multi-level environments means that there is a lack of truly interesting tactical environments. These flaws could be perhaps be forgiven if the interface was a little slicker. However, I found it frustrating to interact with the game world, and the UX around character/item management feels too klunky to be enjoyable. Overall I would rate this as a worthy sale-pickup - something of a curiousity worth playing if you're a tactical+pixel art diehard. Despite not being able to reccomend this game, I do not regret buying it. I think these developers are getting a lot of things right and I hope to see more from them in the future.			"

												A nicely done RTT game, themed inside of a decrepit spaceship. Comparisons to Fire Emblem are apt, but Fire Emblem's depth may keep people coming back to the game where this may only deserve a few playthroughs. Combat is solid, and strategy is divided well between short-ranged and long-ranged combat. This is primarily because the game has only four major player stats: Health, Shield, Agility, and Aiming. Other statistics, like Armor, only modify the rates at which these are gained or lost. The art style works for the game, but I would have liked to see better high resolution support. Sound is simplistic and functional. I would like to see a higher difficulty curve or a NG+ mode, and I'd like a bit more diversity in weapons usage, but overall the game is solid, fun to play, and tactically interesting.			"

												Worth the price for the art & design alone!  Pickup and play with depth!  Gameplay is very, very similar to the XCOM game by Firaxis, except it's driven by a linear plot-line with no meta-game and it excludes terrain height or modifiers.  That's not to say it's a clone, as there are different features included and Halfway is a different game than XCOM that simply follows the same design concept.  The only hard negatives about the game are that there is nothing new here that hasn't been done before and the variety is weak.  Although, at the end of the day, every element is well implemented and thought out; a very enjoyable experience for tactical gamers or those looking for a slick, fun, sci-fi, indie computer product.Damn those turrets!

												This is a solid, well polished, Turn-Based RPG.If you have played modern X-Com, or Shadowrun Returns, you'll be no stranger to the mechanics here. It's the simple 2 Action point system where you choose to move and/or shoot. Naturally with games of this type that also means it has the auto Dice-roll system in place which determines attack & Defense (cover) stats. Even the AI plays a similar game where the difficulty curve gradually builds up from being dumb as a post, to hitting you harder and smarter in later levels. On first impressions, the story has a Dead Space feel about it. Monsters/Zombies on a ship, the ship turning against you, you've seen it all before. But the writing appears solid enough to keep you wanting to play... Which of course is one of the most vital things in games such as these.So you may be thinking (and groaning) that it's another pixel-art game? Whilst true, it is the attention to detail that sets it apart from being just another typical game with the same old graphical fidelity. The inside of the Goliath ship feels and looks like a spaceship. Litter and dirt is strewn amongst the lower decks, lose wiring hangs from damaged areas outside the confines of the playable area. Emergency Lighting creates a dim and hopeless atmosphere. It flcikers creating an eerie feel. Later on in the game it brightens up, adding colour to what still feels like a desolate hostile arena. Even in battle, weapons glow, shell casings fly out of guns and land on the floor, and they feel like they pack a satisfying punch. This is helped largely due to the well made sound effects that accompany this game. This leads on to the games soundtrack which is proving rather satisfying, and sets the right tone to the rest of the game.  The level of polish here would not be out of place amongst other titles developed by considerably larger teams. Still not convinced? Well the developers Robotality are not playing any games with their first Steam release. Within hours of bugs flying in, the game was patched to 1.01 addressing the most critical issues, resulting in a much more stable game right away. So it's likely such support will continue. Couple that with the promise of an editor and the inevitable Steam Workshop support, and you'll be investing in a game that will have a lot of replay value in many months to come.			"

Shotgun does not do enough damage consider how close I have to get to my targets, sniper rifles were biggest bullet eaters, had a decent one for about 5 missions, then found one with better stats and holds twice as many bullets, gradual upgrades should be better.Interface needs to be tweaked here an thereOverall, I like this!

												Great pixel-art-artwork, set within an interesting alienesque szenrio (actualy Event Horizon comes to my mind aswell), driven by an amazing soundtrack, Halfway is way more than you would expect at first glance.Here's a deep tactical combat game, with some slight rpg-elements (like inventory-managment and loot, some minor char-development), nothing over the top like tripple A big publisher games, but instead lot's of love for small detailEven if you just got some minor love for games like X-Comb or group-based rpgs with roundbased combat give it a shot, you won't regret it.

												I really didn't get the feeling that the RNG was that harsh in this game. Even when it is bad none of the battles are particularly long or difficult. They checkpoint at the right time and you can actually bail on a level and reorganise your guys at your home base if you feel particularly hamstrung,Even in my toughest fights i've been able to hide or rely on the special abilities to get our of them.But other than that i got sucked in really quickly to this game and have had a lot of fun. This is a really good game, if you're on the fence about it i really suggest you grab it.			"

												Halfway Is what you get by combining Dead Space 1 and Xcom and put it in a isometric 8 bit format, its fantastic.  The story, art, and gamplay all mesh together into a game that is satifying to play. I very much hope a sequal is in the making.			"

												Hard to believe this game was put together by so few people.  Hands down, it is an absolute marvel and joy to play, and I'm really hoping for a sequel.The plot is the standard sci-fi fare, you awake from cryo-sleep on a long-haul space flight, finding that your ship is randomly hyperjumping through space, whilst all around you humanoid mutants lunge at you from the shadows.  It is down to you to find fellow survivors, salvage for spare guns and ammo, figure out whats going on and attempt to escape the nightmare.  But the way it is told deserves particular praise, with all exposition delivered piece-by-piece through character conversations and in-game encounters.  The dialogue stays fairly safe throughout but there's at least a couple of characters of note.The gameplay, though straightforward, offers some serious amount of depth.  It's a turn-based top-down squad focused strategy game.  You spend the majority of your time being ambushed by mutants, lunging for cover, returning fire, and trying not to be overrun.  Once the smoke clears you salvage the area for weapons, ammo and medikits for future use or for conversion to credits to buy other much needed gear.  But you can't just point your guys at the enemy and expect to win.  Get ready to make strategic choices about defensive positions, weapon loadouts, which characters to bring, when to fall back and when to bring the fight to the enemy.  There are also some light RPG elements which is very nicely and uniquely implemented.  You don't gain experience per se, but rather you trawl the crates and lockers of the war-torn environments to salvage various stimpacks, each of which offer your characters an improvement to their agility, health or aiming ability.  But you can't just pump your favourite guys up to ridiculous levels, as each character can only handle 5 stimpacks before some side-effects become known, so you have to think twice about which characters get what stimpacks.The difficulty is very well balanced.  Usual walkover for first few levels, before a slow and steady rise over the considerably long campaign to some very challenges end levels.  There are indeed plentiful levels, with a varied environment and layout, each of which you must complete in one go, but they are short enough that the few times you do die won't induce much frustration.  Between each level you get to return to your makeshift camp to reload and refit and change your squad lineup.The aesthetics are wonderful.  Though oddly bright and colorful for a game about a grim slog through unforgiving, mutant-infested spaceship corridors, its the little details that make this game come to life.  From the gore-stained corridors, to the way your fallen foes disintegrate into ash, to the spent shell casings ejected from your varied weaponry, this game is one that draws you in and bathes you in its beautiful gloominess.I've only the one criticism, and maybe this was just me, but I couldn't find a way to change the text font size, so those of short sight may be in for a spot of bother.So in summary, this is a game you absolutely must own, and it's available at a very reasonable price!

												I have played a good few hours of this game and at first I could get past the simplistic combat design and repetitiveness but after some hours it's too much. After a few levels, the game begins to use the same mechanic which teleports more of the same units into battle. At first it's once in a battle but halfway through it becomes five times in a battle. This got so bad that I gave up and I am not sure if I am ever going to play it again. I would recommend the first 5 or so hours of this game but now I just can't.			"

												A good game for the asking price. It is basic, with very limited choice in terms of strategy and often times lackluster level design. However, it gets the sense of progression right, with every new chest or locker waiting with promises of a weapon upgrade or stim pack (essentially level-ups). And once two snipers are geared up and ready to one-shot two enemies per turn, the times you spent trading impact-less pew-pew with the enemy quickly become a faint memory.The one big critizism I have for the game is that it constantly takes control from the player in order to put them at an disadvantageous position. It constantly forces you to take subpar characters on a mission, taking up the very limited space in your 4-man squad, and it positions your squad in terrible positions after cutscenes in a level, leaving them open or in low for no discernable reason.Certainly no XCOM or Jagged Alliance, but for 10€ it will shorten the wait for a new game nicely.

Everything runs well, and plays amazing. I always threaten to throw my computer across the room when I miss a high precentage shot but that's just how the cookie crumbles. Other: No glitches or bugs yet, and I'm interested in the plot. Also, somebody nerf the sniper, cause that son of a gun is taking out enemies without even aiming at them.			"

												Just wow...this was intense - I bought the game during a deal kinda just to see and man was I pleasantly surprised. I played it straight through within two days. Clock says over 20 hours and it was worth every single moment. Well the end was a bit draging, but rewarding none the less.+ Beautiful PixelArt and superb intro/outro video+ A lot to discover and a quite pleasant story, though it is classica for SciFi I guess+ Interesting mix of characters and strategy possibilities+ Nice sidequests, whish there would've been more- Replay Value? Not sure at this moment...- Some little bugs, not too much but it killed my level few times- Some levels get a bit repetitious, still you kinda wanna move onWell few games have drawn me in recently as much as this little gem and I really congratulate the developers. It must've been an incredible workload in such a small team.			"

												Halfway is one of the best games most people will probably never play or hear anything about. The story is enthralling (which makes all the reading worth it), every character is memorable, and the gameplay is right in the sweet-spot of being challenging, but not too hard that you can't pass the mission with at least one person left standing.I've seen plenty people complain that there's no overwatch. Look, if you want to play a game with XCom elements, just go play XCom, or shut up and appreciate Halfway for what it is.The experience and memories Halfway will give you is well worth the price.

												I just completed this game and I must say – this was one of the rare games that I was eager to see the outcome of.  From start to finish I felt like I was always against the wall – no mission was too easy and all felt like they furthered the plot along.  Let's get to the details!==Graphics==They are simple but nothing else is really needed; the characters and enemies are all recognizable and feel unique.  Plasma Fire looks good, the 'dusting' of enemies leaves a satisfying feeling, and the levels made sense.  The medical ward, cafe, apartments – they all felt right.  Little touches were here or there to give the impression of varied life throughout the ship and I really liked the fluff 'medical bay' in the home bases you established to explain how your party recovered life in between missions.==Sound==I'm going to sound like a wimp here – but one of the home-base themes always makes me feel sad; like longing for home.  The combat music felt right – helping to keep me on the edge (the final boss music especially, was unlike the rest and definitely 'alien' as it were).  The sounds of the guns firing, screams of the mutants (or your team-mates), doors, platforms; all of these seemed perfect to me.==Story==More than any game I've played in the past 3 years I needed to know how this was going to end.  I was really pulling for these survivors to make it through and escape.  I wanted to know how party conflicts were going to resolve themselves and some of the more hinted at details of the survivors.Unfortunately the game does leave off on kind of a cliff hanger; I feel as if the game story was 'halfway' completed akin to Anachronox if you ever played that game. This need not be a bad thing, but like Anachronox I really want a 2nd part!  ;)==Gameplay==The levels feel incredibly fine tuned – which is to say perfectly balanced with the idea of you gaining a grasp on the combat system, and purchasing/using equipment and gear through out the game.  The enemies were strong where they needed to be and frightfully good at gaining a tactical point to blast me with.  Every battle had me on edge – I wasn't sure if I'd pull through.  The game interface is a bit tricky to get used to at first though but it's still simple enough.  A heads up for the would-be purchaser (none of the below are what I would consider 'bad' at all though).1)- I did not notice it, but I think you can only use medkits/shield-cells on other party members (not on the active character) through the inventory screen as opposed to the radial menu.2)- There is no 'undo movement' button which resulted in my untimely demise in the very final part of the very final mission.  Thankfully the game saves during each 'stage' of it so I didn't have to redo an hours worth of work.  :)  ==Sum Up==A simply wonderful game.  Tough.  A great story.  Simple but challenging game-play, excellent sound and appreciated graphics.  You've sold me on your product/games Robotality; now make the second part of the story so I can find out what happens!  ;P			"

												The full review can be found on Start 2 Continue[start2continue.com].Excerpt:There's nothing worse than talking to someone who doesn't answer back. Well, I guess unless it's an emergency and you need help. In deep space. On a derelict ship. With a bunch of your former crewmates wanting to tear you limb from limb, for some reason.This is the very scenario presented by Robotality in its latest game Halfway. Aptly named, this title has an aesthetic halfway between System Shock 2 and XCOM; it plays halfway between a turn-based strategy game and an RPG; its charm stems halfway between its pixelated visuals reminiscent of old 90s arcade games and its modern take on combat depth and mechanics. Terrible puns aside, Halfway is a pretty interesting game that keeps you on your toes....At USD $12.99 on Steam, Halfway is definitely worth the cost if you're looking for a fun turn-based scifi game. With its nostalgia-inducing graphics with contemporary flare and the fast-paced tactical combat, you'll lose yourself to the cold vacuum of space pretty quickly. However if you're looking for something with in-depth RPG elements, you'll be left scratching your head. If Robotality gave gameplay and story half as much love as they give the game's visuals and engine, they'll have something even more addictive and immersive.			"

												A great tactical sci-fi RPG. Colorful characters all with unique abilities that suggest but do not force strategies/weapon load outs. Very dark and interesting story that reminds me of a sci-fi version of The Raid (i.e. you're at the bottom of the ship and have to fight tooth and nail to get to the top of it). As a warning the ending and story line feel like it's paving the way for a sequel but there is definitely enough content and developments to make it worthwhile to push to the end.			"

												Like many have previously said; i REALLY wanted to like this game. It's almost really good, but ends up being pretty average and mundane. Deserves more than just a straight ""no"", but not as much as a ""yes"".Pros:- Fantasic presentation and graphics.- Good atmosphere- I liked the story and narrative (unlike many)Cons:- No experience, or leveling up - means that killing baddies is not hugely rewarding.- Doesnt really have any tactical elements - it does a tiny bit, in the form of cover.- No overwatch - i'm not saying every game MUST have this, but it's a fairly fundemental strategic tool in these kinds of games and, unfortunately, this game doesn't provide an alternative, so the strategic element is a bit 'meh'.- Some really annoying UI functions (eg. not being able to close the inventory screen without dragging the mouse all the way to the top left hand corner of a widescreen).- gets a bit easy once you get armour w/shields (ie straight after level 1.

												Can't wait for the sequel!A really good turn based strategy, like a sci-fi Vandal Hearts / Advance Wars / Fire Emblem.The characters / setting are all very good, and it feels like the world exists beyond the bounds of the game. The plot is pretty straightforward - find out what is going on - but it's the attention to detail around this - how the rich have bigger appartments than the poor, how the soldiers know they'll probably be held accountable for what is happening even though they're blameless - that really feels interesting.The combat is good, although there are a few tweaks I would like to see to make it great:- change health bars to numbers, as it is often hard to know whether the full red health bar on one enemy is the same as the full health bar on a slightly different looking enemy- use yellow or green (or purple?) for the heavies, although you can tell the heavies from the light soldiers as the art if different, by giving them a different colour it would make it even easier to assess the battlefield- let me see the ranges for both my troops and the enemies, this is a typical turn based thing, and helps me know when my troops are out of range, or how to get my troops in range without getting them killedThese are only small improvements I'd like to see on what was a lovely game. Thank you very much for the experience.			"

												Halfway is one of the best games most people will probably never play or hear anything about. The story is enthralling (which makes all the reading worth it), every character is memorable, and the gameplay is right in the sweet-spot of being challenging, but not too hard that you can't pass the mission with at least one person left standing.I've seen plenty people complain that there's no overwatch. Look, if you want to play a game with XCom elements, just go play XCom, or shut up and appreciate Halfway for what it is.The experience and memories Halfway will give you is well worth the price.

												This is a fun, somewhat short tactical RPG with attractive graphics. The mission structure is rather linear but does provide some choices. Likewise, you can improve the stats of your characters to some degree and modify their gear, but you're constrained by the function of the character in the story. That is, you're not going to be able to turn the tech-geek into a bullet-crazy commando. Story is so-so. Despite my faint praise, I enjoyed the game overall and it really is a sum of its parts.			"

												Great atmosphere through the art and music.  The backgrounds for the ship have a real, lived-in presence and really help set the mood, as does the Vangelis-style music.  I really enjoyed the Pandorum-esque nature of exploring a lost, sometimes hostile, ship and the occasional juicy reward of a custom weapon for venturing off the beaten trail.Game play is perfectly acceptable, but as others have noted, the weapon balance is out of whack, with sniper rifles being preferable to any other category of weapon.  If I were rebalancing the game, I would smooth the accuracy drop off on other weapons (so a shotgun is about 100% efficient to 4 tiles) and consider adding special effects to non-sniper rifle weapons (such as having assault rifles suppress the target or fire multiple shots).  I would also not design a series of final fights designed to punish weapons other than sniper rifles.  Since characters aren't specialized in any particular weapon, this doesn't really constrict your enjoyment of the game or your team's builds - just pick the best options and load your team up with them, rather than worrying about balance.

												It is probably the best X-Com-like since the original game over 20 years ago. Given its very low price, it is actually a great bargain. But being cheap and worth the price is not a good thing. It feels half-finished: there are several interface glitches, lack of polish in the controls - not in the visuals, these are quite nice. And it becomes repetitive, the story is a flat mess of cliches. Fun, worth the money, makes you cross your fingers for them to make it properly in a sequel.			"

												Simple and good turn-based strategy game.  On board the Goliath, you gather the remaining crew members and figure out what is happening on the ship.  Once you gather enough members of the ships crew, you pick out which ones to take with you on a mission, each offering unique skills.  It is important to stock up on supplies, which can be purchased at a kiosk.  To earn credits, you will need to ""recycle"" items you collect from missions.  Basically, you turn in armor, weapons, or items for credits.Although unique in the beginning, the enemies begin to run dry on the unique skills.  Most either charge at you to attack melee or will keep at a distance to fire at you.  This was one problem I had with the game, it stays like this until toward the end.  However, I do feel that this gave the game a bit more realism, as the creatures you fight were human members on board the ship, not four arm, five legged beasts.Enemies also have a bad habit of appearing in random places when the ship goes through a jump.  Only in a few instances can this be a problem because you may have set your crew to physically attack one enemy, kill it, and suddenly have four more appear right where your crew are, placing them in a tight spot because it would be ideal if they were further away and behind cover.Some other small issues I had was the occasional 82% chance to successfully hit only to miss, twice in a row.  This is rare and not something that breaks the game.  The other issue is the text is difficult to read when selecting missions on the right side of the ship map.  Again, not game breaking, just slightly annoying.Overall, I would recommend this game.  It is simple that you can play a mission or two if you have 30 minutes to an hour to spare.  Not many lengthy game conversations.  Each character provides a unique skill to be of use in combat.  And the story is interesting.			"

												System Shock meets Jagged Alliance - and their naughty baby is Halfway. It is a good game, difficult and with solid game mechanics, interesting story and feel of 80's sci-fi movie. Great soundtrack underlines mood, and I must say, whoever composed it, made a good job.Each playable character has story and background, and yes, I like them. I can imagine Kurt Russel as a main character and Dolph Lungren as Thirteen. Only negative, which I found, is absence of RPG system and saving option. Thanks to fact, that game saves only at the beginning and the end of missions, difficulty sometimes hits unpleasant levels. But still it is playable, because missions are short. RPG system is somewhat missing, I'd like to slightly advance the characters through experience, not only doping'em up with stimpacks. It isn't something major though.Overall, it is good game, worth of playing. That 80's movie feel... I just love it!			"

												I went back and forth on buying this game but what ultimately decided me was that even the 'negative' reviews (e.g. Destructoid's) stated: ""Still I had fun."" Well, that's all I'm really looking for.So I did buy it, and I beat it in one weekend of heavy playing.The game is an ultra solid tactics/strategy game, basically an indie version of XCOM. While Halfway isn't going to OMG WOW AMAZE you, it's still just plain fun. The RPG elements are minor - item collection & stat increase via stimpacks - but the tactical combat plays smoothly backed up by an intriguing, fresh story. Basically, it explores FTL travel, asking the question: What happens BETWEEN jumps? Hence the title - Halfway.The characters themselves are nothing spectacular. The protagonist is a marine who's more cool competence than great empathy. Nevertheless, they get the job done. Because each character has a specialty, you get a sense of how they all fit in, even if there are some gaps (Nia anyone?).Honestly, if you like sci-fi and you like strategy/tactics games, you'll almost certainly like this, even if you're as jaded a gamer as I am. Halfway's a smooth little game that goes down easy, and with no regrets the next morning.One small note: If you're a tactics/strategy pro ['pro' means you've, e.g. beat XCom on classic ironman or harder], I recommend enabling the difficulty+ mod. I found the game a tad easy without it.			"

												Just finished the game, so can finally comment on it.I would like to point out that I finished Halfway and I'm not finishing many games these days. So this has to count for something. Maybe it's matter of taste, maybe it's just decent game? Hmm.It's hard to avoid comparisons these days, but basically Halfway is a squad turn-based strategy game, in a XCOM style. There's base, you have squad of up to eight characters that cannot actually die. They can be incapacitated instead, which disables your soldier during combat 'mode'. Overall feel of the game, graphics and sounds, scifi theme and dialogues feels good, there is a level of immersion into the story, which is decent and has few surprises. There's variety of weapons, grenades add to the arsenal, and some armors.I really like the level up system, it's simple and fair. Characters have 3 basic stats and you can raise them either by using better armour (these can be found as you progress through game) or by stimpacks! These can be found along the way as well. No actual level ups from rpg like games, which is nice in world of unlocks, perks and other crap like that.But even little gems like Halfway have their flaws, as usual with this types of game, as you progress the combat becomes a bit repetitive. Some levels are really hard, game made me almost throw my mice in fury, while I found other being damn easy, not sure if this was intended or not. And the RNG... if you'd browse community submissions there's this meme with alien having gun at point blank attached to his head and the gun... misses. That's pretty much how this aim system works in Halfway. It sometimes doesn't make sense, like if the numbers doesn't represent anything.But besides these few flaws, game's great! I strongly recommend it if you like squad based tactical combat and you're okay with old school isometric graphics.			"

It's got a 16 bit vibe going on and a pretty good interface but its got an old school vibe so don't expect anything super slick menu wise and the aiming system takes a little getting used to.All in all I'd say this is a great little game once you get used to it.

												Nice story, tactical combat. Not fan of the save system (can never save within a level, not even between fights). Still a great game.			"

												Fantastic game on all accounts - it's basically a pixelated XCOM. Story, artwork, music and gameplay are top notch. You play as survivors on a space ship that's full of mutated crew. Finding cover and using a variety of short, assault, sniper rifle and grenades, your rag-tag group of survivors each come with unique skills that can help you find out what happened to the crew and hopefully take back your ship. Highly recommend for any one who likes tactical combat games.			"
