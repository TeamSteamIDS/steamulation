												The trailer sums up why this game is awesome. 4 person squad that you take with you to clear buildings from zombies, total awesomeness!But... The game isn't complete yet. It's not even close. And they don't reply to any questions, bug reports or anything. Looks like they got their money and ran off like so many indie dev's nowadays.Update:I made a huge bug report topic where I posted every bug I could find over a month ago. I also sent them an official bug report using the form they made for it. Then after not hearing anything from them I sent them an e-mail asking wether or not they were ever going to finish the game. They responded that it's done in their eyes. After stating that many attacks go through walls they replied that attacks are suppósed to go through windows. Are you guys even reading my e-mails?Pretty much everybody who has ever played this game disagrees with the statement that this game is completed. I guess they just confirmed that they took our money and then ran off.Do not support these developers!Update:After a long time I started playing again two or three times for an hour this week and it was remarkably bugless. (I didn't reinstall windows, steam or the game and I'm pretty sure there wasn't an update, so there was no reason for the gameplay to improve.)I stand by what I said before, but if you are in luck and everything works as it was planned it sure is a lot of fun. Also using cheats can help. I always get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when a zombie does a special attack through a wall, but I just give all my guys Kevlar to compensate for the damage they shouldn't take. Makes it all a lot less frustrating.			"

PrefaceI bought this game on sale, thinking ""Eh, 4 dollars, what's the worst that could happen?"" Turns out the answer is ""a lot"".Before writing the review, I completed the campaign, played some Death Lab and Survival.ControlsLacking. There are keyboard shortcuts, which is a plus, but the amount of micromanaging is just annoying. There is no way to give your squad very basic commands like ""walk over there, but hold your formation"" or even ""guard here, look a little bit left or right occasionally"". I mean, yes, they aren't trained soldiers, but come on - that's very basic ""use your brain to survive"" stuff. Variety / Difficulty / Replayability Personally, I found it too easy. Take an easily defendable position (beware windows), shoot single zombie, run back to squad, profit. If there are hearts, use melee and sneak your way through.  After the hearts are disabled, progress as usual. As this works almost every time, it also gets repetitive. New equipment isn't a necessity, it just achieves victory faster.The different game modes. Yes. Campaign is as described above. Then there is Death Lab, which I actually liked. Kind of. It, too, got old pretty fast. Survival mode is a joke. I kind of expected it to be like the campaign, just without the story and a larger or procedurally generated map. Turns out, there are no branches, no loops, no nothing - just node after node, going in a straight line to the right.So, is the campaign worth replaying? After all, the store page promises random elements. And again, no. While it does, in fact, randomize the campaign map, the actual nodes seem to draw from a pool of predesigned maps and/or houses. While this in itself isn't bad, there are just too few of those to keep things interesting. Even halfway through my first (and only) campaign playthrough, I never encountered any new layouts (excluding the ""story nodes"")BugsJust look at the forums. Also, I played this game some months ago, and the bugs are still there. Chances are they will never be fixed, with the developer disregarding bug reports and calling the game ""finished"". Again, read the forums for details on this. I can just list the bugs I personally encountered. They range anywhere from ""minor"" over ""annoying"" up to ""gamebreaking"".-) Gamebreaking: Rescuing more survivors than you have space for locks you on the ""send survivor to city"" screen.-) Grabbers and Jumpers don't care about walls.  And by that, I really mean WALLS, not windows. I encountered this many times while defending, but I is especially glaring with the survivors hiding behind the ""hidden button"" doors, suddenly being surrounded by Jumpers halfway. And yes, that also happens before the button is pressed. One time, I actually watched them glitch through the door (Apparently, they cared more about the locked-in survivor than about my squadmates standing directly behing them).-) Once hunger and bug-related deaths start to fill up your graveyard, it is virtually rendered useless, as there is no scrolling.-) Many more minor stuff (like the game randomly unpausing when giving commands), but really, I won't list them all, considering the much more major bugs.Survivors / City Map / ResourcesGood idea, but IMHO, poorly executed. The resources themselves are sparse at first (not a bad thing!), but around the early late-game, they are completely useless. Except for food, of which you will not have enough. By far. Ever. You will have way too much of everything else, mainly because the blueprints drop much faster. By the time you first have enough resources for the first firearm blueprint, you will have found much better ones. Even with reasonable mid-gear upgrades, your squad will have the best equipment far before the campaign is over.The survivors... Apart from attracting more zombies on heart maps (IMHO the only difficulty spike over the course of the campaign) they are useless as well. When they don't break your game (see ""Bugs"" above), they idle around in your cities. ""Idle"", because it is very easy to avoid the zombies attacking back. In fact, the only time that happened to me was when I explicitly wanted it to happen (Achievement! Yay!). And even if they WOULD need to actually defend your cities - chances are they couldn't. Remember what I said about food a little bit earlier? When you run out of food, survivors die. Seems logical. BUT: The dying survivors are NOT selected randomly. It always hits the most recently rescued ones. Chances are pretty good that those are the survivors manning your cities on the front, leaving them empty.Graphics / SoundVery good. The graphics fit the gameplay, the music fits the situations, and... yes. Short review, but that's all there is to say about it. I especially liked the Death Lab BGM.SummarySo, the summarizing question: Knowing everything I do now, would I buy the game again?No. Plain and simple. For reasons, see everything above.			"

												This game has a serious case of ""I got it cheap/free so YOLO!"" review syndrome. (Sorry to use that acronym but honestly, that's how stupid most of these positive ""reviews"" are and they already tricked me once...)It's a bad game. At any price unless you really don't value your time...It has potential but the controls, UI and mechanics are poorly implemented and thought out. It really does seem like a glorified flash game. I don't see the point of having a squad game when it's a pain to control them independently and the AI is so painfully not there.I can see the appeal of it to some but the fact is there are so many other survivor games that simply do it better.

												I actually really enjoy this game despite it being VERY hard at times and a little buggy. The game can go from being easy as pie in one moment, to almost impossible at the next but I find that keeps it exciting.Rather than being able to rush through the game, you have to think, pace yourself and plan which many games now don't seem to do.There are different game modes too, depending on how you want to play and the random generation make the game highly replayable.My few gripes are firstly -  the mulitplayer. There was such potential for it and so many ways it could be handled and instead it's ended up being a 1 v 1 type thing.Also, the game has it's fair share of bugs, which I found bearable (the game autosaves before each node) but many people seem to be pretty annoyed by them so if you're looking for a bug-free experiecne this may not be the game for you (but neither will Skyrim or Fallout).But for the price of the game you cannot complain. I got my money worth at least three times over (I own it on Desura too).If you enjoy randomly generated games that can get hard but are incredibly addictive then this is for you.			"

												didnt much care for the game and bought it on sale a while ago, nobody is gonna see nor read this review so might as well say what i feel.the game is what the title says, its about a squad of survivors, you are tasked with guiding 1-4 survivors though buildings, getting supplies and going elsewhere (never played the storymode, i assume survival is about the same). you have to make some choices to take some supplies and leave others, other than that, didnt play all that much, maybe enought to get the cards and a few achevements. got a bit boring and a tad repetitive after i kept dying :/. i do recommend the game, just not at full price			"

Posted: April 17, 2015
												I'd like to start off by saying that I got this on Humble Bundle so I'm not exactly fussing over the fact that I 'bought' this game. It's still not an impressive game to me.Wow, I played two hours and I think I got all I need to say and there's not even much to say about it. I don't have anything to really say that's positive about this game other than the idea. You're a group of survivors and you need to survive. There are different gamemodes and from what I remember there is survival, campaign(you start with 2 survivors, need to find more, you can secure 'nodes' (locations) across the map and it ties into the repetitive nature of the game and you also have objective locations you need to make your way to), and two others. They weren't very rememberable. Your nodes can also be attacked but I didn't care for the game enough to actually let it happen). The nodes themselves in the campaign mode act as 'checkpoint' spots that you can backtravel to when you fail a mission and you have spare survivors or if you finish a mission. The gameplay is extremely flawed with very bad movement controls (click to move squad and  click + hold to designate facing direction for EVERYONE which makes it useless because why the would you want everyone to face in the same direction while you're getting beat up from behind and to the sides). Your squad lacks peripheral vision. The movement itself is held down by a part of the combat that is missing but I'll get to that. There's also these 'hearts' that constantly attract more and more zombies but there's also alarms that do the same thing and from what I could tell, the effects *STACK*. The alarms are only worse than the hearts because the power buttons are almost always on the other side of the entrances to the building but, then again... Some hearts are ominously locked inside a shed that require you to search the house for a code / button amongst the 20-something lootable items all the while getting hit wave after wave of annoying zombies.When a squad member is attacked, it takes about a second for him to react, turn around / face the zombie, and then another 1-2 seconds to actually fight back. The melee is pretty random since even if your survivor is facing an enemy, he doesn't always react immedietally. I don't know if they decided to wank off because they get off to zombies or if they had a brain fart but my character with the axe kept on getting hit first when he should've been able to just chop the brain-dead(literally) zombie away with his weapon. Pistols also have a VERY low range (6 IIRC but another you get has 8, still extremely low) and make it extremely hard to keep range when there's even 3 zombies coming towards you. The zombies also move pretty fast when *not running*, so think on that. If you get a 'horde' after you, chances are you're going to get beat up pretty bad. Now, the thing that annoyed me the most is that there is NO AUTO ATTACK WHILE MOVING. This may seem stupid but attacking something while moving would be entirely realistic and even then this is a video game and the way the gameplay has been built up makes it seem like it would be crucial and yet it's not there. It's like playing a game where you can only shoot when not moving but the enemies move faster than you so you have to stop moving to attack them but you react very slowly, turn around slowly and the enemies keep coming non-stop. Oh, yeah, and you're short-sighted. Overall, the actual gameplay movement is slow and badly done. If your squad could act faster, not be stupid then I'd be kind of fine with it.The special zombies I saw so far pretty much mimic the L4D Spitter / hunters but there's more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t tacked onto them. The spitter gives no chance to avoid the acid since it's pretty much an immediate effect. The hunter or 'jumper' does as the name implies. It jumps *at* a survivor. No, it doesn't knock him down. It... Hits him. Fast. Or something. I don't know since the animation looks barely any different from any of the other zombies. The worst part is that, again, the effect is immediate. He pretty much teleports to your survivors and he takes a huge chunk of health in a few seconds which mixed with the combat and movement controls makes it pointless to even try to save the survivor (health items are costly to make and rare to find. You're lucky to even find a bandage. I maybe got 3-5 in 10 maps total which is only 60-100 HP for 4 squad members (20 per bandage)). There's also beefier zombies but honestly they only make the fast speed of the zombies and overall stupid intelligence of the AI seem worse than they really are. I got these beefy 'big' zombies pretty early in all of my attempts and I wouldn't be wrong to say they make hordes of zombies extremely unfair and unfun to fight.The resource management is pretty neat but honestly it starts to demand a lot as you go on, granted it depends on the size of the node you try to secure or the amount of survivors that you have. For me, I rarely found extra survivors. I was lucky to find even one. I went through 2 large nodes and found a total of *ZERO* survivors, so there's that for you. Now, scrap and wood are rare/excessively common depending on, what I assume to be, RNG(random number generator). Each survivor can carry 6 slots (some items take up 2, a few such as food crates or gas cans take up 4)of items but you can find at least one blueprint for a medium backpack but it takes a lot to even make one. In the end, you will find it VERY repetitive to loot items. When you finish a level, any items on the ground or lootable objects not looted are removed / not lootable on return. It really ♥♥♥♥s the whole experience up especially since you can't loot everything so you have to leave some for the magical zombie genies to steal your discarded crap. Overall, I'd say this game has a good idea but play a few hours and you might just realize how flawed this game is. Usually I'd be able to persevere but this game enraged me with how unfair and annoying it is that I had to take a breather and just uninstall it. It's unfair, it's not fun at all and the difficulty is centered around bad controls and bad balancing issues. Perhaps I'm just bad at it but I was doing pretty well until I got to the point of mass-spawning of enemies and the inevitable succumbing to the horrible controls.5/10. It's okay.			"

												Like flash games? Well here's an over-glorified flash game for you. In Survivor Squad you control up to 4 members of a squad on missions to eliminate all zombies in an area, exploring and looting as you go about it. You can then craft new weapons and supplies at your bases, which cost those same resources to establish. You spend gas to travel from area to area, and there's a store. The fact that I can tell you everything about the game four sentences says a lot about what you're getting here.-The controls are horrendous. your squad has really little to no AI to speak of. you have to tell them where to move, where to turn, and occasionally where to attack. If they're alone and a zombie sneaks up behind them, they're dead because apparently they didn't hear it a flesh-eating monster running up behind them and think to turn around and shoot it. They only ever turn to shoot something nearby them if a teammate spots is spotting it beside them in their cone of vision that extends about four yards in front of their face, because hooray near-sightedness. And they also don't start shooting until the enemy is halfway into their cone of vision. Making guns nearly-useless, due to the fact that they also refuse to reload by themselves. They'd rather stand still and get eaten than reload. No, YOU have to select them and hit R manually, or they're ♥♥♥♥ed. You also cannot tell them to turn and face a new direction without moving first. Which is a hell of a ♥♥♥♥ing hassle.-The ""Story"" is pathetic. After going easy on you for the first few levels, prepare for story-based missions where you have to help some guy, or retrieve some item, while pushing against an UNLIMITED tide of zombies until you accomplish your goal, with your UNLIMITED ammo, where enemies charge you from all directions, leaving you finding your squad walking back to back a few feet at a time in what is the most boring mission layout I have ever seen in a game.-The voice ac- oh wait, there was no voice acting. Or maybe there was and it was so bad I didn't remember it. I'm going to stand by saying there was no voice acting. Leaving you to have to actually READ things others are saying while your squad is being eaten alive because you forgot to check the bottom of the screen to see if they were out of ammo and needing you to hold their hand and hit R.I'd tell you everything else that's wrong with this game but there is literally nothing else to criticize, the game is too small to have anything else to criticize. At least it has two other game modes, survival and sandbox. Sandbox being essentially story mode but without the story-driven♥♥♥♥♥♥missions, but it also has no ending as well. Just repetitive gameplay until you die or get bored.3/10. If I had no other games available, maybe I could push myself to finish the story mode at least, but thankfully, I do have other games available, and if you do too, do yourself a favor. Steer clear so far of this game that you forget it exists.			"

												Survivor squad is a tactical  overhead RTS that focuses on survival in a zombie apocalypse/outbreak. Players must take control of the survivors and scavenge for food, gas, and supplies whilst managing inventory space and surviving hordes of the flesh eating dead. There are four modes of play. Multiplayer, where you pick a side of the zombie apocalypse, Humans or zombies. Death Lab, where you have to fight through hordes with a timer and make it to the decon chamber of the next lab. Survival, where you generally just try to survive the apocalypse itself. And finally, Campaign mode, which follows a storyline with unique events and a conclusion. The game itself is incredibly hard and sometimes it isnt fun, but it keeps drawing you back in. The campaign starts out in an empty hospital with the player waking up from an induced coma. You take control of the randomly generated character and wander through the halls until you hear a growling noise, and are pounced upon by one of the dead. A man shoots the undead creature, and you stand up, bewildered and scared. The man explains what happened, in a typical zombie scenario style script, and the two of you go on your merry way. Wait, havent we seen this before? Oh yeah, like in every single zombie themed  movie or television series-Im looking at you, The Walking Dead.  The whole zombie apocalypse thing is getting rather old to the point where this all seems rather repetitive and all the movies, games, and books just kind of glue together into some ominous pulsing conglomerate of gray mediocrity. Im not sure whether to poke it with a stick like a small child, or to ignore it all together. Since we've obviously decided to do the first option, Let me just state that Survivor Squad isnt that good. It isnt bad, but it isnt GOOD. It's OKAY. A lot of games are okay, but this one just strikes me as mediocre and uncreative. And boring. The game itself is a solid thing, like an idiot, but that doesnt make it good. The game has taken to cheekily calling its special infected ""Leapers, Grabbers, Spitters"" obviously its referring to Left4Dead. There is also a distinct lack of women in the game, like all the women in the zombie apocalypse got teleported to some island in the pacific, far removed from the events of the world. I mean, what the heck! Thats a bit weird, if not a bit mysogynist. Okay sure, there are some good features in the game, such as occasional variation in maps, the survivors are randomly created and have random names and appearances, there is some good voice acting, and the modes can be genuinely fun if you have hours of your life to just throw into the wind, but thats about it. The game is more or less suited for an alpha rather than a full release, and thats what caught my attention. ""Oh hey, this doesnt look done, why is it being released for nine dollars?""Over all? Six and a half out of ten. 6.5/10.			"

												Paid $2.25 for game, and i still dont feel like it was worth it. I want to like it, i really do. But i just can't.The only diffculty in this game comes from stupid AI which would rather continue to walk than stop and attack a zombie that's beating them to death.Oh, and bugs... Ive run into that classic one that wont allow a mission end, 2 times out of 3 games. Which is good if you want to kill 500 zombies in 15 minutes, but not good if you'd like to advance the ""story""It reminds me of games ive played for free on newgrounds back in the day, so i cant recommend this game even for less that 5 dollars American..(I feel bad typing that, because i love indie studios though. So try it for yourself, when it's on sale, but youve been warned)			"

												There is so much you could do with 9 dollars that is better than this. I'd get more enjoyment out of a few rolls of charmin ultra than this game. Tried to get into this game. In short it's a very limited game and theres a lot of broken mechanics which really makes it unplayable. Characters can get grabbed and pulled through windows (windows are unbroken and you cant walk through them) so you can have a unit maxed out with gear and he just gets yanked through an unbroken window into a house of 20 zombies and dies, nothing you can do. I've had my survivors pushed into rooms through windows(once that require buttons to be pressed to get out) so your characters get stuck in rooms that no one can get to. Your units are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You have to tell them everything, and when you tell them things, they don't do. examples. They will run straight into zomibes with mellee weapon equiped, and if they can't get to the spot they are trying to get to, they won't kill the zombies, they will just run in place while they get eaten alive.  You tell them to face a certain way, They turn around to shoot zombies other characters are already killing, then low and behold, they won't turn back around to face the way you told them to face. I could go on but it's the short and sweet, Terrible mechanics, so much is broken, difficulty would be fun if you could actually control your units. Go spend your money elsewhere, you'll feel you wasted it here.			"

												This is a fun game, but good luck finding anyone to play multiplayer.  You can technically spend as long as you like with single player, building up safehouses, resources, and survivors to fight the infected onslaught.  Otherwise, you can just burn through this game in a few hours -- you only need to kill the ""brain bug"" type of monster to win, so you can leave plenty of areas uncleared before completing the game.If you want a moderately challenging single-player campaign, pick this up when it is on sale.  $5 or less is my recommendation.

												The strategy in this strategy game comes down to firing your gun in the air and shooting all of the zombies that come out. Sometimes you have to run into a building to destroy a MS Paint blob called a ""Heart"" that attracts the zombies so zombies will stop coming. Oh no, but it's not just zombies! The special infected from Left 4 Dead 2 - I mean - the MUTANTS will come and eat individual characters if you send them off alone! But your characters are all together anyway, shooting the stupid zombies that run out of buildings! Phew, thought this game might actually get exciting for a moment. Hey, while I'm busy comparing this game to Left 4 Dead 2: Survivor Squad is also missing the writing, characters, decent mapping, advanced strategy, adrenaline-filled horror, and anything from Left 4 Dead that isn't 'shoot all the zombies in this building and then steal all the wood and scraps for modest gains in RPG stats'.

												20141106 - 8-10 hours playtime...The playtime isn't bad for such a low budget game, However, I just ran into a bug that completely blocked game progression - due to a ""defend"" mission not ending - nor allowing me to withdraw.Elevator pitch:Top down scavage & survive in a Left 4 Dead style zombie world...Review:This game could have been epic, but the bugs, near programmer level art, flat and unexiting skillsystem make for a very flat and unengaging experience in the end... It is a shame, because a few bits taken care of - this could easily have been worth €20+. Such as:- A massive bug-hunt...- An art overhaul...- More skills both in number and variation...- Some added gameplay features like sneak, move&fire, etc....as it stands - I guess I'm ok with donating €6 to the dev for a good try. Perhaps if he gets enough such donations he will wrap this up into the game it deserves to be.Recommend?This is a hard call... really hard.While I really DO want to recommend this rough diamond - the developer has all but carried himself to the finishing-line and needs but fall over to complete the product - unfortunately I can not recommend a game which has a progression blocks.If I see regular updates - I will reconsider this assessment.

												An RTS should have easy to use controls that allow switching of selected characters and fluid movements. This game has none of that as well as a camera that moves with delay/wobble. Not to mention that there is constant screen flashing due to lightning that gave me headaches. While the game works, it isn't worth the sale price of $0.39 or the actuall retail price.			"

												despite all its flaws, survivor squad is an incredible little gem. yes, we have played more zombie games than we probably ever wanted to play. yes, 4 survivors in a squad and left 4 dead copycat ""special"" infected are as cliche as they get today. as is looting and everything else that goes on in any such game. however, a nice 2-part gameplay with essentially turn-based overview for node/settlement management and real-time top-down shooter for fights is very well implemented.overview part allows to choose the node to attack, along with showng how much time remains until infected push back. building settlements on large nodes will allow you to generate more resources and use these ase a base closer to where action is, along with defending these nodes when infected do come to attack it.fight is nicely dark and otherwise low-visibility action where you need to keep the eyes of your team facing every bloody direction all the time to survive. survivors can outrun infected but not for long and not when there are too many of them. choice of melee weapons or firearms also comes into play - melee is quiet and will not attract large amounts of enemies from all over the map while firearms are more powerful but will attract infected from a large area. gameplay elements are actually quite well designed - hearts that will cause more zombies to spawn until destroyed, floodlights and alarms that do the same until switched off. fortunately, last 5 zombies around every building get highlighted so headhunting the last one is not too much of a chore.both overview and maps for the fights are somewhat random but will start repeating themselves a bit too much at around half or two thirds of the game.itemization/crafting/upgrades system is solid - find blueprints from nodes, find the necessary ingredients (some are obviously hard to find) and cobble together next useful item. 3 levels of items on each slot is not much but it is enough. survivors themselves will also get levels up to 5, eventually allowing you to select 4 out of the 19 available skills. some are more useful to others for specific playstyle but all around, combined with itemization, the mechanic works well enough.going through the campaign will normally take 8-10 hours but can take more or less if you rush or try to experience everything. there are also couple minor additional gamemodes like death labs - descending through levels of lab filled with infected starting with 4 survivors and limited budget for items - and survival - nature of which is fairly obvious. multiplayer exists, but it is a regular deathmatch and requires an open port.

												So far so fun, so I'd recommend it.  The directional revealed light system is quite cool, but I think that people actually have a wider range of view than the 50-60 degree angle presented in the game.  Further, for some reason all missions are done at night.  Perhaps some in game explaination, like they know that zombies are inactive during the day, so that's when everyone sleeps because it's safe?  Also the tutorial level could have been a bit longer, explaining stuff like Active Pausing and controlling your survivor's orientation.  The graphics for the portraits is ... childish at best ... but the overhead view is good and it cuts the zombie killing down to the important stuff.			"

												The tactical squad zombie combat is appealing, but it is simply not done well. The ""controls"" consist of almost exclusively right clicking, which is, of course, not an attack-move order. You could tell your men to move 2 feet to the left and if there's a zombie in the way, they'll path around it taking damage the entire time.The idea is good but qualitatively it's barely better than a lot of flash games you could play. If it was on sale for two or three dollars, it would be worth but full price was a waste of money.You could of course sink some time in to adjust to the wonky mechanics and probably end up enjoting yourself but it would be a poor time cost to benifit ration. A video game is like a cake. You pay for your cake and then you get to eat it. Buying Survivor Squad is like paying someone to give you cake, and then they give you a napkin instead of a plate and chopstiscks instead of a fork. Yeah you could eat cake with chopsticks, but it's way too much work when this cake isn't particularly good in the first place. Just go to a different bakery. Buy infested planet or some other tactical top down shooter.			"

												This is a hard game to review.  It's a nice game, but EXTREMELY unpolished.  Which is unfortunate, because with a month or two of polish this could be a *fantastic* game, rather than just nice.The game is a zombie shooter played from a top-down real-time tactical perspective.  You control a squad of up to four survivors, clearing buildings of zombies and scavenging for supplies.  There are special infected a la 'Left 4 Dead', and rudimentary inventory and leveling systems.Unfortunately, as I said, the game is extremely unpolished:There is no way to queue actions.You can't attack-move, meaning your survivors will walk right by a zombie as it attacks them.The is no cover-system and your only real tactical choice is which way a survivor should face. The result is that every encounter devolves into ""stand out in the open with one survivor facing each direction and wait for them to kill everything.""Most of the levels look and feel the same, causing the game to become repetitive quickly.You spend a significant amount of time doing tedious chores, like searching for the last building or finding the remaining supplies, which could have been easily streamlined.The leveling system is rudimentary and there is no real customization/specialization, so every unit is basically the same.Melee weapons are completely useless.Some of the artwork looks like it was crudely drawn in MS-Paint.None of these things are terrible on their own, but together they make the game feel bland and unfinished.  My review is right on the border of positive, because it WAS really fun for an hour or two; but the lack of polish causes it to quickly become boring, then frustrating.  The game feels like it's in early-access, but the devs adamently insist it's a finished product.  Which is a shame, because this game has so much unrealized potential.If you are a strategy-game aficionado, you will probably enjoy playing this, but maybe wait for a sale.  Everyone else should go play Infectionator: Survivors instead, which is the same game but better in every possible way.5/10 stars			"

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Survivor Squad 

			Views: 344		

			Survivor Squad is a top down zombie survival on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/258050/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your thing: https://twitter.com/TheSocioPsycho...		

Survivor Squad, is a top down scavenger quest. It starts on a bad foot, as every map you play is poorly lit and at nighttime, the  bad camera angle does the game no favors either. It does not have day rotations and and the view gets annoying the more you play. It tries to cover up how ugly or bare bones it by hiding in the darkness, and while that may work for a short time, you see the same map layout so many times it gets old fast. Even through it says it's random what it has to pick from is so small that every time it feels the same. Combat with melee is mostly useless, yes you can kill silently but the enemy will keep respawning in many maps until you complete a task. That means the more you melee the more you get injured, and that would be fine if there was a better looting system in the game. You never find items of use and you can't trade items, only buy. Nor can you use your items to increase the outposts you build. While you may find blueprints to craft you do not find items such as armor or better weapons, which makes looting a chore rather than fun.    The combat controls are frustrating as you are limited to control up to four members. If a zombie gets close to your south point the people in the north will turn and shoot south leaving the zombies in the north to get closer. They do not turn around or have any way to accurately keep their focus fire, in one direction. It becomes a chore of go to map, see same layout and same combat, fight, loot and move on as the game does not respect your time. I can not find myself to recommend this game.

												One of my units suddenly got cut off from the team cause there was a bomb in the house and as I triggered it the doors shut close.He fought alone, with a sentry gun as help, against a giant horde of zombies, while my other units desperatly tried to find the wire cuter for the bomb in the zombie infested building.They all survived that dramatic fight with the time.Just to die at the next building where suddenly a bunch of special zombies pulled a perfect combo on me.10/10 would run into my own demise again			"

												Easy to understand, difficult to master.  This game is not afraid to drop you into an unwinable situation and slaughter your entire squad.  It's also buggy.  Eventually you'll find an exploit and you'll be proud to make it the centerpiece of your strategy.  Because, seriously, the computer is trying to [blank] you in your [blank], and you'll do whatever it takes to win.			"

												Survivor Squad is a top down game where you move your survivors from one area to the next, clearing out hordes of zombies while striving to find the hidden laboratories that host the cure for ""the infected"". Part of your play, besides killing everything that attacks you, is finding other survivors, searching buildings to gather supplies, and crafting items to better equip your team. You can choose to clear areas with a team of 1-4 survivors at a time, and as the game progresses, there are certain harsh situations you might find yourself in, such as having to diffuse a bomb while being trapped in a building or having to quickly find the switch that turns off the alarm before being swarmed by zombies, meaning you will occasionally need fast reactions so as not to get overwhelmed. Despite what I have read on here, shooting everything in range is not always a viable option (especially when a horde is passing by) and even though the strategic decisions you get to make in this game do not have much depth, there is always the occasional benefit from choosing to be stealthy or using a gadget.Unfortunately, the game could use improvement as it has several shortcomings. The art style seems poorly made, there are several situations where your movement gets glitchy, the audio is bad, and the game depth is not very satisfying. Overall the basic mechanics are there and are viable, but it seems like they could all use some polishing to make this game good. Despite its shortcomings though, I will not thwart you away from this game as it could be a pleasant casual game for those who are not looking for something complex. I will instead recommend that you watch some gameplay videos before deciding to play it.			"

												I really enjoyed playing this game, although the actual main story and game is rather bland, every level is the same and there always in darkness. You control 4 survivors, of which you can level up with exp as you go, this gives them special abilitys such as having a better shot or more health. The new added dlc is great although very short, but hey it free and is a gd addition. Theres also a survival game mode and also something called death lab, which is survival over ten levels. At first the game seems difficult but once you learn it can be paused on the go and movements planned while paused it all becomes a little easiar.... but be warned, youre find yourself tapping that spacebar like a crazy man to advance. Overall for the price this is a must buy for anyone who enjoys this type of game, 7.5/10			"

												Survivor Squad is a top-down strategic survivor management game.The review will be represented with a simplistic ""Pros/Cons/Neutral"" format.Pros:* Can be run with even a potato* Been in multiple bundles, so value is cheap* Good concept* Scavenging* Mechanics like the horde, which make you hide indoors* Still manages to create a believeable atmosphere* A lot of gameplay hidden hereNeutral:* Stealth, but extremely whimsily made* Graphics look like they were made with paint sometimes* Randomized world, but no personality to itCons:* Survivors have no personality with no real reason to care about their survivor, except for their experience points and levels* Repetitive* Bad controls* Unclear campaign objectives other than ""There is scientist, he know cure, we go get!""* The enemy types are indestinguishable sometimesOverall: 6/10Buy it only during a sale, from a bundle or trade for it.

												Survivor Squad is a good game that could've been great. While it is a bit bare-bones, the basic structure is all there. Build your squad, capture and defend nodes, loot nodes, build gear and find the source of the outbreak. The gameplay is fun, difficult and requires some thinking. Survivors can be leveled up and gain useful abilities, but they can also die, leaving you with low-level survivors who can't handle the latter portions of the game.If there was ever a DLC to expand the content of the game, extending the length, I would jump on it.

												As a huge fan of randomly generated games, the premise of Survivor Squad really excited me. I did not buy the game (it was gifted to me), but I would not have bought it had I researched it prior. The most obvious, glaring problem is the UI and art style. I play roguelike games, so to have a poor UI/art style is a very difficult thing to do in my eyes, but Survivor Squad pulls it off. It looks like a browser flash game from 2005, and it handles just a little better. The UI faces similar issues, it just isn't satisfying to use. I feel like I'm playing a game drawn by a kid with crayons. The gameplay was okay. I killed some zombies, I looted some stuff, I progressed. I guess they are going for ultra realism, as each character can only carry a small amount of items. That would be cool if the crafting system didn't require so many materials. In this aspect, it is very grindy, and not in the MMORPG way, but more in the ""I'm really ♥♥♥♥ing sick of finding nothing in these chests"" way. I don't see this game improving. Don't buy it.EDIT: I'm not sure why it says 0.0hrs. Maybe I was offline.			"

												This game is a mediocre over-the-top or birdseye viewed zombie shooter that relies on overwhelming you with zombies to increase the difficulty. It has a considerable amount of bugs, and when I say considerable I mean that it is something you WILL notice and consider (consider deleting it). The developers have stated that they consider the game complete and they refuse to update it or fix a single bug. Refused, so before you buy this remember to go ♥♥♥♥ yourself first, because that is the only help you'll get from the developers. Play Dead Pixels instead, it's cheaper anyway.			"

												Take control of a team of four of the most generically named idiots as they fight for what's left of Earth, which consists entirely of the same 5-6 buildings in various random configuration.  Experience the thrill of puzzling out unexplained game mechanics, extreme jumps in difficulty, mashing the spacebar every 20 seconds to pause the game, figure out what just happened and micromanage your squad so hard you'll be telling them when to inhale and when to exhale.  Survivors so smart you'll have to tell them when to stop moving so that they can shoot the zombie that just appeared in front of them.  Attack move?  So 90s!  Get with the program!Use a variety of six guns and four (inlcuding punching) melee weapons, each of which is utterly outclassed by the next upgrade.  If you hate difficult choices, you're in luck, as there's no reason to use an obsolete weapon ever!  They also look dinsticntly different in your character's hands. 2014 technology ladies and gentlemen!Fight challenging zombies and special infected that Are Totally Not From Left 4 Dead 1 or 2.  There's the smo--grabber, the hunt--jumper, the boo--carrier, the spi-- oh it's actually called the spitter.And the gadgets!  I'm very confident there were more gadgets asides from sentry guns, a futuristic area of effect bomb that kills all enemies nearby and video cameras to spot for the sentry guns, but I'll be darned if I can remember them.  There are also several suits of armour in the game.  With the same nuance you'dexpect by now they are linear upgrades with no drawbacks, entirely devoid of interesting decisions to make.When it comes to character progression, the power is yours!  Experiment away as you can reset your perks at any time between missions.  Watch early perks be outclassed in utility by later ones.  Quickly settle in to your favourite character build and get busy wearing in that rut.That someone possibly got paid actual money to draw the portraits in this game is unbelievable!  The portrait art is priceless, in the same way a three year old drawing on the wall in pastel excrement is priceless.  It is genuinely offensively horrible, like all the great works of deviantART.  Soldiers are assembled from bits of one another with differening skin tones and some will have helmets.  All have the same terrifying eyes that you will burn clear through your soul.The campaign story line is incredible.  Writing on par with George R. R. Martin of Game of Thrones takes you on an epic journey where you will bump into a stranger who will tell you what to do.  And do it you will!  After you've done that, you'll find another man to tell you what to do!  And once you've done that, you'll kill a very fat zombie in a glass cage and the game will end with a credits screen.  A moving tale of redemption and the power of love.  The story is told in a very minimilist fashion which adds to the pathos and dark tones.  Feel your spine tingle with dread as unskippable slow text uncurls on the screen voiced by chipmunks very excited to see one another.  Creepy!And if you want a change from the monotony of doing the same thing over and over again for too long, switch to Survival mode!  It's almost the same as camaign mode, but stripped down of what few choices you had about where to go next and what to defend!  You will go on a one way journey from random map to random map.Where the game might possibly be worth a single dollar is in Death Labs mode.  With a limited budget you will assemble a squad of four, picking your weapons, ammo, gadgets and perks.  You start in a lab which resembles a maze strung out between elevators without any scientific research equipment to be seen.  Your goal is to get to the next level of the lab before an ominous decontamination timer reaches zero.  Such tension!  Don't remember that you can pause, hold down shift and scroll around to see items on the ground.  And certainly don't realize that every down elevator has a medkit in it.Enjoy the utter crap shoot that is lab level 10 on this game mode.  Watch helplessly as a survivor will get pulled away from your group by a grabber, another, another, and then possible another.  All the while being pummeled by every zombie in the tight, tight corridor.Get this game if you hate your money and you hate yourself!P.S. ammo is unlimited.  You will always have a full reload.  At no time does the game tell you this.  I wiped on two campaigns before I realized I hadn't scavanged up any ammo as there literally wasn't any.  I guess that's my fault for heavily associating zombie apocalypse survival games with limited ammo.STORY SPOILERS BELOW(P.P.S the fat zombie in a cage is telekentically secreting eggs across the land which are hatching into these zombies.  That is the actual story line.  I am not making this up.  Apparently the eggheads in the lab captured it in their lab, somehow, at the start of the outbreak but before they realised it could just plant zombie eggs anywhere it wanted.)			"

												Closely resembles a game I always dreamed of making.Pro: The long campaign was very satisfying allowing you to try to amass a large following of fighters to keep at map locations for defense food supplies permitting. Starting alone with a pistol and ending by storming the final location along your best three men armed with assault rifles and armor. 17 KIA, 36 MIA, 73 Turned away, 35 Survivors. Other gamemodes let you jump right into the thick of it. Con: The audio could drive a person mad with injury sounds and door hinges getting played endlessly. You WILL hear what i mean if you play the campaign. Some minor bugs affect playability, for example after defending a zone sometimes a few zombies with be stuck around the map without indicators and finding them is an unnecessary pain as they are clearly stuck because of faulty pathfinding.Overall: I really enjoyed large portions of the game and was willing to deal with a few annoyances to complete the modes.

												Oh look! Another game completed abandoned by the developers because they got a taste of money. Do not waste your time supporting this developer unless you just really want to waste $10. It's really kind of sad too because it had a LOT of potential. And by a LOT I mean I would've paid $40 for this game to be fleshed out and fully realized. Unfortunately the developer is a money-hungry sellout.			"

												Nice little Zombie game with a tactical approach. It also seems to be randomized each time you play so it is somehow rogue like.It is very important to place your soldiers tactically. Rushing in a building with all 4 soldiers might get you swamped with Zombies. So scout the place first, stealth kill stray Zeds, thin the Zeds by shooting through windows and so on. But always have someone cover the back as Zombies can sneak up from behind. Use your gadgets wisely!There are some elements that force you making quick decisions like bombs, alarm traps and Zombie spawning room size hearts :D			"

												This an interesting game. But you should get this game in a discount or during a sale.it is a survival top-down, rogue-like thingyThe game is a little bit too repetive/dull. Only thing what u will keep doing (mostly), Shooting zombies and looting.You can build ""safe houses"" and those are secured.You can find blueprints to craft new items. There are a couple of resources.  It also has some Left for dead reference which i find stupid and mostly it is the enemy zombies.it has ""hunter and spitter"" for in example.You can find survivors and join them your group. There are events sometimes on the map. Which you could do.There is also a temperature effect, which could increase or decreases your vision, and how the weather will be, which is ok. keeps the game okay.There is a difficulty settings and a level difficulty settings. (like how high the danger zone is)It has multiplayer but i am not sure if that is alive, playing it with your friends could be okay but don't expect too much out of this.I give this a medium rating 5/10. It is fun but it's repetive and replayability isn't high too.			"

You have not so much control on survivors, so tactical playing is in theory only. Gadgets useless - I used camera and personal defence, but I it's can't see effects or just it's useless.

												Fun game, however my main issue is that the game will toss you into a brick wall. What I mean by that is you go to your first level 3 area and get destroyed because tons of specials attack at once and all of your survivors die because they cannot fight the horde. I really do like this game but some changes need to be made so I can stop save scuming to get passed a single node, which is my only way to progress.			"

												This is the game has almost all the things I would like to put in ""my game""... but it lacks LOT of other things I would add.How's that possible?On one hand, you have a, let's call it ""XCom light"" part of the game: Survivor management let you equip your squad with different weapons, equipment (Which you will built with scavenged supplies) and make them better at different skills. Then you can send them off to dangerous missions to scavenge more supplies and try to learn what happened to the world.You go to several random-generated maps and explore the houses: You can find supplies, places to create new bases (And get more supplies), bombs which will detonate if you don't find a wire cutter, alarms... all of them really helps to add variety to the game.The action (And the inclusion of the dynamic pause, like in Baldur's Gate) feels quite right (although I would liked to have the classic ""stand ground/patrol/look only in this direction"" buttons). It let you order your survivors move around and maybe only will get you in trouble if you go too fast.But, on the other hand, there's not really so much contentAll the places loolks horribly similar. The random generator picks two-three houses from a set of pre-made maps, the street its just empty. All the characters look the same and have almost the same voice. Even the special zombies are all out from Left 4 Dead: You got the spitter, a charger's cousin, and smoker... and of course you need another survivor to rescue him. Still, they work good in the game (hey, they are proven formulas).Even the inclusion of events (like the bombs, the hordes or the attack) fall short and after some maps you have already seen everything (In almost every single combination that matters).There's a lot of good ideas on the game, fairly well implemented, but the general feeling is austere, lacking of both more content graphically and gameplay wise. Maybe you will have to rethink your strategy once or twice but after realizing that sound matters and guns don't, you will be set up to the final boss.Its a feeling of ""yeah, that's right, I want MORE. And maybe some tweaks on this, and more equipment, and different survivors and..."" it's something difficult to critizice, given its indie development, but still, there's a sensation of ""we couldn't add fancy stuff to the game"" after the second map that just don't go away.I haven't played the lab mode, by the way, only the campaign.

												Survivor Squad is a tactical squad based zombie survival game. It's top down and real time. With your squad you need to clear area's and loot them. Area's are connected through an map and you can chose to which area you go that day. The game doesn't look good but it's functional. The UI is sometimes confusing. When you get used to it it's ok. The controls are very limited. For example you can't shift click and queue orders. Making things like looting tedious. In the end the game has a cool concept, but the execution isn't that great. I would only recommend it if you really look for this kind of zombie game.			"

												Its ok. Its annoying to control 4 guys as its not really easy or intuitive. You have to control all at once during attacks and you'll try clicking to turn them around or attack something and the zombie will move and then your guy will just run forward to them. This makes the combat/movement system clunky as there is no real way to turn without moving. Also the basic gameplay has problems. You take points but you rarely get what you need and if you craft any materials its impossible to get enough back to make medkits, and you don't usuall find enough. Bandages barely do anything so you are always hurt. Your characters permanantely die which is fine but since they level and the people you have at other locations don't its basically a waste. They should level so you can substitute them in. The other biggest problems is there are branching paths, but that any taken node can be retaken by zombies. Since i had no medkits I had to go a different route, but since you also have to use gas (another annoying variable that just hinders your progress and that you barely find) I had to rest 24 hours. After taking a point I came back to the map and around 5-6 nodes id spent an hour taking were suddenly retaken. I dont have the resources to retake all those points so I said ♥♥♥♥ this game. The cards are already stacked against you they shouldn't just make you suddenly lose all your progress. Too many mistakes and poor game choices. This has mized reviews for a reason. Also has no story and goes nowhere, every level seems about the same. You have no idea if you're progressing in the campaign and how you move forward, or what you should be doing. Crafting is way too expensive. You have 4 guys and it takes 1 hr to get enough to craft 1 part for 1 guy. Like all the blueprints though. 5/10			"

												Now, before you hate me for saying I don't recommend this game, what I mean is this: I do not recommend this game to those who have low levels of patience. As such, I utterly despise this game; it starts out incredibly easy, but within the first 10 in-game days, the difficulty skyrockets in no time, and the game becomes unbeatable without save-scumming. Anyway. The game does look kinda crap, but it is a heap of fun, despite the massively high frustration level that could be likened by trying to mine gold with your skull alone. Overall, this is a fairly fun game, and not bad for the few cents I paid for it; definitely not a bad title, and I do recommend people play it.. IF you can handle frustration and multiple restarts. If not, stay far away from this game.			"

												This game is terrible. I played it for five minutes, and it's simply not good. The characters make an annoying sound every time they move, the controls are clunky, and it all looks/feels like a flash game. Oh, and it's also a virus. I have 20 minutes because the game kept re-launching itself every time it closed. It kept leaving background files that were quickly adding up and causing problems. The game also tried to launch itself repetedly after fully restarting my computer, so I uninstalled it. I wouldn't reccomend it if it was free. This would be a kickass flash game, but this isn't worth $9 the developers are asking for, and isn't worth your time.			"

												Survivor Squad is a top down zombie survival game.Here's a video of a Let's Play/Review I did on it.

It is essentially Left 4 Dead: 2D Top Down Edition (going as far as having a mob that spits acid and calls it a Spitter). The story is typical and not anything to look forward to. In fact, I think it's just like L4D in that regard. The story's so standard that it feels non-existent. There's nothing that makes me care about the characters nor is there much happening other than wandering the dark and shooting the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of zombies. As I said, it's fairly standard. Too standard, if you ask me. The only reason you'd buy this if you were a die hard zombie apocolypse (which I am not, I was gifted this)The multiplayer is also rather terrible. It only lets one friend be the zombies, while the other survives. Where's the co-op? The game would be redeemable if it had a Co-Op Multiplayer. At least L4D has that. For many, only having a Vs. is a huge downside. The developers said in the forums they don't plan on adding it though. That's a shame.3/10 - L4D 2D Top Down Edition is not interesting.			"

												I was really interested in the game and my friend bought it for me, so I was totes excited. But I soon discover that the machanics of the game were god awful and I quickly dropped the game. I made the awful decision to try it again, dealing with the machanics, but the game itself is poorly made and I now feel bad for my friend buying me this game full price. It's a really interesting game, no doubt, the machanics just suck and you have to be pretty pro pretty quickly to go far, which also sucks.			"

												Pretty good game to burn time.  Severely irritated when I select the whole squad and only the squad lead goes to the designated area.  My squad died because the other squad members were around the corner of the building...  Really getting annoyed by AIM function. I select an area for that member to aim and he goes and looks at the other door leaving his door wide open for zombies to just flood the room. Then they get confused?I'm also having trouble with the Bomb in the rooms when the doors lock. I send in a squad and it activates to soon and it leaves a straggler outside to die.Windows don't shatter when the bomb goes off.Squad has autism when it comes to which target to shoot.  They keep looking in a different direction than what I ordered, causing that area to be flanked because they won't go back to looking at the previous area.			"

												I say no for recommendation for now, because people tend to say yes too easily, even so they didn't even played 2 hours..  I didn't play much with this yet, but the first thing you notice is the crapy controls. There are hundreds of games with similar controlling and they work well, you don't have to learn how to control a new game. But not in this game. You can get used to it somewhat, but this is a survivor game, and you get injuries by the time you push the right button.. For example with the mouse ""fire button"" you actually deselect your men, and if you figure out why they don't shoot, then you can spend time selecting them again. It's lucky that at least they fire automaticly. Too bad, they can't decide automaticly who's backpack has still space.. They also tend to forget wich way they should look after a single zombie attack from the other direction.. No tactical formation saving either.. So what I am telling, that it could be a good game, but a player should have tested it.. There should be a little more from each: controlling function, automatic behavior, tactical function.			"

												This is another game that I really wanted to like. However, excecution is poor, and the whole thing feels like a browser game. It's much too easy, requires absolutely no tactics or planning, and the only time I died in several hours of gameplay was when an NPC said ""I'll be right behind you!"" and then sprinted directly into a zombie-infested building, making me run my squad in blindly to try to protect him. In addition, your survivors are psychic and can tell how many zombies are in an area, when a building is clear, and sometimes even where the zombies are, regardless of distance, line-of-sight, sound, etc. Most damning, the controls are clunky, and the majority of the difficulty stems not from enemies, but from clicking the wrong spot and suddenly deselecting all of your soldiers.TL;DR version: Probably should have been turn-based. Also, I've read some of the comments made by the developer regarding bugs and issues people are having, and he seems to be like ""SORRY GUYS IT'S FINISHED THANKS FOR THE MONEY KBYE"". This, more than anything else, makes me not recommend this game.			"

												I will start by saying I would like to recommend this game because it is a lot of fun BUT there is a major issue that needs to be sorted out which is the FPS. When your on levels that zombies come none stop till you do a certain task or large maps with tons of zombies already. The lag is so bad that the game is unplayable. They need to add a zombie cap so the level doesnt get overpopulated or for dead bodies to fade out after reaching a certain cap. Until this issues is sorted I would say keep your money in your wallet. Just to be clear I have a top spec gaming pc and this makes no difference to stop the lagging. Shame because this game has a lot of potential. Please fix this Endless Loop Studios!!!			"

												For all ye souls who purchased this game at its normal price, 8.99, I feel sorry for you. I too, looking at the videos and pics of gameplay thought this game looked pretty good. Of course, any product may look good in theory and before the initial tryout, but this game is seriously not worth the biggest sale price they could give you. Maybe free, it would be relevent, but this game is incomplete, and seriously a dissappointment. Its kinda like when 2K announced they were remaking the famous XCOM game, but then they also announced that they were making it a shooter. Although they did make the new XCOM and did a really good job. Sadly, this product isnt even halfway close to the aforementioned situation. The devs sold this game for 8.99, which is not that bad of a price for a good game, but this game is just bad. Its incomplete, buggy, and if youve been listening to what the devs say, they think that the game being incomplete actually makes it complete. Thats sad. So please, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME. EVEN IF ITS ON SALE, DO NOT GIVE THESE DEVS A SINGLE PENNY.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!This is one of the worst games I have ever bought. First off the entire point of the game is to right click and make your sqaud kill all the zombies on the level. That might be fun if it wasn't for this massive glitch that says there is still 15 zombies remaining before you can leave the area. So I search the entire map end to end and can't find any more infected. What's the point in that? This took be about 20 mins to get to that point and I restarted the game at least twice to make sure I didn't do anything wrong. The multiplayer in this game is non-existent. Absolutedly noone plays MP on this game. So my advice, do not get the game, it's a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

First time playing I lost a survivor because i acidentally used my gun an alerted a ton of zombies in the area.  somehow my other guy survived it but not for long because I made the decision to save supplies to make a better backpack instead of doing the smart thing and make something to protect myself.

												Survivor Squad is a top down strategy game, where you can control up to 4 survivors as you clear out level(or nodes, as they're called in-game) by level, looting the buildings and avoiding traps as you go. While in the game, you can pause the game and issue orders to your survivors, which they will carry out when you unpause.There's a basic resource management in this game. You can loot different materials from the nodes, which are used for crafting various weapons, equipment, and gadgets. Managing the loot you collect in levels can be difficult and meaningful. Since you usually won't have room for ALL the loot you find, do you collect the loot that will let you build better weapons? Or do get the loot that will let you make better armor, backpacks(storage space for more loot), and healing items? Not too long after starting the game, you get the opportunity to ""capture"" ""large"" nodes, which will generate basic resources like Wood and scrap, which are the most commonly used crafting material, and Food and Gas, which are used to feed survivors and let them travel to different nodes.As for the bad: - There are many instances where enemies will attack through walls, which really screws with the balance.    - Get pushed through walls.     - Get stuck in corners.- Jam doors shut so you can't pass through them (there are instances where ""locked doors"" are intentionally, but I'm talking about places they aren't).- When enemies are ramming against walls because their occasional ""walk in a straight line"" mentality won't reach you, they'll sort of all stack on top of each other, with very little visual indication they did so. So what appears to be one enemy will turn out to be 18.- All of the above(minus the 'death stack') happening to your survivors as well.- Vital interactive environment pieces like buttons that turn off alarms and floodlights wills sometimes be placed in awkward places that your survivors will not be able to reach.Those are just the bugs I'VE experienced. Others have reported many more. It's been a long time since there's been an update, and I doubt there will be more. Devs have stated that ""all promised features are in the game, so it's finished"", and other than fixing some game destroying bugs, they've ignored most the rest so far. I'll update this review if that changes.As for other issues with this game:- The late game is pretty shallow. Early game your trying to scrounge up all resources you can in order to get better weapons, armor, gadgets, and bigger backpacks. Mid game get's less frantic crafting wise, as not only will you have nodes that gather wood and scrap for you, but there's less to craft. Late game mostly comprises finishing the story and maintaining your territories, the crafting and food supply aspect almost completely forgotten.- There's some utility features that I wish were in there. Looting the containers in a building loses it's charm fairly quickly, and ordering the containers searched will be tedious. I wish there was a button that tells the survivors to ""loot all containers until your full"", or something like that.- Another feature I wish was there was ""back to back"". Having the survivors back to back, looking in each direction, is the most common and important maneuver. Doing it manually is clunky as hell, and I wish there was a button for it.Despite all this, it's still a solid game, as most bugs can be ignored, easily worth about $5, though I wouldn't pay full price.

												If you want a cheap zombie survival game this is it.  Easy to pick up as well as fun.  First time playing I lost a survivor because i acidentally used my gun an alerted a ton of zombies in the area.  somehow my other guy survived it but not for long because I made the decision to save supplies to make a better backpack instead of doing the smart thing and make something to protect myself.

												Survivor Squad is a top down strategy game, where you can control up to 4 survivors as you clear out level(or nodes, as they're called in-game) by level, looting the buildings and avoiding traps as you go. While in the game, you can pause the game and issue orders to your survivors, which they will carry out when you unpause.There's a basic resource management in this game. You can loot different materials from the nodes, which are used for crafting various weapons, equipment, and gadgets. Managing the loot you collect in levels can be difficult and meaningful. Since you usually won't have room for ALL the loot you find, do you collect the loot that will let you build better weapons? Or do get the loot that will let you make better armor, backpacks(storage space for more loot), and healing items? Not too long after starting the game, you get the opportunity to ""capture"" ""large"" nodes, which will generate basic resources like Wood and scrap, which are the most commonly used crafting material, and Food and Gas, which are used to feed survivors and let them travel to different nodes.As for the bad: - There are many instances where enemies will attack through walls, which really screws with the balance.    - Get pushed through walls.     - Get stuck in corners.- Jam doors shut so you can't pass through them (there are instances where ""locked doors"" are intentionally, but I'm talking about places they aren't).- When enemies are ramming against walls because their occasional ""walk in a straight line"" mentality won't reach you, they'll sort of all stack on top of each other, with very little visual indication they did so. So what appears to be one enemy will turn out to be 18.- All of the above(minus the 'death stack') happening to your survivors as well.- Vital interactive environment pieces like buttons that turn off alarms and floodlights wills sometimes be placed in awkward places that your survivors will not be able to reach.Those are just the bugs I'VE experienced. Others have reported many more. It's been a long time since there's been an update, and I doubt there will be more. Devs have stated that ""all promised features are in the game, so it's finished"", and other than fixing some game destroying bugs, they've ignored most the rest so far. I'll update this review if that changes.As for other issues with this game:- The late game is pretty shallow. Early game your trying to scrounge up all resources you can in order to get better weapons, armor, gadgets, and bigger backpacks. Mid game get's less frantic crafting wise, as not only will you have nodes that gather wood and scrap for you, but there's less to craft. Late game mostly comprises finishing the story and maintaining your territories, the crafting and food supply aspect almost completely forgotten.- There's some utility features that I wish were in there. Looting the containers in a building loses it's charm fairly quickly, and ordering the containers searched will be tedious.

												Survivor Squad is the kind of game that gets your adrenalin pumping because of the random jump scares and thrill of trying to well, Survive. As i played more getting deeper and deeper into this zombie infested role playing Game i found out some cruel reality's about it like how you can kill other survivors if you aren't careful. I have to say that one disappointment is that the only thing I've found in safes are Gordons which aren't a very good reward in my mind and i was hoping for more of a reward like silver or maybe a blueprint but apart from that its a good game.

												Not bad. Cheap and enjoyable in short bursts. It abstracts away a lot of the messy recordkeeping, but keeps the feel of survivalism, though perhaps a bit more militant form of it than most. The pause-anytime feature is nice. Let's you play it RTS or quasi-turn-based. The survivors' AI seems fairly decent; I've seen complaints in the forums, but they have behaved for me thus far. It's a little light on some tutorial-type info, but it's not so brutal that you can't pick it up as  you go. And I picked it up half-off, so I can't complain at a $4.50 price point ;oP			"

												Quite nice game, thought late game gets frustrating when survivor number becomes a problem because of food, demanding you to sacrifice some little fellas (it feels wrong to me). The random map generation creates little world sometimes, which cripples your desire to explore, as you see the world totally cleansed.Also, stay away from the windows, they are all buggy and the Grabbers can magically pull you through, which results in 70/100 death. Spitters can spit through it too.Overall, it's a great game for its price, recommended. Just don't expect fancy graphics.			"

												I’d give this a 6/10. It's a great game but i keep finding myself stuck at a certain amount of progression. I’ve tried replaying 3 or 4 times but still get stuck.Lets start with the good-It has a great concept and awesome, intense gameplay.-A nice, but improvable skill and level system - The ability to build safe areas that generate materials is cool. Good when you’re stuck in a rut.-the inventory size is a brilliant idea.-nice story line-gadgets and such are pretty darn cool. Turrets and cameras are my favouriteGlitches:-Spitters can spit through glass and grabbers can grab and drag squad members through glass.-There have been times where I cleanse an area only to have it recaptured the next day; before I can advance. 10/10 on the annoying and rage quitting scale.-Sometimes a squad member will prioritise a group of zombies that had been seen and would be easily dealt with by another member rather than the hoard coming at the door. Also when a squad member is attacked by a jumper his buddies either shoot the other zombies before the one that’s pinning him.- I have found certain maps, during a defence round, zombies won’t attack the area you are in and instead stay in certain areas, requiring you to hunt for them, which is quite boring.- exiting a game will save your squad.Ideas to improve the game-diverse personalities and speeds. A range of movement speed, reloading skills and gadget efficiency would be cool. Certain personalities pick up and improve in certain fields.-being able to move non-squad and/or have multiple squads. Moving survivors for defence from town to town as you progress is almost impossible. -WOMEN!-working at a large facility is required for/improves production- implement of buildings such as hospitals, workshops and storage. Hospitals for increased healing, workshops for building or improving gadgets and storage for storing equipment and materials.- Co-operation mode aswell as fighting multiplayer.dispite this i still like and continue to play this game.

												This game has a lot of potential and could be something better.The characters that you control are just too stupid to allow me to reliably clear out buildings without taking too much damage. They will keep going to where you told them to go no matter what is in the way and wont attack and of the zombies hanging off of them. This means that there is a MASSIVE difficulty spike when you get to the level 2 buildings.The special zombies are an alright idea but are just taken from Left 4 Dead so they don’t seem fresh and are just run-of-the-mill.The spitters are just over powered as they can shoot through walls and any other obstacle. This means that you could be in a building and then there is spitter goo flying through 4 walls and 3 rooms to land directly on one of my team members.The jumpers are basically hunters from L4D so they are as you can expect and mean that splitting up your squad is a bad idea in most situations. This offers a glimmer of hope to an otherwise frustrating game.The crafting is a good idea because it makes you go back to old locations to gather resources that you had missed before. It also means that you can equip your team with better equipment so that they won't die so fast. You do, however, use cloth to make armour. You also use cloth to make bandages. Because of the stupidity of your squad members, you will be making bandages more than you will be making armour.You also have to defend locations if you leave them for too long. I find that this is a good idea because it keeps you on your toes and makes you clear out the areas adjacent. This does mean that your squad will be really badly damaged or killed. This is because they throw hundreds if zombies at you and this is very difficult unless you have built defences to help.Overall this game could be a great game if the problems are either tweaked or sorted out.

												To be reductive: It is Left 4 Dead the (budget) pausable strategy game.You start a mission, kill all the zombies, search all the searchables, collect all the ""loot"", end the mission, go back to base, level up, craft, and equip for the next mission. Repeat until bored.It is a lot of fun. Worth a buy at $5 not $9. Wait for a sale.`			"

But still.Also, it should be said that haven't played it to anywhere near the end yet - but I wanted to get this review out before the sale ended. Just buy it and try it for yourself!

												Yet another game jumps on the zombie bandwaggon.The game has some nice ideas but there is just not that much content to keep it interesting for long. Story is non-existent. You keep on searching same-looking black/greyish buildings for stuff while fighting with the clumsy controls and bad AI of your fellows. While you are supposed to scavenge stuff the initial inventory is way to small so that adds further to frustration.Also zombies can retake areas so you might have to refight the levels. RPG elements are kept simple - all characters have the same skill tree. And the art-style is really bad - not like ""good"" bad but as in ""bad"" bad.The good stuff? Exciting shooting and tension, lot of blood. But it's not enough to save the game.			"

But I draw the mother♥♥♥♥ing line when I hack the game and am still at risk of losing due to sheer lack of fairness.If you want it, Buy it, get out notepad, hack it, and have fun slaughtering zombies.

												if you are a fan of the Walking Dead series on TV, you may like this game. in the game, you control a squad up to 4 members, scavenge different locations for food, gas and materials. you can rescue other survivors and bring them to safe houses, defense your place before waves of dead ones. There are some kinds of zombies, which you may find it is quite similiar to Left 4 Dead series. You have spliters, jumper, grabber, blinder. and it it quite fun to play through. the most annoying bug that i found in this game, is that the zombie can attack through walls and connors. I was deploying my squad to a connor in order to defense the house. Then a grabber from outside the house hooked up 1 of my survivors and he stuck in the connors, and i couldn't do anything but reload my autosave file to play again. the same thing happen with spliters. Sometimes, if you control the whole squad and you move so close to the wall of a house, there might be a chance ( not a small chance ) that one of your survivors will appear on the other side of the walls, the result is that he dies because of the horde inside the house before other memebers can come and rescue himthis game is fun, but some bugs can ruin all your joy. Recommend to buy it when it is on sale. I grab this game with only 1.25$ so it is not so bad to play, but 5 ? i dont think it worths			"

												Remember the days when you were controlling more than just one dude in top-down games like RTS games? If not... get out. Jk.Anyboo, control up to four unfortunate dudes to live in yet another zombie infested game, loot everything, panic micro when Spitter pukes acid and Grabber grabbed one of your dudes.Find survivors, craft things and stuff, build fortification which will become pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to defend later because the game decides that you want to defend the same area twice in the row for some bloody reason = let some people go or waste resources for bandages or medkits instead of that armor or shiny and larger backpack you wanted ever since you were twelve until you get turrets which destroy pretty much everything the game threw at me in 6 hours.It's not too bad what it is most of the part but all you can really do is to click your guys to move, attack, loot, trade items so you could fit that food crate into somebody's backpack (don't ask.. VG logic) and occasionally defuse a C4 because the previous owner of the house didn't want anybody to loot his home but no attack + move command or patrol which would be so so so very nice.Wait for a heavy discount.

												It is really frustrating not to be able to finish a campaign, but this game is just too hard.  I guess I got my 2 bucks out of it, but I give up.  Because it is randomly generated, you never get enough resources to build all the crap you need to survive, and the game is sometimes completely unfair.  OK, get half of your squad into a building when suddenly the doors lock, half the squad is sitting ducks outside while the two others have to fight off zeds while searching the complete building for wire cutters (wouldn't you carry some with?) with the timer running and boom!  Restart, if the game hasn't already crashed which it did for me repeatedly.			"

												Survivor Squad is a fun little game - I understand it's based off a Flash game of the same name, although I must admit I've never played it.Screenshots and videos might lead you to think it's less tactical than it actually is - careful positioning of team members is essential once you start to get onto the harder difficulties, as it gets pretty unforgiving, but there's enough variety in maps and looting to keep you going for quite a while.It's not all great - there's a few annoyances, and the 'heart' levels which require you to destroy a 'heart' to stop infinitely spawning zombies quickly get tiresome. It would have been nice to see some 'special' zombie types that weren't literally just ripped from Left 4 Dead too, as much to show that there had at least been some kind of original thought gone into it.All in all, it's probably about right for its price - it's an enjoyable little time-killer, but most people will probably only get 10 or so hours out of it before they get bored.Fun to play?: YesAny game-breaking issues?: NoWorth the price of admission?: Yes			"

												 I can't express how much I love this game. I have owned it for several months now and I am very happy to see it on Steam.  Survivor Squad has a ton of survivor game goodness.  Very good effects and sound. There are plenty of  reviews out there so I won't go into much more detail.  But if the videos of gameplay look fun, it's because IT IS!  So fun.			"

												Simply said this game looks bit ugly and clunky. But don't just judge by the looks, the gameplay is funny as hell. I really enjoyed playing this and would love to play this in coop with friends. But sadly this one here just got a multiplayer 1vs1 only, which even isn't that easy to connect to each other. I tried it few times via the online IP my friend and I had, but we just couldn't manage to join us.So I only can speak for the singleplayer which I played for a bit and that sure had the right amount of tatical placement of my characters, scavanging around for materials to craft better stuff, and trying to survive while figuring the mission objectives.I totally can recommend this game!

												Somewhat good, but still rough game about strategic survival in zombie-infested world. Turn-based on world level, realtime with smart pause on node level. Simply but addictive. I like this game, even if I cannot totally understand the rules. Why no zones (after first) generates resources? How am I supposed to feed survivors, if I haven't enough food? How can I use ""market"" zone, if I claimed it already? There are more such questions for me, and it keeps to grow while I am progressing.Also, it's quite nervous, trying to secure buildings before all hostages will be eaten by zombie. It's most annoying aspect for me (and endless zombies until you'll finish proposed task is second one).Unfortunately, I got bug in my game when I killed everyone, and secured everything, but cannot claim zone (program thinks there are 10 zombies here), and cannot leave it (by the same reason). As my last save is too far back, I think, it will end my relations with this game. Pity. I will wait for patches.			"

												This game rocks. It takes all the best elements of the roguelikes I've been playing (Bionic Dues, Sword of the Pit, etc) and the top downs (Door Kickers, Monaco) and plays in real time with guts and gore. Very tactical and yet very intuitive, everything plays smoothly and all of the little things are done perfectly. It's got 4 modes, including a randomized survival mode (true roguelike), a campaign, a pvp mode, and one other... get it for 7 bucks while it's on sale or kick yourself later.			"

												Survivor Squad is a Strategy Action game where you control a Squad of up to four survivors and guide them through a highly randomized world looking for supplies to aid you on your journey. Scavenge for supplies in every corner of every building, craft your gear, pick your skills and loadout while keeping your Squad alive by covering every corner and moving as a group. It is a game that encourages quick thinking and fast paced play since you need to pay attention to all of your squad mates. If you leave someone behind, chances are they will be pounced on and die. Move as a Squad and cover every corner.			"

												I bought this game as part of an indie bundle, and this game was really what saved the bundle. I'd highly recommend this game, but not at the $8.99 pricetag; if you search, you can find it in bundles (or catch it during a steam sale). In short, get this game if you can grab in for <$4.Pros:High replay factorFun crafting & leveling systemDecent ControlsDecent Graphics & Sound (Minimalist/Retro)Inventive & Challenging game playCons:The controls are never really explained that well - You sink or swim quicklyCharacters sometimes make bizarre choices - Why use an axe when you have a gun?The characters don't have a way to heal - outside of being lucky with cloth dropsBuilding fortifications - I'm still not certain why I'm doing itDevs - I think if you added some type of walk through level and/or practice mode, it would help the game a LOT.

												I play tactical games like Arma, xcom, and fallout 2. I find this game allows me to utilize tactics I've studied, such as bounding leap-frog movements or how to properly clear a building. There's a lot of strategy involved in every step you take, as well as which sacrifices you will make (what items to bring home, what nodes to capture, etc.). Very fun game, very simple, very cheap. A few minor glitches but they are overwhelmingly outnumbered by the positive qualities, much like you will be if you make a wrong move. HARDCORE: if you lose a squad mate then he's dead. You have to level up your guys and pick a few simple perks from a static perk tree that help define the roles in your squad. You take over nodes to gain resources and you have to manage and defend them by keeping recruits there and keeping them fed. This game is stressful, and makes you worry about your guys and each step you take. Very fun, highly addictive. Worth the money, especially for tactical lovers.			"

												First things first, Survivor Squad is a Real-Time Strategy, a genre I have experience with. Trapped in a world swarmed with the undead, you, the player, must help your starting survivor build up a squad in order to scavenge for useful resources, such as blueprints, scrap, wood and weapons, speaking of which, the crafting system works well, and respects your abilities as a player by not being overly demanding. Now, onto the core gameplay. The controls, while simple to use, seem tiresome and outdated, but still provide a solid, strategic experience for the player to immerse themselves into. The AI, while mostly done effectively, can sometimes be troublesome, seeing as the occasional zed can glitch out and just lag back and forth, which brings me to the occasional framerate issues. Alright, I own a Windows 7, but most of my other games, especially the first person shooters, rarely have problems with framerate. Most of the time, in Survivor Squad, the framerate is not bad. However, upon firing a gun, which can alert most nearby enemies, the framerate starts to lag substantially.  However, another redeeming feature of the game is the stealth mechanics. only able to see zombies within your survivors' field of vision, even through windows? Adds a lot of depth of realism to the game, as you never know what kind of horror may be lurking around the next corner. Which brings me to the enemy variety. As well as your basic zombies, you have jumpers, spitters and others I have yet to familiarize myself with. Moreover, when not slaughtering the undead, you have the overworld, which randomly generates the location and name of each place adjacent to cleansed territory. However, this can sometimes lead to inconsistency; why, like in my current game, would Bangkok be right next to Harvard?  Furthermore, you can enter the Death Lab mode, where several floors are randomly generated for your survivors to navigate while the undead are out for your blood served in a cocktail. As I just implied, the mode is insanely difficult and it takes veteran skill to survive even the first floor, seeing as your instant annihilation is preying on you until your inevitable death.  In conclusion, Survivor Squad is a game with the potential to achieve milestones in the RTS genre, and a fresh adventure that keeps you on your toes. I rate this game 8/10.			"

												Survivor squad is a very small game (looks almost like a flash game on the internet), based around increasingly difficult levels where you keep going until you lose. I very much enjoy this style which is similar to FTL, although the gameplay is a bit different. The price of £1.98 is considerable worth what you are getting. I would definetly recommend it due to its modest pricing and incredible replayablility.			"

												I like this game. I don't understand where all the negative is. I assume its because this is left 4 dead 1 or 2 on an overhead control with you controlling each. Last thing, please stop posting the guantlets updates in the posts for this game. It makes no sense, just update survivor squad, ok?Thanks!			"

												Nice game, perfect to kill half an hour with zombie killings and strategy thinking on how to keep everyone alive. It has enough content for the price asked, as far as I have played and it's fun enough to keep you coming back to do a few more missions every day. It runs flawlessly in my Linux machine and haven't had any of those bugs people claim to suffer.And that's only for the single player game, haven't tried multiplayer, I will surely try that after I finish the main missions.

												Co-op.  This game needed co-op survivor mode.  Dev, if you're still working on this game, add Co-Op!And more than 1 car!And fortifications for your bases and more base-related things like research, build and repair!It's a simple, fun, zombie game where you control up to 4 squad members and clear out zones on your way to the fabled 'scientists working on a cure' much like has been shown in recent games and TV shows, (Walking Dead, Dying Light, etc.) It has some elements of x-com in that you manage resources and recruits to send out on missions, but there's almost no advantage to training multiple squads. The infrequent attacks on your bases only serve to kill them without damaging your supplies and food supplies vs inactive squad members makes you want to rescue people even less. The price was right, 91% off at the time making it 88 cents after tax. I've put more in quarters into arcade games with less play time.  The 9 dollar price tag would be worthwhile if it only had co-op.			"

												This game is AWESOME.  Takes a second to get the game mechanics down but it is great. I've only played the first mission but its fun as all! The design is simple but complex in that your tactics drive the game! And for the summer sale its a STEAL for only .35 CENTS if you don't get it on sale its a bit up to you if you wanna pay 8.99. Its fun point and blank.			"

												Fun at first, but gets repetitive after few hours. The main negative aspect of the game is the inability to set proper commands to your squad (e.g. move in specific formation). In a game that makes claim to have a tactical component this is a grave omissionOverall score  6/10 "

												I really like the game play, a combination node-crawl / tactical RTS.  I really like the concept as well, crawling your way through a zombie infested city and managing your left-for-dead style squad at every turn.But this game is broken and unwinable.I've tried to win twice.  On my first play, I got in a scenario where I could not take and hold a node because it would get immediately recaptured by the zombies in the time it took for my guys to return from base after capturing (a return which was mandatory).  On my second play, I wisely set up a defensive ring so that I wouldn't have to deal with this.  Then, I got stuck in an Endless Loop of defending nodes, because the time it takes to defend on node was enough for another to get attacked.Devs, I like your gameplay, but this is ridiculous.  There's no reason I should get game-breaking bugs on my first two playthroughs.  Do some playtesting next time.			"

												At full price, I do not recommend this game. I picked it up at a significant discount for something like $0.99 a while back, and I enjoyed the gameplay for a while, but (and I stress this) it is NOT worth more than I paid for it.The game is put together decently, but the unity-esque graphics are distressing (unless you only paid a dollar for the game) and the lack of immersion (I don't know how else to expres that I didn't care about whether the survivors survived or not) make it hard to like the game, despite the mechanics being pretty decent overall.In short, if it goes on sale for like a dollar, and you want a quick and decent squad-based survival game, go for it. You might like it. Otherwise, with all due respect to the developer, save your money.			"

												The good: Got it on sale. Got my money's worth of fun from the game. There's plenty of carnage, a crafting system, leveling options, loadout, and a big map with lots of different locations.The bad: It got repetitive after ripping through the first 5 or 6 points on the map. Leveling isn't that in depth. Nothing going on that stood out graphically. The story and all the events encountered were on the blah side. The short: It's worth getting if you don't have much else to do, it's on sale, and you aren't looking for something to play for more than a few hours. Otherwise, don't.I give it a thumbs down since it got boring right around an hour of play. I pushed through another half hour or so of gameplay to see if it got any better. It just got more difficult, which is fine. However, nothing else changed much. The game lost my interest.			"

												Its well worth 10euros! - quite a few items, resonably fair gameplay, tho a few spikes occur due to the sami randomnature of this game. Theres crafting, different weapons, and RPG-lite levveling system, semi randomized maps and campaigns, 4 game modes, hundreds of corpses onscreen, ah yes the sentry gun, and funky little details all over like lightning flashes, and footsteps. The campaign allows you to ""take over"" maps which can then be harvested for resources, and theres even missions to defend them. It works Nodule style, the zombie busting team working their way quick-travel by car, to each set of building complexes, then they try to clear them of zombies, zombie spawns, aswell as trying to free more survivors. Things can get super hectic at times, due to booby traps and other unforseen events, and special zombies appear- dissapointingly ripped straight from Left4Dead. Imagination. Hire me or something. Thats a minor gripe tho. Another is  boobytraps that can be avoided mostly, but theres a roguelike factor in where the wireclippers are located, when the doors are auto locked. Could be next to the bomb. Could be in like 16 other drawers, cabinet etc. in the house, which can be a little steep if only a lone survivor made it in before the doors get locked. Its fairly minor again, i think ill break most hard maps with a bit of patience, or the computer will re-generate the map with randomized traps/alarms on next reload.I wouldnt say the game looks fantastic graphically, but theres a certain charm to everything.UI is fairly good allround, nothing too bothersome, except the level up indicator is hard to see, but thats fairly minor. All in all, 3 hours just went after i first booted it up, and im picky as hell! a good atmosphere gets going, and the pannicy bits, even if they result in death, are quite entertaining. -  Looking forward tot he semi sequel Gauntlets! 8.5/10  instabuy on sale!

												Got it for 80 cents.Saw it before it went on sale, thought ""Eh, this could be a good time waster, been a while since I've played a game like this.""""$8.99""LOLNOThen I see it's on sale for 80 cents.It's pretty good, but it's not worth $9 bucks. I might chalk up $3 for it, but higher than that and I'd have to have very little time on my hands or the steam game market is flooded with Pewdiepie bait. Although it is fun. I hate how it forces you to go into harder areas before you're ready, though.

Just a suggestion.-The group is pretty much one survivor if that survivor had 4 bodies and 8 hands until all the zombies are dealt with.-They will die when a spitter appears because they're too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to get out of the acid.However, it is fun. The randomly generated map kinda pisses me off when I don't have nodes to fights and I'm forced with fighting a danger level higher than I can do. But it's... fun.

												Co-op.  This game needed co-op survivor mode.  Dev, if you're still working on this game, add Co-Op!And more than 1 car!And fortifications for your bases and more base-related things like research, build and repair!It's a simple, fun, zombie game where you control up to 4 squad members and clear out zones on your way to the fabled 'scientists working on a cure' much like has been shown in recent games and TV shows, (Walking Dead, Dying Light, etc.) It has some elements of x-com in that you manage resources and recruits to send out on missions, but there's almost no advantage to training multiple squads. The infrequent attacks on your bases only serve to kill them without damaging your supplies and food supplies vs inactive squad members makes you want to rescue people even less. The price was right, 91% off at the time making it 88 cents after tax. I've put more in quarters into arcade games with less play time.  The 9 dollar price tag would be worthwhile if it only had co-op.			"

												ITs a very enjoyable yet simple game. The game includes crafting, squad management, and zombie killing. The main question is pretty simple, just follow the red arrows to find the labs and kill the source. Controlling large cities is important as they generate resources. When rescuing cities, visit the different houses and kill all zombies without activating alarms or spotlights that attract more zombies. Turrets are awesome. Important details to be aware is that you have unlimited ammo, that all fights happen at night, and that cities are randomly generated. If you lose a large city and you reclaim it, the resources it provides change. Secure cities by keeping 3 to 4 guys in it. The game could use better survivor backgrounds and faces. The faces all look child-like. While there are characters of various races they are all guys. It seems that while some survive the zombie apocalypse, there are no women. The survival mode and death lab mode add additional depth to the game. Cheap and fun game. Worth the price, especially when its on sale.			"

												AN ABOVE-AVERAGE RTS GAME for the more-than-noobish player. I wouldn't put this all the way up there with, for example, the Total War series but I certainly won't put it at the bottom. Granted this game came out almost exactly a year ago in 2013.*CONTROLS: Average- Simple point-and-click commands- Buggy (Your men will walk through hordes of zombies to get to where you clicked, and will most likely die)*GRAPHICS: Above-Average- Blood-spattering gore everywhere- It's the quality you would expect for $9- Fog-of-War system making gameplay more protective- Player-controlled units almost look similar if not for different color layouts*GAMEPLAY: Avereage- A good 20-50 hours of campaign gameplay, possibly an added 10 hours if you indulge in the added gamemodes- 4-man squads (at the max) with starting backpacks with only 6 spaces for loot, thus making it difficult to ration your supplies- Left for Dead characters: spitter, hunter, and smoker are reintroduced- A ""zombie heart"" which spawns endless waves of zeds- Booby-trapped buildings set to explode or attract more zeds- Low customization/weapons/armor/gadgets/character models- Unlimited ammo but guns are expensive to craft and impossible to find*DIFFICULTY:- If you play it on ""Hard"" which is the hardest difficulty, then you get what you expect. Because, come on, who doesn't like a challenge? The game difficulty SKYROCKETS near the 8th or 10th stage (thanks to the ""zed hearts"")*MY RECOMMENDATION:Buy it to kill time and to kill zombies but don't expect a full-blown action game that you'll enjoy for years to come because I'd imagine the game would get repetitive eventuallyAnd if you're addicted to rts games like myself then I would give it a try. IT'S $9!!! "

												Not much variety but a fun play, and not to long that the limited variety would negatively affect the enjoyment. No need to say much on this one, the videos and pictures say what you need to know.			"

												I like this game. I don't understand where all the negative is. I assume its because this is left 4 dead 1 or 2 on an overhead control with you controlling each. Last thing, please stop posting the guantlets updates in the posts for this game. It makes no sense, just update survivor squad, ok?Thanks!			"

												Great game, wouldn't recomend buying for full price though but highly reccomend getting it when on sale.In the area of gameplay it runs smoothly and is great for those that like this style, there are however some gamebreaking bugs that I encountered but never dealt with a second time. In all great game but too high a price to get popular :(			"

												Fun at first, but gets repetitive after few hours. The main negative aspect of the game is the inability to set proper commands to your squad (e.g. move in specific formation). In a game that makes claim to have a tactical component this is a grave omissionOverall score  6/10 "

												Fairly simple elements of gameplay, but entertaining.  Unfortunately I have found it somewhat buggy--in about two or three hours of play, I've had to restart the campaign three times because it bugs out in a way that dead-ends the game.  Even quitting and restarting the mission can't save you as the same issue will resurface at more or less the same point each time.Would recommend based on gameplay, but lacks the polish one might expect of a full release.Enjoy at your own risk!  Hehe.			"

												The idea of a 4-man squad tactical game is great and the gameplay is good, but sometimes you get shafted and there's nothing you can do about it.Pros: Good tactical play, resource management, and it gives the feeling that every move you make counts.Cons: You can't choose whether or not to accept new survivors (which strain your food resources), once you stand next to them they join you. Sometimes, you will get a combination of random events that will kill your team and you cannot load a save file to recover them. That may leave you with a single survivor, in which case you pretty much lose the game.			"

												This is an indy top down procgen RTS/shootemup zombie survival game.   While it may have been possible to swing such a game with an ace developer team, Survivor Squad does not deliver. The graphics are roughly grade 7 school student quality - they are laughable drawings.I think if they hire an artist and spend a bit more time and effort, as well as avoiding the ""Procgen = content"" fallacy, they may have some hope as game developers.   But Suicide Squad is just not very good.			"
