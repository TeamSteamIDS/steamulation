												This is a decent time & resource management strategy game. Each of the 30 levels contains 2 or 3 timed sub-levels. The story was typical, but well-written. The game is not very difficult, so don't expect brain-bending challenges. There isn't much replayability unless you're going for all gold stars. It took me approximately 5 hours to complete the game, but that included pauses. If you really enjoy casual games like I do, it's worth the full price. Otherwise you might want to wait for a sale.

												This is best time management game I've ever played. Usually such games are just boring, but in Ballad of Solar, if you play on Hard and trying to get all gold stars, you need to think and react really fast and there is just no time to be bored. Well designed, lack of bugs, really good piece of code.But also one thing is missing here: achievements.VERDICT:If you a fan of time management games, this is for sure one of the best! You can buy and play it, it won't disappoint you.If you a hard core gamer, but you're in the mood to play something easy, just set Hard difficulty and have fun for couple of hours.Like this review?

												Ballad of Solar is a very simple game with very simple mechanics, but that doesn't mean it's not fun to play. Ballad of Solar is an epic of a pampered prince who is trying to save his girl from the evil's of a wizard. The gameplay consists of 2 or 3 maps per level. Each map is a static board that has roads leading to objectives. Each objective is blocked by trees and rocks and holes. You need to manage resources to preform the task of clearing each object. More simply put, you click stuff on the map to clear it, then you move on to the next map. It's nearly imposible to lose a level, the storyline is all but annoying, and the voice acting is horrendous. However, the game has just enough fun to keep you ocupied. I am an achievement hound; I don't normally play games unless there's some achievements to unlock. I played this game to the end despite that fact. I picked this title up for $2 and at that price it's well worth it. I definately recommend this to anyone who is in the mood for a casual playthrough that requires little to no effort.			"

Game Visual/AudioThere isn't much can be said about the game's visuals asides from that they're well done. Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. The visual and audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu.GameplayThere are two different game difficulty modes to choose from: Adventure and Heroic. Adventure mode is untimed and Heroic mode is timed.There are total of thirty levels in total but in each of these levels has sub-levels within them. Some of them has at least two to three sub-levels.The objective of this game is to complete given set of tasks before the time on the timer runs out. However, some tasks do require resources (food and/or woods) before they can be completed. Also, there're certain tasks that requires the help from certain characters in the game. All levels in the game can be replayed for better score.MiscellaneousThere are total of five different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.Final thoughts, I don't think that this game much of replay value to it. If you're into time management games then you might find this game somewhat enjoyable to certain extent. I don't recommend getting this game at full price. "

Brief SynopsisBallad of Solar is an extremely casual ""click everything until the level is finished"" game. It's labelled as a strategy game, but really there is little in the way of strategy here. In a nut shell, you travel from one level to the next. Each level has different goals to reach; once you've reached those goals you move on to the next level. Long Review Story: An evil sorceror has overthrown the kingdom and taken the princess captive. It's up to Solar (the princess's fiance) to restore the kingdom to its former glory and save the princess.  Graphics: Each character is drawn really well in this game, with loads of personality attached to them.  Music/Sounds: The music and sound effects are pretty good, though the voice acting is hilariously terrible. I'd almost recommend the game just because of the horrible voice acting (it's a great source of laughs), but I won't.  Length: I've played this game for just over two hours and have reached level 19 in that length of time. It should be apparent that this is an extremely easy game, based on this information. However, I do not know how many levels there are in the game as I can not finish it due to a bug which keeps me from moving on to level 20.  Replayability: Each level is scored by giving you stars. If you're a perfectionist (and aren't hit by the bug I've run into), then the game is replayable only to get full stars for each level. Other than that, it really isn't worth replaying.If it wasn't for the bug I managed to find, I would recommend this game to those of you who enjoy casual games. Because of this bug however, I'm going to have to give this game a thumbs down. If you want to take your chances, then wait until the game is at an extremely cheap price.  "

												While not at all what I had been expecting, Ballad of a Solar was an enjoyable game none the less.  There is just enough strategy involved to make even the easy difficulty require some planning to succeed instead of just clicking as often as you can.  The levels are also short enough to serve a nice distraction if you are just after something quick to casually goof around with.  The graphics are mostly still images, but well designed.  The plot is amusing and hits almost every cliche possible for the genre.  While I was hoping for a more sandbox style town builder, I enjoyed the game enough to not regret the purchase.			"

												In the casual time management space, it is hard to be noticed. Games and series seemingly pop into stores at a moment notice, fully realised and ready to be enjoyed by a public who cannot get enough. Whole websites are devoted to these click based games, where the management of resources against a timer will provide a form of accomplishment which is only slightly belittling. For as much as they bring new gamers to the fold, time management games, at their very essence, are a little insulting as they demand so very little from the player. Rising above this is a balance between providing enough feedback and interaction for the player but to not overwhelm the casual audience that this genre naturally attracts. In this case, I believe Ballad of Solar has done a remarkable job.It helps that the game is very pleasing to the eye. I was surprised at the quality of the art and the animation, which was a little more ambitious than a game at this price point and genre have any right to be. From the set up and dismantlement of the tent for each level, to the conversations the characters have, even the movement of the workers you control to do your Prince’s bidding, graphically the game is really attractive. It has a charming cliché atmosphere that brings to mind all the great fairytales of yore but spins it with some fun character designs and interesting companions.In addition, the voice acting was really well done, with some great lines and actors who have really brought these characters to life. From the knight in shining armour to the hearty blacksmith and the giant oaf, these characters are fun caricatures of fairytale tropes exaggerated with a natural belief that you can’t help but go along with the ride. The dulcet tones of the Prince match sharp wit with the wizened Wizard and the oafish giant, who bring a lot of humour and character to their roles.Naturally, it is a cliché’ story of a Kingdom falling to ruin and a Prince who is on a quest to vanquish evil and save the damsel in distress, but this works to the games favour with a certain silliness that is endearing. The Big Bad has ousted you from your former Kingdom and you fall in with a cadre of companions who will help you along your way, each of whom it must be said, is more engaging than the last.The 30 levels will only provide even the most patient of gamers a few hours to complete, which is just enough time to get to know these characters and this story before it becomes to pretentious. Each level is split into several sub levels, and surprisingly, these sub-levels scroll to a new screen, a new and welcome effect. Snippets of conversation and the various posturing of the Big Bad and the Prince add a little flavour and make investing your time rewarding.The music is pleasing if ultimately forgettable. The main theme is repetitive and a little disarming and would be better if it punched through the quality of the effects and voice acting. As it is, it’s probably the weakest element of Ballad of Solar.There isn’t much in the way of challenge, and replayability is non-existent. But with that said, there’s hardly anything to fault with Ballad of Solar. It’s a fun time management game with above average visuals and sound that caters well to the crowd that will appreciate its me-too nuance. Well worth taking the journey.7.5/10.			"

Short version: 86%The simple but cute fantasy fairy tale storyline really helps to keep this time management game interesting, despite its strict time limits and somewhat repetitive levels.Long version:Ballad of Solar is a time management game (mostly in the veins of the 12 Labours of Hercules series) made by Buka Entertainment, a real seasoned veteran in the casual game industry.The game follows our titular hero, Solar, who valiantly works his way through cursed mines, forests, and towns in trouble, gallantly letting his servants do the actual work for him by gathering resources and using them to fix buildings and clear the large amount of obstacles in their path. And when they face something even they cannot handle, then one of Solar’s fairy tale friends (a peaceful ogre, sassy elf girl, wise wizard, grumpy dwarf smith) lends them a hand.The trick is to do these tasks in a fast and efficient manner. As expected from the genre, the stages are on a timer, but there is a twist: each is divided into sub-stages with their own separate maps, so players always have to plan ahead.All this work is for a noble cause, naturally, in our case saving the princess and the kingdom from the dark wizard who holds both in his clutches. Clichéd as hell, but the writing is really fun and tries to be as adventurous as a time management game can be, adding a lot to that final score you can see on top.			"

												Basically, clicking simulator. No tought put into it, nothing. Your only role into this game is to click on things in order for them to dissapear from the map. You click them, they dissapear, you get to the next level. And i'm not oversimplifying, that's the game. It's a dumbed down version of Farmville.Voice acting is silly. I don't know what the ""story"" is about, as i didn't had any pleasure into following it. Probably something with kings and mages. It's definetly a game made for phones/tablets and ported on PC. Can be ok for phone/tablet, for young kids.			"

												A well presented time and resource management game with surprisingly good voice acting.The split level system was unique for the genre with levels split between two or three parts, and if going for gold stars, each had to be passed, failure on the third part meant having to go back to the first part again, which was a tad annoying tbh.Overall, if you've played the 12 Labours of Hercules series, or the Rescue Team series, you'll probably like this.

												A short casual experience.  The voice acting is terrible, but if you can overlook that you will have a good time.  I finished the game in about 5 hours and theres really not any replay value unless you want to go back and get all the stars for finishing the levels in a certain time.  Overall I recommend it, just dont expect any grand strategy game.  Its something you can pick up very quickly and is a very casual game.  Probably great for children too.  Grab it on sale and you wont be dissapointed.			"

												TL;DR: Simple, sweet way to while away a few hours without stress. Easy on the eyes and ears. Unquestionably worth sale price.Full review: Cute. Simple. Amusing. Very high quality production values: zero bugs, high quality art (if a bit cliched, the iron jawed male hero and impossibly thin female characters are a bit much) varying from merely competent to lush and lovely. The music is nothing spectacular, but fits the scenery and mood properly and isn't intrusive or boring. I happily let it play on through the whole game without becoming annoyed.I played the game through in a single evening on the lower difficulty ""Adventure Mode"" setting (several of the eight hours Steam recorded were where I walked away from the game for dinner and chatter with roommates), and found it exactly what I was looking for in terms of difficultly and engagement for a stress free evening. Every two or three levels, I screwed up the initial run through enough to restart, either part way through, or after finishing and being awarded a ""Silver"" star. Obtaining the desired ""Gold"" star required paying enough attention to what I was doing that I remained throughly immersed. This is definitely a ""casual"" game (at least in ""Adventure"" mode), suitable for youngun's or folks looking for to while away a few relaxed hours. The story, which is, yes, cheesy as heck, unfolds neatly as you go along, each level taking no more than a few minutes and leading neatly into the  next and the one after that.If you're ""hardcore"" or in the mood for a ""serious"" challenge leading to the occassional frustrated outburst, this isn't the game for you. I beat every level at the ""Gold"" star rank on my first or second try (although there were a couple of close calls with the latter). While there's probably zero replayablity--I, personally, have no impulse to go through it again on ""Heroic Mode"" (the higher level of difficulty)--that's not a big deal at the sale price of under $2 that I paid for it.

												Some other reviews tell that this game is designed for kids, true. They also say BUT finishing every level perfectly takes some time, not true. The game is pretty nice and I personally decided to put the harder difficult on after finishing the first level. There were exactly 2 levels which I wasn't able to finish in time to get perfect result on first try.The game also repeats itself pretty hard and bringing some new character into the game now and then won't really do much difference. It's more or less hovering mouse over your screen and clicking stuff now and then without much planning.I would still recommend this game for right price because it's nicely implemented even though it's short and repeats itself. Graphics are nice and game runs smoothly without any problems. The current 7€ is maybe little too much for the game that you finish in couple hours and which have little or none replay value. But still, if you are less than casual player this game can be lot of fun.			"

												This was very cute. The gameplay reminds me of the kingdom for my princess series. The strategy aspect of trying to finish all your tasks before the time runs out is fun but there are no consequences for not making your time limits. It jjust gives you a silver star instead of a gold star. It's a very casual game. I would completely recommend it.			"

There is a time limit and the only way for losing in this game is not finishing everything before the time runs out.I would give this game about a 5 out of 10.

												The game is so simplistic that calling it casual can even be considered generous.   I debated giving it a thumbs down but even though it's simplistic to the extreme it's not overly boring nor tedious.  Just click and move along.   Some of the screens are very busy and that is what will lead you to miss the pattern and thus you won't always earn all the gold stars.  But once you finish the scene it'll be so obvious that there's little incentive to go back and  redo the scene.   Don't be fooled by the playing time as I left it up and running overnight so I could get the cards right away.  It's about 5-7 hours of game play with zero replay factor.    For a couple of bucks and the cards, for those that want a brain dead extremely casual game you'll like it.  For any one else look elsewhere.			"

Sadly there was almost a romance with another character other than the princess but that was a red herring that quickly went no where :( .

												There are a few reasons I particularly like this game:1.  It is NOT click everything in sight - you do need some planning to get the gold stars.2. It does NOT require super speed reactions/clicks - there is a reasonable rhythm to the play, that is very pleasent. 3. The game play doesn't seem to get harder, simply variations on different idea themes.  It is very nice to just play the game and not be continually challenged. It is a CASUAL game (not really for hard-core) and suitable for anyone just wanting to relax and have fun.  That means that it should work well for children as well as older folks - not just teenagers.			"

												That was really fun. I love these kind of games, so it was nice to have one that tries a few things differently. Also liked the fully voiced story. Everything was very polished and satisfying to click on. I wouldnt pay full price for it, but if you like these types of games, get it!			"

												If you are looking to get instant gratification with a mindless game, this would be it. Multiple workers avalible for the faster clickers, but you are unable to set multiple tasks. Gets a bit repitative, but the levels are different enough to keep you engaged. Storyline is moot.			"

												This is a short casual game with some light strategy and resource management. Each level's score can be improved by taking less time to finish the tasks. The design is gorgeous and atractive and the story is cute but very common. I took around 5 hours to finish the game. It's worth.			"

												The usuals time/resources management games from Alawar, nothing new.But it's an enjoyable game and if you play with time limits and going for 100% gold stars it even gets a lot tactical and much more difficult, a real challenge. Having no task queue, and the pause window hiding most of the screen, even if slightly annoying add a lot to the challenge and the fun, too.			"

												For a game like this its a well made solid story, great game overall. I finished the game 4,5 hours after i started it. it is quick and fun, well rounded on difficulty management. Controls and mechanics are super simple to get a hold on. Never too old to play a game like this :P If you have any questions how I gave any rating feel free to comment. Please keep in mind that this is my personal preferences:Story: 7 (the story dose not ahve any depth but it is simple, which was what this game needed)Gameplay: 8 (its point and click, easy to learn easy to win)Voice Acting/Music: 5 (it is acctually pretty descent but it gets VERY reppetitive after a while)Graphics: 5 (nothing special but not bad either)Depth: n/aFlexibility: n/aReward System: n/aTotal: 6.25/10			"

												Wow, this was a really short game.  It only took me 4 hours to finish it.  Not many card drops and no achievements.  Glad I did not pay full price for it.  Besides that, it was a challenge if if you like games that time you to compete tasks.  Many of the levels I didn't make it and ran out of time.  So, if you like casual games that time you this would be a good choice.			"
