												Don't let the graphics fool you, beneath its dull exterior lies a creamy center full of Strategic goodness.Strategies center around the nation you choose and how you design your Pretender God.  Battles are decided by how you form up your troops and the orders you issue to them before each fight.If you like strategy games and a fantasy setting, you really should not pass this one up.			"

												Dominions 3 stands as one of my favorite strategy games of all time. It's not really that similar to anything else; the combat is all automatic, and your main job (as a god) is to manage your empire, build armies, build forts, research and cast spells, and plan out where your armies will go. The graphics are sufficient for the job they do, and there's a plethora of addtional mods and maps and what not available for it. All told, i quite recommend it to any fans of strategy who are looking for something a little different.			"

												I highly recommend this game to any strategy enthusiasts or fans of mythology out there. I'll go ahead and get the (tiny) amount of bad out of the way - the game has an unusual user interface, and selection of units can be especially tedious sometimes. With that detail out of the way, I only have good to say about Dominions 3. The writing in the game is top-notch, and very detailed. You often have to play multiple races to get a fuller picture of the history, but it's rich and satisfying once you put it together. The Tuatha and the Fomorian Giants are a good example. The game plays in a standard fashion with territories and movement, much like other turn-based games. However, to locate the useful goodies in a territory, you'll have to cultivate a few powerful mages, to find hidden sites that can provide mana gems, unique units for recruitment, or unique effects once unearthed. You'll need them (and magi once again) for the forging of magical items to equip your agents, priests, mages, generals, and your Pretender God. But the true meat of the game is in spreading your dominion (aka faith) across the map. It is the source of your power, and since it can flow into enemy territoy, it can also hamper their efforts to withstand your (inevitable) attack. Be sure to build lots of temples in your own honor! Put those puny mortal mages to work researching powerful magic that can affect the whole world. Turn day to perpetual night, bring on and endless winter, kill someone anywhere in the world, dispach the flying monkeys! Last Pretender God standing wins the prize - true Godhood. Sounds simple, right? Think again. It's a deep and complex game, and can be quite the challenge at times. So join in the fun, weave your own epic tale! Smash vampires with giants, ♥♥♥♥♥ queens (yes, its a real pretender) with a midget masher, run from Cthulu! It's all in there, and waiting for you!			"

												If you can get past the learning curve, slightly awkward controls and the graphics then you are in for a real treat, this game has so much depth and variety, literally every game you play is different because of the sheer amount of units, unique events and spells available. Very fun and reminds me of Civlization as this game will also give you 'one more turn syndrome'.			"

												I have purchased this game a while ago but only recently I had a chance to play it.While HoMM, AoW, and Disciples series may have their own merits, this is the game that I was looking for. Namely, a Fantasy strategic WAR game. In this game, logistics and grand planning matter.This is a very rare game that handles grand warfare in a fantasy world very well.* Learning the game might take some time. But tutorial is good. And play a small game with only one AI. Then move to medium map with 3 AI. After several games, you know what to do.			"

												Note: This review only reflects single player. Some of the concerns should be equally valid in multiplayer tho. Pro:- lots of nations and spells to play withContra: - no upgrade path except for magic, you start and end the game with the exact same troops - larger empires are micromanagement nightmares (commander limits, picking up scattered units, managing troop supplies for fronline armies etc on a 45 province map is already horrible)- tedious mopping up of beaten opponents (hopefully you didnt pick low dominion while trying to assault a water fortress with Shamblers ...)- hands off battles - almost non existent province developmentAnd just as a side note there isnt really a steep learning curve, its just that you have to memorize spells and units or you will be looking up those all the time. Games like Chess and Go can offer a deep strategic experience without overboarding rule complexity. Dominions while initially fun becomes tedious and boring very quickly.			"

												Dominions 3 is a really deep strategic game that will challenge you to create a pretender God, lead a nation, expand, and avoid being destroyed by the other pretender Gods. There are many stats on units you create and many game concepts to learn if you have never played a Dominions game before. The graphics are lacking when compared to newer games but graphics mean little when this game has the best strategy mechanics I have seen in a while. Overall if you are willing to excuse the graphics and learn the mechanics, you will be in for an amazing strategy gem.			"

												A game of master strategy... Played for about 10 hours straight and I barely scatched the surface of this game. On first glance, This game have sloopy graphics and looped music. They can be quickly overlooked once you get past the learning curve of the very basis of the game.Everything you heard about or seen in other fantasy based strategy games are featured in this game. Magic, Ranged combat, autocast spells by unit, wound, exp leveling, leadership(command army size), summoning creatures, under sea combat, worship war and many more features are involved hidden behind this mask of basic interface for you to discover.Many races of people to choose from with unique feature for each race. This well hidden strategy gem and I am sure I will discover a lot more interesting things in the days to come. Each games are not short at all once you setup on a balanced map with some AI or even human players.9/10 for a wonderful strategy game and it only lost score on graphics, interface and music.			"

												In my humble opinion, this is one of the best games ever made in this genra and one of my all time favorite games.I urge all of you who enjoy games of this style to look beyond the modest graphics and give this game a good look. One of the first things you'll notice about Dominions and one of the things that really makes it shine is how rich the game world is. It really gives you the feeling that a prehistoric world filled with magic, beasts and warriors has its future decided on the battlefield by the individual warring nations (60 of them!) each with their own very vibrant back-story that gives them a very unique feel. Each race is decidedly entirely different - A nation of frost giants, empowered by the coldest environments, a nation of demons who rise from the dead after being slain in combat etc etc.. Choose one and expand your armies AND ALSO your influence (dominion) across the land to bend the lands and their people in it to your nation's style.			"

												This is a very enjoyable fantasy strategy-sim. It's plays very similar to a Total War series game, but with a more hands off approach to the battles (you don't directly control units, but you can give them pre battle formations and priorities, like telling your cavalry to wait a turn before going to attack the enemies archer units).There is kind of a big lack of explaination for a lot of things in the game itself, so you'll have to refer to the manual or the wiki, but I figured out 95% of it on my own. One example is the game lets you give magic gems (that are a resource for casting global spells and making magic items) to your commanders, but it doesn't explain anywhere ingame the benefits of doing that. Turns out it improves their magic casting abilities of the associated gem/magic type by 1 level for having the gem equiped. But some characters also generate magic gems for you and they get put in their inventory until you retrieve them.It took me about 4-5 games to explore how the various mechanics work, like how faith spreads, how you research magic, how building good armies and giving them the right orders to increase their effectivness. Experiment and read the ingame hints about the things that are described and it's easy enough to catch on.			"

												If you aren't sure - find the demo, which blocks technology progress at something like level 5.  This game has a very long (but not too steep) learning curve.  I'm just now beginning to read the manual that goes along with it.So what do you want from a game?  If you want a way to spend your time which is compelling: maybe sitting in front of the computer looking at the game itself and going through some grand strategy plan, or it might be reading the book that will gently unfold ""every byte in the game"" for you.  If this sounds like fun (and it is!) then trust me, you won't regret buying this game.  Every ""square"" on the board begins at the start of the game as neutral (except for starting cities).  As armies conquer squares, they contribute to your economy, but they are also then easily conquered unless you station vast defending armies (which you're rather use for conquering new squares).  So it eventually becomes a land-grab game that I still haven't quite gotten my head around.  It's quite difficult.  The depth in the game is an insane amount of content.  Every time I play I'll discover some new item I didn't know could be forged.  I'm sure there are people who know all this stuff, but it's quite something discovering new items or spells and the possibility of new strategies as a result.  There are also placement and timing strategies to look at.  And afflictions.  I LOVE that heroes in the game can have afflictions!  Religion plays a big role adding flavor to the game and I still haven't quite grasped the historical references other than resemblences to myth.  It's almost alien almost familiar - I like how they did it.  Dominions 3 also seems to be designed to play multiplayer by e-mail, so all moves by all players are concurrent (rather than taking turns) - this is one of the few turn-based games I'm aware of which uses concurrent moves - which is why battles are auto-resolved (they have to be).  Even though battles are auto-resolved, as already mentioned, there are troop placement and timing strategies which will make a huge difference in battle outcomes (guaranteeing that troops arive at the front line all at the same time becomes a consideration).[EDIT]Cons:The game does have a downside, which is the lack of automating some very repetitive tasks, such as what actions you always want a specific unit to use.  My impression is that the game designers are really good at designing gameplay and background, but horrible at designing ""workflow"", which are repetitive tasks that eventually wear down the player.  In it's defense, the game seems to be designed for multiplayer via e-mail - where you might make a few moves a day and games could go on for a very long time - rather than single player versus AI where you're making several moves every few minutes.

												OH. MY. GOD.just a few hours into the game (maybe 2?), and... I'm totally hooked. And, that's a lot knowing I'm not the greatest fan of strategic games.... sure, graphics are... oudtated to say the least. but, who cares? this is not about nice graphics, but about thinking. a lot.(EDITED)ok. more than a few hours later, and even more on dom4, I can only say a few things:- this is one of the largest games in terms of quality content I have seen in my whole life. - it is also one of my favorite games. EVER.- dom4 is even better. get it instead or you'll want it as soon as it's on sale. - be warned: the learning curve is not actually steep but VERY long. about 150 hr. later (between this and dom4), and I still have sooo much to learn. - the AI may not be a challenge for pros, but I still have to think a lot to win even on normal. Haven't tried yet on hard (and won't try in a loong time... I'm not yet ready)- the manual should be your bedside book from now on (note: and dom4's manual is even better. and longer. yay for EVERY unit stats on it. my life is so much happier now. ) You should consider printing it. or buying it printed. but keep in mind: you have no search function on a printed book. - tell everyone you love that you'll disappear for a long while before purchasing this. seriously, it's THAT good. - years will come, and you will keep playing this every now and then. It's not a campaign that you go through once or twice and that's all. I totally see myself playing this for years. (especially dom4. since... oh, well, the few changes are for the better. )- why on earth are you still reading this instead of already playing it??? PS: seriously. buy dom4 as soon as it's on sale. and on the meantime, buy dom3 now that it's on sale. You won't regret it.			"

The only real problem with this game is getting through a steep learning curve - manual for this game is 300 pages, it's highly recommended to read it (and you'd certainly refer to it time to time) and even manual doesn't cover all the things there are in the game.

												Flying to the rescue along with 7 bodyguards on his magic carpet, my immortalized lich god attempted to break a siege of boulder-chucking giants today. He failed, but being immortal his bones were reassimilated back at the capital without a scratch. The 50 soldiers left in the castle were ground to a pulp, however.I have spent nearly 95 hours in this game. The gui and simple aesthetics are off-puting at first. But I've played Dwarf Fortress. Nothing looks bad or is too difficult to learn after Dwarf Fortress. For those who haven't, I think you'll quickly forget how simple it looks after your imagination helps to fill in the gaps of its graphical limitations.If you are willing to invest a few hours learning how to play, and are able to overlook the graphics and the poor sounds quality (I suggest this mod: http://forum.shrapnelgames.com/showthread.php?t=37761 to replace some of the most ear-piercing sounds of the game) you will likely have hundreds of hours of entertainment. Even after all this time, I am still too much of a scrub to survive some of the most difficult races. I have also never won a game on a  large map. I like the challenge and depth, it is what makes Dominions 3 and 4 special.			"

It does certainly have poor graphics, however it is not simple, as you get intot he game things cam become very complex (especially on larger maps), but the game is straightfoward. Sometimes confusing, but that is because there are a wide range of spells and abilities that can do very complex and damaging things.

												Cons:- The worst flaw of this game is that most of the cryptic game mechanics cannot be accessed in game and you have to rely on google search to find out. For example, while researching the ""construction"" school of magic, you are given no clue on what you can craft from it. Even after researching the spell, you have no idea what you can craft because many of the craftable items are not visible because the mage you select do not have the required paths in magic.   When summoning a monster, you have no idea what stat and abilities that monster will have and will need to trial and error to find out. To make an informed decision in a strategy game like this you really need detail info that the game does not provide. Is a summoning a giant turtle better or a sea serpent? Who knows? Just toss a coin to decide! - Really dated graphics- No control over the actual battle itself. You really need good understanding of the games' mechanics (which are cryptic and inaccessible) to script your troops to do combos and perform desirably.Pros- Huge variety of customizations.    You can design your avatar, a pretender god in multiple ways that will drastically affect your game. Your god might be good at combat, single handedly defeating whole armies, support your faction by providing various faction wide bonus or give your troops powerful buffs in battle. The possibilities are endless.   Not only can you customize your avatar, you can customize your heroes by giving them various crafted artifacts while a variety of effects. The kind of artifacts that you can create are limited by your god's and your mages' power in the different schools of magic, so careful planning is needed.- The game mechanics is excellent once you grasps the basics. The the variety of tactics and combos that can be pulled off are almost limitless.- Many factions to choose from that play very differently from one another. The lore of the game is refreshingly different from standard fantasies.			"

												I am the type of gamer who loves complexity and choice over graphics.  With that in mind, this is one of the best civilization type games I have ever played. Its similar to the old 'Master of Magic' but WAY beefed up.  Random world generation, different elemental magics, different races, hundreds... thousands?  of different units. Each with their own stats page, armors, weapons, etc.  Cast global enchantments, combat spells, or ritual spells. immensly complex magic item forging system, massive spell books, great hero and levelling systems. Endless opportunities with the right Pretender God, using the right spells. Like I said, the graphics are... basic, but it's the content I am focused on. If you like civilization, Master of Magic, and Dwarf Fortress, sign up.			"

												BLUF:  This game's pretty awesome, if you can get past the ancient graphics and focus on the creative/imaginative aspects.I loved the game.  Yes, it is complex, but I think the complexities are actually exagerated.  It's basically raise armies, research spells, invade provinces, collect gold, etc.  But somehow I find it 20x more engrossing than any other ""4x"" game (which I don't think it quite is).  There are little quirks, like that it is turn-based, but then all the movement happens at once for everyone, seasons affect gold income, but they also affect how many mushrooms grow in the forest for your witches to collect, and it's all these quirks and the plethora of races to play that make the game world feel alive.  I love how you are slowly introduced to the lore; it never feels like a chore to read it to get into the game, you just pick up some of it as your priests randomly summon some ultra-powerful seraphim that then randomly gets itself killed by wandering around the map.Sure, there's certain techniques that are pretty powerful, and certain races in certain ages are far stronger than others, but it's a game you can learn, and like life not everything has to be balanced.  It's fun to learn, fun to play, and fun to experiment with.  Enjoy, especially if it's on sale (though I get all my games on sale :)).  Also, check out Conquest of Elysium.  Same developers, also very interesting game, and generally much cheaper.			"

												This game is a bit too tedious for my tastes. Too much luck involved in the game as a whole for it too be worth having any true strategy shine through. Some classes are grossly overpowered and having my survival or success hinge on class choice is fairly biased. Province defenses don't make any sense in the sense that I shouldn't have an army of 50 units be wiped out by a single weak unit ever. Forts, labs, and temples are interesting concepts, but the concepts aren't introduced well enough from the outset to maximize usage of the mechanics. If I have to read a 20+ page manual to play a game its not worth the effort, especially when a tutorial is lacking. (5/10) I'm glad I got this on sale, because it wasn't worth the full price. Try Conquest of Elysium 3 if you are looking for something more manageable and less tedious.			"

												I actually had no fun in this game what-so-ever. I thought it was an RTS, but its not, its a dated turn-based let the pc do everything strategy game. You ""view"" the battles, so you can't actually real time control the fights. You can build the troops, manage states, and conquer the map, but without any real fighting it feels more like a fancy chessgame that you could really invest alot of time, unfortunately I don't love grinding and if you are one of those 90's Risk-esk gaming type go ahead and give it a go, but for me, this game just didn't catch my eye. I normally don't give negative reviews but even if its discounted this game really didn't have much to offer in terms of fun.			"

												Dominions 3: The Awakening (and I imagine all other Dominion games as well) promises much but - aside tons of statistics and sprites - delivers a little. You choose a god, well a sprite for your god and go through pages and pages of descriptions and statistics while doing it. It's fun if you're into details like I am but the ingame version of my God wasn't nearly as exciting. You start from the rather ugly map that consists most of the gameplay. There's your starting grid where you click recruit troops to... recruit troops. Then you assign these said troops under commanders which are like better troops than 'just troops'. You can choose the actions they take in battle... wait, oh, that's it! The problem is that you don't play any part in the combat itself. You move to a grid containing enemies and the combat auto-resolves to show you the outcome as a text-file or you can choose to watch the sprites go at it. It's fun for a couple times but you just start to slowly wish you could do more. But no, that's it. Next turn begins and you recruit more troops and set the ones you recruited last turn to move and capture more grids until you find your opponents. There's endless amounts of content here if you enjoy reading a novel of statistics but besides that there's no much to do. You might argue that there's a deeper level to the games strategy and there might be, I would've died to boredom if I tried to find out. I'm deeply dissapointed that there's also a fourth instalment of the series and by the looks of it's store page nothing has changed. It's just an add-on for Dominions 3 with now even more statistics to play around! Yay.			"

												Huge learning curve and in my opinion not worth the time to get good at it. I played offline so that's why I don't have much playtime. Civilization is much better if you want an in depth strategy game with a much nicer learning curve, and there are free strategy games that are better than this.			"

												A huge variety of playable nations, each with strengths, weaknesses, and distinct synergies with spells and magic item forging.  It's daunting to learn, but can be learned in layers (military, magic and forging, and metagame knowledge), and is fun all the way!  There's so much Stuff in the game, and it's fairly well balanced.  Best game in the world, recommended.			"
