												Old school turn-based squad tactical game released in 2000.Why buy it? If you haven't seen this game before, well, it's not as famous as Jagged Alliance or Incubation, but it was very good at given time. It costs little and there are coupons up to 90% - almost to cost of sip of water.Pro: Good tactics of small squad (3-5 members) based on fair balance and well-made short maps. Note that it's a close combat game, there are no gauss rifle to solve the problem from distance. You'll need to count every shot and use cold steel in every fight. It feels like survival games like resident evil 2&3, but with turn-based battle system.Cons: in year 2014 RE2-styled product look awful. Gorky 17 is playable, but some of new gamers might have their eyes bleed from first sight. The story, especially basic one (english version), is vague at its best, and klükva in general. AI is not that good, some of us will overcome this game easily.All in all, it's a fair 7.5/10 in my line. I'd give it more, but good balance was made out of killed realism. PS: It almost hit 15 years age mark! That means you can run it on very dull config! But, no matter how good is your CPU and GPU, there will be 640x480 resolution and damn large pixels. It runs on Win7 with no trouble at all, just pick the right stroke on videoconfig before starting the game.PS for russians: Game contains right translation (Made by Snowball studio - not Goblin's Gorky18). So you have two games in one: for NATO or for good old Specnaz, since translation made a big difference in all dialogs in game.			"

												Russia decides to bomb Poland... er, I mean one of its glorious soviet era secret cities built in Poland and the Western world doesn't take it lightly. NATO sends the whole army of four soldiers into the city and loses contact with them. Then they send another three - a Canadian, a Pole and a French. Sounds like a good mix for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ joke. Instead, as player finds out, it is a beginning of a sinister story set in a devastated city which has been abandoned by human beings... but strange creatures lurk in the shadows and player faces them constantly in turn based combat. With exception of the end game and some silly boss fights, the game offers a challenge and you will often count every bullet as they are hard to come by. The graphic and art design are amazing when it comes to surroundings, the creatures, however, are of mixed quality. During the gameplay there is a very atmospheric music which fits the mood perfectly, although one could wish for more tracks. Overall, the game is great if you enjoy gloomy settings and even more so if you are a fan of tactical games. For five euro it's a must-buy, so get it on Steam sales at least. Get it and play it!			"

												This is my firs review and english isn't my first language. So about the game. First of all i dont care about graphics so my review will be positive. Gorky 17 is the game in which you must to think in every battle and especially in begining you must save ammo as much as you can. I saved too much and in the end had plenty of ammo. And you must to choose the best route how to complete stage.I liked how the surroundings of maps was drawed and i liked the story and characters too.So buy this if you like turn based strategy, rpg and dont care about graphics. I spent 21 hour to complete the gameaming . On my non gaming laptop works perfectly.			"

												Gorky 17 is an endearing little strategy roleplaying game. While simplistic in it's design, Gorky makes up for it with solid, challenging gameplay and an intriguing plot which won't require a lot of time to invest in seeing through to the end. Minor glitches appear, a gamebreaking one in the third last fight which makes completing the game tricky. The game has aged a little poorly and you may find yourself rolling your eyes when it comes to the voice-acting, cutscenes will stutter and blink, and creature designs suffer from the poor graphic quality. Other than a few hiccups Gorky 17 is a quality title, and a steal at the small price tag this halloween sale (only a dollar and four cents).			"

												All i can say is.... WOW I don't expected creatures are that hard to kill. You have to use your mind as often to overcome the challenge. Only con is cutscene is being bugged with window 8 but I don't care. Point is gameplay and storyline in during game is truly amazing, and brutal challenging. Ammo and Medkits is very rare. After beating it. I Felt really good because it was freaking hard to kill creatures and bosses but I managed to survive with squads. For those whom actually enjoy storyline than graphic GO FOR IT.

												A wonderful  game I played back in the days. Be sure that the graphics are dated, but this is not the reason you play this game.The Game Centers around a NATO Command team that tries to uncover the mystery of the disappearance of another group. While uncovering its secrets you roam a city that was designed with attention to detail and encounter enemies at different points of the map. There is a large variability of enemies and cool boss enemies. The battles are faught in a round-based fashion, which is the aspect that makes this game so dear to my heart. Your group members (that change during the game based on its story) gain experience with the weapons they use increasing their effectiveness. They also level up and you can influence their attributes (like Luck, Accuracy, Chance of Coutner Attacks etc). The maps are fight layed out using squares and usually offer some possibilities to retreat from enemies so that you are not standing too tight. They often also offer coverage or objects like explosives that can be used to your advantage.The game is sometimes quite challanging because ammo can not be found in aboundance, so tactical thinking and choice of weapon is a must. In conclusion I have to say that I can only warmly recomment this game to anyone who likes old school tactical RPGs and is not too put-off by the dated graphics.			"

												Gorky 17  is a really nice classic turnbased action-horror-combat game. It has a great atmosphere even with its outdated resolution. The music is great and to me the background graphics still have their quality. The voice-acting is pretty bad but tolerable, nothing too distracting. The story is nothing special but it does manage to keep you interested and immersed. I also like the cutscenes used to introduce the boss enemies.The good thing about the gameplay is that it really needs you to think about your strategy. You'll almost always be short on ammunition and meet new enemies which require different tactics. The boss battles can be frustrating, but quite satisfying when you manage to get a victory. Get it, especially when it's on sale (which it is very often).			"

												Childhood game, remember playing it for the 1st time on Windows 98 and old PC, sigh. If you don't mind the pixelated graphics and you love turn-based combat games with RPG elements, this is the game for you. Campaign lasts for about 5 hours, is pretty intriguing with nice characters. Lots of stuff and weapons to find, helping us to shoot/smash/burn monsters, from a simple baseball bat up to Ionic rifles. Pretty slow at the begin, but if you can get through it will become more and more intensive.TL;DR game with terrible graphs but with amazing gameplay, worth buying especially on a sale.Btw a tip for people playing it on a system newer than XP, since they couldn't run it in any possible way. this game won't run unless you will use Software Renderer in the options menu. This will make your graphics settings terrible, but it's the only option to play it on Vista/7/8, at least from what I've seen.			"

												This is one of the best tactical games I ever played. The atmosphere and how every battle is unique really makes you want to play more and more.Unique weapons, unique enemy types, bosses in every corner, it will make you fear for your life every time, or want another 30 health packs just in case, even though you wont be needing it, thats the kind of fear the game places on you, you never know what to expect next and you will want to be ready every time.The story is cool, but ends in a cliff hanger, I guess because there is a prequel and a sequel (which aren't on steam).This is without a doubt one of my favorite games of all time.The main flaw now is being able to run it. It doesn't work that great on modern systems, and I had to change it to the Intel HD graphics to make it work, which is a shame how publishers just release stuff on steam without fixing it.			"

												Gorky 17 (Odium in North America) is a turn by turn strategy game.You will start with 3 guys from NATO and your objective is to rescue another team (Group 1) that HQ has lost communication with. The city is full of monsters and that's the game's main attraction: wasting them. As you can guess, the game's story is average.The voice acting is okay. Dialogs are sometimes ""funny"" even though most of them are cliché, as are the characters. The team boss is Canadian and tries to help people and goes right to the point. Another guy is Polish, has a funny broken English and he wants to blast everything. And the last dude is French and is -- of course -- an unbelievable wimp. Well... all of this is not that great either.During the combat phase, you will have trouble to see the tiles as they are transparent glowing green squares. It is also hard to visualize the opposition's move range as it has the same color and style. Also the overview is not isometric. Sometimes a weird camera angle prevents you from having a clear sight of what's going on. Crates and other stuff will block the view and those lovely glowing tiles. If you are not careful, you will end up clicking on the wrong tile and wasting a move. Or worse. In other words the combat phase is very clumsy.When you are not shooting stuff, you are exploring the map. Every time you will spot a glowing crate -- which contains supplies like medpacks, ammo, etc. -- there will be a battle nearby. There is pretty much one crate per battle. Always. Whether the battle starts when approaching it or right after you emptied its content and went through a door or something nearby, a battle event occurs. Oh yeah I forgot: battles are scripted. There are no random encounters.During this epic adventure, various people will join your team. It's all fine and all. Except that when they have to leave your awesome NATO team because they… uh feel like it or just because they die or whatever, they will simply disappear... along with all the stuff you gave them! Say goodbye to the shiny armor, handgun, precious ammo, etc. The inventory is NOT transferred to one of your guys. Save often, so that when they leave you can load a previous save, and empty their inventory.But this is quite a problem as the ammo is scarce. The game is quite hard if you use firearms. The limited amount of ammo pushes you to use melee weapons. At first you won't have a choice but to shoot creeps. However, a taser and a tranq gun will help you freeze those turds for a couple of turns while you beat the sht out of 'em.The taser among other weapons like the flamethrower, have unlimited ""ammo"". But, they have a cool down: like 3 turns to fire/shoot again. That means that when two of your goons have a taser or such other weapon, you will be able to keep a monster “tranquilized” forever. Just wait for the cool down to be over to tase the mofo again with the other guy.So... basically a battle goes like this: analyze which scum to tase first, rush him with all of your guys, and melee him like a bunch of hooligans. Crowbar, baseball bat, axe. Yeah. The battles are hence, not very interesting. However there are some cool ""weapons"" like calling for an airstrike, an electric beam, and all kind of other crazy tools.Let’s talk about bugs now. I had an inventory bug were a key item disappeared between saves. I had to restart the game as I couldn’t open a freaking door without it. Also the game cannot start on modern computer due to the old graphic ""engine"" -- if we can call it that way. However, fear not (or not that much) as there are a few different gorky17.exe builds in the game folder that you can try. Copy/paste/overwrite the original .exe with one of them and try to run the game. Disabling the hardware zoom is however pretty much always recommended.On an old computer with WinXP and a crappy graphic card that has barely 3D acceleration, I had no problem running the game. It was flawless. However Win 8.1 x64 + GeForce GTX 770 the game crashed. Using the software only build + choosing software renderer was making the game super freaking slow. Even with my quad core i7 4770k. So I was back to my WinXP.All in all I must have spent 10 to 15 hours of gameplay. Not that bad. But the overall experience was barely average. I’m hesitating whether thumbing this down or not. I had fun with this game. I wasn’t playing that seriously anyway and still ended up with shtton of ammo.Hmmm… lets thumb it up.			"

												Gorky 17 will always be a great game, with a very interesting story.You start out in some dreary town, somewhere in Poland, and immediately you get the feeling something is very wrong here. As you soon find out, things are going to hell real fast, and the enemy types leave you no clue whatsoever as to what exactly went down here.This is the first thing that struck me as brilliant when it first came out, and it still does today.where in most games you get a general idea of what you are about to face just looking at the enemy types (skeletons, zombies, wild animals, humans etc.), in this game you just get more confused the more of them you encounter.Troughout the game you get fed some scarse information about what caused all this madness to happen, but you only get the whole picture near the end, in a very blatant exposition dump.This almost seems as if the people that created this game ran out of time, or they simply didnt have any budget left to let the story come to a more natural, more fluid conclusion.The variety of weapons, gear, and other items is very well done, and shows the tender care the creators had for this product.While exploring and fighting inside the town, you encounter all kinds of NPC chatacters, all equally colorful and unexpected.Some will even fight with you, turn into monsters, betray you, or help you out to find usefull stuff.My verdict for Gorky 17 is that for its current price, its a no brainer to get it, great gameplay, great story, great game.But beware, this game is old, and has no support whatsoever from its publishers, might not even work on your machine, and/or glitch out some times.Pro:Very atmospheric game that leaves you wondering right up tot he last second.Good variety of gear and NPC encounters.Cheap as dirt, especially with coupons or on sale.Clearly a lot of care went into the game, even though the ending is a bit rushed.Con:The story could have been concluded more gradiently.Old game, might not work properly on your system, or have glitches.The voice acting (especially for the women) is a bit odd in places, although not bad.Some fights can have fail states which you can not overcome (if you happen to have low health for example), save often.p.s. A sequel would be very very welcome...			"

												Gorky 17 ain't perfect. Bad voice acting, rough polygonal graphics, and iffy combat system can drag this game down for a lot of people. But for the few who wish to take on this unusual, potential cult classic, give it a try. Where the game falters are immediately compensated for by where it succeeds. A smooth fusion of RPG and survival horror, an intriguing story, wicked creature designs, more-than-suitable atmosphere and soundtrack, and well-developed strategic gameplay make Gorky 17 a flawed bundle of late-90's sci-fi horror goodness.

												Don't mind the steam play-time stat, I played (and finished) this a long time ago.I even have the original CD here...somwhere...Anyway, I don't write much reviews and above that, this is a very old game but I still wanted to express my views about this game.This game was a very pleasant experience back then:+ Resident evil kind of atmosphere+ Tense ""tactical"" combat+ cheesy voice acting+ over the top mutant enemies (wheelchair-bound-super-revolver-shooting-mutant ....yeah...that's just one of the enemy-freak-show encounters....)+ cheesy but still interesting ""story"" (story is a huge word, but you still want to know what in the name of [...INSERT YOUR DEITY...] is going on.Negative point(s):- VERY shortI really miss these kind of dark atmospheric ""tactical sci-fi"" horror games.The only game I can fetch from the steam library is STASIS but that's a point and click style kind of game.If horror and tactical combat is your thing, you can not go wrong with this one, even if the game is about 17 years old (?). The only problem is, is to get it to run ""normally"". Whith that I mean, that the characters might look like they have been cut out from cardboard by stevie wonder.If you find the game to hard, there is a tactic you can use which involves positioning your characters around the enemy. I can't remember the tactic fully...sorry...but if you get the hang of the combat mechanics you might find out the tactic easily...Do yourself a favour If you're a sci-fi horror fan who appreciates some tactics in combat, get this one to work and play it.So.... back to my blockbuster movie: Dinocroc vs. Supergator ...

Goofy enemies, lots of weapons and equipment, elements of exploration, simple but fun puzzles, nice NPCs and tactical combat.

Kinda. I have used all my ammo for the rifle and the melee weps don't worth anything, neither the pistol.My favorite turn based game, after Fallout 2.This game worths every cent.Edit : Harder than STALKER CoP's Misery. Not even 30 min in the game (restarted the whole game about 4 times) but I am aganist ranged minigun thing, attacks 2 area and damages like 30, same with melee. Other thingy, rocket launcher guy, attacks 9 area and damages 45. The third, cutter thing, I am still afraid of that since 2003, damages 30-40 up close.Melee and stuff don't worth much since you have to use them a ton to get your wep skill high and atleast they can destroy a pile of butter.I have successfully finished the game. In 15 hours??? Yes, I have died a lot, but still, it only felt like 8...			"

												1st of all i think this game is awesome, even if many things made me crazy in it.It looks like more or less like a ""tactical resident evil"". So you can guess what to expect.Now to the main point, the game is HARD, very HARD, i mean at least the first time you do it, not knowing when combats happens, sparing any ammo you can, any bandage.. It's like a non stop boss fight (with an opening movie each time) and you're always on the breach, so this and the overall difficulty, the fact that 1 knockdown and its game over, is the good point. The bad point is technically, the  camera make this even harder in the bad way, you will often shoot your teamates miss you target or run when you dont want to, without any possibility to cancel, and finally flying monster do not appear on the ground with any shadow or anything, making them awfully hard to deal with.As i list the default, one more would be the ia.. the ia is actually in some aspect too good. I should film a combat with humanoids, its hillarious, its like playing chest with computer, you cant touch them, except if you sacrifice something.So in the end, great ""little"" game, took me almost 20h in a row, when i only wanted to give try.  9/10, no wait.. for 50ct 10/10			"

												All of you should play this game truly for the sole reason of hearing Jarek Ovitz's quotes because they are truly the best thing about this game and it's really what kept it memorable for me.Other than that this game brings many memories of my childhood and the very horrific but well story driven moments with this game when it wasn't just about graphics but about well written story.Honestly, buy it because it's not too expensive but it's worth every penny.

												It's old style turn-based strategy. You need to place you team members in right positions and use proper weapons to defeat enemies. Graphics really old one, but game has some charm and interesting logic.In game there is no rutine, so from one figth to another you need to use different strategy.at the end the game become easier, and end itself a little bit shortcutted.Anyway, if you like JaggedAlliance, X-COM and Fallout, you need to check it.

												For starters, the game has a very good atmosphere. Somewhat of a Stalker'ish feel. The game itself plays like a turn based game with battles occuring like the random Final Fantasy random battle style. You walk around the game world and sometimes get caught up in these battles. They aren't random but you never see them coming so moving around a new area is always a bit tense!As said before, the battles are turn based. You get the first turn to move your men around and use their weapons. The fighting is alot like Chess in a sense. For example, you pistol can only fire in four directions while the assault rifle can also fire diagonally. This kinda feels unrealistic of course, but it adds to the strategic element. Hitting the enemy in the flank or rear also adds more damage, again making the game a bit more tactical.The graphics are pretty good. The characters are pretty low polygon but the hand drawn enviromnents are great. You may have some problems getting the game to run due to codec problems but I've managed to solve them quite easily. I'm sure GoG-team will issue a better fix for all the other people someday.Now for the bad; the game is very very hard. Ammo is extremely scarce and you will need to resort to melee weapons in order to conserve it. While this adds some intensity and challenge it also makes it possible to completely screw yourself over early in the game if you use up all your rifle rounds or waste that precious ""missile"" on a useless enemy.The ""random"" fights can be quite annoying as well since you never know you are walking into a mutant death trap and haven't found more quality weapons in order to win that fight. The beginning area for example is quite open, you go into different directions from your starting position. But sometimes you really need to have visited point A first because there you can find weapons you need if you ever want to have a chance against the enemy at point B.In conclusion : A fun game but the difficulty may scare some people away (and this is coming from someone who loves hard games!). You may need to replay the beginning a few parts to really get the hang of it. Still a recommeded though! And for six bucks, you don't have anything to lose, right?			"

												Ah Gorky 17, one of my first and favorite games. Turn based, tactical, with a good story and good characters. And the player turn 01 is still one of the best ""song"" in my book.

												Well, for the past ten years I beat it three or four times. It's great turn-based tactics RPG, with good and clear UI, easy-to-use mechanics and entertaining gameplay. There are not so many games in that genre, and this one totally worth seeing. Disadvantages? The game is quite old, the graphics is outdated and the plot is a mess. And it's hardly a real RPG - don't expect it to be Fallout, because it's not - no complex dialogues, no barter, no real open world. All it has from RPG is an ability to increase your soldiers skills. It is more like Shadowrun Returns, but darker and with ""less talking more shooting"" kind of gameplay.I wish they did sequels in the same way, because the game is just awesome.			"

												Gorky 17 is surprisingly fun if you look past the dated prerendered look.One of the best things about this game is the pacing. Rather than having long periods of time where you are disconnected from the story, Gorky 17 keeps the story going by injecting character expression into the many situations you find yourself in. Another thing that stood out was the unique enemies that you run into. As you work your way into the bombed out mutant city, you'll encounter creepy new enemies at every turn. You will marvel at the hideousness of these beasts. Unfortunately, the battle engine is a little too simple such that the terror of these monsters are not fully realized.Nevertheless, a decent experience.			"

												Odium (AKA, Gorky 17) is the game that first got me into turn-based strategy games. It forces you to think and plan your every move. Limited ammunition and healing items mean that your every shot matters, and just blowing everything away leaves you ill-prepared for what lies ahead of you.The story is inventive and still holds up today, as does the gameplay. The character and creature models may appear dated by today's standards, but the inventiveness and excellent sound library make this VERY easy to overlook.If you are a fan of turn-based tactics games, creepy atmoshphere, and challenging gameplay; this is a game you should seriously consider picking up. ESPECIALLY for $5 (or hey, this week it's on sale for $0.99).			"

Once you've got yourself covered on the bug front, you should be set for an enjoyable experiance and fantastic story. Consider it as a turn based version of S.T.A.L.K.E.R with a story line just as intriguing. A must buy for such a classic game.			"

If you haven't seen this game before, well, it's not as famous as Jagged Alliance or Incubation, but it was very good at given time. It costs little and there are coupons up to 90% - almost to cost of sip of water.Pro: Good tactics of small squad (3-5 members) based on fair balance and well-made short maps. Note that it's a close combat game, there are no gauss rifle to solve the problem from distance. You'll need to count every shot and use cold steel in every fight. It feels like survival games like resident evil 2&3, but with turn-based battle system. "

Posted: September 9, 2014
												First off, the game has serious problems with graphics on modern computers and surprisingly, it's easier to run it on a laptop with an integrated graphics card than on a regular PC. When buying it, do expect it.As for the game itself. Back when it was released in 1999 it was definitely a hit, however it has aged rather bad. The 3D graphics are clearly outdated - low res textures, low poly models, etc. Still, the general crudeness of the game somehow appealed to me so I decided to play it and finished it afterall.Unfortunately, the gameplay itself is extremely dull. Once you get the hang of all of the game mechanics the game's only about fighting a vicious, unforgiving AI, which is rather easy to predict. Boss fights are oversimplified and often boil down to blocking/stunning the boss and hammering him/her down with every weapon available. The final boss fight is a complete joke and is probably the easiest of them all.Finally, I was greatly disappointed with the plot and depiction of characters. Once the Great Conspiracy is revealed, it turns out to be a huge load of bullocks. It doesn't even qualify for a Z grade movie. Also, two of the characters totally drove my gears - Jarek Ovitz and Slavsky. I'm of Polish descent and Ovitz is NOT a typical Polish surname, nor is Slavsky a typical Polish name. Polish people are depicted in Gorky17 as strong, yet dumb and supersticious. Also, they have Russian accents and speak very bad Polish. I know the game was probably low-budget, but that doesn't excuse a complete lack of research on Poland and Polish people.Honestly, I am super patient and that's the only reason I managed to complete the game. However, the game's not worth your time. There are other, better ones around. "

												Gorky-17 is a sci-fi horror-themed turn-based tactics game. Imagine Resident Evil 1 with combat system from Incubation. The atmosphere of the abandoned city is great and resembles STALKER series somehow, the turn-based combat is fun and varied with lots of status effect that can be inflicted on enemies. There are some easy puzzles and even some deegree of nonlinearity to the plot (one of the secondary characters can be saved or not, while the other one is killed no matter what you do). The leveling up system is lacking and I didn't see any difference when dumping points into a skill, but it's probably the only bad thing I can say about the game.I'd like to remember what made the game popular in Russia at the time of the release. Russian version was more of an adaptation than translation - they changed a lot of names and plot details. For example, the main character trio became Russian, Ukrainian and Estonian who serve in Russian MES (Ministry of Emergency Situations). And then there was an official ""funny"" translation named Gorky-18, where they changed all the names and all the plot again, now adding a lot of humor of varying quality.It is still fondly remembered as one of the first foreign games officially published in Russia. It was published in jewel cases without the manual (which was new for the time) and the retail price was equal or cheaper than the pirated CDs. There was no way bigger companies would agree to such terms and such a low profit, so the big hits of the time like Quake 2 or Half-life weren't published in Russia (though they were pirated a lot). We could get aquainted with some lesser-known games instead, and sometimes they turned to be just great, such is Gorky 17.			"

												Although i would like to give this game a proper review once having completed it, it unfortunatly was unplayable after the cutscene for me, for some reason the outdated graphics do not display properly from my gtx 950 so all i see is the background, although i can see the feet of my characters i couldnt see any of the enemies which meant combat was a mere guessing game in the darkness, perhaps if you are going to resell a game from 1999 you should add an HD texture pack to ensure that when we buy it that it actually works. But since i got this in a bundle months ago im not overly bothered since the cost probably works out to like 10 cents per game once divided up.			"

												Truly an hidden gem.I've enjoyed everything about this game, but as im going to explain why, i'm afraid it will end up looking like the opposite,Gorky 17 is flawed and it's nothing that much original either.Its a turn based strategy adventure game with some rpg elements, back then it was probably the first time i´ve seen a game that mixes genres like this, but it didnt do anything i haven't seen before, and it was a fairly simple turn based game as well.Its scarce in rpg elements, there arent multiple routes you can take, you wont do any moral choices, its fairly linear, and even the leveling up sistem isnt all the complex, it's also inconsistent when it comes to difficulty.What it does right though, might be the reason why i choose to replay it after all this years and still find it so addicting.For starters Gorky 17 is all about resources and tactical thinking, the game is easy as long as you are good at managing what you got, there isnt much ammo or health lying around and characters themselves become better with weapons after using them in battle.winning isnt enough, finding the best strategy too waste as less ammo and life as possible, is just that important, you will have to know your enemies, know who too attack first and be aware of your characters limitations.for a survival horror this fits well, more importantly it adds a lot of depth to an otherwise simple game.The story is just ridiculous and so is the acting and the dialogue, its just so over the top but it work perfectly and its done while maintaining its horror atmosphere through the all gamei also have to mention how bad and uninteresting the creatures design is, though it doesnt even matter when there are this many enemies, each one with different attack patterns, and besides, for such an old game the graphics still hold up well, the backgrounds are just great even the music is fantastic, makes me wish i had the OST as well, it's just that good.In the end Gorky 17 sure is a flawed game, but for every flaw it also give something amazing, if you are searching for something that mixes x com with Resident evil, look no further4.0/5			"

												Pros:-fun for someone who rarely plays turn based strategy games-crazy monster designs-somewhat challenging gameplay, sometimes you'll get flooded by monsters and have to use the map's cover to your advantage as well as all your resources (spare that ammo when you can, you'll need it) Cons:-really bad voice acting that gets worse as soon as you meet the girl you're supposed to rescue, the voice doesn't fit her at all-cutscenes are broken for me in some weird interlacing issue that plays in lines over the last screen I was on, might as well mention game doesn't even render properly unless I set it to software render mode-A bit slow for some battles if you end up burning a lot of monsters, seeing as it gives the burn damage one at a time and animates them dying slowly one at a timealthough it seems like an older game with it's flaws, for someone who just walked into it expecting less it actually kept me entertained for the hours I was playing it, and I plan to keep playing it until I beat it.

Fallout Intertwined With Resident EvilThis is an obscure Polish strategy RPG for the PC released in 1999. At first, it reminded me of RE because it is a small team, sent to investigate some vague mystery, and everything goes wrong right from the start. You even find and use items on different objects to advance or find secrets. The voice acting is terrible too, another plus for RE fans, adding to the camp, but the translation is pretty good, actually.The battles are grid-based (you can turn the grid on and off with TAB.) The depth of the battle system relies on the multitude of weapons, and the fact that you level up weapons individually. It's best to spread the weapons around and have a team of specialists.The music is electro-industrial indicative of someone in the late '90s who had a decent synth and liked Haujobb.			"

Worth it if you're a fan of the genre This is a weird Polish turn-based squad tactics game. The graphics and mood are both like the original Resident Evils - dark, but cheesy. The game does a good job of keeping you off balance, not knowing who to trust, or how to survive each new horror you come across. Each boss is unique, and every few battles you'll fight a new type of monster.Combat is a little weird. Weapons have distinct attack patterns - pistols can only be fired in four directions, while rifles can also be fired diagonally, etc. That restriction (and the weird camera angles) can make it difficult to make sure that you're on the right spot to be able to shoot an enemy, but you don't have to use all your movement at once, so you can adjust as needed. (I've seen videos of the original Polish version of the game where there's a visible grid in combat, but that seems to have been removed from the English version). Ammo (and healing items) are often scarce, but you also get some reusable weapons that can be used every few turns for free. Stupidly, this includes tasers that lets you stunlock some bosses (many are immune) to the point where they can't ever attack you or move.You get to choose how your characters improve when they level up, but the choices are pretty basic. Increasing health is  mostly a waste because there's nothing that can one-shot you, and healing items just heal a fixed number instead of a percentage of your health. Max out accuracy for your shooters, reduce calmness for melee guys (so that they rage out and do bonus damage easier), and then go with either luck for bonus damage or improve your counter-attack chance. (Counter attacks are free actions, but you can't switch weapons or change your facing, so plan ahead. You can face your character by clicking on him). Make sure to save after every fight or event. There are some times when you blatantly should have been given a chance to reorganize your inventory but weren't, so just reload instead.If this doesn't run properly in Windows 7, add it to the DEP list, use Windows 95/98 compatiblity mode, and use software rendering.This game is very old and rough around the edges, but it often goes on sale for a dollar and it's easily worth that.

												A turnbased RPG from 1999 that is hard as there is no training/grinding, supplies are limited and if any character gets killed its GAMEOVER. I can't say that the story was written well, its just enough to keep things going but the gameplay is more than enough to make up for it.Its a pretty short game about 20 hours (half of my play time was not recorded even though I was online -Steam bug) or less.Overall I give it 8.3/10!

												The decsription for this game seemed really interesting, unfortunately the execution is not. The game opens to a hideous menu with a ridiculously blinding light for a cursor and one of the ugliest fonts I have ever seen.The options menu is minimal with the graphics options have 2 options neither of which is texture quality or resolution, despite these glaring issues I hit the play button and wait. The starting video is really bland but this pales in comparison to the voice acting once the game starts. The acting is ridiculously bad and the attempts at accents are even worse. As for graphics they are PS1 graphics style which is unfortunately the ugliest period in gaming history, after listening to the opening dialogue i take 3 steps and a random battle begins the combat seems as though it would actually be fun, I manage to make 2 attacks before ending my turn, the enemy then hits me twice and the game crashes in spectacular fashion.I would avoid this title as all costs unless you have a fondness for PS1 graphics, bad voice acting and unstable games. If you do decide to play this game through for whatever reason I would suggest turning your sound off and just reading the subtitles.			"

												*EDIT* I recently learned that this game's graphical issues can be fixed with running it in software rendering mode. I'll give that a try later this week.To start off, Gorky 17 looks like it has a decent premise behind it, the beginning is interesting and I was immediately sucked in the conflict at hand. The game is a turn based tactical rpg that feels similar to the original Fallout games. During my brief playtime I battled a fair amount, and I really had no idea what I was doing. There wasn't much of anything to help you learn how to battle or even how to equip your characters. I eventually figured it out but the lack of a tutorial is understandable with an older game, and I'm not going to fault it too much for it. However, that's not why I don't reccommend Gorky 17. Gorky 17, as you may find out, is quite old. very old in fact. If you have anything near a modern pc you might not even be able to play it. The game has color and texture issues, with some textures moving over your character and enemies. This makes combat very difficult, because you can't see where to move and shoot. Oh and by the way, all of these graphical issues can barely be fixed by compatability modes. The first time I launched the game it looked like I was on acid or something. My experience personally was marred by these technical issues, and while they may not be present on every user's machine, I can't reccommend this game because I didn't get a chance to play it right. I thought it looked neat and I picked it up, but with only a half hour's playtime i didn't get what I wanted out of it.This is a problem with some older games on steam, I had no real warning the game would/could essentially be unplayable due to graphical glitches. Gorky 17 probably should be taken off Steam and GoG until someone patches it (if someone cares enough.) It has a decent premise, but it will never be expanded upon unless you like can get past the graphical oddities.			"

												Bought it purely out of nostalgia .. was diappointedits boring, fight after fight with nothing new going on, I dont mind this old school made up difficulty, but it needs proper character progression, so you get motivation to level up your soldiers through endless fighting, if story is not enough (its not)overall slighty above average game back in the day, aged to become not worth the timetech tip: play the game with exe found in versions/alternative2 and use rpg emulation			"

												First of all, i actually played game for like 10-15 hours and finished it.Game has some problems with ""new"" hardware (keep in mind that it was first released in 1999), so you will PROBABLY need to use google to fix some problems. For me it was ""screen flickering"", but i fixed it by using DXWND (forced windowed mode). And because i played game via DXWND, steam says that i only played for ~7 minutes.The gameplay is pretty easy for those who are experienced in turn-based games, but is also very entertaining. For those who want some sort of challenge - try to finish the game without using any sort of stuns and disables - this things are very cheesy in Gorky 17.This game is old, so don't expect graphics to be any good, though for game which was released in 1999 it is very decent.In fine, I can say that the game is good and worth the money.

												Played this years ago on disc. It's short and doesn't have much depth. I'm not talking about the story, characters and such, I'm talking about the gameplay. However, for me at least, very memorable. This is one of my first games, which I truly enjoy and finish couple of times back then. It's like Japanese turn-based tactical RPG but with Western science-fiction horror flavor. Think of it like FF Tactics Lite version. A very lite, that is.Nothing will blow you away in awe, but it's just simply good, guilty pleasure. Some of the monster/mutant designs were actually great, altho they don't look good by its outdated graphics by now.Also there're not much options or even difficulty settings in game. The backgrounds are pre-rendered images, and they're low res. If you don't mind those, this game is great.I tried to get it installed using the disc but I can't remember why it doesn't work. I was very tempted to buy this game when I saw it on Steam.Do I recommend it? Not this release.Graphical glitches and bugs everywhere and the publisher don't even put any effort fixing it or upgrading it for modern systems. Instead they working on Mac release. I know, this is more than a decade old game, and they probably don't keep the source, but still, that doesn't make them have the right to release a broken product.Sure, there're workarounds from the users, and if you don't mind jumping through these hoops, I'd actually recommend it. But that doesn't justify lazy re-releases like this.Perhaps it'll run better on Wine under Linux or the Mac release, since most older games run better under it. I haven't tried it myself tho.It's cheap, so if you're tempted, give it a try. I got this Steam release for free, so.. meh.			"

												My comments (and subsequent downvote) about Gorky 17 having compatibility issues with Windows 7 were resolved some time ago after several newer driver revisions over the course of time, I should have edited or removed this review long back, but it had slipped my mind; I apologize for this error.I'm too lazy to type up a proper review for this game at the moment, so the below will have to suffice for the time being.This game is very atmospheric, enjoyable, and is pretty hardcore in terms of difficulty. I love hard games, as I grew up with that kind of thing. When people say games were traditionally much more difficult 15+ years ago, it's the truth. If you want something to hold your hand, this isn't it. If you want an enjoyable turn-based strategy game with rpg elements, set in a dark atmosphere and filled with grotesque abominations that are equal parts flesh and metal, then this is something you would enjoy.It's a great game, and I recommend it to any fans of the genre.Important-ish Note: Out of the video cards that I have (Geforce 760 gtx and Radeon HD4870x2), the Geforce works perfectly, and I actually still have issues with the Radeon (Win7 x64), and actually have to run the game in software mode for it to be playable.

												Now after playing around with this game for about 20 minutes, i just couldn't get into the game, Why?, well this is my review of this now 15 year old video game.Pros:It has an amazing atmosphere for a Post-apocalyptic game, something that is growing less nowadays.It is a difficult game to master, requires strong strategy, it could take 1 wrong move to get yourself killed.Cons:The soundtrack is a bit repetitive.It has something which pains gamers, the random fight sequences every odd steps you move.Meh:Graphics are very meh-bad, even for a game released about 15 years ago.Overall:Gorky 17 is a very meh game in my opinion, and one that i myself cannot get into, though i feel like older gamers might like this game. In my opinion i give this game a 5/10.			"

Buggy and the graphics are glitchy. You can't walk down the road without being assaulted. The fire arcs are horrific. There is NOTHING in your way but you cannot shoot the creatures. The game gives you these star shaped firing arcs which serve no purpose and when you have a rifle equipped you can not shoot far like you would think you could.			"

												When playing through my indie and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games, I also got to Gorky 17. Guess which category it belongs to. That's right ♥♥♥♥♥♥. This game shouldn't be on Steam anymore. It's too old and the story line is just too cliché for 2016.One upside though, the voices of the characters are funny.2/10			"

												One of the best and most atmospheric games made around 2000. Story is pretty good: it revolve around Soviet/Russian labs on Polish soil and the experiments that gone terribly wrong. Characters got their own personality, which made the interactions/conflicts between them look interesting. Every one got their own opinion about what's going on and it makes you guessing the whole time during the campaign.It's not Jagged Alliance 2, it's not a Xcom game, its a little simpler, but the mix of a good strategy gameplay and its military/horror setting makes it a pretty decent, unforgettable game for that price. If you haven't played it, now is your chance.			"

												*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS**** For $2.50 this old-school squad turn based strategy is not too shabby.  I remember playing the demo AGES ago, but I never found a copy of the game then forgot about it.  The game's ok but has lots of flaws.  some weapons only shoot in straight lines, or straight lines and diagonals.  If you aren't standing in the right spot, you can't shoot things.  There's no cover.  Gear is limited, but mostly I like that about the game.  It makes you stingy with ammo, you melee more often.  Some weapons ""recharge"" so have unlimited shots but you can only use them every 2 or 3 turns.  Fair trade-off I suppose for unlimited ammo.   If a character dies or leaves the party in a scripted event you can't recover their gear.  It's gone.  I'd understand if they walked away, but even if they die right at your feet the stuff's gone.  it's an okay game for what it is, and for the price.			"

Didn't think much of it to begin with, but I found it to be a brilliant hidden gem.A sci-fi/horror isometric turn-based strategy, you start off investigating a missing team, but the story really draws you in. There is a fair difficulty spike with the game ending if you lose a team member (you can restart from an earlier save), but the atmosphere is brilliant, and if you end up playing this through to the end, won't feel like you've been robbed a few hours of your life.

												It advertises being a RPG game but its actually not, there is only a little bit of character (skill) development and not much dialog. The story isn’t that bad actually but nothing memorable, its the usual ”scientific research went work and some special forces have been sent to investigate it”.Some of the advertised features are little strange, like the ”multiple-choice dialog”, there was not a single dialog where you could choose anything, I think there was totally only about 30 lines of dialog in the whole game, so that about the ”enthralling dialog”.The skills you can train are mostly useless, I think that only luck and HP were useful enough to put points in.But otherwise this is still some decent old school turn-based action game, just don’t except any RPG elements in it. Its moderately challenging, the beginning can be frustratingly hard as you don’t get too many ammo and medpaks, so you always need to think every step thoroughly, every turn counts and you can not make any mistakes.Be warned, it might not work on newer machines. I got it running on my old laptop (WIN7) but it didn’t even start on my new desktop setup (with Win7 also), always crashed on the start. Even on my laptop it still crashed sometimes in battles, it has really bad bug in the second last fight, where it would crash every time I killed the last monster in the battle, and the only way around it was skipping that battle with cheat-code.6/10			"

Despite aged graphics, sloppy cinematics and horrible voice acting (seriously, in eng version, polish character speaks with russian accent, I mean, I'm from polland, am I missing something in the history of my country?)U might wanna save ammo from the very beginning, the game is not f***ing around, there is combat literally every each step you take, and it is challenging. The game is difficult, but in a cool way, u wont die 10 times a day playing this, but the game forces you to think and contrive. You will give your ♥♥♥♥♥iest character your last med kit just to prevent from dying and losing the game. The sight of box with items will be more joyful than your girfliend's♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Gorky 17 is an oldie, but a goody. Russia bombed a village of theirs a while back and no one knows why. Now years later, Nato sends in canadian Cole Sullivan,  polish Jerek Ovitz, and ??? Theiry Trantique to find Group 1. Well Group 1 failed their  mission pretty hard core, aka DEAD, so now you are to find out why Russia is so interested in this village '' Lubin '' and is referring to a '' Gorky 17 ''... Not a bad story huh? This kinda reminds me of the orginal Resident Evil plot set-up. Well, with old graphics but a good spooky soundtrack, hunt down Russian chaotic science hybrids in Lubin village to find out what is going on. The cinimatics are ok, with a true turn based combat system. Their also is a in enviroment items puzzle system too. As in you find items in the map that are ''keys''  to get to the next map or get items, ammo, and gear. There is 5 maps or levels, so the game is short but takes alot of searching for items the first time around. A good one for the turn based tactic lovers and those that like X-files.lol			"

												This game might look ugly, but it's a really fun and atmospheric turn-based strategy game with RPG elements. It has a very original setting and is really, really fun. Only downside is you can't cancel you move, once you've made it. E.g. if you accidentally click on a square you cannot reverse it that's how it'll stay.... so better be careful and make your decisions wisely sometimes accidental action might end your combat and you'll have to start again. It's a minor issue, but still annoying.With all that said the game rocks and it's highly recommended.			"

												This is a very old game, from the 90's golden era of pc gaming.  Within its genera, it holds its end up well against many graphically superior games today.  It is a fun game and a good representation of gaming at that time.  Has some decent music too (""battle theme #2 player"" is my favorite).  But I would note the following for those contemplating buying it.1. I have windows 7 64-bit.  I had to use ""software rendering"" to get around a graphics issue.  Not all windows 7 users have to do this.  Has something to do with ffdshow maybe?  But this simple fix works fine.2. there is one place in the game where it crashes, near the end, but this area is skippable and it is a long fight with no benefits at the end.  You may not even get the fight depending upon when you visit rooms in the last area.3. recall that this was originally made for 640x480 monitors.  Scaling will be done either by your monitor or your gpu.   It is possible to turn this scaling off either via most monitors or your video card's drivers.  For example, nvidia has a ""no scaling""  and ""scale on gpu"" settings which will render an uncaled 640x480 picture.  But interstingly enough I found this little picture almost impossible to play compared to the scaled version on my 27"" screens.  So I went with the scaling.With the sale, it is a cheap 30 hours of old style gaming entertainment.  For those who think it is hard, the trick is to look for all the boxes and hidey-holes to get first aid items and ammo and special weapons, and to fight smart.  That was part of the point with these old games (smart).  By smart I mean doing things like conserving ammo, using the proper weapon type at the proper time (ranged, area of effect, mele, and the all important negative buff inflictors), and tactics like figuring out when to close in for an attack, when to make the enemy come to you, what sequence your characters should attack in, plotting ahead by two or three moves in battle, and paying attention to the immunities and special abilities of different types of monsters.  You can't just do ""combat shotgun to the head"" in this game and expect to get through it.  In the end, like most great games, it is the special abilities that make all the difference in the really hard fights.  This game offers several negative buffs you can inflict on the mutations you will be faced with, so, whatever special weapon abilities a monster is not immune to, us it on them without reservation.Good luck.

												Gorky 17 kinda reminds me of good ol' Resident Evil back in PsX era but with tactical gameplay.It has good creepy vibe and sense of dread that somehow absent from most recent horror games.Dialogue are believeable unfortunately the voice acts kinda sucks. A serious line can sounds silly and funny.And one thing, this game is hard. At least for me.The gameplay itself is your typical grid based strategy ala X-com or even final fantasy tactics but a bit minimalistic.Battles will occur on spesific point in an area. And there is no random battles. Battlefields are flat with some obstacles. There are some object that you can interact with. Enemies have a lot of variation, each with their own behavioral pattern and strength, you'll need good strategy to effectively eliminate them.One thing that marred this game is the way they handle ammo and consumables.THERE IS NO SHOP!! The only way to heal yourself is by using consumables that can only be gained from boxes. The same thing also applied to ammo, weapons and armor. So killing everything effectively is very important lest youre running out of stuff and can't move on.Overall this game is pretty good. It's challenging and has good horror vibes. It has decent playtime about 10 hours or so and  has solid replayability value.Old maybe, but definitely worth to be played.			"

												If you're into 1990's PC games, this is a great title. By 1990's games standards, meaning the plot is step by step not sandbox. The gameplay is based on ammo preservation, so think of it as a battle campaign of getting out of a town infested by strange creatures while learnign the story behind it.+ turn based combat system+ locations+ 1999 game + graphics have a charm to them - not much choice to make when it comes for travelling through town as its mostly an A to B kind of game.

												So here comes my opinion (I'm sure I will repeat things written before, so I try keep it somewhat short and formal):Pros:- Good, and suprisingly dinamic, yet quite tactical TBS combat system: team, but not classed based fights - each three of your main character can use any weapon you find during the game, and they can freely switch those tools-of-the-trade between each other, even in the middle of the battles!- The setting is good (sounds and visuals fit with the game's concept very well)- There is characther development: you can gain attribute points and level up weapon skills - not much, but just enough,- Challenging but still balanced: For the first playthrough this game can be...., no, it WILL be hard and hars on you in the battles - there will be a lot of ""Oh, shi..."" moments-, but the items you find while exploring will even the odds from time to time. Paying attention for attacking angles, support items, damages types and constantly keeping an eye on the supplies is important. - The story is pretty good too. Don't expect extra sides of originalty, but it does it's work to keep things interesting,- Voice-over is okay.Cons- Low replayability: in every playthrough is the same, the same battles with the same monsters, everything is in the same place - basically it's a one-stop-gamer for most of the gamers.- Voice-over is okay, and talking between the characters lets you to pick up little details about then, but not it just fits in every time. The voice actors fall of the character from time to time. The conversations only occur during the cutscenes and the beginnings of the battles, and sometimes are quite inconsequential (for example in an battle with a lot of enemies, the characters are sarcastical and and ♥♥♥♥♥ure, yet in the next fight with against only two enemy the got paranoid and scared of dying. Not a big problem, but makes the image look worse.- Gameplay mechanics are sometimes inconsequental and has bugs (only one damage-over-time effect can be active, the enemy has electricity protection yet can be tranquilitized with a shocker, and theres a game crashing bug in one of the battles, so here's the solution for that: http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Gorky_17#Incubus_Boss_Crash)- For me it's a bit short. You can play through the whole game with every area explored, every enemies slain, and every item picked up under 15 hours.Overall, Gorky 17 is a fine survival TBS/point-and-click hybrid game with semi-isometric graphics in a horror-sci/fi setting. It's mixing the genres well. It has it's flaws, yes, but it makes up for it as well.And also, I warn everyone to use discretion: If the game seems a little bit outdated, old, antiquated... well, it is. This game is originally came out in 1999, as the descprition says, in an age when Pentium III/IV processors, GeForce 256 video cards,  1280x1024 monitor resolution and DVD discs were the BIG things and the WinXP was still in development.In the release year, this game was a fine product őf technology, but sadly stayed under the radar. However, up to this day this game still has a small, but sturdy fanbase, and three or four year ago there was an announcement of a sequel for this game under the name of Gorky 21. (sadly again, not much can be heard about it since then) In my opinion, if this game had the random encounter system at least, and some random-generated terrain between the key locations. it would become a classic cult game. like the original Fallout series. Well, not exactly on the same level, but close enough. All in all, I totally recommend this old, yet pretty and shiny pearl of gaming to everyone who won't turn down an old game, looks for a bit different TBS experience and likes if a game challanges them to weight and plan their every action,			"

												This is one of my favorite games :D Turn based strategy gameplay, you will need to plan ahead and think before you act to survive. You also have leveling of skills and weapons. The story is also good (sci-fi).I really recommend this for everyone who love turn based games! (and some difficulty) :D			"
