												A really original simultaneous turn-based tactics, set in a cyberworld of a distant future.Even if usually I'm not too much into this kind of games, I really enjoyed it for its simple yet complex mechanics. The rules are really basic, but since the whole game is about predicting opponent's moves, and you can never, never know for sure what another human being is thinking, and that's why it shines in multiplayer more than anything else, even though it has a lenghty and worthy campaign.Multiplayer is really versatile too, since you can just leave your turn and play another match (or even another game altogether) while you wait your opponent's; you can even set the game to send you an email when a new turn is awaiting you.Also, is worth nothing that replay of your matches are automatically saved on the servers, and you can watch even other's really easily; and there's an amazing little option that uploads your matches to your YouTube channel. Graphics are really simple, but they do their job, and the soundtrack is astonishing good.Just try the demo and complete the tutorial, you'll get an idea if this is or not a game for you, you could be surprised.

												It's a shame when people have only AAA games in their mind and ignore hidden gems such as Frozen Synapse. The game is not for anyone - that can be said about any game out there. But in this case what I mean is that unlike other games where you just rush and kill everything in sight, in Frozen Synapse you must take a slower and more tactical approach. You are in command of a squad of soldiers, each equipped with different weapons, from shotguns through sniper rifles all the way to rocket launchers. The game has a good tutorial which can make a person understand the basic and more advanced tactics - from the standard take cover tactics to the more advanced search and destroy where each member of the squad covers the blind spot of the other and thus advance in their search for the enemies. Afterwards people can chose whether they want to advance to the campaign, practice against the computer in skirmish matches or go online against other people around the world. This is a game which would be more suited to the gamers which favor brains and strategy over the standard gamers which know only how to react and rely on reflexes while gaming ... If you are of the first type - I recommend buying this, if you are from the latter one - prove us wrong, joins us and show us ! :)			"

												Frozen Synapse is phenomenal. I bought a multipack ages ago, and remember eyeing it with great interest before release. Finally got around to playing it, and being turn based, it can suck the hours away.One of the major hooks is that you can simulate the actions you think the enemy will take before you complete your turn. This allows you test a bunch of potential outcomes in advance, and it ratches the tension up tenfold.There are loads of features built into the client: a chat service (communicate with your opponents without needing Friends list functionality), piles of multiplayer modes, a built in IRC client so you can discuss strategies or find new opponents... There's play-by-email functionality, hotseat (aka pass the keyboard) multiplayer, full coop for the campaign, and I don't think I've even mentioned the DLC yet!Add all that goodness on top of one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard and a cyberpunk inflected premise and story, and you've got a winner. Immense value for the money. If you have any love for turn-based strategy, be sure to pick it up!			"

												You know what makes chess the ultimate strategy game that has lasted for thousands of years? Its simplicity. Frozen Synapse takes the turn-based strategy game genre to an extreme level of meticulousness. This is saying something in a genre that already resembles something like chess with more rules.I am a long-time fan of turn-based strategy games, with the X-Com iterations holding a special place in my heart (well just the first two and the remake actually), so I am no stranger to intricate control over characters and exhaustive planning for each turn. However, there are two questions that must be answered in the affirmative for any TBS game to be considered ""good"":First, are the controls efficient?Second, is the game fun?Unfortunately, Frozen Synapse fails on both accounts. The painstaking level of control over every minute movement of your troops is maddening and superfluous. You are the most anal-retentive military commander in all of history, and while the game provides a reasonable explanation for it, your troops are apparently mindless drones. Simply adding more controls over every little movement does not make a TBS game superior to others. Extraneous controls weaken a strategy game's enjoyability by obstructing its very purpose: strategy. Very often, you will find yourself losing rounds/games because you forgot to set a drone to look in a specific direction or to duck at the right moment, or walk quickly/slowly. Not because you didn't realize that those moves were necessary, no, because you FORGOT. There are so many options to set for each individual unit, that you can easily spend an hour just setting up a SINGLE TURN. I am not exaggerating, the multiplayer gives opponents a week to post their turn! This kind of burdening complexity removes the players ability to strategize and gives advantage to the player who is most able to memorize details. Strategy is about out-thinking your opponent's moves and countering them, or recovering from a weaker position with superior tactics, NOT micro-managing the user-interface.So is it fun? Well, Frozen Synapse insists on you monitoring every sniffle and cough your troops make, so the majority of the time playing this game is spent staring at a screen of unmoving drones and identical walls, running simulation after simulation to determine the highest likely method of success. It would be just as fun to compare tax audits to determine which IRS agent was the most efficient! Speaking of identical walls, the graphical quality of this game is terrible. I have never before claimed to need high quality graphics in a game, in fact in many ways the fight for ever greater graphics is ruining the industry, but if ever there was a game that needed better graphical design: this is it. The neon colors that honestly looked cool in the trailers and screencaps are horrendous to look at after only ten hours or so of gameplay. Every character looks the same, every wall is identical, you are a robot commander of a robot army killing other robots for no reason whatsoever. Some of the positive reviews said the game was ""easy to get into, but hard to master,"" and this is an outright lie. This game is hard to get into and hard to master. I will say it again: strategy games require simple controls so the only thing between you and victory is your tactics. Not fun.			"

												Frozen Synapse is a game where player input is taken in turns but the actual outcome is played out simultaneously.  In game matches, each player is given several soldiers and has to complete a certain objective, like getting to a certain location or killling the enemy's units.  Players then give orders to their units to try to outmaneuver their opponent.  Every plan can be tested ahead of time and will always play out the same way; there is no luck or randomness in the combat.  After both players confirm their moves, soldiers on both sides will execute their commands.  The entire game is about predicting the moves of your opponents and trying to counter them.  It also has great music and a pretty good single player campaign (although the multiplayer is much more enjoyable IMO).  I would definetely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of tactical gameplay.

												This is my favorite strategy game, probably ever. Even though I'm horrible at it and don't play enough.It's a simultaneous turn based game in which you have soldiers and give them orders for the next 5 seconds of the fight, both players input orders, and not just move and shoot, move, crouch, aim direction, target priority, target ignore/fire on sight and time based things, so you can do ""Move to this wall, take cover behind it, in 2 seconds, get up, look in front of you but do not engage anyone and crouch back down half a second later"".What you do then is try to simulate what your opponent would do, because yes, you are in control of enemy units during the planning phase so you can order them to do what you think the opponent would do, or even move the units around anywhere in the map if you have fog of war and they aren't seen.That kind of strategy is what I really enjoy, and with a large campaign and multiplayer, the game is very well done.

-Quick Review-Frozen Synapse is a turn based strategy game where you utilize several different types of units to execute a variety of commands. Combat mechanics are based on: Direction, movement, cover, and weapon speed.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  I have yet to figure out what type of creature I am… in the campaign mode, I’m under the impression that I’m an artificial intelligence named “Tactics”, whoever had the bright idea of making me an AI apparently need to be shot in the foot, because I proceeded to fail the next ten attempts at the campaign.The campaign has a total of 55 missions, this game’s appeal is in its competitive aspect, think of this game as a “modern” chess game, although the objectives can be changed from simply “capture the king” to, capture the flag, team elimination, etc.Game Play: There are five basic units in the game: Machine Gun, Shotgun, Sniper, Grenade Launcher, and Rocket Launcher. Each have different abilities, for example the shot gunner can run fast and does is the fastest at weapon draw, while the Sniper is slow to shoot, but can shoot from almost across the whole map and moves very slowly.As you get into the game the different units make more sense and you start to learn how to implement them accordingly. I practiced against the computer on campaign… which admittedly felt like bashing my face against a brick wall, but eventually strategies started to stick. Achievements: There are 16 achievements for this game, one of those achievements requires beating a player named “bin” who is apparently no longer playing… Ergo, this achievement is broken in my book. The rest of the achievements are very straight forward and require either winning a game mode, or doing something specific in the game.The two hardest achievements are probably “get to level 100” and “Beat the campaign”. Hardest might be the wrong term though, maybe “the most time consuming”? Regardless, there is a fair amount of activity in this game if you’re going after achievements.Price: Frozen Synapse commonly goes on steam sales, so that is when I would suggest purchasing the game, at the time that I’m writing this review the game is actually 88% off for the next 43 hours. At the standard price of $24.99 that’s probably too high of a price for a strategy game like Frozen Synapse for most people, you can easily pump 20-40 hours into the game… again; if you already know you like strategy games and enjoy learning new ones. Conclusion: Again to recap: the story/campaign wasn’t particularly intersecting for me, the game play is very precise (a requirement for strategy games), achievements are “meh”, the price is high unless on sale.I’ve enjoyed playing this game, I would suggest it to people who *already know* they like strategy games. When you first jump into this game it’s definitely daunting to comprehend what’s going on. The game itself tries to help with a lack luster tutorial, but in the end it doesn’t prepare you for the cruel reality of “campaign”. (Unless you happen to be a young strategic genius, who in that case, go back to your business classes and leave my review alone.) "

												Frozen Synapse is all about tactics.  There is no grand strategy here.  Just you and your (usually) outgunned squad of clones trying to take out the other guys in meticulously planned five-second turns.You are Tactics, an incorporeal AI lifeform that specializes in one thing: enemy neutralization.  You work for a rebel faction trying to topple the megacorporation that has overtaken the cyberpunk city of Markov Geist.  The “how” of that is up to the characters in the story.  You are just there to take orders and fight their battles.  In each level you will take charge of a set of nameless robots made of meat, and use them to take out the enemy squadron, defend a VIP, or inflitrate a certain room.  Each “vatform” you can control has a certain weapon, and this will define your approach.  Shotgunners move quickly and fire quicker, but they have a short range.  Keep them out of sight until the last second when moving in for the kill.  Snipers take precious seconds to line up shots, but can instantly kill a unit they see from across the map.  Rockets move aggonizingly slowly, but blowing up walls can kill anything behind them, or open up surprise sneak-attack routes for your other units.If this sounds like a lot to keep track of, it really isn’t.  Because you don’t control all of this in real time.  Instead, a level plays out as a series of five-second turns, where you are given all the time you need to plan the next five seconds.  You can even guess your enemies’ moves, and simulate the results until you’re sure you have every possible scenario covered.  The key thing to remember is that outcomes are never random.  Units behind cover will always kill those in the open.  A moving unit that has to stop and aim will always die to one standing still.  A shotgunner will always kill a sniper when he pops out around a corner in close range.  Knowing how to best situate your units to maximize your chances of winning encounters is critical to success.  Each turn is only five seconds, but you will spend minutes carefully plotting and checking angles.  Hitting that “Prime” button is so stressful, and there’s no going back once you commit.The color palette is incredibly simple: the scenery is blue, your units are green, enemies are red, and target civilans are yellow.  This is how an AI who specializes in tactical combat would see the world, and it is all you need really need.  Everything else is superflous and unnecessary to the task at hand.  The level description might be a corporate lobby, but all you see is a bunch of pillars and a few hallways.  This works incredibly well to keep you occupied and focused on the action instead of the secenery.  The only graphical flourish in the game occurs when an enemy dies.  Blood will spurt everywhere and leave a bright red pool around the body for the rest of the level.  This is handy for showing you exactly where your precious unit died, and reminding you of your mistake.The soundtrack is an electronic futuristic collection of tracks, and it is perfect music for getting lost in thought, focussing intently on your units’ every move.  The announcer calling out “Enemy Neutralized” is euphoric.  When she says “Unit Down” though, it is equally frustrating and demoralizing, because it almost always could have been prevented if you’d have throught through the situation better beforehand.Frozen Synapse is unforgiving at the best of times.  There is no difficulty setting, no way to make it easier.  Either you play by its rules and take advantage of the systems, learning to anticipate the most likely moves your opponent will make, or you will fail over and over again.  Progress through the campaign is often slow.  You’ll need razor-sharp focus to make it through even the middle levels where your units are heavily outmanned.  There are video tutorials, but nothing makes up for simply playing the game and mastering its quirks, one mistake at a time.The single-player campaign is quite long; almost 30 hours worth, and the cyberpunk story is engrossing.  Mastering these systems is difficult, yet rewarding.  Turning tactical strategy into almost a puzzle game, this is a game that has a wide range of appeal.			"

												I love it when a plan comes together, and Frozen Synapse is my favourite turn-based game.It’s similar to ground operations of X-COM, for example, but in a purer, simpler form. There’s no base management, inventory, RPG elements. All units of the same type have identical stats. And, unlike X-COM, RNG does not make much of an impact on outcomes of firefights, if any. The typical ‘chance to hit’ mechanic is replaced with ‘time to hit’. If enemy unit is in cover, your unit will need more time to hit him; if enemy units runs into your stationary unit, your unit will shoot first because he had a bonus to this timer, and the enemy had a penalty for running. Thus, if you can predict what your opponent is about to do, you can be 100% sure what will happen when they encounter one of your units. If.


This is a skill-based game. Luck doesn’t come into it.

By: Savv




The best thing about this game is the ability to plot your opponent’s expected moves and run a simulation that will show what will happen if you do this, and they do that. You can run as many iterations of this as you like before submitting a turn.  In multiplayer FS becomes a game of psychology, misdirection, bluffs and double bluffs. You have to be able to make accurate predictions, but also behave unpredictably, be stealthy, feed misleading information to your foe. And make plans that account for every eventuality.The maps are random and asymmetrical, but scoring takes this into account. Plus, you can use premade symmetrical maps or make your own. You can even play a flat version of cs_office if you’re so inclined.There’s a long single player campaign with interesting missions and a cyberpunk-themed story. You can play it in coop, too. And it’s fairly hard. Only 0.6% of players have completed the campaign according to Steam achievement stats. But  two of the missions at the end are somewhat glitchy and many people may have quit just because of these.Downsides: I’m not too fond of the graphics. 3D perspective makes it hard to see whether you have line of sight sometimes, I would prefer to have a flat 2D mode. Thankfully, there’s a line of sight tool that works like a ruler. There’s no offline chat in multiplayer, which is disappointing for a game you can play via e-mail. Red DLC adds shield units (really cool) and the ability to host co-op games and play single-player campaign with a friend, among other things. You can use the new features in multiplayer even if your opponent/partner doesn’t have the DLC. So I’d get the Complete Pack while it’s on −88% sale.Edit: Co-op turned out to be pretty buggy. The share plan function tends to glitch out a lot.

												Fun, innovative, and well-balanced. This is like a top-down hybrid of Counterstrike and Chess. Looks pretty good too, and the soundtrack fits the experience really nicely. The controls could use some streamlining, perhaps, and the game would work well with controller support. My only real criticism of the game is that some people take a really long time to make their moves, although the upside is that you can have a bunch of active games at once and jump between them as your turn comes up. Definitely recommend this one to competitive gamers and tacticians looking for a game they can pick and and put down at their leisure.			"

												This was a decent little title. It it a simultaneous turned based combat game. It's difficult but fair and there are multiple levels and challenges to go through. It can be fun, frustrating and gratifying all at the same time. It's even better multiplayer. You're going to get a bunch of slap-your-head moments and a few chuckles when you're able to spring a well-laid trap on your enemy.EXCEPT... Then they screwed around with the Steam overlay and broke the game. It couldn't be run from Steam (see the sticky on the top of their forurms). They said they would fix this ASAP and never did. They didn't even bother responding to repeated requests on a status. A year and a half later it's not fixed and they've moved on to different games. Now I have a huge problem with that - when you know about a bug I believe you have an obligation to fix it. I have 300 games in my Steam account. This is the only one that won't launch through the launcher (and remember many others have complained about this).That irks me to no end. If the dev can't be bothered to support their game, I can't be bothered to support them. Thumbs down.			"

												This game is being hit with a lot of negative reviews because they miss the point of what this game is. Some say the graphics are bad (they are perfect for this type of game imo), that the gameplay is slow (they'd say that about chess too, and this game is similar to chess in style), and that this gameplay is confusing (the game is simple but the game does start showing its age in how the controls are presented).This game is actually a fun strategy game, and you should think of it more like a carefully calculated strategy game (like chess) rather than a typical turn-based strategy game. If you go into it thinking its going to be another standard turn-based strategy game then you're expectations are wrong.			"

Some units die when they shouldn't, and some the of the calculations are off, but if you like rttbs (real-time turn based stradegy) games, this is very fun. The game itself has both people plan their turn on the movement of their army men. The turns play out in real time. So it's not one person's turn then the other, it's planning your turn without knowing what your opponent is going to do and both play out at the same time.

												I always thought I never cared for strategy games, but then I remembered most RTS games are about as strategic as dumping fire ants in a jar with a spider in it.  Frozen Synapse is a true example of raw strategy and squad based tactics with an excellent soundtrack to boot.  You and your opponent is given a handful of units and a number of turns to take each other out or complete the objective.  The strategy comes from the planning phase in which you can give detailed orders to each of your units and even give simulated orders to your opponent's units to see what the possible outcome of your actions could be before accepting your turns.  Basically, it's almost like chess with guns, allowing you to take your time and really think your actions though.  It's a very deep, strategic experience for those who would rather not abandon strategy due to the pressure of hastily building up your unit spam to be more overwhelming than your opponent's, then ♥♥♥♥♥ about the Terran being overpowered.

												I like tactics games, but didn't think I would like this game, and so passed it over when I first saw it.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  My friend gifted me his bonus copy, and I have been playing it nonstop since.  It seems like a sort of real time/turn based hybrid and can seem very intimidating at first, but at its core it really is just a turn based game that rewards careful planning.  You give your soldiers orders that they then carry out over the course of a 5 second round, and you have a chance to revise the orders each round.  The controls seem complicated when you first start as well, but they are actually both remarkably simple and surprisingly powerful - you can give incredibly intricate orders to your troops with only a few clicks and drags.  The asynchronys multiplayer lets you take pretty much all the time you need for your turn, and lets you juggle multiple games if your opponent does the same.The soundtrack is pretty killer, too.  If you're on the fence about this game and you like tactics games, you won't go wrong picking this up.			"

Brillant concepts may fall shortThe singel player campain DLC failed.(see seperate review )The match making is utterly broken. It's not fun for any part to be matched up against a player 10 or 20 levels higher.The matches become out of sync with resulting illbehaviours in game play.Some ""players"" are abusing the bugs to be on top of the leaderboard.As the game hasn't got a VAC shield on it it's ""cheat as you please"".That is not at all good in my book as its a PvP based leaderboard system.Everyone can challenge everyone so be prepared to be steam rolled.This wouldn't be a problem if:*You could cancel the challenge and not have it linger for ever.*You could see the level of the person who challenged you.I like the concept and atmosphere, you who played ""Rainbow six"" (up to Rouge spear) will see similarities with the ""planning"".All in all this game would have been brilliant.But before the things mentioned above have been fixed this review will be a ""not recommend""			"

												A precursor to the know semi-reemerging genre of top down planning and individiual strategy. With door kickers and all the others, this game well before, its take on the approach is much different than the games that have come out since, involving PVP in many different modes, and actually fantastic campaign, and enough depth to be sure that whenever you lose a guy you know it was your fault.What is it? Besides worth your time,  Synapse is what came to fruition when you take old school rainbow six on a top down format. Instead of relying on your aim, and some modest planning, it relies purely on your mind and ability to place soldiers in positions that will end in your win, or at least a stalemate.Depending on the game mode and otherwise, you typically start with 4 or 5 units, of varying classes, that all specialize in something different on one side of randomly generated maps, scattered across your designated field. You objective depending on the game mode can vary from exterminate all enemy forces while preserving as many of yours for a higher score, to securing or assasinating a hostage controlled by another human (and yes the online community is still very much alive, and with newbloods as well) to a whole sloo of other modes that I can't be bothered to describe.Gameplay is what I can generalize for you, the core mechanics revolve around a system of ""turns"". Each turn is 5 seconds long consisting of you controlling these units by telling them what to do literally down to telling them to wait in a position for 2.4 seconds, do a quick 180, move forward two inches and then set up shop for an ambush. At the beginning of every turn and until you commit the turn you can constantly reposition not only your soliders, but the enemies, in an effort to play out what you think is likely for them to do. You can run through a turn 1000 times if you want to, setting your soldiers down differently, preparing for different enemy strategies, attempting to place soliders you may have seen a few turns ago somewhere else, accounting for every single detail, until you commit, and watch how that specific turn pans out. The beauty of this lies in the execution of the UI, and controls. This game will live and die on your ability to access and utilize use these commands. And I'm only delighted to say that the devs delivered 10 fold on this area, easily one of the most accessible yet complex games I've played, and it all lies in the fact that you get to choose just how meticulous you are.  The formula for this goes only as far down the rabbit hole as you are willing to take it, choose your oppenent based on how much time you plan on putting into a specific game, you choose to utilize the controls whenever you need them or if you need them, or give rudimentary orders that still get the job done for most. To end this prematurely, I've enjoyed this game to a degree I feel I don't experience more than a few times a year, I always can come back for something fresh, something new with the generated maps, and varitions on game modes. I've been wanting to write this review for quite a while just to get out suppport for a creation that I believe goes over most of my fellow gamers heads due to the graphical quality or seemingly innaccessible concept. I cannot recommend it enough			"

												I want to start off by telling you that I am not smart enough nor do I have enough friends to play this game. Frozen Synapse is like a master-level chess game. You arrange your squad to make actions, and your opponent does the same. Then, you watch those actions play out. Things go wrong, people die, and you repeat until only one is left standing. This is a game where you get to mess with your opponent. You always have to be one step ahead of them. In theory, this is a incredibly fun idea. With the right friends, this game is a blast! But if you don't have any friends, you're stuck playing with the computer or strangers. This is like playing Team Fortress 2 by yourself. Frozen Synapse against the computer is a frustrating experience. They know where you are, and they'll remind you over and over again how computers will take over the world. Frozen Synapse would be fun if I had someone to play with. So overall, I don't recommend the game if you're a loner gamer like me.			"

												I was enjoying this game until I hit a late mission defending an elevator.  You insta-fail this mission if anyone steps inside the elevator even if they die a second later.  After doing this mission 5 times and seeing the enemy suicide rush in on one of the last few turns (15-mins of playtime) I got tired of the BS.  I'd enjoy a casual mode where I could back up or save every 3-5 turns perhaps but I don't want to replay the same mission over and over hoping I get lucky 15-minutes later.The tactics are also too detailed and could use some streamlining like snap-to-cover abilities so there wasn't so much micromanagment in moving your guys 2 inches at a time which seemed often necessary.Maybe multi-player is good but I don't have the patience.

												This game is challenging, and kind of obtuse.  It really demands that you experiment a lot with the controls, and try to plan things out well.  It's extremely easy to lose your troops, have the entire mission go pear-shaped, and have to restart it.  This can make things frustrating, especially when the game has such a completely literal interpretation of your goals.  You can be defending a particular room and be almost done, when an enemy walks in and instantly gets his face blown off by a shotgun blast.  Trouble is, he technically set foot in the room, so you have to restart.It's not like many other games, that's for sure.  Oddly enough, I'm just not sure I have the patience for it.Still a good design, though.			"

												Every turn you and your enemy program your units; tell them what to do in the next 5 seconds. You can't know what your enemy will do and what will actually happen, so you must predict. Units do the basic things, like aiming+shooting, on their own, but winners of shootouts are determined by tactical advantage.This game is unlike any other and is implemented flawlessly. The rules are quite simple, everything is up to you.I expect multiplayer to be a different kind of awesome, but I haven't tried that yet.★★★★★★★★☆☆			"

It has pretty simple and good mechanics though you'll have to play a bit to start understand and use some deep moves. However, game is quite friendly to new players, tutorial and a few singleplayer missions will be enough for you to start playing multiplayer which is where real fun is.So, if you enjoy tactical games you will definitely enjoy this one.

												Do you like tactical games? Frozen Synapse is a great real-time simultaneous turns squad-based game. Confused? Don't be. Let me explain: You have two players, each with a team of soldiers. Each player picks his soldiers' moves secretly. When they're both ready, they submit their moves and they are played out simultaneously. It's really nothing like anything I've ever played. It's great, refreshing, brain-twisting gameplay and that's the stuff that actually matters in games, trust me. There are a few problems which should not go without mention though: First, there's no support for more than two players. So you can't play co-op against the computer and you can't team up with others. Second, the gameplay feels a little barren, sometimes, the gameplay elements are too few. You could use this same argument against chess of course, so I'm not sure how valid it is. Overall, it's a unique game that plays well so it's all good in my book.			"

												This game is quite excellent, especially when played against another human being. You have a squad of soldiers for which you create a more or less detailed battle plan, which they then execute for five seconds at a time. The plan of the other squad is executed simultaneously, and if you guessed correctly what your enemy was going to do, you'll see your soldiers shoot the enemies down. The turn-based mechanics and the need for anticipation of enemy moves actually kind of remind me of chess. The game features several game modes and a ""dark"" and ""light"" variant of each. In the dark versions you only see the enemies that your soldiers would really see, whereas in the light versions you will always see all the soldiers on the map. In the multiplayer mode you can play, for example, just one turn a day and plan each turn for half an hour, or you can finish a game in half an hour if your opponent happens to be online simultaneously. There's also a nice single player campaign.			"

In other words, you don't react to someone's turn, you guess what will the do next. This changes the whole mechanic of turn-by-turn strategy games, offering something new, fresh that guarantees an enjoyable, fun and rewarding experience throught.

I could live with that, but combined with that, there is a certain....""vagueness"" with moving and planning, where you might have been off by a few pixels in clicking that will make or break the results. Granted, nothing is ever certain in combat, but isn't that the point if you are painstakingly moving your units and guessing what the opponent will do? I also found the command system cumbersome and slightly unintuitive, but that may be an unavoidable hurdle given the subject.I wouldn't recommend it unless you know without doubt that you'll love it.

												Have you ever wanted to play a game where your tactical thinking was rewarded without having too much hassle or any difficult  mechanics to grasp? Yes? Then this is the game for you.Frozen Synapse is an absolute wonderful tactical battlefield commander game. You are able to control several of your soldiers on a randomly generated map against either a human or AI player and lead them, showing whether they should duck or stand up, engage or continue on sight, time their actions, etc., all in hopes to out-think your opponent and guess what they will do. You are given planning phases which, although they may be lengthy, give you the chance to test every possible scenerio to your liking, giving you the ultimate think session of your life every turn.Frozen Synapse also has great co-op in it's expansion pack, which gives you the same tactical fun with a friend. I highly recommend you get it - it's called Red Mode, or something like that. Another great feature this game has is the ability to play multiple games at a time. You get popup invites from other people, which you can either accept or deny, into their games, which allows you to play however many games you want to play over any period of time you like, which leads to the bad parts  about this game.I'm not going to lie, this game isn't perfect. There's no punishing system for abandoning games, which happens a little too often with bad mannered players who don't want to finish a losing game. Not only that, but It does have two or more glitches (you can plan to move your soldier through a wall, but the game says that you can't do that, and an extra move when trying to walk beside a wall, really nothing that major or game-breaking) which can annoy you a little, but it won't consistantly happen to you. My final verdict for Frozen Synapse is this - if you are a fan of thinking games, especially chess, GET THIS GAME IMMEDIATELY. If you are not, wait for a sale, because you very well might enjoy this game for it's easy-to-understand, but hard-to-master mechanics. A solid NINE out of TEN from me on this wonderful game.			"

The game is fun but it still has its problems, I find the controls hard to use and over complicated.

I have to say this was a great purchase, especially when it gives you a free copy to give to one of your steam friends. You will always have one other person to play with at the least.			"

												Frozen Synapse is one of those games that looks to be terribly simple... But is much more complex than meets the eye. Think of it as playing ""toy soldiers"", albeit with realistic line of sight and reaction times, and different weapons, with a fancy cyberpunkish story. It's turn-based so you have plenty of time to plan your moves, like move, run, kneel, aim at, and so on. Once you commit, you'll likely curse as yourself for moving the wrong way, or pat yourself in the back for having anticipated your opponent and set a trap for him. You start with just rifleman and shotgunner, but later you get snipers, RPGer, grenadier, and more. And of course, your objectives will vary, from search and destroy, to survival, to escort, and much more. Some will even have turn limits, while others would be sensor dark (i.e. only enemies within line-of-sight can be seen). While the single player campaigns are good, the heart of the game is in the multiplayer and the online matchmaking system. Play against others, get ranked, and much more. Not for twitch gamers, but if you relish some tactical combat where planning the right move is more satisfying than making the right shot, then this is your game.			"

												Good old fashioned turnbased tactical action. Against people or AI, paint the map with your enemies and never play the same game twice, unless you want to. Plan, feint, preview, adapt, adjust, fine tune, counter and commit. You'll do all of this every turn and after your opponent does the same you'll watch your finely laided plans laid to waste, unexpected victories snatched from the jaws of defeat and oh so many faceless, nameless grunts biting the dust. Best of all, any humiliation you suffer on your opponent can be watched by the world, via youtube. This is a game of intellect, subterfuge and boldness, played over minutes, hours, days or more, but lasting only seconds. Do you have what it takes to triumph to victory?			"

												This is a difficult recommendation to write, because I really enjoy this game, but have a friend who is rather indifferent to it, and finds it hard to learn.On the point of education, I found it straightforward to learn with the tutorials and intuitive controls, but multiplayer has a good way of showing you how little you really know about strategy. I have to think though that you have to like turn based strategy enough to *want* to learn.Assuming you 'buy in' on the turn based strategy bit, I think Frozen Synapse is great because it condenses a lot of action into these fixed moments of time, so you are forced to make the most out of every microsecond. Your opponents decions are unknown to you, and while you can run through all the possibilities of their response, you're eventually going to have to commit to a course of action, or die with mediocraty.There are few games that really seem to distill a genre down to its pure essence, but Frozen Synapse does the trick. On top of it, the one technical problem I had was answered promptly and by a team that clearly loves and takes pride in their game. Personally, I offer it an enthusiastic recommendation, but possibly contingent on someone having at least some interest in turn based strategy.			"

												According to Steam, I played this game for 300+ hours (and that does not account for all the time I played it on a tablet...). I was – very briefly – even at the global top rank. So obviously I kinda like it. Yes, it has a very simple graphics. Yes, there are some more or less annoying bugs. Yes, the controls may be more intuitive. ...But at its heart, its one of the greatest strategy games I've ever played. I enjoyed the single player, but be warned: if you're not into reading quite a lot of text, it's probably not for you. Anyways, its true charm comes from playing 1vs1 against other (human) players. It has a unique mix of pure strategic skill, psychology, and (some) luck. The more you play against top tier players, the more psychology enters the game, and that's something I found very thrilling (leaving me to think up to 40 or 50 minutes on a single turn). Being able to play at your own pace, using any device (PC, Mac, Tablet) is realy great.So if you like strategy games, don't mind a relatively simple UI/graphics, and enjoy trying to find the perfect move against your opponent: give this game a try.

												Frozen Synapse triggers the same tactical parts of the brain as Chess.  You have to see your moves and your enemy's moves well in advance.  Then, take into account weapon type, enemy focus, and missions and you have yourself a game well worth the price.  Beyond that, the base game comes with two copies -- one for you and one for a friend.  Combine that with the DLC (or get the complete pack) and you and a buddy have a solid weekend of entertainment with more down the line.I do want to note, however, that online play often suffers during times of Steam sales because the servers just can't handle the new traffic.  Luckily, you can still play offline.  The traffic issue sorts itself out in a day or two.			"

The number of unique moves in this game by far outnumbers the moves possible in chess. There is no way two matches in this game is ever going to look the same, you need to consider your every little move you do.Combined with a very nice soundtrack that almost perfectly sets the mood of the game i simply say this:This is one of the best indie games ever made, buy it!.

												Let's begin with stating that this is probably the best tactics game I have played. Combat is turn based, with each turn split into two parts. First you plan your actions, issuing detailed commands to your troops (look in this direction, wait 0.3 seconds, then lower your weapon, ignore everyone and make a run across the room. Once through the door raise your weapon, keep your eyes in that direction and back up against that corner). You can preview the results of your commands as many times as you like, adjusting them until you are happy. Once done, you hit the prime button and the actual action takes place in real time. You watch as your troops act as you commanded and see what the opponent had planned - and as they say: no plan survives confrontation with the enemy.What the game really comes down to is trying to predict what your opponent will do and how to best counter those actions while trying to achieve your objective, And most importantly: the AI is not dumb.

												This is probably the ideal game for those who always fostered the intention of 'getting into chess', but never found the hundreds of hours needed to play it at a proper level.If you've instead put hundreds or thousands of hours into FPS games over the years, Frozen Synapse is one alternative. Stick your brain on tilt and imagine any shooter battlefield from a birds-eye perspective, albiet one with a sparse retro-styled arena. The game's still the same, shoot the other dudes before they shoot you, but skill is irrelevant and here only the best strategy will win out. Knowing where to move and predicting your opponents intentions, just as you would in any FPS, will lead you to victory.The best thing about the game is realising that all these past experiences are immediately transferable, and finding that the interface is razor sharp, intuitive and allows you to devise tactics in exacting detail each turn.Just remember to slice that pie.

												Frozen Synapse is a true tactical masterpiece, albiet one that suffers from an overuse of randomness. Frozen Synapse offers a modern take on chess (in a sense), and simple yet complex mechanics. The campaign is a well scripted, addictive and interesting experience, but what shines the most is the extremely intuitive online play. Each online match is played in steps: The planning phase, and the action phase, and with the proper player - you could play a step a day, as you can pick up said match over the course of a week, rather then log in, play, quit - lose the game, etc. Unfortunately, online is relatively dead, although you can always find the rare match to test your skill. The visuals are mediocre, but fitting for the type of game it is. The OST is absolutely fantastic, and is well worth the purchase! Frozen Synapse is well worth your time and money, especially for fans of tactical turn based isometric games.			"

												Frozen Synapse is a turn-based overhead urban-combat strategy game, where you input a chain of commands to coordinate your military squad each turn.  The visuals have a cool VR aesthetic and the game uses impressive procedurally-generated maps.  There are no lifebars and no damage in Frozen Synapse, only alive and dead.  The battle system is deterministic and skill-based, movement speed and a couple other factors deciding which player makes the faster killshot.  The rules behind the killshot timer are simple, but the game never details its combat mechanics (the tutorial is a brief how-to), so new players should read the wiki to gain a better understanding.I barely played the single-player campaign as this game is all about multiplayer.  There are a number of different game modes, including a football analog where you bid on how far your squad can gain a foothold, and a mode where your team must capture and return more resources than the opposing force.My favorite by far is Secure mode.  Each player proposes a defensive zone, and then the player proposing the largest area defends it from the other player's attack.  Secure is such an elegant blend of strategy, risk and objective it almost deserves its own game.  The procedural setup leads to wildly different plans.			"

												This game is awesome. The asyncronous multiplayer lets you play a game (or games) over time, taking a turn when you've got the chance, rather than needing to commit a whole playthrough. Of course it's likely that you'll get sucked in and just keep going. Really good stuff. I haven't even tried all the various modes because i enjoy Dark Extermination (kill the other team, and only see their starting position and when you have line of sight with them). It's got a single player campaign also, that is solid and challenging. I haven't gotten all the way through it, but I enjoyed what I played. I started with the single player to get up to speed, but spend most of my playtime in vs. MP against friends. It does have a match-making system so you can quickly play games with anyone, but it's easy to opt out or in. the asyncronous element means you can also play multiple games at once, hopping between them. a lot of fun. give it a shot.

Games are asynchronous and played over multiple days in which each player submits their turn at their leisure, and you're free to have many ongoing games at once - meaning that you're always able to do something while playing.It's essentially chess with guns.

												Great strategy game. Turns take place at the same time, when both players lock in you view the result, so it is all about predicting your enemy. It looks simple, but is actually a lot like Chess with the results of each encounter being predictable(in a good way, this is a strategy game not luck). The music is good and the ability to control your units very precisely make this worth a try at least. Also, you can play games a turn at a time, leaving the game and joining again when you are notified via email or Steam Notifications that the other player finished their turn, which can allow you to play in whatever spare time you have.

												In the film ""Groundhog Day"" some guy (Bill Murray) is suddenly blessed & cursed with repeating the same 1-day time period over and over again, indefinitely. In the crushing desolation of this acute & inescapable repetition, he’s forced to confront the erstwhile emptiness of his life and worse neither reckless abandon nor self-destruction seem to succor his temporal malady. However, the dissolution of normal human failure states as a direct result of his strange curse unexpectedly creates the metaphysical space in which he has the power to exorcise his personal demons and commit fully to growing into his full spiritual potential. Embarking on a quest to enrich the existence of other human beings ultimately gives his own existence the meaning it had lacked, and thus he finally indirectly achieves the salvation & the girl he's been after.This is sorta like the videogame version of that. With clone soldiers and cyberpunk drivel. And more shooting. And less Bill Murray.Spoiler: (And at the end, you Murray yourself instead of the girl.) "

												After months of hype in the gaming press, Frozen Synapse is finally available. Frozen Synapse is a game that offers two very different experiences. The solo game is mechanical, like a puzzle game. There is generally one ""correct"" solution; you just have to work a bit to find it. However, the multiplayer game is very fluid and tactical, and plays a bit like a chess match. To succeed, you have to be able to see the game from your opponent's view as well as your own. I didn't enjoy the solo game much. After about an hour of tutorial and early single-player, I hit a mission that I found extremely distasteful - hunting down and executing unarmed civilian scientists. It was jarring, and turned me off. The methodical nature of solo puzzle solving wasn't as fun as the multiplayer experience, which I found thrilling. Best to start multiplayer by playing with a friend; the online commnity is very skilled.But I like the mehanics of the game; The controls for maneuvering your squad are powerful and easy enough to use, after a bit of experiementation. If you struggle with the tutorials, there are videos on Youtube that I found to be more helpful.I can't review Frozen Synapse without mentioning the inventive marketing. If you buy this game, you automatically get a gift copy to give to a friend. What a clever way to get you in to the best part of Frozen Synapse - the multiplayer mode. I wish more publishers offered this sales model.			"

												Hello community of Frozen Synapse, It's me Adrian Jenkins.and here is my opinion of the game:Frozen Synapse is a turn based stratergy game based on entirely skill with 6 different classes and about 3 different game modes and the abitlty to change the color of your team and the enemy team. I highly recommend this game to anyone who thinks there isn't a hard stratergy out there anymore.Firstly, This game is just awesome and I do agree with some of my friends that this game it is hard for new players. I enjoy this game although I haven't tried Multiplayer mode I heard its balanced but I don't know how it works so I can't really talk about it expect it requires a lot of stratergy.Secondly, There are 5(6) different classes now I put (6) in because there is a hidden class:- Machine Gunner. (Rapid fire - Multi burst fire)- Shotgun. (V shaped attack cone - Medium fire rate - Short range.)- Sniper Rifle. (1.75-2 second aim time - Long range)- Rocket Launcher. (Large AoE hit radius - Can blow walls and windows up - Infinite range - try not to shoot while crouched and behind a window)- Granades. (Medium range - 1 shot per round)- Finally the hidden class of Riot Shield.(to access this class you get 1 per granader you own.(I think that's how it works) (Stops any non explosive bullets as long as he is set up and facing the fire - Has no weapondary).Gameplay:This game has a couple of different game modes such as:- Elimination (Kill all enemies and win)- Protect an area (Normally you have to protect an area for about 6-7 turns and you win)- Extraction (An AI moves towards the exit zone with 2 useless guards and you win.)All game modes have a turn based time limit of 1-50 turns.- Normally quick games.

												Pros:+Distinct cyberspace artstyle+Futuristic soundtrack+Interesting mechanic where you can predict the enemy's actions and are shown the results based on your actionsCons:-After a few hours, everything starts to look the same--Apart from the few basic classes, there's not much variety. Because of this, it quickly starts to feel repetitive-Dull campaign: I don't remember a single word of the story, even though I played it about half-way through. Better stick with the Versus modeIf you want a futuristic turn-based strategy game, go for XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Once you've put many hours into that and still crave more, Frozen Synapse might be worth a second look.			"

												I wanted to like this game. I bought the DLC for this game. The concept for this game is great and the writing is trash but I don't care. I made several false starts at learning this game, and I'm pretty sure I finally did, but the single player has an escort mission that involves an unrealistically bad area defense against way too many opponents, and it's like the third mission. It involves specialized units, which kill the game. Shotguns can't engage anything beyond about 20 feet even if you order them to. They don't miss, they just don't fire. At the same time, an enemy shotgun on the run will beat a readied assault rifle at close range, which basically means that by the rules I can't defend with the units the scenario gave me. There are no difficulty levels to adjust this.BUY the soundtrack and not this game. You probably got it as part of a humble bundle, which is maybe what it deserved.UPDATE: This game is addictive, though. While I was writing the review, I thought, oh, but what if I move my shotguns into base to fight the enemy shotguns and use my rifle to cover my flank? That shouldn't work, because of how far away they start my shotgun unit, but it's worth trying! And it turns out that no, an unready AI shotgun beats an already-aimed player shotgun.			"

												okay, to start off, if you do not like strategy games, or games that take a lot of prediction, this isnt the game for you. this game takes so much prediction and strategy, one time my head actually started to hurt. besides for strategy, this is a turn-based game, which means that you can set up a notification to say when it is yur turn for a match. this also means you can close the game while you are waiting and still have the match going, the notification lets you launch the game from the message you recieve at the top right corner of your steam page. this game suprisingly has great graphics if you zoom in on a character by scrolling ""up"" on your mouse wheel, and scrolling ""down"" will zoom you out. the default range for the camera is probably the best because it lets you see almost the entire map but not going to far out with the zoom. now, map set-up's. the map set-ups on this game are fantstic for a tactical game like this, you will notice there are light blue parts on the walls, those are walls that you are able to penetrate to set up ambushes on the opposing player. as well as that, you must out think your opponents before they out think you. great game to learn from your mistakes and teaches players that just because they can do something, doesnt mean they are good. this game also keeps track of your wins and loses it also applies an appropriate rank to you if you open your profile.

												Gamers who demand verisimilitude and attention to detail in their flight simulators will be thrilled with Frozen Synapse. It's not a flight simulator, of course, but it's stupendous and everyone will love it, unless you're red/green colorblind, in which case all the little men will look the same until you stumble desparately into the menu and fiddle with the colors. And even then, the zones on the edges will still be incomprehensible. So, good luck with that.In any case, Frozen Synapse is like what you'd get if Neal Stephenson changed his named to William Gibson, drank cough syrup, watched Tron five times back to back, then tried to recreate Laser Squad Nemesis from memory. The only difference is that Frozen Synapse, unlike Neal Stephenson, knows the value of brevity.I give this 17 out of 17 Melted Neurons.			"

												Probably the best turn based, PvP, tactical sim out there.Instead of like X-Com, where enemies can react during your turn, both turns are commited, and when both players are finished, you can see how your choices played out.Did you clear the room with a machinegunner like you thought, or did the enemy rocket launcher blow a hole in the wall and allow their shotgun to take you out first?With a great single player, endless RNG maps, quick games, and a stable player base, you can easily spend many hours with this.The only gripe I have is players who never come back to a game in progress, but oh well.

												Ima write a review for this ♥♥♥♥♥ because none of my friends are MANLY enough to try it (not that a review will change anything). Frozen Synapse is a lot of things, but first and foremost is it's a turn based simulation game where you plot out your turn against an enemy who does the same, and the game runs the scenario each turn. That in itself opens up a broad range of gameplay opportunities which Frozen Synapse utilizes but sometimes not to their full potential. The tutorial covers is very comprehensive though you'll find there's a lot to remember and you might have to go back to it to brush up your skillz. The game has a story but honestly it might as well not have one just as easily, though it does have a cool premise so why not. All in all I think this games pretty fun and if it's ever below 10 bucks git it!			"

												A great strategy combat simulation game, that REALLY requires you to think hard and to the end! While it's background and visuals aren't multi-coloured, it all makes up for the complex controls with a astonishingly wide variety of commands for your units to execute. The learning process might be a tad bit long for those unfamiliar with the strategy genre, but with a lot of time and effort, giving commands should become second nature to you. This isn't one of those strategy games you have played recently, like LoL, Dota or anything: Frozen Synapse really challenges you to think and plan every move, with no time constrains or pressure dropping all over your shoulders! The gameplay is divided by two phases, one of which is the ""Planning Phase"", where the game is temporarily stopped for you to think your plans while the second phase, the ""Outcome"" shows the consequences of your plans made to your units, as well as your enemy unit's moves. Those looking for a hefty, strategic challenge should seek this game! I highly recommend it, even if I suck at this game myself... :P			"

												This is without doubt my favourite game of all time. Totally original concept at the time of its release (as far as I know). I can't see anything ever surpassing it apart from possibly the upcoming FS2. I've played it for years offline so please ignore my steam hours.It's like a cross between chess and poker. There is no luck involved whatsoever and it's all about predicting your opponent's moves. The game is easy for a beginner to pick up but it takes time to become a master. The best thing I like about it is because it's turn-based you can take as long as you like over your moves so a) you have no excuse if it goes wrong, anb b) you get a good dose of satisfaction/adrenalin when it goes right. Many a fist-pump has ensued!			"

												I tend to enjoy turn based strategy games. However, in this case I really couldn't care how good the game is because the experience of trying to get to the game stage was so unpleseant that it ruid the entire experience for me.Plus did I mention that I couldn't create a coop game? The first feature advertised on the sales screen. The option to create a coop game didn't even exist in the menu system. Friend had the option (and other options that I didn't, still don't know why) but when tried it gave the error ""You must have the expansion activated on the server to use this option.""On top of that:* Tutorial was painful and at times insulting. They were going for sarcastic AI insulting the player for being bad at the game but the humor really didn't play that well.* They made me create an account specifically for the game. I don't want any more logins or accounts, please just let me authenticate through Steam.* VS mode was extremely unbalanced. Would start frequently one player is a very disadvantageous position.Would love to see more turn based strategy games get a foothold in the market. But first they need to get the easy stuff right. You shouldn't loose a customer becuase your menu system stopped them from playing your game.			"

												Gameplay gets repetitive and boring very quickly. In between the missions you get some text ""cut scenes"" and then it feels like you play the first mission again with slightly randomized maps and objectives (kill all enemies, kill all scientists, escort someone).The ""loading time"" between turns is a real downer and immersion killer, no matter if the AI calculation is so complex or whatever. But seeing a loading screen for like 10+ seconds if the actual turn then takes only 5 seconds or so, is a no-go.Also for me, the all blue-themed maps became annyoing pretty quickly.			"

												The single player has an incredible story, filled with a unique world and interesting characters.  The gameplay is quite unique, as you and your opponent input your commands at the same time to guide actions within 5 second increments.  The interface however is clunky, and the multiplayer has a severe slippery slope effect in many modes, where losing even one unit can put you in too far a disadvantage to make a comeback.The Red expansion adds more single player missions, a new unit type, more multiplayer modes, and most importantly allows you to play through the single-player campaign cooperatively.This is a great game for the campaign (through singleplayer or coop), but fails as a reasonable multiplayer experience.

												Remember in the original Rainbow Six when you planned out your strategy with that crude map, setting waypoints, rushing through doorways with shotguns?  Then you could execute your plans while watching the map or, if you made a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ plan, you could gung-ho it by taking control of a character, trying to play it as a first-person shooter, which eventually devolved into getting your whole team killed?  Then you realize that if you just would have made a good plan to start with, your team actually isn't that bad?  You are rewarded for being smart instead of a FPS retard.  That whole map part is basically this game.			"

												I was going to make a positive and negative list of this game but frankly I cannot think of many bad things to say about it so I'll just make a list of points why I recomend it:- You can run it in almost any device, including laptos and tablets.- regular matches (minus waiting time) are very quick plus you can stop and resume playing at any time.- you can just play one game at a time or you can open many multiplayer games at the same time and just play your turn in the ones that are ready.- because of the 2 previously mentioned points it is perfect either for a dedicated session or just for a quick play during a break, while commuting or when the boss is not looking.- because the turns are executed simultaneously and calculated in the server there is no randomness or unfair advantages like in some games where players take alternate turns.- Variety and options for custom matches look sufficient to me.- the music is excellent.- probably the best tactical only game out there. some have tried to copy it but this one is still the best.- Frozen Synapse may scare new players with it's unattractive main menus and apparent complexity, however in my opinion it is a very simple game to play. You don't have to check stats, keep track of resources, memorise maps or abilities. Just give orders, press a key to simulate the results of those orders and once you're happy commit your turn.- Regarding the price after all this time it still looks high however it is not very uncommon to find this game discounted somewhere or as part of a bundle. Still for the hours I've spent on in I'd gladly pay full price, especially considering I've paid > £40 for many AAA games so boring and generic that I couldn't spend more than 15 minutes in them.

												Frozen Synapse is an unforgiving turn-based strategic experience. Every turn, you must plan your moves or face almost certain death at the hands of your enemies. Story missions hand you control of a small present squad. Every member of the squad can die from a single hit. Units are differentiated by the weapons they carry: shotguns, assualt rifles, sniper rifles, or rocket launchers. Shotguns dominate close-range, sniper-rifles dominate long range, and assualt rifles are useful at any range but will lose if too far from a sniper or too close to a shotgunner. Rocket-launchers will blow away walls and enemies, but must be set up in the right direction.As in Chess, the simplistic nature underlying the game leads to surprising complexity in motion. Every turn, you must try and forsee what your opponent will do. Once you've planned your moves to the best of your ability, you submit your choices and wait for the game to work everything out. Waiting is the only downside to this game, as you will be forced to wait for surprisingly lengthy periods while everything gets worked out, and it can be frustrating to wait so long only to see all your units die at the start of the next turn. Nevertheless, the feeling of gratification when things go right is worth the experience. I highly recommend this game.Gameplay:

												Chess gone cyberpunk. This is some of the advancements I've been looking for in a simultaneous turn-based game. It's also just too damn kool that you can wait for players to make their moves while it isn't even running on your end. As of right now the game DOES has some bugs & command clutter that needs to be worked out (that won't ever be worked out so).I'm looking forward to their upcoming projects.6 out of 10 "

												A change of pace that makes you use that mouldy spongy thing inbetween your ears.Like playing a game of chess where both players move simultaneously, and move all their pieces at once... You can also fine tune the actions of each piece every time you make a move, as well as trying to predict your oponents moves...Brilliant in it's execution, but will your plans be?			"

												Excellent game, though it's biggest drawback is a less than perfect explanation of the combat mechanics. The game can feel very frustrating and random unless you learn a bit more about how the battle outcomes are decided -- there are no random elements at all -- and once they become clear, you can really sink your teeth into it.Good points: A real sense of accomplishment when you predict the enemy's movements and squad wipe them with a shotgunner. Music. Multiplayer is fun and can be played asynchronously over many days. Missions constantly introduce new objectives, and the last few missions are remarkable! Though the levels are similar, it maintains the feeling of experiencing something new each level, whether that be through new weapons, unique unit matchups, or clever objecties.Bad points: A few missions stick out as being really surprisingly hard. The story was like a series of blog posts from Tycho of penny-arcade. Well written, but too vague at points to be coherent.			"

												Keeping it short:The gameplay is incredibly solid and the music is super nice. However, the game seems to go on for way to long as I found myself just wondering if X stage was the end when it still wasn't, even after I played it for so ♥♥♥♥ing long.The campaign is ok, but I really couldn't care too much about any of the character's motivations. Some stages tried shaking up things a bit, but in the end it's all much of the same and the stages start getting really boring to play through when you've seen the same objectives being used over and over.However, for the gameplay alone, the game is worth a play. Really deep levels of strategy can be used, which just make you feel like you're in full control.			"

												It's a quite interesting strategy game, rather complex and with lots of stuff to learn and memorize before you're able to win. I would go on writing a long review about this game, but there's a problem.....This game is pretty much dead. I tried playing for a few days in a row, and I'm lucky if I get 1 or 2 matches before all activity ceases. Why? It's not even a bad game. The best part of this game is the multiplayer in my opinion, and with a dead multiplayer game, this will only entertain you for a few hours at most. I wish I could give this game a neutral review.

What I liked: Tactical gamplay mixed with guesswork of how the enemy will play You and enemy playout at the same timeWhat You Need to Know: The games story isn't a big selling point, so don't expect much and just skip it You can plan your moves and the enemies moves that might happen and try your best to guess it and counter it or negate it as much as possible There is no progression like in other games of similar style like DoorKickers( which is better in my opinion) Between each move which is 5 secs of game time, it loads it, which can take longer than the moves to happen :O This is really odd, but not ruining the game experience completely What does it that fact that planing your guys moves and guessing the moves of your enemy takes so much time and the controls are not very quick to make plans,waypoints will screw you up unless you manually place them yourself, changing between crouching, aiming, and stoping anywhere in the middle of a guys movement can get hard to keep track ofwhat they are doing later, when you have lots of moves to do and want very precise control of your guys Looking forward to the sequel though, as it looks to be fixing all the problems, if not there is the sequel to Doorkicker( Seriously it's that good, I'm not being a hater of this game)My Score:CPrice:$7Main reason for dislike: TediousGames similar that might be better:  Doorkickers( Just plain better in every way) Frozen 2( Might be) Invisible, Inc.

												I am amazed how this has any good reviews.The standard product is buying the game twice, so you can give it to a friend. Really it looks like it's trying to justify charging 23 bucks for a single sale.Aside from all other critical thoughts I also had the displeasure of graphical and gameplay bugs in the first 2 hours of simple campaign play.The game is paradoxical in almost every aspect:It is a turn based game, yet ultimately actions are done timebased.It puts very little effort in the story telling,yet it drowns the player in expositional dossiers, conversations and monologues. Luckily you can skip them all.You need to micromanage and possibly run simulations of every nanosecond,yet the choices you can make are very simple and gameplay lacks any depth.Machine gunners are the ""bread and butter"" unit you control very precisely,yet their aim is so horrendous that engagements outside of shotgun range feel completely luckbased.Waist high objects give cover, yet standing on the corner of a wall does not give sideways cover.Standing behind waist-high cover is an advantage, yet ducking(so you fit below waist-high cover) has no effect aside from hiding behind cover.I mentioned gameplay lacking depth, let me go into more detail on that.Your mindless drones have no inventory and never need to reload. You can not change weaponry, the drones you use or how they are distributed on the map at the start of a singleplayer mission.The options available are wait, move, aim, duck, ignore all enemies, ignore a specific enemy and prioritze a specific enemy and reversals of these commands.That's it. If your guys are in♥♥♥♥♥♥positions, your enemy has to make a mistake. Your drones can not have more than object in their hands. So unless that object is a grenade thrower or rocket launcher, the only feasible ""strategies"" are 1. to be in a good position and aim, motionless, at the correct angle.2. move, preferrably without line of sight, to a better position and do 1.3. exploit positioning mistakes of the stupid AI and shoot them in the back. If even possible. If not possible, do 1.If a drone is standing still and an opposed drone comes around the corner, both having the same weapon, equal cover and given all appropriate commands(aim at that direction, focus specific enemy), then the drone that stood still will always win.There is no time to outmaneuver the enemy drone with your own drone in a single turn, either. Rewarding inaction with 100% chance to win an encounter is atrocious game design.The graphical bug I encountered seceral times was hatched green neon lines connecting my selected units with my other units for no apparent reasonThe gameplay bug I encountered after a particularly long processing time for the first turn, including 2 prompts to kill the program, because it didnt respond.It changed a unit of mine from a sniper to a machine gunner. While no other downsides, it was an annoyance.The music was nice, I guess.In summary, a shallow and unresponsive tactical game that requires huge amounts of micromanaging miniscule movements.It feels like playing counterstrike without grenades from the top down perspective, which is entirely the wrong perspective for that kind of gameplay and also lacks grenades.Would not recommend.

												The concept of Frozen Synapse is pretty solid, but the gameplay has too many problems to be an enjoyable experience. The map and unit placements are randomly generated, and much like Solitare, the deck is often stacked against you in such a manner as to make it impossible to win no matter what you do. Losing units at the start of the first turn before they are able to act is commonplace. Furthermore, the units themselves often inexplicably fail to do what they are ordered. Rockets and grenades are often launched at trajectories different from what was input, while some units simply don't engage an enemy directly in front of them (and yes, ""Engage on Sight"" was selected). I have also had instances where a unit glitched against a wall and became stuck in place as cannon fodder. The tutorial was largely useless; I learned more through trial and error in a few randomly-generated skirmishes.All-in-all, I really want to like Frozen Synapse, but the frustration from bad spawns and glitches outweighs any enjoyment in the end.

												This game is a gem! I have owned it for about eight months or so, and logging on and starting a bunch of games and keeping up with them over time is a joy. This game challenges the turn-based strategy caveat in regards to multiplayer which is simply the fact that turns take a long time to plan and execute. Players and their opponents take their turns simultaneously, once the 'planning phase' has been finished by both players. Then, the outcome is played, and further turns are played as necessary. Fortunately, with so many games on the run, you are always in some kind of action. By the time you've finished your seventh new game, your very first opponent has probably submitted his turn, and switching between these games is easy, albeit nowhere near seamless... there are short loading sequences. Endless strategy fun!Also, Frozen Synapse isn't exactly the prettiest game ever. But the music is pretty fantastic!			"

												From those that played Breach and Clear, this game is a bit more immersive than that game, which requires more tatics and strategy, Those that never played Breach and Clear or any games similar to it, this game is quite complicated when you first started to play. Then it gets easier as you play. Multiplayer is what makes this game fun, the campaign in the game is just a bit dull because the dialog of the game is just wierd and confusing. 8/10, i wouldn't say this game is great, but gets boring after beating the campaign since there is almost hardly any one play multiplayer.

												Interesting concept, but not particularly well-executed, which often causes frustration. I would very much like to see a game of this type with a significant amount of polish. Would definitely love to play *that* game.This game is worth checking out, but the various little fruatrations quickly outweigh any joy the innovative system might give you.			"

												This is a reasonably fun game if you got it in a humble bundle as I did. For the price though it could really use a lot more customization. From an old school programmers point of view, this game combined with something really simple like Infested Planet would be a smash hit the likes of which no one could resist. Maybe the developers will take that into consideration? We can only hope.			"

												I was fairly disappointed in this title.  I watched YouTube videos and read lots of reviews and was painted a different picture of the game than what I actually ended up with.  It was constantly called a ""top-down Counter-Strike"" but it was more like those Rainbow Six games-top-down.  The tutorial doesn't do a great job of familiarizing the player with all of the game's features, which I think takes away from the long term success of this title as a multiplayer game.  After spending so much time working out the perfect plan to own your adversary and watching it play out in a matter of seconds then seeing that plan fall apart before those seconds are even over I didn't have much motivation to experiment.The multiplayer part of the game can be played somewhat at your leisure by opting to receive e-mail notifications when the enemy has taken their turn, but it's far from an exciting game that will keep you engaged.  I found it to be more fun in short bursts.			"

												A very dull game where you command different colored hologram dudes to kill eachother. I'm really not seeing the ""tactical"" part of this game. In the campaign you can see the positions of every enemy at all times and they can see you. I'm not sure how that allows for any type of tactics or strategy. You have to tell each unit EVERY SINGLE TINY THING that they must do or else they will just end up getting killed trying to do a simple thing. Even with only 2 or 3 units this ends up taking a ridiculously LONG amount of time which is no fun at all. Then you can click next turn and watch how your perfect plan ends up getting ruined when the enemy ends up moving all their units. The devs should have just made up their mind and made this game either a straight up RTS or a TBS, not tried to combine both.			"

												I gave this game a chance on a free-play weekend, as I normally enjoy turn-based games, but this asynchronous turn making simply doesn't work for me. To be fair, I only tried the campaign (ignore the completely confusing story) but I imagine this gets much more worse when playing against humans: you plan your move, coordinate your people, only to see them obliterated in the outcome phase because the AI did something completely different than you expected. I think the game would be much more accessible if you would get a hint or trajectory of what enemy characters are probably doing. Overall, the combat system suffers the same problem as Jagged Alliance: Back in Action, sometimes you have to position characters pixel-accurate to have them shoot around a corner or through a window. Cool idea, but not my cup of tea!			"

												The game concept is a variation on the planning phase of the older ghost recons. i just wished they would have copied the GUI of that game too. I had lots of difficulty already in the tutorial to move my men. One objective (move along route) was so difficult to do that I tought the game had bugged. So I restarted the whole tutorial: same problem. After 5 minutes I succeeded, did a real mission with success, quited and started Ghost recon Raven shield which is a much better game.			"

												So I had it on a free weekend and decided to try it out. I find it dissipointing. First of all, I find the Player AI seems to be rediculously dumbed down. I have had matches where they stand there after I give them commands to engage, while they were in the same room. On top of that, I have to tell them to engage the enemy on sight every single turnControls are rediculous, and attemtping to cancel/change an order is a nightmare. I couldn't get my guy to change directions with out adding about fifty different checkpoints to his path of direction. I had a unit basically two step around because he was trying to get to another point on the map.Enemy AI manages to get off lucky put shots like rediculously lucky... as in impossible ranges when you have the same units.Moving the camera around a map is difficult. I couldn't see where the enemy was coming from and was unable to strategise because all I could do was zoom out. The HUD also seems to get in the way of the actual action of the game.I even tried the customization abilities on this game. This again, was another joke, Getting full screen and resolution proved a little bit of trial and error. as well as adjusting the colors. I tried... and yet again, seemed to find another thing broken with this game.It seems like it was rushed. a great concept, but still needs work guys.			"

All actions were istant, turning and aiming to a direction were instant, no stances, no scoping, no items, no inventory, no kind of cover system, no item stealing, 'no nuthin'. All in as basic as it gets. Finally also some play by email features, so you get to wait or more like forget a game someone takes too long to play.All in all, quite awful.

												Having played several tactical games before, I was very disappointed after playing this one after many users described it as being on the cutting edge of the genre. In truth, it comes down to a rock, paper, scissors blend of wits and guesswork. Frozen Synapse is actually rather well-balanced. The variety of weapons, random placement of objects, and high amount of control over your actions add a lot to consider when taking your turn. But once you learn the rules, the game actually ends up very shallow. The simultaneous, locked-in turns limit the player to faking out his opponent rather than actually creating a strategy to suit the environment and adapting it to his opponent’s actions. In this way, the game is less about using tactics and more about being cheeky. Strategy, i.e. a plan of attack, is still important, but that is more about getting used to the game’s meta than actually developing tactical prowess.Frozen Synapse is very stylish - it has a very entertaining sense of humor in its dialogue and narration, and the music is well-composed and nice to listen to, but the gameplay itself falls pretty flat. I do not recommend this game at all.			"

												I just don't really get this game. I feel like I should... it's a tactical strategy game where you take simultaneous turns ordering units around trying to kill all enemies.This game is just too inaccessible. After the tutorial, I started up the single player campaign, and I can't beat the first level. No help from the game, no strategy tips, and crap units ensure that my guys get torn to shreds each time I try. It's frustrating... I don't know what I'm doing wrong and the game refuses to tell me.Apparently this game is built for online multiplayer, but quite frankly, I don't care. I've never really been one for online multiplayer against strangers. If you do, maybe you'll find more enjoyment in it than I did. At least I didn't pay much for it...			"

												Now, when I first downloaded this, as it was during the free weekend, I believed it would be an excellent strategy game. I was wrong. Now, the concept seems great, but just too poorly excecuted for me to like it.1. AI- Well, 1 shot can kill a man, but unfortunately, sometimes when I give orders to my characters, and press to see them, they don't do it. All i can say is thank god for the planning phase, or else the mission would be over before i could say ""WHAT THE ****?!"" Your friendly AI, the people you control, take like 3 seconds to fire, keep in mind most turns only last like 5 seconds, this gives you around 2 seconds to move a guy.2. Graphics- So-so, is all i can say, only about 2 death animations when a dude is shot, and most of the detail obviosly went into the pictures of characters, and that isn't saying much.3. Story- Don't even bother, try to understand, your brain will disolve, but not before giving you the finger as it turns to mush.4 -Gameplay- Oh boy, is this difficult. NO DIFFICULTY SETTING, except for the type of AI in instant skirmish (suicidal, old etc)1 shot=1 kill regardless. You can get hit from the other side of the room with a single shotgun pellet and still die. Yeah programmers, Health bars would be nice seeing as your dumb squad fail to shoot unless they get a bullet in the face. Also, what the game does not tell you is that once you press ""PRIME"", enemies will move, which completely buggers any plan you made. All you can do is hope they do not turn around when your guy is ready to shoot them. Trust me, most of the time they walk off, see one of my guys about to kill another Enyo:Nomad or whatever the **** they're called, and boom, you're dead. No buts, just dead *heavy ""yells DED, not big suprise""*. Why could we not see where enemies go in the form of waypoints, fewer of these waypoints or where they face the harder the difficulty, where a DIFFICULTY SETTING WOULD BE NICE.5. Soundtrack- Best part about the game, not Portal 2 level, but still good.6. Humor- Only in achivement names bub, otherwise, you need to only play the tutorial for a sarcastic remark.Overall, unless it's on sale for around £3 (about 5 dollars if you're American) I'd stay away. For £18.99, I could just go save up about £2 more and buy BOTH Portal games or Half Life/ hl2, so if they think they can charge more for this game alone. I don't think this is right.However, if you are still here and not up in arms either at the game or at me, THIS IS MY OPINION. Personally, I don't like this game, but if you do, that's fine. I just want to warn people about the problems I have with this game.On that note, goodbye, I am off the play some (in my opinion) better games.			"

The campaign is repetetive. The environment the game projects may follow the story, but it is extremely uninteresting and dissatisfying. The maps in multiplayer are not symmetrical, and both teams get different troop count and type, so it isn't even fair.

												I really wanted to like this game, but there is just so much wrong with it. I was told by several people that it is ""Rainbow six planing mode the game"" this couldnt be further from the thruth and that has nothing to do with the cyberpunk setting.The setting is actually really nice and the charecters are entertaining. There are however several big gameplay problems.1.The mission start. You always get a group of several soldiers. You can not place them in starting zones, which is fine. The problem is instead they are placed randomly around the map. Add to this that the enemies are placed at random as well and what you get is an unbalanceable game. You will play one mission that is just not possible and when you restart the very same mission it will be unbelievably easy because by chance the soldiers were placed in your favour.2.The weapons. RPGs and grenadelaunchers are a lot of fun. The Shotgun is believeable to even though its a bit shortranged. Apart from that the weapons are a mess. First of all there is a ""Machinegun"" yet soldiers cant lie down. So they spray at each other from about 20 meters till one hits the other. The enviroments are all about 50m x 50m why not implement a Machinepistol instead? Next up the Sniper. Yeah tiny enviromens + a sniperrifle how is this♥♥♥♥♥♥supposed to work? Why not a rifleman instead with an assault rifle? 3.Hit prediction. You have the option the precalculate your next move. The only downside is you have to guess yourself what the enemy will do. The AI is utter rubish so you will have to make a few wild guesses, but even when you guess right and everything plans out like you wanted it to .... you are still going  to loose at least one soldier. Why? Because that guy you shot in the back in the calculation before he has time to turn around will in reality be a lot quicker than your guy turn around and shoot him, for no logical reason. It makes the whole precalculate option pretty pointless.			"

												Cool idea, but sometimes the mechanics just don't make sense. i.e: Cannot shoot from cover (peeking out) and aiming down sights and rounding a corner doesn't provide the suprise attack that you would think it would. The turn based strategy is reasonably fun against NPCs and the campaign mode has a good story, but PvP seems limited in creativity and feels like playing a chess game except you have to make your next 5-10 moves without seeing your opponents reactions. Also...on mac OSX...WHY CAN'T I TAB OUT from fullscreen...seriously developers...its not hard...literally all my other games work just fine. 5/10			"

												Not really sure why this game rates as well as it does with reviewers.It feels slow and random. It's bound to be slow because of the turn based nature, but add on the amount of time it takes to compute a turn (a surprisingly long time!), and .. it's a bit boring.Now factor in that where your team are randomly plopped on the map basically defines if you will win or not. Bad placement? Then you dont really stand a chance. Woo game of skill.Oh and the weapon types don't feel balanced either. Shotguns being basically useless unless you can get close to someone without being shot. See ""placement"" above.Soooo .. it's slow, even more slow than a usual turn based game, feels random and unbalanced. Yet gets some really good reviews. I get the feeling a lot of reviewers just play a game for 20 mins, and then write a nice review so they get more free games sent to them, coz this one's a bit crap.			"

												Turn based grid-less version of X-COM but without the resource management and metagame. The most interesting part is planning out both your moves and predicting your enemy's moves, playing it out, and optimizing your turn based on your available information and predictions. LoS and cover can be frustrating with you occasionally you being shot before you can shoot the enemy without explanation from the game. Single player is pretty generic and multiplayer is a bit empty. I assume most people set up their own matches between friends because I get the feeling this is one of those games that a dozen hardcore people play publicly just to stomp people online.This could be a great tactical play-by-email game between friends but I wouldn't recommend it unless your friends get it or you buy multiple copies for some. Be prepared for 30min-1hr long turns and week long games; this is something you really have to dig deep into.			"

												Between countless Fire Emblem games, some tabletop roleplaying, and a recent campaign of XCOM: Enemy Unknown, I've come to enjoy turn-based strategy. There's something very satisfying about using your brain to look at the situation, and by taking careful risks, use each and every single one of your units to make a satisfying move which puts you further towards winning the game.That was what I was hoping for when I bought Frozen Synapse - a nice, fun, turn-based strategy which lets me plan carefully in order to win. Personally, I was almost crossing my fingers for an XCOM/Fire Emblem rip-off, since to me, they represent the core ideas and mechanics of turn-based strategy and more of that sort of gameplay couldn't be a bad thing.Unfortunately, what I found instead was a boring, drab game where the ""strategy"" comes down to ""have you guessed what your opponents were going to do?"" Sure, that's an essential part of most strategy games, but usually you get help, like showing where your opponents can move, or knowing how much damage they'll do so you'll know which units can survive a fight with them. Instead, in Frozen Synapse, you choose which actions you want your units to take, press the button to end your turn, and then your opponents make all of their moves at the same time.Whilst this doesn't sound like a bad thing, it means that you can spend time setting up your units, planning for your opponents to do something, only for them to bypass that method completely and catch you by surprise, all because you didn't have the precognition to see into the future and realise that they could do that. Sure, you could try and plan for all outcomes, but that means using more units and therefore cutting off your options elsewhere. Essentially, gameplay boils down to you crossing your fingers that the enemy walks in front of your units and dies before they notice your units.On top of all that, the controls are confusing as all hell and very unintuitive. There's a tutorial, but it rushes by pretty quickly and being given step-by-step instructions is much different to having to think ahead and choose and work out what to do in a real level. I should say something about the graphics and story too, but really, what is there to say? The graphics are ugly, uninspired, and boring, and the story is a bunch of cyberpunk technobabble which made my eyes immediately glaze over because it was so boring.Normally, I try and finish games to the end because I want to get my money's worth, but this is the first time in a very long while that I've simply quit and said ""No."" I tried to get into the game and give it a good go, but as I struggled to predict the enemies' paths for the umpteenth time, I recalled that in video games, players should be interested within five to fifteen minutes. Well, I gave the game nearly an hour of my time, and as far as I'm concerned, I shouldn't have gone further than fifteen minutes.Overall, I would not recommend Frozen Synapse. This is not the type of turn-based strategy I enjoy, and whilst it's certainly a nice try and something different, there's a reason that turn-by-turn strategy has remained dominant in many games - for example, chess - for so long: because it works and it's fun, unlike Frozen Synapse.

												I love a good strategy game, but I could not get into this one.  Every little step requires absolute micromanagement.  Yes, that does allow for greater precision, but it also quickly becomes overwhelmingly tedious.The flavorless presentation doesn't help either.  It's visually bland, the level and characters all in one of three solid, textureless colors.  This attempted minimalism only makes the world feel lifeless.  The story is equally lacking in both color and texture, and is easily forgettable.There's countless strategy games out there--many of them far more worth your time than this one.  Go play XCOM instead.			"

												 I really wanted to like Frozen Synapse but it just didn’t click for me. I thought the combat would be more like X-Com but while similar, it’s different in a bad way. It is still technically turn-based, but instead of each unit getting an individual turn, your whole team has a turn and you assign them moves & tasks, which all get carried out at the same time. The enemy units move all together at the same time your units do, which results in wasted turns & frustration. Let’s say you want to move one unit, who is exposed, behind some cover. You want another unit to camp behind cover & shoot a bad guy as he moves. You have to instruct both of them on what you want them to do, then basically push the “play” button and watch events unfold. Unfortunately, an enemy unit moves into firing range of the guy you told to move into cover. You couldn’t anticipate the enemy would move there, so your guy keeps stupidly running forward as you watch helplessly while the enemy blows him away. Meanwhile, your other unit jumps into a perfect firing position right at the start of the turn, just like you told him. Unfortunately, that other enemy unit went a different way than you thought he was going and basically gets a free movement turn while your guy idiotically sits in one place the entire time. Events like this are commonplace.Maybe it gets better. Maybe I wasn’t doing it right. All I can tell you is that I didn’t enjoy the hour of Frozen Synapse I played. I’ve thought about going back and giving it another shot but then realize I’d have to sit through the entire tutorial again because I don’t remember any of the controls. I have zero desire to do that.			"

												This has got to be one of the most boring games I have ever played. I know its a game about strategy and its not supposed to be all up in your face with action but its soooo boring. In Frozen Synapse you decide where you want your soldiers to go from a top down angle while the enemy does the same thing. This phase takes way too long and makes you want to play the game less and less. Then you watch it play out. If 2 soldiers from different teams come in contact they will shoot at each other. That is the most fun thing about this game. Yeah...thats it really, and its not even that fun. You just see them shoot at each other and then one of them dies.  I only have 1 hour on this game for a reason, I can't stand it. The gameplay is repetative and boring. I sound like a broken record here so ill just end it. I would give this game a 2/10. If you like watching blue people walk around corners and have long setup times, this game will give you a boner			"

												This game is entertaining for an hour or two. After that it's simply frustrating. Pros:Cool graphics and interfaceVery cool soundtrackMildly entertaining for a little whileCons:Convoluted control management schemeRather pathetic attempt at a backstoryExtremely redundant after the first hour or twoAttempting to predict the AI's movements is a real exercise in frustrationVerdict:Glad I got to try this for free. This isn't something I'd want to spend money on. RTS fans might enjoy this even though it isn't strictly an RTS.			"

												The game dose not start. There is a fix that users have come up with to get the game to start but one should not have to do this. This bug should have been fixed years ago and the developers have not done that. But they continue to sell the game here on Steam. I think that Steam should remove the game and give everyone their money back until the developer fix this game braking bug.			"

I went through the tutorial a number of times, and tried very hard to get in to the game, but it's just way too strategic, and technical. If you like, or can even comprehend, that kind of game, then give it a go by all means, but I can't recommend it since I ended up hating it because I just couldn't really grasp it.

												At $25 for a two-pack, this is a damn good deal.  The game basically plays like a Turn-Based Strategy, except that... well, your turns happen at the same time.  This makes multiplayer both strange and frustrating, yet at the same time very competitive and satisfying... and nothing beats the humiliating moment where your opponent micromanges every aspect of the battle and gets his♥♥♥♥♥wiped off the map in two turns!$25 honestly would be a reasonable price for just one copy of the game.  Its soundtrack, its campaign, its skirmish generator, everything, it's all hundreds of hours of content in a highly innovative and polished product.  The fact that you're getting a gift copy for free to let a friend play against you is just a deal that can't be passed up.For strategy enthusiasts and people just looking for something new, look no further.

												7/10 FS is a turn-taking strategy game that simulates a SWAT team vs SWAT team kind of combat. ""Strategy? Turn taking? Sounds boring."", right? Wrong. This game is actually quite a thrill! When it's your turn, you can issue orders like sprint, walk with weapon ready to fire, crouch behind cover, no engagement, and a many others. You can also move your opponents units to predict how they will move. When you think you're happy, you can hit a ""test"" button to see how it works out then either keep tweeking or commit to your orders. The replay makes every win rewarding. I can't finish campaign, though. Invisible rocket troops isn't my idea of ""tactics"" or ""challenge"". The A.I. can be a bit too psychic as well. This makes for a needlessly-impossible combo. It loses points for forcing you to buy 2 copies, making this too expensive for what you get. If FS is on sale, definately try it out. Demo is available too.			"

												Frozen Synapse is a turn based squad tactics game set in a confuseing scify distopiea utopiea where digimon have guns.  The game has a terrible habit of not telling you things you think you should probably know like that units cannot shoot while ducking behind cover, shotguns not being able to engage hostiles that are more than a rooms width away, and what the hell a ""check"" command is.  other than that the game just seems flat out unpolished with poor AI.  Sometimes units will try to engage an enemy with their gun clipping through the corner of a wall.  He will then empty his gun into the wall he was hideing behind until he is killed by the enemy he was apparently engageing because your guy was still half exposed.  Sometimes your shotgun unit will just stand infront of an enemy and recive a load of lead to his face because no one told you he wont even ATTEMPT to shoot people that are litteraly only farther than a small rooms width away. this is very confuseing because shotgun projectiles seem to travel the entire map with no problem.  Units also cannot climb through windows or over low obstacles, leaving very little real tactics you can actually employ while entering a building.  The game is also all on one plane, meaning that you cannot climb onto roofs or down into ditches, basements, ECT.  Making all the maps just feel the same...  The asthetic of the game is simple computery blue wireframe untextured simulation which Is alright for this type of game I suppose, but the world just feels empty with no doors to breach or any furniture at all in the buildings.  Yes I know that you are fighting in the digital world net thing, but I would think that doors would be a nice thing to have in any building.  The gameplay seems solid at first until you realize how shallow it is with the whole lack of doors thing going on along with the lack of being able to climb through windows.  On the story side of things, you get mountains and mountains of text and exposition with what I would guess would be a gripping story.  But with SO MUCH UNEXPLAINED JARGON in the lore and no voice acting whatsoever... it all just becomes skippable seeing that you wont be able to understand half the things the characters are talking about anyway.  The only thing done right in this game is the sound track which if you are a fan of electronic music I would suggest buying.  In the end, Frozen Synapes gets dragged down by poor AI, Shallow gameplay, and a boring story.			"

												I have absolutely no idea how good or bad this game is because I do not own it. Steam somehow decided that I own this game (I wish it become true) and now they requested a review despite the fact I did not play it at all.This game may be good, but it may be bad. Who knows, right? However, this is a review, therefore I have to evaluate this product. I really like these blue boxes which are on logo. It may be because blue is my favourite colour. Also I like boxes because you can stack them on top of each other and more boxes you have, higher you reach. I think that is all. Hopefully I helped you to decide, whether you will or will not buy the game.			"

												You play the game by blindly planing your squad's actions for every 5 seconds and then watching the outcome. I had high expectations but found it unbelievably boring and repetitive. History is way below meh and history telling is dismal, with no voice overs and a writing that's uninspired at best. I haven't tried it in multiplayer but I don't think it'll be much more interesting than this.I can only recommend it if you get it for free.			"

												One of the Best Asynchronous Turnbased Strategy Games i know.Each player plots his turn, and selects which actions his units are gonna take. And once both players decide to submit the decisions, the game will plot out the plan. This may sound very vague but due to the ability to simulate any possible order the opponent may give his units, it quickly comes down to mind games. While there is a Single Player mode i can not recommend it past learning the game. Your mileage may vary but i did not like the campain, even though the story was quite interesting.			"

												Set in the far future, Frozen Synapse places you in the role of a tactican who's tasked with giving orders to bio organic robot soldiers called Shapeforms on a mission to help a resistance group, Petrov's Shard, take down a corporation called Enyo:Nomad who are ruling the city of Markov Geist with an iron fist, you will learn more about the world of Frozen Synapse through the files you can review prior to a mission as well as listening to the conversations between the characters, some are even sentient AIs.The game plays out like a turn based strategy game, except it allows you to run simulations of what the enemies might do, but it may very likely not end up being as the simulation predicted and you have to gamble if you're willing to take the risk or just rethink everything.

The learning curve is a wee bit steep at first, but thankfully the single player campaign is brilliant at training the first-time players; not to mention that the campaign story is a compelling modern cyberpunk told through the course of many well-balanced missions.

												Great turn based RTS. I bought it years ago when it was in the humble bundle and I seem to always keep coming back to it.If I could describe it I would say the turns are simultaneous but at the same time asynchronous. Basically you place your moves for your units and hit the calculate outcome button.  Once your opponent has done the same, the computer calculates what the outcome was with those programmed actions.   Makes for a very interesting guessing match of what the opponent will do.  Since it's asynchronous you can carry a game on over a week or finish it in one sitting.  Or like most, have 6 or so games going on at any one time.  Best strategy game I have ever played (well except for chess)!  I wish there were more games like this, I think this is the only one of it’s kind though.			"

												I really like this game because of its strategic purity.  You can spend as much or as little time with your strategies as you want, and the results pretty directly match your skill and effort.  It's like running your own hand-crafted simulations to outwit your opponent.  Also, the soundtrack is very fitting, which makes it very easy to spend a ton of time planning.			"

												SummaryIn short, Frozen Synapse is a turn based counter strike with focus on tactics rather than action in a cyper-punk setting.You get thrown right into the action from your first match with little introduction which may put off some people. I did not find it too bad though.When playing against other players online, it feels very rewarding to win a match. Seeing a carefully planned out plan work feels great! However losing also feels as progress as you gain experience points for your actions rather then just the outcome.GameplayYou control a team of units armed with different weapons (either shotgun, grenade, machine-gun, sniper or rocket) in a battlefield against opponent units. Orders are given to a single unit as a path of nodes to travel along and you can assign actions along the path such as ""crouch"", ""ignore at sight"",  ""shoot at sight"", ""wait"" and ""look in this direction"". You can order units to take cover, make distractions, flank enemies, flush out enemies and many other tactics that make use of the randomly generated environment. You can also simulate the enemy units to test out your plans and make sure you covered all outcomes. It is hard to describe the feeling of seing enemies fall into your traps or pressured into defeat other than ""Just as planned..."".The game was slightly intimidating in the beginning as there are many things to get used to and most of it is presented without much introduction. There is a single player campaign which presents all actions from the first mission and the tutorial only teaches a few basic tactics. Generally the overall focus seemed to be on playing online and learning by doing and failing.Multi-playerOnline works overall well. You can play any number of matches you want at once as the game does not progress until both players have submitted your plans. Once both players have submitted their plans, the outcome is played out. You can also choose to have the game notify you by email or through Steam when your next turn is ready.ThemeLastly I really like the overall style of the game. The music is very fitting and the sparse visuals keeps focus on the gameplay.			"

												This game is just incredible. The design appears simple, but there's so much depth to the strategy that it becomes both addicting and hugely tense in short order. Anticipating enemy movements, adapting to contingencies, and determining the best way to use the forces at your disposal make the gameplay immensely rewarding. The simultaneous turn resolution throws in further decision-making concerns and makes strategy development that much more dynamic and exciting. The soundtrack is phenomenal, as well, and really helps to enhance the cyberpunk world you inhabit. Snippets of the text dialogue could use some touching up, but information is communicated well and characterizations are done competently.Frozen Synapse is everything I want from a tactical game, in the sense of both gameplay and presentation. An absolute masterclass indie product!			"

												The game is fun, i can tell you that. The multiplayer is kinda stupid with finding and leaving a game because its does not seem to give me any sign of when another player has left the match (what i have experienced). The game would be better if you could create levels from scratch and maybe have more players in the match when playing multiplayer. The AI seems a little overpowerd like it knows where you are going (again from my experience) and in the campaign they have way to many troops that can just kill you like that.When you have played it some time you start enjoying it but only after some time.But overall it is a good game with a 7 out of 10 from me :D			"

												Interesting take on Turn Based Strategy games. Instead of moving units one-by-one along a grid, you set something of a sort of ""timeline"" that your soldiers follow. Then all the units act out this timeline simultaneously, with each turn being about 5 seconds. Would love to see more games like this in the future.			"

												This is a great turn based strategy game, where you control a squad and are paired up another squad controlled by another player. There is a lot of depth to this pretty simple game. You have to plan what your squad does, and anticipate what the enemy will do. You can watch any games you have played (or anyone has played for that matter) and see what the enemy team did, what you did, and what you could do to improve. You can even upload your games to youtube directly in game. This game is awesome.			"

												So... why haven't you bought this yet? This is a simultaneous turn based tactics game, not to mention an absolute delight to play! To describe this game in such a small space is difficult, which is a testament to just how in depth this experience can be using a perfectly simple interface. Sure the graphics might not be the bells and whistles of X-com, but you owe it to yourself to try this new breed of TBS/T.And even better? Extremely accessible multiplayer that provides the conveniance of an old school PBEM without all the annoyings bits - take turns when it suits you. Rugged coop and a decent single player campaign... not to mention a whole slew of tactical game types. When things get good its almost like you're playing a top down arena based shooter, and you'll cringe as each tiny faceless trooper gets popped off by your ruthless opponent.Let the arm chair commander within you be unleashed!

												I'm not very good at strategy games. Luckily for me, there's Frozen Synapse, a squad-based tactical game that's one of the most addictive indie titles I've played all year. The style of FS is quite nice, with a quasi-cyberpunk setting, a simplistic graphic style that recalls Metal Gear Solid's VR missions and an electronic soundtrack that's pretty impressive in its own right. Matches can be lightning fast or last days a la chess. Such is the beauty of the turn-based gameplay in FS. The multiplayer community is robust as of this review, and I get plenty of invites whether I'm playing single player or multiplayer. The multiplayer community is great. In the few matches I've played (and lost), competitors have never hesitated to give me tips on strategy. Community aside, there some great features, such as ""light"" and ""dark"" modes (which determine fog of war) as well as instant Youtube uploads, giving you plenty of reference for strategy and a way to showcase your wins			"

												I personally don't like shooter games, so Frozen Synapse was not a natural purchase for me. It came highly recommended, though, and I personally woudl say that I do not regret buying it. There's something very satisfying about this tactical strategy shooter: setting up a plan of attack, viewing its potential outcome and reviewing every single step of the attack process. When you see a well-planned attack go off perfectly with pinpoint precision, you come away feeling like a god.There's only one downside: there's no steam cloud backup of your data. This is one game that really needs it, especially with Steam's potential plans to make its games available on Tablets. With data backed up onto the cloud, you'd be able to play at home or on the go without much hassle. This is not possible.			"

												Being a fan of tactical shooters, I'd picked up Frozen Synapse the second I'd heard of it. I'd gone in expecting the same levels of awesomeness I'd experienced in titles such as Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six.I wasn't disappointed.As I'm sure you've gathered by now, Frozen Synapse is a turn-based strategy game. Both teams piece together their plans, press the start button, and watch as the battle unfolds. The planning phase makes up the vast majority of the game, with most of your time spent fiddling with aiming directions, movement, testing the layout of your troops against every possible scenario and so on and so forth. It takes an incredible amount of time to plan out a turn that effectively lasts five seconds- but you'd better believe that they're some of the tensest five seconds I've ever experienced in gaming. Beyond its brilliant core gameplay, Frozen Synapse boasts an intriguing storyline and setting that's vague in all the right places along with an absolutely fantastic soundtrack. I'd fully recommend this to anybody with a love for tactical squad based combat and strategy. It's a great game. "

												I really thought I liked these types of games.  I enjoyed ""Breach and Clear"" so I thought I would also enjoy Frozen Synapse.  While the background elements are fine (helps explain the plain graphics), the micro-managing is a LOT more intense (that is, there was basically no micro-managing in Breach & Clear).  This is pretty cool.  Also, the AI is much more advanced, which is good training for multi-player (to a degree).  Where B&C was a simple single-player game, Frozen Synapse really shines in multi-player.  In fact, I'd recommend it for fans of the tactical/turn-based genre who solely like multiplayer.  For casual, single players, you might like it - but the campaign got frustrating really fast for me.  Sometimes my guys would not move at all and get picked off; the cpu could not only peg me from afar with an automatic weapon, but also turn and kill the guy who flanked him and was behind cover... nice.  For the CPU.  Several ""turns"" I was like, ""really?  REALLY?  Sure.""  That kind of frustration.But hey, in the end, it's all about polishing one's tactics and learning your opponent (whether they're a CPU or a human).  For the sale price (and linux support) it was a no-brainer to buy (and you do get two copies, since it is so multi-player, 1-on-1 heavy).  An excellent buy and incredible value.			"

												This game is just incredible. The design appears simple, but there's so much depth to the strategy that it becomes both addicting and hugely tense in short order. Anticipating enemy movements, adapting to contingencies, and determining the best way to use the forces at your disposal make the gameplay immensely rewarding. The simultaneous turn resolution throws in further decision-making concerns and makes strategy development that much more dynamic and exciting. The soundtrack is phenomenal, as well, and really helps to enhance the cyberpunk world you inhabit. Snippets of the text dialogue could use some touching up, but information is communicated well and characterizations are done competently.Frozen Synapse is everything I want from a tactical game, in the sense of both gameplay and presentation. An absolute masterclass indie product!			"

												This'll be a short review because I got a lot of turns pending :DFrozen Synapse is a turn-based strategy-game similar to Breach&Clear but with a more intense focus on multiplayer.Overview:The game is set in a future world in the city Markov Geist. The reality has become divided into the real world, controlled by humans, and the shape, something like a second reality that can be accessed through the widespread wireless network that has been established over the years. It's home of so called shapeforms which I won't explain in detail.The setting is somewhat similar to that of the Shadowrun Universe (Cyberpunk).Gameplay:As there are so many other reviewers out there who already explained the gameplay in detail, I will just sum up my impressions. The game easy to learn but hard as f*** to master. You are given a small tutorial which explains the basic commands and teaches you how to chain them and plan your turn. Then you're on your own to figure out what to do with that information. I suggest playing the campaign a little before jumping into multiplayer.The mechanics are fair although sometimes frustrating since who kills who depends on a list of factors you have to be aware of and at times they are not that easy to assess. But that's what makes this game great. It really forces you to THINK about what to do next!The graphics speak for themselves. Simple yet stylish. You get a good overview of the map and there are no irrelevant objects. If you can see it, it has a function -> Good guys, bad guys, cover, walls. That's it.Summing up I did not regret paying 7€ for this. If you also want to play Coop, buy the Red DLC. Only one of the Coop-Players needs it for coop to work which I think is really well done!

												Set in the far future, Frozen Synapse places you in the role of a tactican who's tasked with giving orders to bio organic robot soldiers called Shapeforms on a mission to help a resistance group, Petrov's Shard, take down a corporation called Enyo:Nomad who are ruling the city of Markov Geist with an iron fist, you will learn more about the world of Frozen Synapse through the files you can review prior to a mission as well as listening to the conversations between the characters, some are even sentient AIs.The game plays out like a turn based strategy game, except it allows you to run simulations of what the enemies might do, but it may very likely not end up being as the simulation predicted and you have to gamble if you're willing to take the risk or just rethink everything.

												Frozen Synapse is not a game where players can get an advantage from the order of turns. Both players' moves act out at the same time once their tactics are sorted and locked in. With this unique management of time, things can and will go wrong. You may have launched a grenade, but the other player accidentally bounced it off his riot shield unit killing half of your guys. There's great fun to be had in Frozen Synapse.			"

												Simple, yet chess like in its replayabiltiy, Frozen Synapse is a turn based tactical combat game.  You control a fix number of solders armed, each with a specific weapon.  Load out varies per map and round, but they navigate a simple techno/hologramed terrain with walls and windows, in an attempt to take out the other guy.  Turns are not executed live, so you can have a slow play game with someone, simply putting in your turn when you have time, or you can be running multiple games at once.  Once your turn is submitted, your opponent gets a message and vise-versa, at which point you can view the results of that round and plan your next.Turns are process simultaneously so you setup your mans with postures, positions and what direction their facing.  As you move around the small map, so does the other guy, when your mans see someone, they shoot (unless told not to).  It's satisfying and frustrating to see each round unfold and it's immensely challenging to attempt to get your mans into the best position to attack the other guy.Take that simple gameplay mechanic and throw in a couple classic game modes like King of the Hill and recue/protect the hostages and an additional mode called charge where you bid on how far you believe you can get and hold a position on the map.  Each play puts their bid in at the beginning of the game and whoever is more aggressive (distance from starting point) in their bid wins the bid and must then achieve that position.Each round is unique and challenge.  While there's AI to train yourself on (which scales well) the match making system is where it's at.  Stat tracking and ranking is very much a part of the game and it ends up pairing you for battles that don't tend to feel lopsided.It's a small, simple game so despite being really good I'll say it's worth $10.  Add another $3 to throw it on android and you can process those turns on the go.  Worth it.Visuals 6Gamplay 8Slant 7Overall : 70 "

												Possibly one of the best games I've ever played. The combat is balanced and tactical, my experience with the campaign is wonderful, and I find it hard to fault this game.One thing I should warn people of though, is that the art style makes it look like a simulation of a game (which it is) but in a retro style.Which is weird for some.

												Interesting strategy game.  It has a great variety of moves you can make to order your units to do exactly what you want them to do.  With both teams moving at the same time, the real strategy is in anticipating what your enemy is going to do.  The level design is varied, so each map is a different scenario.  I rather enjoy this game.  It's a great bang for the buck.7.5/10			"

												Good turn-based shooter that works wonderfully for a sort of ""play-by-mail"" or ""play when I have time"" game.  Imagine a simplified UFO / XCOM where you send a complete turn to a remote server and wait until your opponent replies, but the results of both players movements are carried out simultaneously, and you have any number of games going at the same time.  Also quite a good single player campaign, and a wonderful control system (i.e. time-based action changes, view changes, etc. with a very intuitive control).			"

												If you like tactical, 'small scale', simultaneously turn based strategy games, stop looking for your ultimate game! ;) In Frozen Synapse the player controls a squad of different units (assault rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle, rocket launcher, grenade launcher), of which the composition is partially randomly generated. The levels are also (partially) procedurally generated, so there is an endless amount of levels.A nice campaign with 55 missions, multiplayer with different gamemodes and the 'deep gameplay' make this, at least for me, one of the best strategy games I've played to far. You should definitely try (and buy!) this game if/when a demo is released! (Which, as far as I know, will be in July 2011)			"

The online multiplayer is great and the players are freindly; unlike other gaming comunities.

Oh, and it ain't as nerdy.This turn-based tactical game doesn't have the eye-catching effect of the AAA titles, but down in the core it's far more fascinating than any of the big-budget titles.It's actually difficult to describe exactly what Frozen Synapse is. The Steam description doesn't do the game justice, and it's only after you dive into the game (even a simple match vs the CPU) does the game's complexity become apparent.Most definitely a title worth checking out!

												I personally don't like shooter games, so Frozen Synapse was not a natural purchase for me. It came highly recommended, though, and I personally woudl say that I do not regret buying it. There's something very satisfying about this tactical strategy shooter: setting up a plan of attack, viewing its potential outcome and reviewing every single step of the attack process. When you see a well-planned attack go off perfectly with pinpoint precision, you come away feeling like a god.There's only one downside: there's no steam cloud backup of your data. This is one game that really needs it, especially with Steam's potential plans to make its games available on Tablets. With data backed up onto the cloud, you'd be able to play at home or on the go without much hassle. This is not possible.			"

												So you're looking at the store page, and you're like; ""Okay, a turn based strategy game. Looks okay...but not worth the price."" WRONG! SO WRONG! SCRUB! It's really fun, with exciting online and singleplayer gameplay, combining turn-based strategy with RTS features. If you get it, you are a-okay in my opinion. If you don't, you're b-okay. Not bad, but not a-okay.			"

												This game is very fun and difficult. You have to use timing, positioning, and use the battleground to your advantage. If you pile up one to many people in a group, they could die easily from a grenade or rocket, or if you make someone stand up to early, someone ready to fire could take him down easily. It's a really fun game, and you have to rely on skill rather than chance.			"

												This thing is raw stategy. You have a squad of ""vatforms,"" essentially clones into which orders can be plugged. You must provide those orders in this turn-based squad combat game. Except it doesn't feel so turn based, because after each planning phase where you meticulously plotted routes and arcs of fire for your units, all the action hashes out in real time.The game basically does a bunch of behind the scenes math to come up with the result, taking into account cover, movement, range, wepon type, etc. After a bit, you catch on to the basic rules of who's going to survive a given one on one encounter, and you can start testing strategies by running real time simulations of enemy movements (with orders given by you based on what you think they might do) before you submit each turn.Add to the rock solid core mechanics a compelling story, holographic computer simulation graphics style, and awesome soundtrack, and you have top notch game.Did I mention there's procedurally generated maps and multiplayer?

												Frozen Synapse... this game is rather hard to classify. It's a turn based simulation of turn-based combat. It runs by a few simple rules, yet it's random and at the same time, calculative nature keeps it much more complicated. It can be as simple as a game of chess, or as complicated as political usurpation. The gameplay holds quite well to both those who enjoy full control of the situation and those who preffer to let things play out by themselves.The campaign takes you on an interesting trip through futuristic city of Markov Geist. You are aided by a number of characters such as idealistic Nix, snide Belacqua, and caring Soulsby. Although the campaign can be difficult at times, it is ultimately enjoyable, and beating a mission has a sense of achievement. The strange nature of the game's AI however, can be a problem at times.Multiplayer on the other hand, features great implementation of communications and planing. It is the main reason that this game should be acquiered.			"

												Frozen Synapse has been described as “Chess with Guns” but this does little to communicate the fantastic cyberpunk theme the pervades the experience. The score pulses through the experience spurring you on as you plan your next move, running simulation after simulation, attempting to find a way to evade that rocket that was fired a turn earlier. The story is smartly written and indie developer Mode7 punches above their weight to release an engaging tactics game for those who crave something a little more crunchy in a genre that is almost ignored by larger developers.

												Although it may look a little lack lustre, Frozen Synapse is in fact a very deep turn-based strategy in the vein of XCOM or Heroes of Might & Magic with a twist: once you and your opponent decide your units' moves, it becomes a real-time action sequence and your strategy goes against theirs. The story became gripping and the characters very interesting. It's a mix of corporate espionage, rebellion, and a war of beliefs coming together to make a fantastic singleplayer.On the multiplayer side, it comes with the added benefit of being asynchronous (after you setup your strategy, you can wander off for hours while your opponent decides; kind of like chess by mail). The game modes are neat and varied and seting up a match is pretty easy. Another plus, the people I played against were gratious and felt like a great community.Finally, after listening to the trailers, I decided to buy the soundtrack, and boy was it worth it! Still in my play list today.			"

												If you are a fan of strategy and top down view games or cyber-punk, then this is a great blend for you. The game revolves around you sending virtual units around randomly generated building interiors to fight for whatever objective is set for that mission.The interface allows you to make complex orders relatively effortlessly with just the touch of the left and right mouse buttons. Queueing orders up and then hitting the turn button to see the outcome.... or giving orders to your enemies units to see what you think they will do and then getting a simulated outcome to judge your tactics in relation to what you think the enemy will do. Trial and error gameplay, smoothe interface, beautiful art style and elegant multiplayer system. Try it out.			"

												One of the best tactical, simultaneous turn, games I have played. So much strategy goes into every units' move, turn, aim, whatever. It needs to be accounted for. I'm not sure if they've fixed it, but one complaint is that rockets can't hit the actual unit. Also, since it is dependent on your opponent's turn, it can take a while for them to respond if they suddenly go offline. But these are small issues. Overall, it's a great game and has some serious longevity potential. Buy it now.			"

												SummaryIn short, Frozen Synapse is a turn based counter strike with focus on tactics rather than action in a cyper-punk setting.You get thrown right into the action from your first match with little introduction which may put off some people. I did not find it too bad though.When playing against other players online, it feels very rewarding to win a match. Seeing a carefully planned out plan work feels great! However losing also feels as progress as you gain experience points for your actions rather then just the outcome.GameplayYou control a team of units armed with different weapons (either shotgun, grenade, machine-gun, sniper or rocket) in a battlefield against opponent units. Orders are given to a single unit as a path of nodes to travel along and you can assign actions along the path such as ""crouch"", ""ignore at sight"",  ""shoot at sight"", ""wait"" and ""look in this direction"". You can order units to take cover, make distractions, flank enemies, flush out enemies and many other tactics that make use of the randomly generated environment. You can also simulate the enemy units to test out your plans and make sure you covered all outcomes. It is hard to describe the feeling of seing enemies fall into your traps or pressured into defeat other than ""Just as planned..."".The game was slightly intimidating in the beginning as there are many things to get used to and most of it is presented without much introduction. There is a single player campaign which presents all actions from the first mission and the tutorial only teaches a few basic tactics. Generally the overall focus seemed to be on playing online and learning by doing and failing.Multi-playerOnline works overall well. You can play any number of matches you want at once as the game does not progress until both players have submitted your plans. Once both players have submitted their plans, the outcome is played out. You can also choose to have the game notify you by email or through Steam when your next turn is ready.ThemeLastly I really like the overall style of the game. The music is very fitting and the sparse visuals keeps focus on the gameplay.			"

I got it for free in the Great Gift Pile during the 2011 holiday sale (thanks, Valve!), and must say I was pleasantly surprised by how much fun it is.I've barely touched the campaign, mostly because ""Instant skirmish"" is fun enough.There's a room with around 3-6 enemies and a squad of friendly soldiers you can map out the paths for and set their stance/aiming/targeting options. Once you've done this, you click the ""prime"" button, and your sequence of moves plays out at the same time as the AI's. The process repeats until everyone on one team is dead. Simple, right?The key phrase for Frozen Synapse is ""just one more game"". The skirmishes are nice and short, and the gameplay is simple and addictive.

Worth it for the soundtrack alone, which is mind-blowing imho.The game itself is Turn-based and it' s easy to pick up but hard to master. The UI allows you to customise your every command up to the tiniest level of detail.The game offers a campaign but it really shines when playing against a human opponent, when you try to get into the mind of your adversery and anticipate his next move. The multiplayer part of the game is very well made and it supports many features that embellish it, like a replay system, a matchmaking system where you can be randomly challenged by individuals into 1 vs 1 duels, a pause/resume online game feature where the online mode is put on hold until both parties agree to continue, match notification by e-mail, leaderboards, match spectation, etc.There is also a skirmish level generator where you can create your own scenarios against diffirent styles of AI (aggressive, defensive, etc).

												Frozen Synapse  is a rather excellent strategy game that blends a minimalist style with intricate tactics. Players control squads of soldiers, and plan out their exact movements down to the last second. There is none of that ""click and go"" style crap here; in order to succeed, you must carefully weave your squad around corners with synchronous precision, divert sight lines towards choke points, and above all, predict where your opponent will be. Also, Introversion fans may be surprised to find that Frozen Synapse, is, in fact, not created by Introversion, but rather mode7 games. They could have fooled me- FS's style is no less slick than Introversion's best.			"

												Frozen Synapse never gets boring. For me it's the optimal multiplayer experience. Whenever I have some time on my hands I sit down and do my turns. There's also an iPad version. So when you really have to go to the toilet, you can just continue the game you started on PC on your iPad.			"

												Probably the best strategy game I've ever played. Plan out the actions of your soldiers  and watch as they unfold at the same time as your opponent's moves. You have to predict what they will do, and you can even simulate it to see what will happen if all goes as planned... or if it doesn't. Asynchronous multiplayer so you can do your turn, go do something else, and come back later to see if your opponent has made his. Simply brilliant game that everyone should get, and remember you get TWO copies for the price!			"

												This game is simply a joy to play. I enjoy this game on my mom's netbook, or on my 30"" 1080P monitor. This is a turn based strategy game. I highly recommend it. There are many really good things to talk about with this title. I will only scratch the surface I'm sure. There is a beefy single player campaign, a HUGE online comunity (Thanks Humble Indy Bundle!) The graphics look like tron, the gameplay can be as fast or slow as you want it to be. There is a lot of suspense involved.  I completley recommend this game to anyone who is open minded. I also highly recommend the soundtrack as well. Pick this up and joine me in the ""Texas 2"" server. ~PR0XIDIAN			"

												In a market over-saturated with instant-satisfaction run-and-gun shooters, there has been a lingering void of video games that focus heavily on tactical decision-making, deception and patience. Frozen Synapse not only fills this void but also offers gameplay that remains and will remain addictive and satisfying for years to come. What makes this turn-based, strategic game extremely gratifying is the ability to not only issue complex multi-layered orders to each of your own individual units but also the ability to issue the same extent of orders to the units of your opponent — providing the capability to explore and simulate how you might expect your opponent to carry out his or her next move. Regardless of whether or not your opponent reacts in the way you might have prognosticated, the anticipation to see the outcome of the next move can at times be overwhelmingly exhilarating. This coupled with an exceptional soundtrack and visuals is indicative of how excellent indie games can be.			"

												I didn't get this game. In principle I should love it in the same way I loved the X-COM games, but in practice I found the learning curve to be too steep, the controls too fiddly and everything to be a little too hard to adapt to.Otherwise the story is nothing to write home about, I haven't played online, and I never finished the game and don't intend on going back to it. I'll wait until the new Jagged Alliance comes out and play it instead. Sorry Frozen Synapse you don't make the grade for turn based shooters in my books.			"

												Great strategy, great concept, great styöe. It is round based and opponents may take really long planning out, as they can also estimate what you will be doing. But features to keep you entertained included: Play multiple games at once! You will be notified when the opponent makes his move in a game. You can also play with people never online when you are - make your move, wait to the opponent to make the move, and the next time you're online you can make your move again. Pretty neat.			"

												Simultaneously turnbased, top-down strategy game. Although there isn't that much activity online, I highly recommend grabbing this game if you see it on sale, which it has been for AUD$5 and under. Great soundtrack and art style, and a highly competitive gameplay, fully customizable multiplayer/skirmish modes and various gametypes. I've not yet played through the story, but I like this game enough to take up anyone who offers to give me a match in it. If you can find a few mates to play this with regularly, you'll probably get your money's worth, but because of how diminishing the server populations are, I cannot guarantee a good playerbase when you get it.If there is a demo or free weekend, definitely check it out.

												Quite an interesting and unique spin on turn based strategy games.  The game is fairly simple and straightforward, but planning out moves can take a while (if you get really in depth).  You don't even have to be around for the entire match, and can log back on at intervals in order to plan out turns over time.  I've enjoyed this game so far, though I will admit, it occasionally doesn't seem to follow its own rules and my characters seem to die in situations that they shouldn't.			"

												Do you like to play chess? Do you get satisfaction from destroying your opponents carefully laid plans with one swift move? We all do, don't we? And most of us have, in one time or another, sat for tedious hours planning entry points and drawing target lines in Rainbow Six (the original ones, mind you) or Jagged Alliance and gotten major kicks when these crazy plans actually worked. If you are one of us, then here's an order: get Frozen Synapse. It may resemble an 80's game, but trust me, it's a 100% pure strategy and psychology. You thought you could figure out what your opponent will do next? Think again! This is chess..with guns!			"

												Being a fan of tactical shooters, I'd picked up Frozen Synapse the second I'd heard of it. I'd gone in expecting the same levels of awesomeness I'd experienced in titles such as Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six.I wasn't disappointed.As I'm sure you've gathered by now, Frozen Synapse is a turn-based strategy game. Both teams piece together their plans, press the start button, and watch as the battle unfolds. The planning phase makes up the vast majority of the game, with most of your time spent fiddling with aiming directions, movement, testing the layout of your troops against every possible scenario and so on and so forth. It takes an incredible amount of time to plan out a turn that effectively lasts five seconds- but you'd better believe that they're some of the tensest five seconds I've ever experienced in gaming. Beyond its brilliant core gameplay, Frozen Synapse boasts an intriguing storyline and setting that's vague in all the right places along with an absolutely fantastic soundtrack. I'd fully recommend this to anybody with a love for tactical squad based combat and strategy. It's a great game. "

												Frozen Synapse is a nicely done tactics game, if a bit technical and hard to handle. Everything is manual, in the full sense of the word. You can't go rambo.Some negatives are the combat rules being so static.

I played hundreds of hours of FS before it ever came to steam. --The single player missions are pretty fun and decently challenging. --The multiplayer is hands down the best PvP I've ever seen. No p2w. No grind. No hardware advantage. No hackers. Your wits are the only thing that matters.			"

												Reminds me of some of the classic old-school games I played on my Apple 2! Great turn-based tactical squad shooter. Feels a bit like a puzzle game in some ways. Random map generation suggests that it's very replayable.You can compare it somewhat to an RTS in that you have multiple units to co-ordinate, but if you've ever wanted an RTS to be less frenetic and more focused on precision tactics, you'll probably enjoy this game.

												It's a turn-based strategy game that takes the ""luck"" aspect out by letting you run sims of what both your units and the enemy units do BEFORE confirming your turn. The fact that it comes in 2-packs is good, as well: it means that you can always play it with your friends. Speaking of which, the online is handled by e-mail: You get messaged when any current game you're in is ready for you. Basically, if you're a fan of strategy games, this should not be missed.Now if you'll excuse me, I need to re-strategise my next turn...			"

												Don't get fooled by the bad (almost non-existant) graphics. If you like turn-based tactical games, this game is definitely one of the best I've tried. It differs from other turn-based games in that this one has simultaneous turns, which means each side chooses its moves and then both are resolved at the same time. It's like pausing the game, selecting what your men should do, then unpausing, with the difference that you cannot pause again until the turn is finished, so if you screwed up, you can just watch your team die. This means you have to somehow ""guess"" what your opponent is going to do, which is not always obvious./The gameplay is very good, with some options I only saw in this game, like waiting time and ignore enemies (the first 2 that pop in my head). Planning path and actions for your team is easy, but sometimes the paths overlap and it's a bit confusing in my opinion.The difficulty curve for single player is ok, introducing the different classes in a good pace and allowing you to understand their pros and cons.8/10			"

												I love this game! No luck, simple mechanics but loads of strategy. A pretty easy game to get your head around (I recommend looking up a combat guide or game mechnics wiki as some aspects are not clear in game) but bloody hard to master. A really simple concept that creates a guge amount of tension. Seems like a lot of players have dropped of, maybe in favour of Frozen Synapse Prime, so finding a game to play then and there can be hard depending on when you log in.That said, there is no issue with playing a game for a few minutes every day over a couple of various games you have going, so long as they finish!Awesome game that will have you thinking and there's endless replay value to be had here. There is nothing better than outsmarting the person becasue you knew they would know that you knew they would know what you were going to do and catered for that with a stragtegic move from hell!

To put it short, I don't know how to proceed to the next game turn. I hit ""Prime"" and all my action results are simply discarded. I cannot pan the map and the GUI visuals are crappy looking and sometimes barely distinctible (I have a 2560x1440 display if that matters at all).The order in which actions like pause, duck or turn take place is not easily understandible. The devs didn't even bother to put together a *decent* tutorial in place of that piece of cow turd they are offering now.			"

												This is such a fun game. Quick to learn, and yet tons of endless strategy and fun. I've never played a game like it, and I totally love it. Get it! I've never come across a similar game, and if there are some, I would love to know about them.In Frozen Synapse, you have an endless variety of randomly generated maps to do battle on.You go through the planning phase, testing out tactics, giving your guys waypoints, telling them where to look, what enemies to engage or ignore. You can even give the enemy characters waypoints and instructions to test out what your enemy might do, or see if they get the drop on you if you make a certain move. You can try to anticipate their moves and make a bold decision that may backfire, or win you the game.After you've planned your turn you submit it, and it cannot be edited. When you and your opponent have both submitted, you see how your plans play out, for 5 seconds of action. (you can change the game length, but that's standard) You see what happened, then go back into the planning phase to play your next 5 seconds of action.There's a handful of game types and playmodes. My favorite is ""dark extermination,"" where your objective is to wipe out your opponents players, and, after the start, once you lose line of sight on a character, you no longer know where they are. You just see a ghost of where they were, and how many seconds since you saw them last, so you can use their ghost in the planning phase, and if you're right about where it is, you can test out some tactics for it, and against it, and see hat your options are, but you might be wrong about where it is.This is one of my all time favorite Steam games and it has a lot of replayability, because it's always a different game. Especially when you start building custom battles by choosing how many characters you get and of which classes, to make custom games.One last thing I'll mention, and I think it's a brilliant aspect of the game: You can have multiple games going with different people at the same time, and just switch back and forth. You'll get notifications when someone in a different game has submitted their turn. Often times people will play games in a reasonable amount of time, but sometimes someone will leave before the game finishes, and you'll find that hours later, or the next day, they submitted a new turn. It's not uncommon to have some games that end up playing out over the course of a day or 2. If someone abandons the game because they're losing, after a few days the game will be closed and you'll get the win on your stats.			"

												Frozen Synapse will make your head hurt, possibly in a good way. It's Flotilla with foot soldiers. You have a squad of guys who follow your orders to the letter; so does your enemy. The trick is you give orders in phases, and both sides execute their orders in real time. Ordered your men to walk up behind an enemy and blast him? Too bad, your enemy ordered that guy to turn around moments before you arrive.It's pure tactics with no chance or twitch gaming in the way. Each battle is mathmatically solvable (To the point that you can simulate fights before you commit to your moves), there's no element of random here. It's a hard concept to wrap your head around, and you'll probably lose even the first single player mission many times before you get it, but once you do, there's multiple game modes, multiplayer, and an engrossing campaign to keep you hooked.

												Quite an interesting and unique spin on turn based strategy games.  The game is fairly simple and straightforward, but planning out moves can take a while (if you get really in depth).  You don't even have to be around for the entire match, and can log back on at intervals in order to plan out turns over time.  I've enjoyed this game so far, though I will admit, it occasionally doesn't seem to follow its own rules and my characters seem to die in situations that they shouldn't.			"

												Do you like to play chess? Do you get satisfaction from destroying your opponents carefully laid plans with one swift move? We all do, don't we? And most of us have, in one time or another, sat for tedious hours planning entry points and drawing target lines in Rainbow Six (the original ones, mind you) or Jagged Alliance and gotten major kicks when these crazy plans actually worked. If you are one of us, then here's an order: get Frozen Synapse. It may resemble an 80's game, but trust me, it's a 100% pure strategy and psychology. You thought you could figure out what your opponent will do next? Think again! This is chess..with guns!			"

												I really thought I liked these types of games.  I enjoyed ""Breach and Clear"" so I thought I would also enjoy Frozen Synapse.  While the background elements are fine (helps explain the plain graphics), the micro-managing is a LOT more intense (that is, there was basically no micro-managing in Breach & Clear).  This is pretty cool.  Also, the AI is much more advanced, which is good training for multi-player (to a degree).  Where B&C was a simple single-player game, Frozen Synapse really shines in multi-player.  In fact, I'd recommend it for fans of the tactical/turn-based genre who solely like multiplayer.  For casual, single players, you might like it - but the campaign got frustrating really fast for me.  Sometimes my guys would not move at all and get picked off; the cpu could not only peg me from afar with an automatic weapon, but also turn and kill the guy who flanked him and was behind cover... nice.  For the CPU.  Several ""turns"" I was like, ""really?  REALLY?  Sure.""  That kind of frustration.But hey, in the end, it's all about polishing one's tactics and learning your opponent (whether they're a CPU or a human).  For the sale price (and linux support) it was a no-brainer to buy (and you do get two copies, since it is so multi-player, 1-on-1 heavy).  An excellent buy and incredible value.			"

I will recommend it because I really like the idea of the game but I found some issues annoying: Controls can be very awkward sometimes (and are not that intuitive), the menu is not very clear and it's easy to get lost AND the loading times between the phases of the game are IMO a little bit long.On the bright side, is  pure tactical game, a great idea a nicely executed.

												To say it in short: I love this game! To say a bit more: It is a tactical turn based game where the turns are prepared simultaneously by the players. This game can be played online and offline, against the AI in skirmish mode or in a campaign as well as against other players from around the world. It can be nailbiting while you watch the outcome and realize all your awesome and unbeatable planning goes down the toilet as your opponent does exactly what you didn't think of. And on the other hand, the feeling is great when you watch your plan unfold and you stomp the opponent into the ground. But the best thing is, if things go awry and you lose, you always know it had nothing to do with luck but all with the mistakes you did. It is a bit like chess where you have to plan your moves into the future and adapt to the strategies of your opponent. The units you (can) use range from machinegunners, to shotguns, rocket launcher and grenades to snipers and riot shilds. There are also differnt types of scenarios such as rescue hostages, secure a specific area or just plain extermination to name only a few. The most important thing about this game is that you cannot just rush in and shoot blindly. You have to use a tactical approach and plan your moves carefully. Your units don't have many hitpoints as in classical shooters. One hit and they are dead biomass. Buildings and covers can be destroyed by rockets. So depending on the units there might be not a save spot to just sit and wait. Another nice aspect of this game is, that you don't need to be permanently online. You can plan your moves offline. And soon as the turn result is there, you get notified of it and can prepare the next turn. So even for casual players who don't have much time, this is a good game to spend a few minutes for your turn and upload it. I really hope this game gets more attention as it surly deserves it. The grafics in Tron style and the nice soundtrack are really catchy. Very nice is also, that when you buy a game, you also get a second one to send to a friend. So would i recommend the game? Yes, definitely!			"

												Calm and calculating. These are necessary traits for late-game turns of Frozen Synapse, an intelligently crafted turn-based strategy game where action plays out in real-time, but at 5-second, pre-planned increments. With realistic combat, every unit matters, and the tense gameplay cannot be matched anywhere else. This is highly recommended to any fans of strategy games, especially turn-based.9 out of 10 - Nico			"

												Something to understand before playing this game: its not a game for the masses. It's not an extreamly popular genre, it has confusing controls, and one might even say that it has qwerky mechanics. But its a game unlike anything you've ever played before. Asyncronous Turn-Based Strategy. A brilliant idea, but where it excedes in Frozen Synapse is in the execution. This game could be reviewed by an unenlightened gamer as an ""annoying, confusing, turn-based strategy game"", but what it actually does is it makes you think. And then it makes you think again. And again. In the words of Sun Tzu:“To know your Enemy, you must become your Enemy.”You must think like your enemy. You must find every possible senerio and make a counter for each, or take a risk, and prepare for the most likely one. All the while knowing that your enemy is thinking just like you. It require a mental skillset that not only do most gamers not want to have to use, but do not have at all. However, if you think you have what it takes, and you think that you are able to not just think for yourself, but think for your enemy, and plan ten steps ahead, then this just may be the game you've been waiting for.

												An excellent deterministic game (no luck involved) at its core with different units that have strengths and weaknesses. I find it works in principle very similar to chess, another deterministic game without luck involved. Although this game has the advantage from a pure principle perspective in that there is no first move advantage; both players execute their moves simultaneously.Randomized maps can give one person an unlucky starting situation though, however I find that adds to the fun and keeps the game fresh. It also proves skill; its easy to memorize maps and with enough play through with different people, get an intuitive feel for what is common and what is not, and play accordingly. But with new maps generated and starting positions semi-random, it can really determine between two players who actually has adaptive skill, and who perhaps does not.I would recommend this game especially on discount for anyone who enjoys strategy/tactical games.

												Unlike XCOM and other turn-based strategies, where the main resource are factors like:cover, character states and generally chance.This game manages to remove the ""chance"" aspect and replace it with ""time"".Everything from turns to killing an opposing unit requires time. There is no chance, there is no blind luck, there are no 95% chance to hit *аnd then miss* moments, there is no RNGesus, there is none of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.This makes gameplay a lot less frustrating, more predictable and overall, more enjoyable.

												I really enjoy myself playing this game, it's very tactical, and having the ability to really control your troops down to when they crouch, when they hold fire, which way they look, adn more is just great. Every move there is always a few seconds of tension waiting for the turn to end as you watch your troops move and hopefully not get caught by the AI moving in a way you didn't expect or being faster than you hoped.I would easily recommend this game to anyone I know who likes tactical games.

												That game has a lot of potential, but it just doesn't make fun yet. I love the setting and how you can interact with the scene, that is awesome and I am looking to get that wallpaper for my server :) Looks and feels great.. BUT: The loading-time before you can see what happens, I mean, before every outcome, is way to long and totally unnecessary. I have a 3000USD machine and it takes 10-20sec? A timeline scroller or something like that would be way easier. It cannot be that complicated.. So I lost motivation..I also think that the game is to difficult / unfair (and yes, I love strategy games).  Both together tells me: that game is not yet finished, some work is left to do, but it's one the right direction!			"

												A fun little tactical strategy game. In a nutshell, you take turns telling your dudes what to do (shotgun dude, machine gun dude, rocket dude, sniper dude, grenade dude), then click play and see what happens.While not for everyone, Frozen Synapse is a great diversion for strategy enthusiasts. The story is kind of oddball - some kind of cyberterrorism thing going on... The real meat of the game is in the strategy. A little pricey at 19.99, but you do get two copies of the game. A rare, slightly flawed gem.			"

The ability to essentially play by mail makes it all the more worthwhile. If you have not played a game of this type, it takes some getting used to, but the tutorial does a very good job at teaching basics, which is essentially all there is. The rest of the games is tactics. As one of the Achievements says, ""True Focus Means Ignoring That Which Is Irrelevant"". By far, the greatest strategy title i have played first hand.			"

It's awesome.Some complain that it takes a long time to understand and i can see that side of the game, But I've pretty much learned every tactic and movetype within 20 minutes of gameplay.

												Intelligent and brilliant! It removes everything I dislike about RTS games... mainly the real time. I'll admit it, I can't manage 20 units at once. But when the action stops, I can take my time and plan my checkmate. A very cool, very different game. There's a sequel now that I really want to check out. There are still a good amount of people who still play multiplayer, surprisingly enough. Shows how great this game is.			"

												Although it's a very hard game to get your head around initially, I highly recommend it.  The timing mechanism was confusing until I watched some videos, and the single player campaign was impossible until I searched for information on how the different unit types interact during combat.  Peeking around corners does not provide any cover, but unit cover (low objects), range and state (movement), are the three keys you'll need to understand to smash this game wide open.It is a highly addictive time waster that is both fun and challenging!

												The game is fun, i can tell you that. The multiplayer is kinda stupid with finding and leaving a game because its does not seem to give me any sign of when another player has left the match (what i have experienced). The game would be better if you could create levels from scratch and maybe have more players in the match when playing multiplayer. The AI seems a little overpowerd like it knows where you are going (again from my experience) and in the campaign they have way to many troops that can just kill you like that.When you have played it some time you start enjoying it but only after some time.But overall it is a good game with a 7 out of 10 from me :D			"

												Being a fan of tactical shooters, I'd picked up Frozen Synapse the second I'd heard of it. I'd gone in expecting the same levels of awesomeness I'd experienced in titles such as Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six.I wasn't disappointed.As I'm sure you've gathered by now, Frozen Synapse is a turn-based strategy game. Both teams piece together their plans, press the start button, and watch as the battle unfolds. The planning phase makes up the vast majority of the game, with most of your time spent fiddling with aiming directions, movement, testing the layout of your troops against every possible scenario and so on and so forth. It takes an incredible amount of time to plan out a turn that effectively lasts five seconds- but you'd better believe that they're some of the tensest five seconds I've ever experienced in gaming. Beyond its brilliant core gameplay, Frozen Synapse boasts an intriguing storyline and setting that's vague in all the right places along with an absolutely fantastic soundtrack. I'd fully recommend this to anybody with a love for tactical squad based combat and strategy. It's a great game. "

												Frozen synapse is a stratergy/tactical game that's one of a kind. Whilst games like Rainbow Six thrust you deep in, this has you plan out your attack turn by turn whilst not knowing what your enemy is doing and vice versa- whom your soldiers make light cannon fodder in during the planning may have escaped or, worst of all, taken one of your guys it.Pull your plan off and it gives you a REALLY nice feeling inside knowing you kicked some serious♥♥♥♥♥of either the AI or another player.I'm not that much of a TBS fan (I prefer RTS), but I highly recommend you grab it.

Even the most well thought out strategies can crumble when the smallest of details (for example, whether or not your unit is running or aiming down sight) can change the outcome of an entire battle. Place an interesting story over top this challenge and add a unique gameplay with colorfully simplistic visuals and you have an interesting game that you're sure to spend hours on.			"

												This'll be a short review because I got a lot of turns pending :DFrozen Synapse is a turn-based strategy-game similar to Breach&Clear but with a more intense focus on multiplayer.Overview:The game is set in a future world in the city Markov Geist. The reality has become divided into the real world, controlled by humans, and the shape, something like a second reality that can be accessed through the widespread wireless network that has been established over the years. It's home of so called shapeforms which I won't explain in detail.The setting is somewhat similar to that of the Shadowrun Universe (Cyberpunk).Gameplay:As there are so many other reviewers out there who already explained the gameplay in detail, I will just sum up my impressions. The game easy to learn but hard as f*** to master. You are given a small tutorial which explains the basic commands and teaches you how to chain them and plan your turn. Then you're on your own to figure out what to do with that information. I suggest playing the campaign a little before jumping into multiplayer.The mechanics are fair although sometimes frustrating since who kills who depends on a list of factors you have to be aware of and at times they are not that easy to assess. But that's what makes this game great. It really forces you to THINK about what to do next!The graphics speak for themselves. Simple yet stylish. You get a good overview of the map and there are no irrelevant objects. If you can see it, it has a function -> Good guys, bad guys, cover, walls. That's it.Summing up I did not regret paying 7€ for this. If you also want to play Coop, buy the Red DLC. Only one of the Coop-Players needs it for coop to work which I think is really well done!

												First off I'd like to say, if you have a computer with Windows 8 don't bother with this game. It won't launch due to an OpenGL error. (Or maybe that was my computer)Luckily I managed to find an older computer that would work with this game, and I have to say this game does provide a lot of scenario planning and even the slightest thing such as wrongly predicting where the enemy will stop as he approaches you, will turn your plan to successfully flank the enemy's shotgunner and drive the enemy to fallback, into giving your whole squad bullet wound shaped tatoos.  But if you like spending a bit of time planning out yours and your enemy moves then watching the enemy do something you never planned they would do then this the game for you.8.5/10			"

												This is my first time reviewing a game on Steam, but I think this is the right game to review as I enjoy it so much. I was first exposed to this game through the iPad. I was looking around online for a competitive turn-based strategy game, one that would be fast-paced yet satisfying. Different names came up across the Web, but Frozen Synapse was consistently showing up throughout forums and blogs. I decided to give it a go.At first, being that it was my first time ever being exposed to a simultaneous TBS, it took a little getting used to the concept. But that was accomplished after the first mission in the campaign. The trickier parts are predicting who wins a gun-fight in a given scenario and understanding all the orders you can give and when. These come with continuous exposure and practice.The game definitely requires strategy and good planning, but it also allows for randomness to affect a match at times, such as when neither you nor your opponent know where the other is. The learning curve isn't anywhere near as steep as for other strategy or tactical games, which means you'll probably get the hang of it after the first couple of missions in campaign or matches online. Because each round online lasts a few seconds, you don't have to worry about wasting action points (there are none), rather, you get freedom to give as many orders to your units as you feel necessary to keep them safe and to ensure they are always in an advantageous position. And because there are only a few units in the game and you don't really need to worry about stats, everyone knows what to expect from the enemy in terms of units and capabilities.The campaign mode seems legit. I played about 7 missions perhaps, give or take, and they vary from simple to challenging. The online mode, though, is where it's at. There are many game modes in online, from a simple team death match to hostage rescuing scenarios. It seems there's always someone to play against, and you and the other player can decide how fast-paced the game should be. I once played a match that lasted only a few minutes when we were both online and another time I matched with someone and we took almost a week to finish the match. You get notifications when it's your turn to make a move. And you can start a match on your iPad and finish it on your computer or vice versa. The only downside is that your progress on your PC or iPad for the campaign stays put - that doesn't transfer.To summarize, the game is easy to get into, very addictive, requires strategy but leaves a little room for luck, has an excellent multiplayer system with diverse scenarios/modes, the gameplay can be rather fast, and it allows you to play between devices. Obviously I recommend this game to anyone who is even slightly inclined to tactical sorts of games.			"

												Although it may look a little lack lustre, Frozen Synapse is in fact a very deep turn-based strategy in the vein of XCOM or Heroes of Might & Magic with a twist: once you and your opponent decide your units' moves, it becomes a real-time action sequence and your strategy goes against theirs. The story became gripping and the characters very interesting. It's a mix of corporate espionage, rebellion, and a war of beliefs coming together to make a fantastic singleplayer.On the multiplayer side, it comes with the added benefit of being asynchronous (after you setup your strategy, you can wander off for hours while your opponent decides; kind of like chess by mail). The game modes are neat and varied and seting up a match is pretty easy. Another plus, the people I played against were gratious and felt like a great community.Finally, after listening to the trailers, I decided to buy the soundtrack, and boy was it worth it! Still in my play list today.			"

												This thing is raw stategy. You have a squad of ""vatforms,"" essentially clones into which orders can be plugged. You must provide those orders in this turn-based squad combat game. Except it doesn't feel so turn based, because after each planning phase where you meticulously plotted routes and arcs of fire for your units, all the action hashes out in real time.The game basically does a bunch of behind the scenes math to come up with the result, taking into account cover, movement, range, wepon type, etc. After a bit, you catch on to the basic rules of who's going to survive a given one on one encounter, and you can start testing strategies by running real time simulations of enemy movements (with orders given by you based on what you think they might do) before you submit each turn.Add to the rock solid core mechanics a compelling story, holographic computer simulation graphics style, and awesome soundtrack, and you have top notch game.Did I mention there's procedurally generated maps and multiplayer?

												It is hard to fit this game into a Genre. Obviously it is a strategy game, and it has turns, but it is not a turn-based strategy game per se. You see, Turn based Strategy like XCOM or Civilization often rely on the simple scheme of Player A, then Player B, then Player A etc. Frozen Synapse however takes a unique approach on it: Both Players at the same time. Each turn takes 5 seconds where each player has to plan the movements of their units - at the same time. Once both players are happy with what their units are going to do they hit the ""Prime"" button, and the scenario is played out. At this stage there is nothing the player can do to inflcuence the outcome. You can't command your units and have to watch as they win or loose, based on what you told them to do. This concept might sound weird at first but it allows for very balanced gameplay as no player has an advantage. You as the player are just a camera from above commanding the units, waiting for them to fulfull their orders. It allows for a higher strategial depth, a 5 second turn can take 5+ minutes to figure out. The game provides a ""simluation"" button, where youc an preview what your units will do. You can, at the same time, give the enemy units commands for the purpose of simulating to test your scenario. It is easy to get lost in the amount of tinkering you need to do, and you never know what is going to happen. Overall this game is game is great, it offers a great breath of fresh air into the genre of strategy games. I would suggest waiting for Frozen Synpase 2, as it will release in ""Late 2016"". It looks like this game and probably playes like it as well. If you can't wait or just want a great game in your library buy this.			"

There is no chance, there is no blind luck, there are no 95% chance to hit *аnd then miss* moments, there is no RNGesus, there is none of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.This makes gameplay a lot less frustrating, more predictable and overall, more enjoyable.

The only downside is that your progress on your PC or iPad for the campaign stays put - that doesn't transfer.To summarize, the game is easy to get into, very addictive, requires strategy but leaves a little room for luck, has an excellent multiplayer system with diverse scenarios/modes, the gameplay can be rather fast, and it allows you to play between devices. Obviously I recommend this game to anyone who is even slightly inclined to tactical sorts of games.			"

												Frozen Synapse is a simple to learn but deep tactical combat game. The main story is quite well written and engaging with challenging missions while the multiplayer is fun and brutal. If you like a good RTS or tactical game and want a challenge that will keep you coming back for more then try Frozen Synapse. It will be well worth your time.			"

												This game is so in-depth its insane. But it's so good. Frozen Synapse is an odd blend of turn based strategy and squad tactics. Turns don't play out like in Civ5 for example, they play out in 5 second intervals. Both you and the enemy will act out the moves you both planned whenever the end turn button is pressed.The way the multiplayer works means games can be both casually played one round a day over the course of a week or you can become a full on fanatic of the game if you wanted. The soundtrack is also one of the best I have ever heard. Very ambient, but in a good way. It suits the setting and atmosphere of the game really really well, the setting being very cyberpunkish and is done very well.Overall I would give it a big recommendation. I would only recommend it though to slightly more hardcore audiences, casual players might be put off a bit.			"

												Simultaneously turnbased, top-down strategy game. Although there isn't that much activity online, I highly recommend grabbing this game if you see it on sale, which it has been for AUD$5 and under. Great soundtrack and art style, and a highly competitive gameplay, fully customizable multiplayer/skirmish modes and various gametypes. I've not yet played through the story, but I like this game enough to take up anyone who offers to give me a match in it. If you can find a few mates to play this with regularly, you'll probably get your money's worth, but because of how diminishing the server populations are, I cannot guarantee a good playerbase when you get it.If there is a demo or free weekend, definitely check it out.

												In a market over-saturated with instant-satisfaction run-and-gun shooters, there has been a lingering void of video games that focus heavily on tactical decision-making, deception and patience. Frozen Synapse not only fills this void but also offers gameplay that remains and will remain addictive and satisfying for years to come. What makes this turn-based, strategic game extremely gratifying is the ability to not only issue complex multi-layered orders to each of your own individual units but also the ability to issue the same extent of orders to the units of your opponent — providing the capability to explore and simulate how you might expect your opponent to carry out his or her next move. Regardless of whether or not your opponent reacts in the way you might have prognosticated, the anticipation to see the outcome of the next move can at times be overwhelmingly exhilarating. This coupled with an exceptional soundtrack and visuals is indicative of how excellent indie games can be.			"

I'll wait until the new Jagged Alliance comes out and play it instead. Sorry Frozen Synapse you don't make the grade for turn based shooters in my books.			"

												One of the Best Asynchronous Turnbased Strategy Games i know.Each player plots his turn, and selects which actions his units are gonna take. And once both players decide to submit the decisions, the game will plot out the plan. This may sound very vague but due to the ability to simulate any possible order the opponent may give his units, it quickly comes down to mind games. While there is a Single Player mode i can not recommend it past learning the game. Your mileage may vary but i did not like the campain, even though the story was quite interesting.			"

												This game is just incredible. The design appears simple, but there's so much depth to the strategy that it becomes both addicting and hugely tense in short order. Anticipating enemy movements, adapting to contingencies, and determining the best way to use the forces at your disposal make the gameplay immensely rewarding. The simultaneous turn resolution throws in further decision-making concerns and makes strategy development that much more dynamic and exciting. The soundtrack is phenomenal, as well, and really helps to enhance the cyberpunk world you inhabit. Snippets of the text dialogue could use some touching up, but information is communicated well and characterizations are done competently.Frozen Synapse is everything I want from a tactical game, in the sense of both gameplay and presentation. An absolute masterclass indie product!			"

												I personally don't like shooter games, so Frozen Synapse was not a natural purchase for me. It came highly recommended, though, and I personally woudl say that I do not regret buying it. There's something very satisfying about this tactical strategy shooter: setting up a plan of attack, viewing its potential outcome and reviewing every single step of the attack process. When you see a well-planned attack go off perfectly with pinpoint precision, you come away feeling like a god.There's only one downside: there's no steam cloud backup of your data. This is one game that really needs it, especially with Steam's potential plans to make its games available on Tablets. With data backed up onto the cloud, you'd be able to play at home or on the go without much hassle. This is not possible.			"

Each turn spans a 5 second window of time. You see what happens and then you make another move to cover another 5 seconds of the action.There are a good amount of modes and plenty of unit types to keep things fresh and exciting. It has a few bugs/flaws and a lot of untapped potential (they're making a sequel!!), but never gets old.8.5/10			"

There is no chance, there is no blind luck, there are no 95% chance to hit *аnd then miss* moments, there is no RNGesus, there is none of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.This makes gameplay a lot less frustrating, more predictable and overall, more enjoyable.

Good luck with that lol. I've lost most of my guys in the first move sometimes, but still able to comeback or at least take out most of their guys. It's all about strategy and knowing what each unit can/cannot do, and the moves available.It's turn-based, so even in a multiplayer game you can leave and come back to the same game, and play multiple different games.

												Excellent concept of turn-based strategy with real-time execution. Clever ideas of what affects the units' ability to react and nice gametypes. Unfortunately the game only supports 1v1 and so gets boring fast and makes it hard to get friends to get it (since we all like playing together).Other than that the replay feature, along with everyone's past games being available to see, makes it interesting to watch, not just play.

												Hi all. Im fan of tactics but this is awful. May be good idea, good feaches but interface, ordering,  battle zone overview vary bad. Long long ago in 2005 was game with exactly such idea - Alfa antiterror (Russian).  It was like AI simulator. This is the same. But without graphics. For creators: add enemy Icons in the sides of the screen. Even if enemy not if viewport now player will see it.Next. After eccepting turns - First big wolds than very fast rendering and againg programming every unit every step. IGive more time to see battle, make word smaller not to close battle view. Next - add possibility to move map not only by arrows (wtf, actient realisation) but with mouse also (may be two buttons + plus movement) Very unfriendly game. I will try it more and may be more. But only because Im fan of this type of games. But for now it is far from the end.			"

												Frozen Synapse will make your head hurt, possibly in a good way. It's Flotilla with foot soldiers. You have a squad of guys who follow your orders to the letter; so does your enemy. The trick is you give orders in phases, and both sides execute their orders in real time. Ordered your men to walk up behind an enemy and blast him? Too bad, your enemy ordered that guy to turn around moments before you arrive.It's pure tactics with no chance or twitch gaming in the way. Each battle is mathmatically solvable (To the point that you can simulate fights before you commit to your moves), there's no element of random here. It's a hard concept to wrap your head around, and you'll probably lose even the first single player mission many times before you get it, but once you do, there's multiple game modes, multiplayer, and an engrossing campaign to keep you hooked.

												It's a turn-based strategy game that takes the ""luck"" aspect out by letting you run sims of what both your units and the enemy units do BEFORE confirming your turn. The fact that it comes in 2-packs is good, as well: it means that you can always play it with your friends. Speaking of which, the online is handled by e-mail: You get messaged when any current game you're in is ready for you. Basically, if you're a fan of strategy games, this should not be missed.Now if you'll excuse me, I need to re-strategise my next turn...			"

												Don't get fooled by the bad (almost non-existant) graphics. If you like turn-based tactical games, this game is definitely one of the best I've tried. It differs from other turn-based games in that this one has simultaneous turns, which means each side chooses its moves and then both are resolved at the same time. It's like pausing the game, selecting what your men should do, then unpausing, with the difference that you cannot pause again until the turn is finished, so if you screwed up, you can just watch your team die. This means you have to somehow ""guess"" what your opponent is going to do, which is not always obvious./The gameplay is very good, with some options I only saw in this game, like waiting time and ignore enemies (the first 2 that pop in my head). Planning path and actions for your team is easy, but sometimes the paths overlap and it's a bit confusing in my opinion.The difficulty curve for single player is ok, introducing the different classes in a good pace and allowing you to understand their pros and cons.8/10			"

												A fun little tactical strategy game. In a nutshell, you take turns telling your dudes what to do (shotgun dude, machine gun dude, rocket dude, sniper dude, grenade dude), then click play and see what happens.While not for everyone, Frozen Synapse is a great diversion for strategy enthusiasts. The story is kind of oddball - some kind of cyberterrorism thing going on... The real meat of the game is in the strategy. A little pricey at 19.99, but you do get two copies of the game. A rare, slightly flawed gem.			"

												Frozen Synapse is what you get when you try to combine a strategy game like starcraft with turn based mechanic. What makes this game unique is that it lets you simulate enamy movement which opens your mind to possibillities and multiple actions you can take to achieve victory. The singleplayer aspect of the game as far the story part is kinda weak but the game was not ment for singleplayer it was ment to be played with humans and their tedency to exploit or be unpredictable unlike the A.I.'s. Something else that makes the game unique is the procedurally generated levels this ensure that the game is not allways play the same.Final Verdict 4/5			"

												An amazing tactical achievement. Frozen Synapse has a easy to learn, hard to master vibe. One mistake can mean instant death for your units. This game is turn based where the moves are executed at the same time. It's unlike anything I'vve ever played. I love this game. That means you should buy it. :)			"

There is nothing quite like the feeling you'll get when you successfully out guess your opponent. The Enjoyable music is also a plus.Try the demo today!			"

The Steam description doesn't do the game justice, and it's only after you dive into the game (even a simple match vs the CPU) does the game's complexity become apparent.Most definitely a title worth checking out!

												It's a turn based game where you control a SWAT team of sorts. You don't know what the opponent is planning—and in some modes, you can't see them if they're not in your line of sight.It has a demo, so go try it out if you're still uncertain.There are some criticisms I have to mention:The controls can feel a bit clunky at times. It's a minor complaint but it's worth mentioning.What isn't a minor complaint is the stability of this game. This game crashes a lot, especially during level editing and the campaign. I keep losing progress in both areas, so I stopped using those two features and continued playing the relatively-stable skirmish mode with other players.Besides those criticisms, this game is still a lot of fun to play. There is a Frozen Synapse 2 which might be more stable, but I can't confirm that as I haven't played it yet.			"

												This is a great game of tactics. Simultaneous order execution is the perfect implementation for this type of game. It also supports a play-by-email format, of sorts. Simply start a game and issue orders. Once your opponent has issued orders, the orders are resolved and the next turn becomes available for both players to log in, view the previous turn outcome and then issue orders anew. Really great game. Prime looks like a waste of time and money. FS2 looks like it could be a worthy successor.			"

												I'm absolutely astonished by this game. Agreed, the graphics are not much to look at, but the gameplay more than makes up for it. This is tactical excellence to the fullest.Basicly, you take full control of a squad of infiltrators, and have to eliminate the opposing force. Micromanagement is a must if you want to succeed in this game, and this makes the planning sequence of the game crucial to your success. Turns are in 5 second intervals that you have to plan out in advance, and not knowing what the enemy will do can have lethal consequences if you're sloppy in your planning.If you're impatient of nature, this is NOT a game for you, especially in multiplayer where waiting for the other player to finish the planning can be quite long.But if you like turn based strategy and tactics, the gameplay will keep you hooked for hours.IMPORTANT !Buying this game will grant you TWO copies of the game, so you can gift a copy to a friend, or trade it for something else with another user.

One of the best Tactical and Strategic games for sure, and once a match is complete, its really cool to watch the entire thing from the start.And I love how short the matches really are. You probably put anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes planning and placing your soldiers, but once the match has ended completely and you watch it over, EVERYTHING in 30s-2 minutes, which really makes it feel, IMO.

												Intelligent and brilliant! It removes everything I dislike about RTS games... mainly the real time. I'll admit it, I can't manage 20 units at once. But when the action stops, I can take my time and plan my checkmate. A very cool, very different game. There's a sequel now that I really want to check out. There are still a good amount of people who still play multiplayer, surprisingly enough. Shows how great this game is.			"

												The following is a preview I did of Frozen Synapse prior to release back in 2011.  Six years later, and it still holds true:There’s a big cyberpunk game looming on the digital horizon and I can’t wait for it to arrive.  No, it’s not that game, the one with the illustrious heritage – albeit I am anxiously awaiting it, too.  Rather, it is Mode 7’s Frozen Synapse, a game of simultaneous turn-based tactics that I believe is going to knock the socks off of a lot of gamers.  Here’s why….Frozen Synapse’s gameplay harkens back to those great days when deep, turn-based tactical warfare titles, such as the classic Computer Ambush and X-COM, were rather commonplace.  Like its predecessors, Frozen Synapse core gameplay mechanic revolves around plotting detailed combat orders for each of your soldiers (or “vatforms” in Frozen Synapse cyber-lingo), and using them as a team to beat the opposition.  Because each of your units are armed with a specific weapon, such as a machine gun, sniper rifle, rocket launcher, bouncy grenade launcher or shotgun, the player needs to carefully consider the strengths and weaknesses of each of his men before committing to a plan.  For example, if your team has a lot of shotguns, you better plan on a CQ battle, while a lot of sniper rifles or rockets would suggest the opportunity to engage the foe from a greater range.   The player must also consider the terrain at hand.  In Frozen Synapse, maps, which are usually randomly generated and of varying size, have an office-like layout involving discreet ‘cubicles’ built from full or half walls.  If the map is densely populated with such structures, count on a game of cat and mouse as both sides take advantage of abundant cover to close with the enemy.  However, if the map is more open, then things become somewhat simpler with shots being exchanged from a longer range.  In such situations, situational awareness can be more valuable than stealthy maneuvering.  Regardless of the map type, though, the tactical picture will always be challenging and demand imagination from the player.Fortunately, Frozen Synapse’s user interface is well designed to allow the player to craft his plan to his liking with a minimum of fuss.  With just a few clicks, the player can place waypoints that his unit will follow; this is the foundation for any plan.  However, tactical ingenuity comes into play when the player builds on this foundation by issuing a number of more refined commands to these waypoints, something that can swing the tide of battle.  For example, the player might want to issue a facing command that sets up a field of fire, something that will give an edge in acquiring a potential target.  Or he might want to change a unit’s stance, such as when sneaking past a half wall by crouching.  Other commands provide other options, such as focusing on a particular enemy, or delaying the execution of a particular command, such as telling a unit to halt for a few seconds so as to sneak past an enemy when he has his backed turned.  Because of Frozen Synapse’s well thought-out and slick UI, the player can craft remarkably detailed plans with a minimum of effort.  Best of all, Frozen Synapse even includes a preview option so that the player can test out his orders to make sure they are executed to his liking.Now, one thing that separates Frozen Synapse from many older tactical games is that it is “simultaneous turn-based”, sometimes referred to as “WEGO”.  In other words, the player and his opponent, be it the clever AI or another human, do not alternate taking turns, but rather simultaneously plot orders and submit them.  The game then crunches the results and produces a remarkably tense and exciting ten second movie that will have you howling with rage when your plan goes awry, or cheering when it all works out as planned.  Battles will often seesaw back and forth across multiple turns, with most resolving themselves in about six to eight turns, making for short but thrilling games.Frozen Synapse, even in its beta stage, is already packed with so much content that it puts the DLC-ready offerings of the bigger studios to shame.  For example, right out of the box players will have a chance to play their way through a fifty-five mission – that’s 55! – cyberpunk-themed campaign that will involve a variety of mission types, including simple assaults, assassinations, heists and more.  These missions take place on maps that are semi-random in terrain, which should add greatly to replayability, as well as the challenge factor.  As you work through the campaign, an interesting narrative is unveiled about various splinter organizations trying to overthrow the cyber-overlords of the city of Markov Geist, something that makes the individual missions all the more meaningful and enjoyable – which is unusual for a turn-based game such as this.But what if you are more of a multiplayer type of gamer?  Well, Frozen Synapse has you covered here.  Frozen Synapse features a remarkably robust set of multiplayer options and features that would seem to keep players busy for a long time.  Players can select from a wide assortment of mission types, from simple elimination games, to hostage rescue, securing territory and more, with “light” and “dark” variants available – these determine whether or not the player can always see the location of his opponent’s units (i.e., fog of war is in effect).  If you’re really adventurous, Frozen Synapse even offers a game editor that allows the player to set all sorts of options for a game, including map size, unit type, or even specify a “symmetrical” set-up.  Perhaps the best part of Frozen Synapses multiplayer component is how it is all neatly contained on Mode 7’s “Grand Server”, something that takes all the hassles out of the normal multiplayer procedures for turn-based games, such as finding an opponent or manually exchanging files.  Mode 7’s server does all the work, from arranging games, to automatically processing submitted turns and notifying opponents when the results are available.  The server even tracks your ranking and allows for players to save replays of their favorite games, or share them with others on the server or via the handy and effortless YouTube exporter.  It is a testament to the power and functionality of Frozen Synapse’s multiplayer component that even during this pre-release beta stage, 64 players were online when last I checked!Tying this whole package together is an artistically slick visual style well suited to a cyberpunk-themed game, and a musical soundtrack that strikes the right tone and sounds great.  Add in a well thought-out and easily navigated menu system, and Frozen Synapse is a remarkably polished game in its current beta build.Last year, when I first heard about Frozen Synapse, I was very supportive.  The idea of old school tactical gaming married to WEGO gameplay was sufficiently exciting to get me to pry open my wallet and buy into the project – something I very rarely do.  You could say I was cautiously optimistic.   Since trying this late build beta, you could say my attitude has shifted:  I am no longer cautiously optimistic; rather, I am now…wildly enthusiastic!  This is a title that is packed with gameplay well in excess of its meager pre-release price of $25.99.  While the final jury decision must remain out until the finished product is available for review, I am finding it increasingly difficult to stifle my love for what Mode 7 has already accomplished.  Time will tell, but I suspect this is a game that will be shooting to the top of my playlist and remaining there for a very long time.			"

												Frozen Synapse - Raymond KTI swear this may be one of the only darn games that you need to play the tutorial to understand how to play the game.  But besides that, this game was and is excellent. I heard of this game from the PC Gamer magazine when it first came out. I won this game, I wouldn’t buy it. Over 20$ is too much for me (My opinion whtevr) Thanks to the 2014 holiday I was able to achieve this game I was looking forward to playing. It was exactly what I thought it would be.Complete fraud. The game is PBEM by nature, but has no method whatsoever of notifying you that your turn is up, without actually loading into the game. Multiplayer is dead. Additionally it also has serious performance issues even if you care to only play the single player. I have very mixed emtions about this game.. i honestly don't think i'll recommend this one.			"
