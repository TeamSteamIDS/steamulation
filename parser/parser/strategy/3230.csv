												Let me start by saying that while I do recommend this game, the Steam version has given people some problems; some say they have had errors on trying to launch, which I have not had, and others have said they have had some in-game oddities such as ships not loading, which I did encounter and initially kept me from advancing past the 2nd map.The steam version is missing a couple of folders. It is silly but adding these empty folders resolves some of the problems such as the ships not loading. Click Read More if needed to see the fix.--Go to your Steam directory. In Steam\steamapps\common\Genesis RisingCreate three new folders called 'replay','temp', and 'save' (without quotes)Then in Steam\steamapps\common\Genesis Rising\dataCreate a new folder called 'scripts' (without quotes)--[Many thanks to Future2012 who originally posted this fix.]Other than that I didn't get any errors on Win7 64-bit when launching it so I don't know if compatibility mode would help or if it is an OS or driver issue. When I did the above fix I have been able to play through several missions without incident.All that said, the game itself is really good and has everything from voice acting to cutscenes and a story with some deep religious undertones if you care for that, and if not then you still get to blow lots of stuff up and capture enemy ships and bases. In fact there are countless decisions you get to make about how you want to set up your ships and even which ships you want to take. Moreover I pose that you have likely never played a space game quite like it, as it has elements of RTS thrown in and on top of that your ships are ALIVE and can be genetically modified to suit your desires, and changed on the fly to boot. Plus the music and visuals are quite appealing, so if you can get it to work then it is easily worth $5 or more. Good luck!			"

												I do recommend this game, as it is very unique, even though the story is lacking any depth. I like the bioships, upgradable, custom builds, multiple endings.Sadly I can´t give it a thumbs up, because the game crashes within the first few missions. I would gladly change my review if the developers would release a patch/working version.NOT WORKING, DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION.Update:I tried the fix proposed by Sparta (the review below mine), be warned: Does not the fix the issue of the game crashing (for me at least).Tried again on a different machine, because I´d really like to play this game again. Sadly the same crash occurs at the same point.			"

												Here's a game that on the surface is quite interesting; first it's an rts in spaaaaaaace. Points right there.Ships are customizable, and the take on how the ships work (read - organic ships, with your main resource being 'blood') is certainly different.But it all still falls flat; Its buggy - but not unforgivingly so, The cut scenes where  juvenile to just plain boring. The ship combat was middling at best and restricted to a 2D plane and missions are nothing to write home about.In the end the game has many problems easily forgivable on their own but this entire game is just one misstep after another. Get on special or not at all.			"

												After much looking at Youtube about this game, I broke down and bought it for the $2.50 on the Winter Holiday Sale. Unfortunately, on the very first mission my ship won't load which prevents me from finishing or even starting. I also have errors when I click the start button in my library. You can click through the 8+ errors and still launch but that never instills faith when starting a game. I would love to recommend Genesis Rising because of the concept, the music, and being able to enjoy the dying genre of space RTS but,  when there isn't a feasible work-around to the bugs or errors you have to call it what it is. As of right now, the game is not playable.			"

												After I recieved a message from my supposed best friend of six years to buy this game, I was a little dismayed to find out it was in fact complete and utter rubbish and I would have been better placed to bet my money on the Queen's Head sunday league team winning the champions league. First of all to make the game even playable you have to edit folders and such sorcery in the game's root directory. I do not want to be doing this. I'm one of those people that still believe computers are run by magic. I just want to play. Fortunatly for me, my 'friend' talked me through the set-up and his timeless advice of 'press ok until it works' when faced with error messages only four seconds into the game really displayed his numerous IT qualifications.We both bought it with the intention of playing co-op, however I discovered after three minutes of sheer laughter down my microphone that online support had been withdrawn. Luckily for me the only option that I could access from the main menu was the credits.I discovered during watching the credits that the game had four advisors. I Would have thought that the first advice would be to make sure it works. At the time of writing my ex-friend is showing on steam as playing this game, I am sad to say he is silent. Dumbstruck.I'd like to end on a positive however as i know a lot of hard work goes into developing titles, The credits are lovely. Well Done Advised Advisors. Well Done "

												Bought it at 75% off and i can't say i'm disappointed at that price. At first i couldn't get it to run, then i disabled Steam community In-Game and the game runs properly now. That was the only problem i had with the game. Voice acting is kinda wooden and lame at times, but the gameplay is solid and challenging with some nice and hard space battles. The idea of organic ships is original and the graphics are quite nice while exploring and battling other factions. Overall a nice little space strategy game. (If you manage to get it to work, which is the most common complaint about this game)			"

												Well, I completed it!It's a graphically pleasing game and I enjoyed the genes configuring of the ships and stations to suite whatever mission purpose. Interesting approach to fleet building.I did experience bugs - Memory low and a few other CTDs - setting graphics to medium may have lessened these crashes alot. I owned this originally on DVD years back and the same errors happened on that one too. Characters are ok, same with voice acting.  Nothing out of the ordinary on the missions. Religious rule backed by military based plot so expected something along what Star Trek V gave us. Even including a high-jacking too!Its fine if you want a game in the Homeworld style vein don’t expect it to exceed that in any way that as that truly a masterpiece.As others have said get it on a sale – Its ok. There’s worse things to spend a few quid on here. "

Once you get a “Shader Error” there's no hope… this Game seems not to recognise an NVDIA Video Card (I guess it's too old and they didn't update it)!My Final Say: Although it had its moment of glory, now this game is as dead as Count Dracula… and just as troublesome, as it will easily crash your PC!

												Back in the day when I had a Windows XP, I used to play this game A LOT. Got it from a Big Lots for like 6 bucks and took 3 or 4 cd's to download. It was unique (and weird in a way) but VERY entertaining. This version, and many like it, doesn't seem to work on Windows 7's. I looked into it and it seemed way to complicated to fix. When you start this up it will hint you with a message, then another, then another. Until you just cannot bare any longer and just hold down the ENTER key till it starts. Once it starts up everything is fine. However in the middle of loading the 1st mission (and if you even get passed that, those too do this) will create a dump file. Taking up reletively no space in your hard drive, but it's there. Anyway it also may freeze AND if you even get passed that to get to the actual first mission where young Icona gets his first ship. Everything is red and black checkers. A lot of missing textures and such. However there are fixes for these and its all over the discussions. I also have my own way that fixed it.			"

												I feel this game can really be summed up in one sentence, but I'm needlessly verbose so I'll waffle on anyway, but for the sake of being concise, here's a tl;dr.tl;dr, I woke up to find the person I was sleeping next to had soiled my bed, it was still less unpleasant than this game.Boring, repetitive and cliche, the touted innovation in being able to morph your ships on the fly really isn't as cool as it sounds because in practice it comes down to the choice between being able to debuff your enemy with a laughably weak debuff, or equip extra rockets. The game functions, which is more than I can say for a lot of games but it's so boring, simplistic and bare that what's the point?Also the unit variety is shameful, a worker shared between factions, a capital ship, light, medium and heavy cruisers respectively. So that's what... three actual combat ships you can make per side? There's a few mercenary ships, but they can't be upgraded with extra rocket launchers so they aren't relevant.Basic maths aside, you probably shouldn't buy this game, it's a waste of money and if you desperately need to lose money then give it to a homeless person or buy a Freddo bar or something, anything but this.2.5/10.

												Genesis Rising: The Universal Crusade is the only tactical space combat game I know of which uses the idea of organiform spaceships which is even a rare topic in Scifi literature. You upgrade your ships via genetic mutation. The necessary genes can be acquired through devouring conquered enemy ships or by trading with other races. It is fully voice acted and looks quite nice for a ten year old game. Movement is limited to a plane so no six degrees of freedom here.There is only one catch - you have to get it working on a modern OS. After an hour of testing I succeeded in getting the game running on Win10_64 Pro in 4K. I set the compatibility for TestApp3230.exe and GenesisRising.exe to 'Disable display scaling on high DPI settings' and 'Run this program as an administrator' in the bin subfolder of the SteamLibrary. Good news is the game is already patched  to version 1.0.44 which seems to be the latest. After clicking away the dozen error messages at start up the game starts and runs without issues for me.Also read this guide

I did not experience that.You can download savegames from the Internet and put them in a ""save"" folder that you have to create. Then you can play the game more or less in the intended way.The game itself is ok, but i found the UI and controls really lacking in features.

												Tried all possible attempt to troubleshoot, but just couldn't. Just doesn't run on Windows 8 62bit system. Would have been helpful if the store page mentioned it. Read online that some people managed to get it to work, but I'm left scratching my head here. Managed to tone down the initial launch error message to 1 by fixing a few lines in the Crucifom.cfg file, but no matter what suggested fix I try, the game would crash as soon as I try to even start a tutorial campaign. Pity, loved the idea of the game. I guess I'm just glad that the game didn't cost that much to buy in the first place as I don't think steam has a refund policy in these cases.			"

												Unstable mess freezes too often to finish missions. Combat was chalenging and satisfying when the game ran long enough to finish a battle. Horrible voice acting, worse writing.			"

												Bad. Just plain bad. A purely 2D space RTS with tiny levels, cruddy voice acting and an intriguing plot concept turned to mush by horrible execution, this game wasn't worth buying when it was new and definitely isn't today. Even for five bucks.Living ships, genetic modification... New. Different. Intriguing. (sigh) I wish these guys hadn't done it. I wish they'd left it for a serious, competent, industrious game developer that could give the concept the attention it deserved and make the most out of it. Unfortunately these guys took it, and now they've got it all copyrighted, which means that a truly wonderful idea is buried in this crap game.Just plain sad.			"

												Mostly I'm quite okay with things that have swarms of bugs flying out of every orifice, but not so much with software.There's some decent ideas (and a fantastic/terrible plot) underneath the bugs, but I can't really recommend this. Watch an LP on youtube or something instead.			"

												This looked like a fun game and worth a punt at £2, but it seems the campaign doesn't work as on mission 2 it does not spawn a ship for you, thus you cannot do anything.. a real shame. I cannot figure out what has gone wrong with it, but it is seems like a strange and obvious failure to miss.. anyone know of a solution? I would assume a patch would have been auto updated by steam.			"

												Three thousand years in the future, mankind has carved a bloody path towards domination of the known universe. Self-proclaimed as a divine race and beyond reproach as a species, they view all alien races as inferior. With fleets of organic starships genetically engineered for war, humanity sets out to conquer the last remaining independent galaxy - The Universal Heart.As Captain Iconah, you are commissioned to uncover the location and purpose of the Heart. Take command of a living fleet, altering your starship's DNA in real-time as you grant them new and powerful abilities. The Universal Crusade has just begun!			"

												Sadly, I cannot even play past part 2 of the campaign. Game fails to load the Mothership models and prevents the game from progressing. Has a neat idea of building mod-able turrets and accessories on the ships you can build but is crippled by an unfriendly user interface and riddled with bugs.I played the tutorials and two skirmish matches with the AI. It needed more glut removed. Warzone 2100 or Impossible Creatures are two games with similar concepts for anyone wanting to play a game with the cool idea this game wasn't able to utilize.I only recommend watching a Let's Play so you can see how the game is meant to work.

												Meh. I keep buying these space sims, expecting something that actually attempts to simulate a spaceship. This is really a naval combat game without the water. It's 2-dimensional (the graphics are 3D but the actually playing field is not; you can only move in 2 dimensions). Say what you want about Homeworld not NEEDING a 3rd dimension; at least it had one.Having said that, this is a pretty unique naval RTS. When you kill another ship, you get to harvest it for both health and abilities for your own ships. I've only played the first couple missions but the mechanics seem solid and the ship customization is very intuitive. Once you've killed a few enemies, it's very easy to customize your identical ships into specialized individuals.For example: on the second tutorial mission, I loaded all my beams onto one ship, all my short-range projectiles onto the second and all my long-range missiles onto a third. What started out as three ships with two pea-shooters each quickly became a useful unit with very distinct roles.Haven't played far enough to say how the story or mission variation is but just based on the core gameplay elements, I recommend Genesis Rising.

												Using the fixes mentioned in the discussions section of the game I managed to get the main menu working, which allowed me to adjust the usual things located there such as graphics, sounds, etc. and look at the possible tutorial/campaign missions you should be able to play.Sadly the slightest adjustment in the graphic options will result in a flurry of error messages (which I ignored while starting up the game) and trying to launch a tutorial, campaign or skirmish will promptly crash the game.-2/7 Not enough sci-fi space battles			"

												So much potential, so little substance.  I managed to actually play the game, through clicking error boxes, creating directories as suggested by Future2012. It was an interesting idea and I usually LOVE RTS type games see Star Trek: Armada 1 and 2, Homeworld 2. The genes and blood thing was pretty cool, but it just failed to deliver a playable game.
