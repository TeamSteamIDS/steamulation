												Plant vs. Zombies is a cute,addictive and fun game for all ages. I play it a lot of my old school laptop, and it runs completely fine even on that. The game has a lengthy story with various challenges to overcome. There's many plants, zombies and maps to play around with. The story is very simple, but fun. Crazy Dave is quite hillarious.Plant vs. Zombies is a defense game. Your task is to defend the garden against waves of enemies and upgrade the garden. It starts of easy, but new zombies and plants are added throughout the story. You will earn coins and other rewards which you use to buy new items from the store and upgrade your Zen Garden. The game is really simple when it comes to graphics, but it's adorable. All the plants and zombies have unique abillites and funny looks. The game is really small, but there's so much content here. Challenge mode, survival, story, Zen Garden, water park, mini-games,tree-challenge and a store full of important and fun upgrades. The fun simply never ends. This is a must own!			"

												Plants vs. Zombies GOTY Edition is a strategy tower defense game from PopCap, which is now part of Electronic Arts.Plants vs. Zombies GOTY Edition is a very good and fun game, with great gameplay. Defend your home from invading zombies who wants to eat your brains, with many plants such as peashooter, chomper, cherry bomb or wall-nut. There are many plant types to choose from, each with their unique abilities and purposes. Of course the zombies are also vary, like the trash can zombie, buckethead zombie, conehead zombie, pole vaulting zombie or even dancing zombie that can summon backup dancer zombies. There are also many mini games that can entertain for hours with their even more unique and vary gameplay. There is also even a survival game to which you defend until you can't defend no more.Plants vs. Zombies GOTY Edition has cute and great design on plants and zombies. You can also create your own Zombatar with this game. You will also meet a crazy guy who will sold you even more plants or tools for you to use, or sometimes have you do something crazy.One of the downside and the only downside of this game is that it doesn't support greater resolution size beyond 800x600. So even on fullscreen, you stuck on 800x600 and there will be a black screen on left and right side of the screen.Plants vs. Zombies GOTY Edition is a great tower defense game, with many mini game and great gameplay, this game can make sit down in front of you computer for hours. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

Talk about a gem, am I right?Plants vs. Zombies is the game I showcase to friends who are non-gamers, because it is digital crack. PopCap took tower defense theory and boiled it down to its most pure elements, and coated that with beautiful artwork, themes, and great sound. I've purchased this game three times on PC, and once on mobile. Money very well spent.I don't care if you normally play Call of Duty or Undertale or anything in-between, here is what you need to know:1. If you haven't played this, buy it immediately and I guarantee you will not regret it. It will suck you in instantly.2. All you need is a mouse.The only downside is that there are black bars on my screen, but hey, that's older games for you.Absolutely worth full price for literally anyone who even has a minor interest in gaming.

												Tower defense games have come a long way in these past years and only with Plants vs. Zombies has this type of game reached its zenith. While past incarnations have been somewhat inaccessible to casual gamers, PopCap Games has done what they do best and brought tower defense to the masses. Not only that but did I mention that it has plants AND zombies? The end result is a quirky and addictive game that will have you bringing down hoards of zombies late into the night. Don't say I didn't warn you, because once you start playing the first few levels.....well, you get the idea.			"

Plant your vegetables you shall, before running with haste back to safety, back to the comforting confines of your kitchen, to peek through those awful curtains your mother gave you.And when the war drums sound, and the stink of the rotting folks that you used to lay flowers for appear at bottom of the lane, as they march with squelching feet and missing limbs, and they cry for the soft tenderness of your grey matter, you will stand tall and scream. For mercy.The first over the hurdle will fall, much to your delight as the power of Vitamin D, E, B2 and K, blights the haunted flesh; as you realise that they and they only provide the sustenance of life, and that you know, deep down - your mother, she was right.And should your walnut fall, should your pumpkin be defaced, you know that somewhere down the line of peas you will have reveg. Yes reveg you shall, against those zombies swimming through the tears of fallen onions, against those who moonwalk across your crops, dusting them with glitter, against those who dare destroy your expensive garden equipment. And when all is lost and your arsenal depleted, you can only pray that you grew a really tasty squash.- An excellent, casual Tower Defence with an overall cute charm, one of my favourites, and easily enjoyable for all.- Huge replay value with 18 puzzles, 20 mini-games, achievements, zombie creation and a Zen garden alongside the main adventure.- Fantastic soundtracks, featuring music from Laura Shigihara (To the Moon, 'Everything's Alright'), including the 'There's a Zombie on your Lawn' soundtrack.- I'm fairly sure my college grade suffered due to this.

												Plants vs Zombies, GOTY Edition is a must-have game if you like the Tower Defense genre. Basically, the idea is very simple: defend your garden(s) against the relentless attacks of Zombies, trying to get into your house. The means you have at your disposal to do so, are ... plants. Plants in all varieties: from the basic grunt (aka the Pea Shooter) through the basic defense plants such as potatoes (halting zombies for awhile) up to plants that are capable of doing great amounts of damage, even inclusing kamikaze-like jumbing plants. Which is needed too: the Zombies come in different varieties and are more resilient than you'd expect from your average Zombie. But they are pretty brainless as well and just rugh at you, in ever growing numbers. There is a bit of strategy involved, however, first of all by choosing the 8 possible plants for a given level, and secondly by the actual planting. Since you have zes different lanes through which the Zombies come Marching In, it's important to keep everything well-covered.You have one resource at your disposal: sunlight, which comes naturally (except in the night-levels) or, mostly, by means of planting sunflowers. The more sunlight you collect, there more plants can grow at the same time. No water needed. Simple, isn't it? Furthermore, the Zombies drop coin (they seem to go on a stroll with some plan...) which you can use to buy new slots for your plants, or some upgrades with a crazy neighbour.And that's it,  really. There is an extensive adventure mode, slowly revealing all the plants (over 40!!) and zombie-types, and there are great mini-games that give you an extended challenge. It's all so well done with vivid graphics, and so humourish that it's difficult to resist. It comes with a bunch a Steam achievements which I recommend heartily, since they let you discover some possibilities of the game you otherwise wouldn't have thought about.There are some techical shortcomings which did bother me. The Steam-version is basically a port from the mobile platform versions, and to be honest, it's very badly done. There is only one fixed resolution (800x600 I think), no widescreen support, so the game uses only the middle portion of the screen if you happen to have a widescreen (which I guess most of us have by now). This is really appaling, and should long have been fixed by now. Some graphics configuration options might come in handy as well.Gameplay: 24/30Graphics: 14/20Sound: 7/10Longelivety: 7/10Technical & stability: 12/20Personal appreciation: 8/10Overall: 72/100			"

												Never you mind my Steam hours...I've got a good twenty or thirty hours up on the mobile phone version of this; a phrase which, in all honesty, you won't hear me utter too often (mostly 'cause it's the ONLY game I've played on a mobile for longer than, say, a handful of minutes).   So having perused the Menu and seen all the mini-games and modes available, and played nearly half-way through the ""Adventure"" mode, what differences have I noticed between this and the mobile version? Well, I gotta say...not many. I don't recall the option to ""customise"" the look of your zombies on the mobile version, but that kinda petty, purely cosmetic ♥♥♥♥ is all by the by; the simple fact remains that, no matter what the format, this is far and wide one of the simplest, yet cleverest, and moreover most MADDENINGLY ADDICTIVE real-time strategy/tower defense games you will ever play.    Is it worth another purchase, if you already have it on mobile? Hmmm, probably not, unless it's on sale, or if you generally prefer (as do I) to use a mouse rather than rubbing your grotty little fingers all over your telephone screen. Oh, and I guess there's the Achievements, if you're inclined towards such things (me, only up to a point).   If you don't already have it, buy it. If you already have it, buy it when it's a buck or so. It's a bit of a no-BRAINer, really (hahaha, I made a funny, look Mummy, I made a post-post-modernist zombie funny, ooh I'm so clever, look Mummy, me so clever, me so clever)...   Verdict: 9.5/10 (docking half a point ONLY because the pint-sized graphics look just the tiniest bit ""wrong"" on a larger computer monitor. But ONLY for that reason).			"

Get this game or wait for zombies to destroy your lawn.This game is crazily fun; has a funny-talking npc and a awesome ending song.This game is not one of the ""killing zombies"" and thats it game. It has more contents than you think it has.You get to grow your plants, collect coins from em and buy the items that are useful to go against the zombies.Moreover, it has puzzle levels which require high intelligence in order to get all of em completed. 10/10 will play through it again in the futureNote: This game is great to be played on iPads.

OK, let's be more specific:- Nice visual style, sound and music.- Good sense of humor.- A large variety of awesome plants and items to play with.- Great set of different zombie types to fight against.- Interesting levels with original conditions, several additional game modes.I can't really think of any bads in the game. If you like Tower Defence games, you should check this out.------------------------------Лучшая игра типа ""Tower Defence"", в которую я играл. Нет, вы только подумайте: растения, защищающие дом от нашествия зомби - это же гениально! Ладно, давайте по порядку:- Симпатичный визуальный стиль, приятные звук и музыка.- Хорошее чувство юмора.- Куча чумовых растений и предметов.- Большое разнообразие зомбаков.- Интересные уровни с необычными условиями, несколько дополнительных режимов игры.Если честно, никаких минусов на ум не приходит.

												Plants vs Zombies is an old game that still holds it's own. The setting is your house where you are in charge of planting mutant plants to defend your home from zombies. You meet only one other character called Crazy Dave, 'cause his shop is, ""Crazy!"" This tower defense game will challenge your mind as you progress to more difficult levels. What Pop Cap Games had created is a game that is one of the most addictive of it's kind. You won't grow tired with Plants vs Zombies as there is a variety of plants (towers) to use. Each plant can be used tactically, like using a Hypno-Shroom against a zombie. Just as the plants name implies it hypnotizes the zombie to fight for your side, obviously recommended for tougher enemies . There are plenty of other plants of it's ilk in this game to meet your strategic need. Plants vs Zombies has plenty of other challenges like, mini-games, puzzles and survival modes. The mini-games range from plant zombies that shoot back at you, to playing whack-a-zombie. The puzzle mode gives you a chance to play in different modes as the zombies or a breaking a pot game. (Where is Link when you need him?) Survival mode is similar to adventure mode; it just has more challenging levels. Then, there is a Zen Garden you can unlock as you progress through adventure mode. The goal there is to make a money farm for your grinding and to help grow a talking tree. So, yes plenty of other things to do long after you have finished adventure mode. What kind a game has so much replay value? My wife and son still enjoy playing it, years after it's release. It is a shame we won't likely be seeing a true sequel for the PC, but at least it's on your mobile phone. (Thanks EA...) Plants vs Zombies has plenty of fun for everyone of all ages. This game can stand tall for being one of the best games of it's genre and for the price. Why not pick one up for yourself?			"

												PopCap at their finest hour. A fantastic mix of casual strategy and tower defence with a great focus on mechanics. It's a true shame what the franchise has evolved into nowadays but the original PvZ still lives on  as a fantastic game that I constantly recommend to anyone who loves strategy games. Some of the challenge modes will keep you coming back again and again and can be a heap of fun to play with friends gathered around the screen. Indeed, some of the best PvZ moments I've had are helping others get into the game for the first time.A must play game in my opinion.			"

												Plants vs Zombies is first of its kind. There were many copies made ever since. It's a great game of simple tower-defense-based idea. The goal of the game is to protect your house from incoming waves of zombies. How do you do it? By planting your green friends in the garden. They shoot, they explode, they produce sun, that is your currency, you can place huge nuts as walls, that zombies need to breach before getting through.It's a really nice, warm, colorful and enjoyable game for everyone.Seriously, even my parents like to play it from time to time to bust some zombie asses.

												You want tower defense? You want zombie killing? You want a little sunshine in your life?There's no reload. There are no elitist classes. These plants dgaf. They will spit, chew, stomp, and nuke your wannabe-Michael-Jackson-zombie dance party. This PopCap game is amazing. It's super fun, addictive, and an absolute favorite. There are different modes, puzzles and mini-games - plus it worked on my crummy HP laptop.  It's a casual game - yeah it looks a little silly, but everyone who has played it loves it. It also helped me procrastinate during my graduate courses - good times. 10/10 will procrastinate again.			"

												A really fun light hearted tower defense game with a healthy campaign and a lot of extra modes and mini games. The object of the game is to defend your home against zombies with plants. Sun jewels fall from the sky and you click on them. This gives you currency to buy plants to set them up in the path of zombies. If a zombie makes it to your house, then it eats your brain. The zombie enemies are diverse and quirky. Your plans that you defend your house with are equally fun and quirky.  The campaign is split into 5+ major chunks (front yard, pool, night yard, night pool, roof and so on). Each one of these major chunks has a few levels in it. Each level consists of 3+ waves of zombies marked on the bottom of the map. So its like an endurance sort of thing until the final wave.There is plenty of reason to come back and keep playing. Especially since you pick your own plants. The mini games offer a lot of diversity. Things like bowling for zombies, whack a zombie, be-zombied, and even a mode where you need to make it through as zombies to eat brains. There is a ton of fun here for a week and then in a year another week of fun and in another year another week of fun. This isn't the type of game you play forever, but it is a lot of fun while it lasts.			"

												Plants VS Zombies is a simple and classic tower defense game, whereby you deploy a variety of different plants to protect your lawn from zombies to stop them from eating your brain. Fending off wave after wave of different types of zombies provides an entertaining and relaxing way to pass the time. With plenty of minigames to play as well as endless modes after you finish the campaign will keep you occupied for plenty of time. You can also develop your Zen garden as you collect more plants as you play!Pros:+ Many hours of fun and provides a relaxing way to kill some time+ A nice selection of plants allows you to try different combinations to play your own way+ A wide variety of zombies with different strengths and weaknesses keeps you on your toes+ Large selection of minigames+ Endless modes+ Zen garden with collectable plants+ Can leave your snail in charge of your Zen garden while AFK or in the background+ Some achievements for completionists like myselfCons:- No level select after you complete the campaign- Gameplay can feel repetitive after a while- Tree of Life achievement can be a bit of a grind- Resolution not great in fullscreen modeMy Score: 7/10			"

												I recently installed this game on my Windows 8 Tablet, since I used to play it on my cousin's Xbox. At first i thought, ""Well, this game is probably not gonna work very well on my tablet."" But so far, i haven't had a single issue or seen a single bug! It even works pretty fast!     I got this game in the Summer Sale for a ridiculously low price of $1.24. The normal price is $4.99, but even that price is cheap for this games worth! The game works quite fast, and it has hardly any bugs. I highly reccomend this game if you like Strategy/Zombies/Tower Defense  games! And no worries parents, the zombies in this game are entirely cartoony, with no innapropriate scenes at all! Possibly the only part that could be considered innapropriate is if you lose, a zombie walks into your house, and eats your brains. It doesn't actually SHOW the zombie eating your brains, just a message pops up saying, ""A Zombie Ate Your Brains!"" It's up to you if you think thats innapropriate, but honestly, I don't think it's something to get worked up over.     Now to talk about what this game is really about! You start out in a normal house, when suddenly zombies try to invade your home! You have to grow special plants to defend your house, such as thhe Peashooter and the Potato Mine.     This game comes with 5 chapters that each contain 9 levels. A normal PvsZ level takes aproximately 5 Minutes, I'm not sure exactly. To add on to that, they even have awesome minigames to put your PvsZ skills to the test!     This is one of the best time-consuming games i have ever played. I highly reccomend you purchase it, as in my opinion is the best tower defense game I have ever seen.			"

												Well, there is a reason that this game became an all-time favorite among PopCap Games. It has a funny concept full of word puns and mainstream humor, arranged into an addictive defence game. If you want to clear your mind, and think nothing for a while, it is an excellent choice to pass some time. It is a bonus that the game is child friendly, and appeals to all ages.

 really good tower defence game with a long tutorial damn this game is good. I'm actually not that big of a fan of tower defence games but this games sucked me in an spat me out some hundred hours later and i still love it.Most people should know the game bye now but if you don't here is a short explanation what's it all aboutThe zombieapokalypse went down but you have some mutated plants that will protect you. So you plant your yawn full of mutated plants which shoot the zombies and by that defend your home form them.The first levels function as a tutorial, where you protect your front yawn but later the zombies try to eat you bye getting in your back yawn or on your roof.And with every level the zombies become more and more and you have to choose which plants to take into the level and where to plant them for max damage and stuff.

												This is one of my favorite video games ever. While there are things to complain about (I'm looking at you graphics), there is almost nothing but mlg in this game.There are 49 plants in total (50 if you count the Tree of Wisdom) and about 25 zombies. There are 5 'areas', each with 10 levels, plus all the mini-games and puzzles. The goal of the game is clear: DONT LET THE ZOMBIES EAT UR BRAINS. Because I don't want to make a huge review, I'm just gonna list the pros for this game:1. Adventure mode is fun, even though it's repititive, and a lot of the times it can be challenging.2.There is a lot to do post game.3. NO IN-APP PURCHASES (YOU HERE THAT, PVZ2?)4. That credit song tho5. The mini games are fun, addictive, and some are HARD.6. The puzzles have the same pros as the mini games.7. You can easily grind for money, either by just playing somemore adventure mode or via oversight/glitch.8. Nothing is too expensive in the shop; everything is priced fairly (excluding Tree of Wisdom food)9. Getting achievments is VERY rewarding.10. It's single-handedly the best tower defense game I've ever played.11. The plants (and zombies) all have special abilities, helping or hindering you. This makes the game interesting to explore.12. For all you hackers out there, this is easy to mod.GO OUT AND BUY THIS GAME! IT'S WORTH THE PRICE!			"

												This game really redefined the use of the term 'tower defense game.' I first tried this game at the Apple store with my girlfriend and we ended up spending hours just sitting there playing it on their free demos. Immediately I went home and purchased the game for both of us right when I got home. I would say I probably beat the game in a week but I never really had the motivation to beat it a second time.Now I've come to Steam and here it is again for 1/4 the price of what I originally paid for it. Picked this up for my girlfriend who has never played it before. She ended up making it my top played game on Steam until I bought her Garden Warfare. For me, there wasn't too much in terms of replay-ability but she seems to get endless hours or joy from this game. I wish they would release the second one for Steam but until then I would literally suggest this game to anyone. Casual gamers and hardcore gamers would both love this game and anyone of any age.PvZ would have to get a 4/5 out of me.			"

												I didn't intend to cover this game originally, but then I figured it was certainly a big enough name to justify, and also a good enough game to talk about. Before Plants VS Zombies was following in the footsteps of Team Fortress 2 and interrupting an indie developer with mood-destroying music at every E3, it started here, as a simple tower defense. This is a kind that's a bit less common on Steam, where you're defending rows rather than winding path. As the title implies, you do this using militaristic plants to combat a bunch of eccentric zombies.Compared to a lot of the games I've talked about, Plants VS Zombies is a pretty casual one. Experience in many of the above titles would make the campaign fairly easy to get through, and even when I played it years ago without any TD experience I don't remember having much trouble. Of course, not every game needs to be hard, far from it, and there's something relaxing about watching your garden take on all comers. Both your plants and the zombies are also both appealing enough to look at without trying too hard, and there's a good amount of enemy variety.You start with a simple Peashooter for damage and a Sunflower for harvesting resources (you do need to manually click on them like Beware Earth, but that's the only thing like it in the game and it's not generally very hectic), and across the course of the campaign get access to forty-seven others that all have some different use, depending on what zombies you're up against or the level. The game mixes things up often enough to keep things from getting too repetitive, and aside from the normal sunny day you'll also have to defend at night, where you get less resources, or at the backyard pool, where you have to build terrain for most of your plants to stand on. You'll also get levels within those that operate on different rules, such as using the Wallnut to bowl down zombies or having to pick your defenses from a sort of conveyor belt.Aside from the campaign there are a bunch of minigames and alternate modes you can unlock, including survival and a role reversal where you pick zombies to go after the plants' defenses. Quite a lot considering the game's only five dollars, the cheapest of any game mentioned so far. If you're looking for a more low-key entry into tower defenses, it would be a good one to pick up, as long as you remember most other ones aren't exactly like this. Even if you're not new to them though, if you somehow haven't played this I can't think of any reason to dissuade you.			"

												OMG, I DONT KNOW IF THERE'S STEAM VERSION OF PvZ-One of my favorite game when I was a kid, can't stop playing itIts very engaging, charming and funn, the music is marvelousI can still sing it until now.This review is little bit personal but thanks to this game I got myself a really good friend and oh god, this is very nostalgic.Unfortunately you can't play it on widescreen.

												As playing this game for more than a hour, I can safely write this review.I played this game back in 2009 and I had a blast. The last time I played this game was about 2 years ago. I'm back playing it, though. If you want a awesome Plants vs Zombies game that isn't infested with EA then buy this. Or in general, if you want a awesome tower defense, go with this.There is only one downside. This game works perfectly with Windows 7 and lower. I have Windows 8.1... So what does that mean?It means that if you play with 3D acceleration and Fullscreen there would be constant frame drops (this isn't my computer, there are people on the steam discussion page that have the same problem.) and weird blocky pixelated shapes around the zombies, the plants, everything... and the game would look really pixelated. But if you play in windowed mode and turn off 3D acceleration then everything is fine. I'm able to play the game in a good 120 FPS.Overall, It's a really good tower defense. I would recommend it to anyone, not just gamers, but everyone. I had a blast back in 2009 when I played this game, and now I can play it again.			"

												I love the game!! It's very entertaining, keeps you on your toes and makes you think.The only thing I don't like about it is that after you complete the 5 levels (I think, can't recall when it happens) and go back to the first level to start again (still keeping all plants and progress), Crazy Dave starts picking 3 plants for you. I understand that it adds as a challenge, however, it would have been better if it could be an option or box that you can untick if you want to choose your own.That said, I still play it, it's very awesome, and highly recommended :)			"

This game not only allows me to experience the harsh sun beating on my neck as I plant flowers for gringos, but it adds in some challenges as angry gringos disguised as zombies try to deport me.

												PvZ is one of the heaviest RTS games to hit this generation. The combination of a deep and intricate mechanics system impleneneted with a gritty, dark graphics style allows for some of the biggest plays seen in the RTS scene. The amount of APM required to even break in at the entry level for this game is nothing compared to that of Starcraft Brood Wars.""One of the most challenging games i faced in my career: - Jae Dong, Professional Starcraft player.""My zerg APM is nothing for this"" - Insec, Professional Zerg player.To conclude this short review, PvZ is for the most intense RTS players out there, only mastered by a select handfull.

												This is good fun to pass away an hour or two at a time as it is quite repetetive. But despite the slight problems, I would still recommend it. I tried the demo first and had an 'Invalid command line parameters -changedir' issue, which I managed to overcome. Despite the problem, I bought the game. When I tried to run the game it had a completely different issue... 'Fatal error - Access Violation (code 0xc0000005)...'  Not a good start. I searched for ages, through loads of forums of people with similar problems and it all seems to come down to display. After trying almost everything I could find, this is what worked for me. The game doesn't seem to like loading full screen, so you can fix this in regedit.HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SteamPopCap\PlantsVsZombies\And set ScreenMode to 0The game loaded for me this way. Once in the game Alt+Return puts you in full screen again. I hope this helps someone/everyone.			"

												Good, simple tower defence game, easy to get into and play.  Adventure mode is a good length, 5 areas of 10 levels each, with NewGame+ available.  Large variety of plants, and multiple valid strategies to beat levels. Mini-Games Galore: It has several large mini-games and a bunch of smaller single levels with different rules, so plenty of variety and extra things to do away from the main game. One of my favourite games, really enjoyable, easy going gameplay, pleasing art-style/plant designs and plenty of things to do, loved playing Vasebreaker.Only technical issue I ever had with the game was having my save wiped when it transitioned over to cloud saves, other than that it’s all been good.

												As a non casual gamer I wouldn't have stuck with pvz if it was anything but the simplist and most joy us game on the planet. A vortex that Sucks you in with simple and rewarding gameplay feeding you new mechanics and challenges at just the right pace until your a master. Fun graphics. A great and unique concept. Addictive gameplay and reward cycle. Perfect difficulty curve. And a great host of minigames for when it's all over. Or in between games. Pvz is a game changer somthing so fresh is rare seing as hours can tumble to making your perfect defence. I'm a turtle you see. In every rts I ever played I love building up my base defences more than anything else. That's why I'm no good at them. But you see this why this is the game for me. It's no regular tower defence game which I find boring and slow. It has infinite complexity in learning what all your units do and how best to use them. The zombies are cute but ruthless and come in waves and that's when you regret that missplaced sunflower at the start of your game where you now desperately need a walnut.  All this will make sense when you play it... Which you must  "

												I played through the app years ago. Then it became free and I played through it again. Then I bought it on Steam and played through it a third time.This game is a fantastic tower defense game because it works in a more structured environment with up to 6 lanes of straight pathways, as opposed to a twisting, curvy path for hundreds of enemies to go through as in most TD games. The plants are adorable and the balance between them and the zombies keeps the game a good difficulty throughout.GabeN's favorite game as of the beginning of 2017.Easy 100% (Time Consuming)10/10 Zombies On Your Lawn			"

												This is one of my favorite games of all time. I just got the Golden Sunflower trophy today and all I have left to do is to get the remaining acheivements. The Game Of The Year edition adds so much more content that I had not originally played. Even though I had beat the game about 5 times before, I still wanted to buy this so I could beat all the mini-games, puzzles, and survival modes. If anyone is wondering why they should buy this, I have two reasons. First, the price on Steam is incredible considering the release price of the game and that this is the GOTY edition. Second, Plants vs. Zombies is one of my favorite games of all time because it is easy to play and has soooo much content in the game, in fact, you can complete the adventure mode twice! and still get new content.Also, I love the Zen Garden, mine is completely filled and I check on it every other day or so because it is one simple aspect of the game that is just fun to maintain and doesn't take much time at all to do.I would give this game 10/10 for all the reasons listed above!

The campaign mode is just about the easiest thing ever, but the difficulty gets quite up there once you start sampling what infinite survival mode has to offer.

												Best tower defense game,even i dont like these type of games.Also play this PVZ game before PVZ 2 and Garden Warfare,you will see the true fun in this game,no DLC`s,not buying things frim game with real money,also EA now made the series to be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t one to me except this game,i can say the best version of this game is the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions because it has Versus mode and Co-op.Also an important note in Steam version of the game is they cut Michael Jackson zombie (R.I.P  Michael Jackson),achievements on Steam which only 1 i hate so much,you will see by yourself.Its a lot of plants,some useful some are not depending by level,5 chapters now:``SPOILERS``:Also is a lot of zombie types like buckethead zombie,pogo zombie,Giga Gargantuar etc.Modes to play:Adventure,Mini-games,Puzzles,Survival.Just get the game and you will see how so fun is it.Final note:9.5/10			"

												I LOVE The plants vs. zombies game! I've played previously on the Ipod, Xbox 360, and Nintendo DS systems, but using the computer was a new experience. If you haven't played this game before, trust me, it's worth the five bucks. This is a strategic tower defence, where you use plants to repell a zombie attack. Defend your house and your brains using the Peashooter, Cabbagepult, and many more, in locations like your front yard, night in your front yard, your pool in the day, your pool in the night, and your roof! Pros: Good graphics, not too good or bad to distract you. The game is pretty much simple, so everybody can easily play. There's more than defense too! Minigames, A plant garden, a shop, and a giant tree you grow! There's no cons I've discovered, as the gameplay and content I've completed on all four platforms is bug-free. Parents, your kids will love this game! Kids, your parents might like this game! Thanks for reading my review,DignifiedPeach			"

												Great game, when it worked. Now it's plagued with problems (read the discussion boards), and there's effectively no official support for it. I've just gotten through a 1 week war of trying to get actual support to get the game working (with no success). I started at PopCap, as Steam has it listed as official support. PopCap, no matter what you categorize the ticket under will send you an automated message, redirecting you to Pogo. Pogo will tell you that you need to bring it up with Steam (which has no contact method listed). This effectively means you're stuck with a product that does not work and that neither of the two companies which -should- be responsible and have support for it, don't, despite still actively selling it.In summary: Great game, buy it when PopCap and Steam manage to get their crap together and fix this one.

-Quick Review-How to describe a game based on planting various plants, to keep the zombie apocalypse from getting into your house and eating your brains? Maybe “A Botanists guide to survive the zombie apocalypse”? Basically, the game is all about using different plants to keep various types of zombies away from your house. There are several different levels each with their own challenge.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  The story itself is very short, there isn’t much to say about it either. The game goes by pretty quickly but it is a lot of fun to play. And if you’re trying to squeeze out even more time, there are some great mini games to play. The “Whack a zombie”, might have given me carpal tunnel someday.Game Play:  This is a strategy game, so you will need to select the plants you want to use, then place them in various orders that will hopefully ward off the hoards of zombies. Most of the games start slow, and really pick up in pace. Achievements: As I do for all my reviews, I also make note of the different achievements in the game  and the work to get them. To be honest I don’t’ really remember how difficult these achievements were. Most of them were unlocked as you played the game, although there were a few that required some setup. All in all, the achievements wouldn’t be a reason to get this game; this game would be fun with or without achievements. (I can hear everyone on my friends list gasp right now)Price: Plants vs. Zombies is normally $9.99 and I personally put 81 hours into the game, so in my mind that’s a fair trade, although it never hurts to wait for a 50% or 75% off sale. Occasionally older games like this go on 90% off sales, so it would be best to wait till then to get the most out of your money. However you wouldn’t be disappointed if you simply bought it right away. Conclusion:  I loved this game, it was a very simple, short game but I squeezed a lot of time out of it. As far as the game is concerned I consider this one a “must buy”, at some point in your steam life.			"

												Go back to a simplier time where Microtransactions are non-existant and games are ACTUALLY games. Plants vs Zombies is a Tower Defense where you plant sentient plants against hordes of zombies. Despite the name, it's actually fun where you can plant a variety of flora, ranging from evil looking mushrooms that is the equivalent of a mini nuke to literal pea shooter plants all while being guarded by a literal wall-nut. Tons of fun content and it's also $5.			"

												An extremely addictive, yet incredibly fun tower-defense game. I love that PvZ is casual, but also requires strategy to send those zombies back to the grave. It's also quite amusing to see what new tricks the zombies have up their sleeves as you progress through each level. And Laura Shigihara's music fits perfectly with each section and time of day. This is truly one of the best games that I have ever played.			"

												It was my favourite when i was a kid, and it still is. It's honestly suprising how a game with such a simple context can be so enjoyable. Sure, it doesn't offer too much replay value but it's still fun to play it through every once in a while. The soundtrack is just flawless. I just adore the amount of love and passion that has been put into this game.I would definitely recommed this to anyone who enjoys tower defense type games, but this game is just so much more than just an ordinary tower defense.Probably the only con is that the game often fails to run at Windows 10. There are ways to go around the crashes though.For the sequels in ths franchise, i wouldn't recommend them at all. It's just sad to watch how EA managed to ruin a franchise with so much potential. This game will always be the #1 from any current and future Plants VS. Zombies titles for me.In conclusion, definitely atleast try this out. There's also a free demo available if you want to try it before purchasing. The game only costs around five bucks.			"

												Interesting take on tower defense.  Zombie theme is well done, game is funny but tactical.  Decent if not spectacular graphics, doesn't need a graphics card.  Main adventure mode is a little short, a good player can complete adventure mode in 3 hours or so.  But there are a lot of side minigames you can unlock and play.  There is an endless survival mode that can soak up dozens of hours strategizing.  Low memory requirement.  Tied with FTL for my favorite light game.			"

												This game was really good but the sequel was ♥♥♥♥, i'm not saying you cant make it better but PvZ is such a nostalgic game because its realease was 7 years ago but the sequel, even though it did good in thee markets, it was not good enough for me and i am not blind in this situation as i have completed both games. I beat PvZ 1 about 7 times and PvZ 2 once. This is not coming out of nostalgia this is coming from the style the stuff implemeented were fine, the thing that really put me in a weird spot was the fact that stylistically the game did not exactly improve or strive in the subjects it was focusing on in PvZ 1. You had 7 years of room for improvement, I expected something better, but you can still make it up  in PvZ 3 or PvZ Heroes. It was a good run			"

												This is not only a very good tower defence game, but one of the most creative games I have ever seen, both in terms of its gameplay and its many types of humour sprinkled throughout. After having played through it, it is quite evident that the team behind this game is a creative bunch, and it truly adds to the overall experience.As for the game itself, it provides you with a metric ton of towers, which allows for an almost endless amount of strategies and experimentation, and equally many types of enemies, which gives you variation. It also has a bunch of mini-games and challenges if the standard game becomes too repetitive, and a garden to tend to so you can earn more cash, amongst other things.The campaign starts with the very basics and ramps up the difficulty and complexity of the game at a good pace. You are rewarded for experimenting with towers to make your own strategies, so if you ever get stuck, change your strategy around to take care of the zombies or waves you have issues with. You will learn a lot that way, which will become useful later, and it will also make you feel good with the sense of mastery it gives you.Considering how much content you get from this game, it is well worth the price tag even before any discounts, assuming you like tower defence games or strategy games in general, and even if you don't, this is the perfect place to start if you want to get more familiar with the genre.

												Plants vs. Zombies is an extremely simple tower defense game. It is very easy to learn and complete and even though some of the challenges provide some higher level of difficulty it is not enough to give the game any sort of longevity.The sound and graphics are heavily linked to the humor of the game which also happens to be one of the strong points of the game. Although the quality is that of a mobile game the artstyle is cute and interesting enough to forgive that.Plants vs. Zombies is a fun little game that most people will enjoy but few will love. It's is the quintessential AAA casual game. Made with more development and public relations money than some major retail titles but geared towards the casual and mobile audiences.			"

A tale of flora, undead britons, and a psychopathic neighbor named Dave, Plants vs. Zombies GOTY Edition is a Masterpiece of modern software. This pulchritudinous game uses the newly developed ""Frostbite"" game engine by Mojang Studios. With this new engine, the game has stunning visuals of a province of the superstate Oceania in a world of perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, and public mind control, dictated by a political system euphemistically named English Socialism. Along with beauteous graphics Plants vs. Zombies GOTY Edition displays the compelling story of Dave, the last Emperor of China, who has to defend his karesansui from imperialistic westerners seeking his asiatic intellect.

												This is not only a very good tower defence game, but one of the most creative games I have ever seen, both in terms of its gameplay and its many types of humour sprinkled throughout. After having played through it, it is quite evident that the team behind this game is a creative bunch, and it truly adds to the overall experience.As for the game itself, it provides you with a metric ton of towers, which allows for an almost endless amount of strategies and experimentation, and equally many types of enemies, which gives you variation. It also has a bunch of mini-games and challenges if the standard game becomes too repetitive, and a garden to tend to so you can earn more cash, amongst other things.The campaign starts with the very basics and ramps up the difficulty and complexity of the game at a good pace. You are rewarded for experimenting with towers to make your own strategies, so if you ever get stuck, change your strategy around to take care of the zombies or waves you have issues with. You will learn a lot that way, which will become useful later, and it will also make you feel good with the sense of mastery it gives you.Considering how much content you get from this game, it is well worth the price tag even before any discounts, assuming you like tower defence games or strategy games in general, and even if you don't, this is the perfect place to start if you want to get more familiar with the genre.

Plants vs. Zombies is an excellent time killer but not much else (at least for me).Grab this game on sale, I don't recommend purchasing it at the regular 5 dollar price. There's really not a whole of lot of content here.That's not to say I don't like the game, I do, but I got bored pretty quickly.Pros- Levels range from easy all the way to somewhat challenging (This game isn't that hard)- Hilarious game!- Everything elseCons- Game has tendency to get pretty boring after a while- Best played in a window, Fullscreen has terrible quality (There is no way to change the resolution)My Rating: 7/10 (Recommended for those rainy days) "

												I consider myself a pretty big Plants vs. Zombies fan having played through all of the games multiple times. That being said going back to the start and playing this GOTY Edition makes me realize I really want another plants vs zombies game that's not a shooter. I love the Garden Warfare series, but that's no reason not to give us release of both. The more fans the better right?If any of you are not familiar with PVZ yet this is the perfect place to start.  it really is as simple as Plants vs. Zombies.			"

												Plants vs. Zombies GOTY Edition– Raymond KT*EDITED AND UPDATED!!*“Zombies are invading your home, and the only defense is your arsenal of plants! Armed with an alien nursery-worth of zombie-zapping plants like peashooters and cherry bombs, you'll need to think fast and plant faster to stop dozens of types of zombies dead in their tracks”If I do say so myself, I was a much larger fan of this when it wasn’t so mainstream. But regardless, I still am a fan of Plants vs. Zombies. Unfortunately, Plants vs. Zombies Game of the Year (I’ll abbreviate this GotY from now on) isn’t a sequel at all. There are no new zombies, no new plants, no new levels. Instead it feels more like a series of bug fixes, including a curious change where the dancing zombies have been replaced by disco zombies “per the request from the Michael Jackson estate” which In my opinion was a bad move but whatever. Nothing really changed from the original besides a feature called “Zombatar” or something like that. Still a great game.I recommend this game			"

												Plants Vs Zombies is a really, really fun game. The artwork is very cute and original, the “storyline” is worth a chuckle. This game really shines in the gameplay department. You fight to protect your home by planting plants onto your lawn, which attack zombies for you. Different plants do different attacks as well as different zombies do different amounts of damage as well. You need sun to grow things, and the dynamics of the game flow beautifully. The sound effects are on par, and just when you get bored, the game adds more features for you to play with. There are plenty of mini games and even a survival and puzzle games as well. Mac compatible, this game is a great play. My only complaint is that it is quite difficult to earn money in this game to purchase upgrades. Maintain your zen garden and I’m sure it gets easier. 9/10			"

												I LOVE. THIS GAME! Plants vs. Zombies is a clever little cartoon Tower Defense game with a charm! Campaign ModeLevels are paced perfectly, getting harder and harder, with differentiating worlds. Completing each level unlocks different plants to use against the ever so dumb zombies. Unlocking plants never feels like you are growing more powerful, but feels like your arsenal is getting larger. If you unlock a new plant, you have to adapt to the playstyle of that plant...not the other way around. This simple, yet powerful mechanic makes complete each and every level feel SO satisfying. Extra ModesBowling, Bombs, and Bejeweled...yup! Loads of fun! Extra modes also include the ability to play: As a zombie...quite hard!In an endless mode (Beat my score, I DARE you!)Challenge maps in each ""World"" (Different areas of your house)Fun!Zen GardenAs you play the game, you get money, spend money to raise plants and soak away 90 hours of your life making your garden the most beautiful garden on the block and beat off all the kids away from it... Its good!+Fun Main Game+Great Extra Modes+Zen Garden+Cute everything, even the Zombos!+Jiving music to pop off heads to+Crazy Dave doesn't die10/10 If you dont have this. Feel sorry for yourself "

PopCap have infused this game with enough humour, originality, and style to raise it above any other game of it's kind.

												I played the free version on Pogo.com, so I knew what the game would be like. Basically, it is a grid game. You plant plants on the grid and protect your house from the zombies coming. Some of the zombies have pop culture references, which can be amusing. Many unique levels and fun mini-games to go along with it. An addicting, but fun game.			"

												READY... SET... PLANT!!An awesome classic tower defense game! As you can guess from the title, pictures and/or some videos, the main premise of the game is to sow an army of plants in your lawn to protect your house from hordes of zombies that want want to eat your brain (tower defense is a subgenre of strategy videogames, so they know at least that your brain is not Switch cartridge flavor.....or your brain is really Switch cartridge flavor and the zombies were videogame journalists in their past lives... it's hard to tell at this point).The adventure mode is very friendly, easy and balanced, letting everyone to learn about it and enjoy the variety of plants and zombies in very different scenarios. Also one of the best things of the game is there alot different -and efective- ways to play it even if you are repeating the same stage. After completing the adventure mode, it unlocks puzzles, mini-games and the survival modes where it increase the replay value.The game has 21 interesting achievements that gives a good challenge and diversity to the game. Trying to get some them is where at some point the game gets difficult and funny, specially the endless ones. Also there are other achievements where they involve grinding money in other to buy new upgrades or for the infamous tree food for the ""Towering of Wisdom"" acheivement (that single achievement is literally the only bad thing of the game, so much unnecesary and unhealthy grinding).Last but no least this game just needs 49MBs of hard drive space and is very cheap! I totally recommend it!!P.S: This game savestate your game progress when you want to return to the main menu, so you can save it in the middle of a invasion and continue later without worry. This is very nice when you are still goin in a endless mini-game.			"

												As of the time I am writing this I am going to NY in a car. So I had to play this and a couple other games on the way their. I have played the game a lot and beat the game twice on the PC and have played on the xbox also and beat the game once, And I just started this because it was a sale and I didn't have anything else to buy. Anyways time for the review:STORYThe story is simple and it is told simple. Zombies invaded your house and you need to defend it. With the help from plants and crazy dave you have to defend your house and defeat the zombies. Kinda cheesy but at the time it was the bomb.GAMEPLAYUse plants to kill zombies and unlock even more plants to kill more zombies. Play minigames from time to time and unlock survival mode to continue the onslaught.GREATTower defense done rightGOODOriginal IdeaOriginal plant IdeasBADStory is very slowMinigames and survival take too long to unlockWORSESame thing repeated over and overCant repeat levelsIn the end the game starts out as fun but gets very boring and repeated. Beat he game as fast as you can and unlock survival mode and play the minigames. Other then that you can't find much here. It is a very good and small game for anyone on a trip and such. I'm not used to making reviews on this labtop so tell me If I made any errors. Bye. 4/11/17 Fixed spelling error			"

One of the best casual gamesThis is possibly the best cassual game i have ever played. In this simple tower defense you just play rounds and rounds of plant planting so you defeat the waves of zombies. It is rly the best so i will pinpoint only few bad things about this game.It will consume tons of your time to get everything your plants desire to defeat the zombies. Its fun, though quite stereotypical, especially when you are decided to hunt the achievements. There are some minigames, puzzles and game modes which try break the pattern but as soon as you complete them all, you are back to the zombie killing. GOOD things:  Funny Minigames, Mods, ... BAD things:  After a while it gets quite stereotypical "

												Lots of fun. Very original game . I originally found it back in... what was it.... 2009? Yes , that must have been it. I suppose. Either way, it had just come out. I was playing feeding frenzy or something and figured the people who made that must make other good games or something. And , boy , did they!        I got the game and was immediatly thrust into something I didn't understand and hadn't seen before. It explained itself, though. As I was gaining more rows of grass, I thought about the possibilities of this game design.       For quite a few years, me and my father wondered if a sequel would come out. It made so much sense. We came up with all kinds of funny ideas.                                                                                  .............                                                                              My Condolences                   What came after that game was not a part of that franchise at all. It was a monster. It came out and was free to pay. It was IOS exclusive. Then it came to android after way too f*cking long. It still isn't available on PC. So, uh, turns out EA bought popcap.      Now I get it...			"

												Plants vs. Zombies is relatively simple tower defense game in which you defend your house against zombies.Lawn has several lanes where zombies will slowly walk towards the house. To stop the zombies there's selection of plants that shoot peas, explode or eat the zombies etc. Zombies are varied too, some of them are just tougher or some will jump over one plant or dig under the plants. Almost all zombies have pretty effective counter measure against them, it just takes a moment to figure it out.There's limited slots for the plants so they have to be chosen carefully to be effective againts upcoming zombies.Zombies also leave money on the lawn which can be spent in shop to buy stuff to tend your zen gargen or plants which help out defeating the zombies. Zen garden is way to get more money, but it's pretty much just watering plants and collecting money.There's also several minigames, which have variations of the main game.Plants vs. Zombies is pretty good casual game and doesn't cost that much either.

												Fun concept, great setup, EXTREMELY difficult to get the badges.  you pretty much have to get one every level you play otherwise you will not achieve them all.  that being said, the plants that you have for the begining levels make it impossible to get any good badges.  if they lowered the difficulty of them, say instead of getting 50 kills in one level using only cherry bombs, to something like 20 kills, fully worht trying to collect badges.  That being said, still reccomend heartily as a fun game, and would suggest it to anyone looking for a funny tower defense game.			"

												This is a tower defense game with plants. The objective of the game is to stop the zombies from reaching your house and eating your brains. Its a simple concept that can really be entertaining. This game bring humor and creativity to a whole new level. There are quite a few different ways to defend the house, the selection to possibilities are endless. You can time attacks or be prepared for the future and place all your plants everywhere. Some of the achievements require you to play the game through twice which can take awhile. The the game is entertaining and fun. If you love a tower defense style of gameplay then this is a definite game to have in your collection.			"

												Plants vs. Zombies is relatively simple tower defense game in which you defend your house against zombies.Lawn has several lanes where zombies will slowly walk towards the house. To stop the zombies there's selection of plants that shoot peas, explode or eat the zombies etc. Zombies are varied too, some of them are just tougher or some will jump over one plant or dig under the plants. Almost all zombies have pretty effective counter measure against them, it just takes a moment to figure it out.There's limited slots for the plants so they have to be chosen carefully to be effective againts upcoming zombies.Zombies also leave money on the lawn which can be spent in shop to buy stuff to tend your zen gargen or plants which help out defeating the zombies. Zen garden is way to get more money, but it's pretty much just watering plants and collecting money.There's also several minigames, which have variations of the main game.Plants vs. Zombies is pretty good casual game and doesn't cost that much either.

												Plants Vs Zombies is an amazing game that gives you alot of bang fot your buck. The game starts off slow, but once it gets going, it never stops. New plant and zombie types are introduced every level to keep you on your toes. A strategy that worked in one level could become useless in the next. Minigames unlocked after the game is done offer immence replay value. Tying the entire package together is a great sence of humor that never grows old or hits a sour note.			"

												Pretty sure everyone's played this game either on the computer of phone before. Each has a slightly unique feature but the game is essentially the same thing on both. i didn't ask for this game but got it anyway it's such a good game. With a price tag of $10 i guess it's sort of worth it but if you have it on IOS there's no point in buying this game. Play as zombies or plants pick your side and plan what your going to use they should have a versus mode which would be fun but the game isn't bad and not pricey deece game 6/10			"

												It's one of those games you just have to love. A combination of strategy, adorable graphics, this game can be simple 5 minute quick play, or something you could play for hours. The learning curve makes it very accessible, while the possibilities (when you've unlocked a lot of the plants at least) of different combinations of plants in your arsenal gives you a lot of room for setting up an offence to match your personal style. The mini games are a ton of fun, and of course, it's worth playing it alone for Crazy Dave.			"

												Plants vs. zombies is a great game.  Dont judge the game by the way it looks, it can get hecktic.  Plants vs. zombies is a great game for strategy players.  The game has a wide and creative assortment of different plants to use for different levels.  The story is however not the strong poing.  Basically all you do is deffend you house from zombies that get increasingly hard as the game goes on.  Even though the story is not a key part in this game it's hard to complain about anything else in this game.  Michael brown gives this game a 9 out of 10.			"

												A brilliant and easy tower defense game where you will defend you’re self against a massive horde of zombies, and where your only defense is mutated killer plants!It’s a game that can be enjoyed by everyone of all ages from the youngst to oldest and will never feel boring to play do to the 50 levels in adventure mode that varies from day, night, and fog, in a swimming pool and on the rooftop. And trueout the game you will unlock a lot of different mini games and puzzles that really spices up the game, you even get to play as the zombies.I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to have fun, I have passed the 300 hours played mark and I’m still playing the game because it’s just as fun as when I bought it! :Dhow ever, be aware of the fact that the company that made the game was bought from its original owners and is now owned by EA (which means that the game will never get any updates, it was supose to have gotten alot more content but the moment the old company was bought the staff was fired and every single content that was planned was scrapped)It's still a good game though, and I highly recommend it, especially if you can get it on a hand held devices (they got a ton of content added)			"

												I'm sure everyone and their mother has probably played this game already (mine has, for a fact) but I'll post something anyway, just in case. This is a fairly average flash game in the tower-defense genre. It's a somewhat illogical mashup of your towers (plants) versus the attackers (zombies), in which you are defending your lawn, backyard, and roof against the attackers who want to eat your grains, then your brains. The levels are static and only change every 10 missions, which means the variation in gameplay comes from your tower composition and the rock paper scissors you play with the different kinds of zombies. It's not particularly well balanced as some plants are plain useless and most are situational at best. The actual campaign is quite short (but still manages to feel overly long), but you accrue resources at such a slow rate that you can be sure that there's a lot of grinding to be done to unlock everything, for those people that enjoy that. Somewhat underwhelming as a PC game, but probably worth playing on your laptop or iDevice.			"

												This game rocks. I got addicted to it from the WoW knock-off quest. I say addicted because I even got it for my Xbox so I could do the achievements all over again, and then I got it for free on Origin and did the same. I also beat the little quest line on WoW on all of my different characters because the quest isn't repeatable on WoW.If you like strategy, tower defense, and zombies, give this a try. It has a main play/adventure mode, and also tons of different game modes that are equally fun and frustrating. I mean really, it’s only around 5 bucks at full price and it's one of the few games I would have been willing to have paid even more for. Also, if you love this game, the Xbox version has a few different features that are kind of cool.This game isn't too difficult to get 100% on achievements, but it does take a bit of time. It isn't one of those games you can get 100% in 5 to 8 hours, and you also might want to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of your keyboard for some of them, but I still love it. :D "

												Technically, PvZ is a casual game, but -if you're like me- you may find yourself going back to it more than casually. I won't bore you with things you already know, but I was EXTREMELY impressed by the amount of content you get with the GOTY edition. Most of the mini-games you have to unlock by beating the main game, but this is hardly a negative. The main 'adventure mode' took me about 17 hrs to complete. (If I had to guess: For most people, it probably takes closer to 8.5 hours. Yeah I'm that slow, lol.)Anyway, lots of different plants at your disposal, along with many different types of zombies to take down. And I don't want to ruin any surprises, but you really just have to believe me on the great amount of content with this game. I mean, there are still hours and hours left of things to do after the main adventure.Bottom line: Fun game. Easy-to-pick-up gameplay. Insanely good replay value.

												Plants vs Zombies is a true classic in the making, Its a no brainer that this game is amazing and fun to play all the way to the end, it has many mini games and then the campaign mode, this is a casual game that re-imagines the tower defense games. Build plants, stop zombies from eating your brains,and meet a crazy man? The game shows you which zombies you will face before you pick your plants, so you can make the wise choice. There is an amazing amount of plants to use, a ton of zombies to use them all on with their unique abilities and usage. As the game progresses it gets harder to decide which plants to pick for the onslaught of zombies to come. It actually does bring out a bit of hardcore gaming, but it is aimed at the whole family. This game won a Game Of The Year award and deserves it too, it truly a amazing game with little to no flaws, lots of humor and references to other real life material. It's worth your money by a long shot.			"

A few downsides though, for a start there is no controller support for this game, and it also has no adjustable graphics, so the screen is shocking, you can have a massive TV, but the game will give you an image so it wont fit the whole TV screen, this can be frustrating. Alot of hours can be had with it, and the game is cheap as it gose on sale alot, I picked this up for 85p.I have to recommend this game.			"

												Really like this game a lot as I've played the mobile version for countless hours while on the bus or toilet. I got this in the Steam winter sale 2014 and though I've not played the PC version it is a game I can recommend. The only issue I have with this version is that the GFX have not been updated (I Guess) from the flash version and looks ugly as fudge in full screen mode and in window mode the play area is about 7Inch². So for GOTY Edition I would have liked to have seen a HD version or at least some improvement. All in all its a hole lot of fun.I'd reccomend buying at a price point at or below £2 because of the above reasons.			"

												By far, one of the best indie games ever made. I started playing Plants vs Zombies on the phone and when it was released on steam i bought it immediately, with the idea to complete the game once again. I had so much fun, like if it was the first time :DThe graphics are really pleasant, the mechanics well achieved and the extra modes add a couple of interesting features to the story mode, preventing the gameplay to get too boring. Some nice quality time spent with this. RECOMMENDED! :)			"

												This game is great.Buy it.When you buy it make a cake.I'll tell you here: Gather your ingredients. Pound cake is one of the simplest cakes to bake. Here's what you'll need:1 cup unsalted butter, softened1 cup sugarPinch of salt2 teaspoons vanilla extract5 eggs2 cups cake flour2. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.3. Grease a cake pan. Pound cakes are best baked in deep pans, such as loaf pans or bundt pans.4. Cream the butter and sugar. Place the butter and sugar in a mixing bowl and beat them together until the mixture is light, fluffy and creamy.5. Add the eggs and vanilla. Keep beating the mixture until the eggs are completely incorporated.6. Stir in the cake flour. Keep the hand mixer on low or use a wooden spoon to stir the flour in a bit at a time until it's just incorporated. Be careful not to overmix it.7. Pour the batter into the pan. Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl.8. Bake the cake for an hour and 15 minutes. The cake is finished when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.Enjoy your cake! "

OK, let's be more specific:- Nice visual style, sound and music.- Good sense of humor.- A large variety of awesome plants and items to play with.- Great set of different zombie types to fight against.- Interesting levels with original conditions, several additional game modes.I can't really think of any bads in the game.

Who wins? Everyone!Not only is Plants vs. Zombies a splendid candidate for anybody with an interest in exploring the gaming medium, it's perfectly suited to the type of no-commitment, speed-date, pick-up and play (then put away) gameplay people who hate video games, LOVE!

												What a charming tower defense title. The graphics are detailed and awesomely cute. Same goes for the sounds. And for such a low price you really get a lot of gameplay. There's just so much to do; puzzles, zen, adventure, mini-games, you name it. The game also has quite the zombie and plant collection, adding a lot of (strategic) depth to this already wonderful game. I'm not going to say anything else about it. You really have to experience it yourself.[Rating: 88/100]			"

												I absolutely love this game.  I bought it when it first appeared on steam before it became popular.  I loved it immediately.  It is a lot of fun, and I have spent hours playing the main game along with the mini games that you unlock as you play.  This is  a worthwhile defense game that has a lot of fun twists and additions to it.  And to top it off, it is kid-friendly.			"

You can get different plants with different abilities that will help you. how further you get the more plants you can choose from. But also the zombies will get more difficult.

												While not the most challenging ""Tower Defense""-type game, it's the most complete experience from the genre. What do I mean? First off, it's charming. Cute, funny, bursting with character: It's just unqiue. Each zombie-type and plant has it's own little encyclopdia entry, often-times filled with the discarded dreams of zombie youth or a taste of plant family-drama. Second, it keeps your fingers busy even when it's being easy. I don't know about you, but I HATE having down-time in my games. YOU are the one responsible for collecting resources with a clickity-click (along with coins to unlock items) and is a welcome change from the passive reception of wealth in the genre.Third, there are loads of little fun mini-games and extras that the game encourages you master. Zombie-bowling anyone?So yeah, buy this game. The learning-curve is gentle (maybe a little bit too gentle!) and is a great starting point for anybody who is wondering what's so fun about Tower Defense games.			"

												Looking for a casual game to just sit back and spend some time with - well this one fits the bill in several different ways.  Overall gameplay, music, challenge, etc., they're all there.  In fact, the only thing missing are the trading cards - assuming you're into thoe.The gameplay can at times become hectic, but you won't feel as if you'll never be able to master a level - while also feeling that there was still a challenge.  There's also enough variety in not only the default game, but the other game types.  On top of that, the music is just the right amount of soothing, without putting you at risk of falling asleep or being overpowered with it.Sure, for the hardcore gamer this may seem a bit of a waste, but even hardcore gamers need to de-stress sometimes...

												This sounds silly, but it's incredibly addictive. The secret is that the game mechanics are simple: each plant you place down serves a purpose much like in a tower defence game. But as more complicated plants become available and different combinations are available to experiment with, different strategies must be formulated on the fly. As well as this, the wacky humour and cartoonish graphics always make the game feel friendly and quite charming indeed. Given its price, this game is well worth it.			"

												I've only recently purchased and installed the game, but am familiar with in from earlier on my phone. The game is a happy mix of several kinds of games in one. The main part consists of strategic fighting of zombies by the help of cute looking plants. On the side there are several mini games like zombie bowling and a slots game.Despite containing zombies this game is anything but scary and is easily suitable for people of all ages. The difficulty level increases per game, but is easy to handle if you practice a bit. When stuck look up the several plants and zombies in the almanac and come up with a new strategy to defeat the type of zombies bothering you.The pros of this game are:Very cute graphics
Easy to understand gameplay
Humor
Suitable for all ages
I can't think of any cons. And at this price you almost feel like you are committing robbery in plain daylight. I can not understand it's this cheap! "

												 Oh man, Plants vs. Zombies GOTYE, it blew my dang mind! When I saw a photo of it, I was like, ""That game looks odd."" Well, nowadays, I think this game is just so cool. The plants you can plant (especialy the gatling pea and cattail), the variety of zombies, heck, even the ACHIVEMENTS are cool. One of the thing I also have to like about this is the frickin' final boss music. It is so freaking awesome! Anyway, other than the adventure mode, there also is stuff like puzzles and even endless survival to keep you playing. One of the things I think the developer did so well on was the Zen Garden mode. The music is calm, and it can be fun growing the plants and collecting the money they give. Pretty much, for anyone who wants a good tower defense game, they should get Plants vs Zombies GOTYE. This game deserves a 10-10, and/or a 4.9-5 star rating, only because of the fact that the second time playing adventure mode, Crazy Dave will pick three plants that possibly would be useless. Still, this game is awesome. Enough said.			"
