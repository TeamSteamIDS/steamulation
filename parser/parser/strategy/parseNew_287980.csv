												People are calling this game 'Calming,' or 'Zen.' Is it, really? The design is minimalist, and the audio is subdued, and you can pause whenever you want - but all that just disguises what is actually one of the most deviously clever and difficult puzzle games I've ever seen.So: Stations are little shapes on the map. People show up at each little shape, wanting to go to some other shape. You connect the shapes with metro lines, and a little train will show up to ferry people along the lines you drew to get everyone where they want to go. There's a few more mechanics, but that's 90% of it.There are only so many metro configurations you can have for any given map, but with every station that pops up, the possibilities increase in number exponentially. There's never quite enough lines or enough carriages or enough tunnels to keep all of your passengers totally satisfied. In essence, playing this game is endlessly performing triage on an ever-growing network that's a few bad decisions away from becoming an unsustainable mess and collapsing under its own weight. It's mind-warping how fast things can get out of hand if you're careless.Forget Telltale; here, every choice you make feels genuinely heavy and difficult, because they actually are heavy, difficult choices. Crucially, though, there's always a right choice that will keep you alive for at least another week. Every game ends in you frantically trying to fix a bottleneck in your network, or deperately rerouting half your lines to ease up the congestion in one distant corner of your map - and failing. But there's always something you could have done, out of the umptillion different decisions the game threw at you.This game is terrifying. I've been pulling my hair out. The quiet bleeps and bloops of the passengers arriving and leaving no longer register as something Calming or Zen but as something far more sinister. Needless to say, I absolutely love it.			"

												<Review Update> I originally reviewed this game in 2014.  Since then the game has added a number of features.  First, the game has sound and music now (they are sort of one and the same.  All sounds are music notes, and all the notes make the music.), which I think is quite good.  You get an audio cue now when things start to become frantic, as the music tempo begins to pick up.  Secondly, there are now more modes and objectives, which gives even returning players something new to accomplish.  Third, the game now has much better options, including color blind modes and automatic gif recording of your metro system.  Fourth, I can now confirm that the game works great with touchscreen systems like the Microsoft Surface.  Past these items, the core gameplay stays the same (just smoother) against my alpha review from two years ago.  I continue to recommend the game with two big thumbs up.<End Update>Mini Metro belongs to the category I call ""Optimization Games.""  These are games like Banished, Prison Architect or Sim City.  These sort of games are more about building the best thing you can with your resources available, and less about reaching a ""win"" state.Mini Metro is a extremely minimalist version of these sorts of games.  Whereas in a game like Banished you'll be trying to balance population growth, food supplies, trading resources, lumber, etc, Mini Metro just asks you to get your passengers from station A to station B.Mini Metro doesn't have saves or anything, and you can expect a single round of the game to last about 15-20 minutes.  During this time, stations of various shapes will pop up, and they'll begin to have passengers show up.  Your goal is to build your rail lines in a way that gets the people to their intended station.  Have too many passengers waiting too long to get somewhere and you lose.Where Mini Metro really succeeds is that it builds a lot of tension easily thanks to the constant need to incorporate new locations, while only giving you minimal additional resources.  Can your Red Train Line handle an extra circle station?  Maybe you can rearrange the stations a bit to fit that new station onto your Yellow Train Line instead?  You'll be juggling these decisions constantly.Overall, I highly recommend Mini Metro.  It's kept me occupied for longer than many other optimization games have.  Despite it's simplicity, there's a lot of room to improve your skills in the game, and I tend to find myself thinking of new station arrangements when I'm not playing.  That's the sign of a good game, and it's the same feeling games like XCom or Banished gave me.  If you enjoy these sorts of games, I would very much say it's worth your money, even in it's current Alpha state.			"

Early Access Review
Mini Metro is a zen-like strategy experience with pleasing minimal visuals that utilizes the real-world simulation of public transit and the growing system of subways that various corners of the world have come to know. The simple metro-line style of the game is not only a minimal aesthetic, but a symbol of civilization that is powerful to those who have relied on it for a better portion of our lives.Although simple in appearance Mini Metro is nothing short of a complex affair with lots of little mechanics to learn as you delve deeper. The game is easy enough for players of any level to hop into but offers layers upon layers of choice and consequence that you will need to learn and master through hours of your own planning of expansive transit systems. You begin by connecting differently shaped metro stations to other stations with similarly shaped passengers, which gets complicated as you notice your limit on Metro lines you're able to make and the amount of trains you're able to have carrying passengers. Without an even balance between how much load each of your lines have you'll quickly have a station overcrowd leading to a Game Over.Overcrowding can be avoided through careful planning as well as the help of upgrades you get to choose between at the end of each week. These can be very hard decisions as you'll be deciding between the ability to build another carriage to hold more of your overflowing passengers, extra bridges to allow you more tactical planning under rivers and other tracks, or a new line giving you a new color-coordinated track to work with on the constantly expanding map. Only one of these upgrades can be chosen and not using the chance efficiently will end your reign as a metro tycoon much quicker.The game is currently undergoing some extremely ambitious and promising sound work, including a soundtrack being composed by the legendary Disasterpeace. Sound is a feature I am greatly anticipating, because while the silence serves the minimalistic approach to the aesthetics of the game it could really use a bit of atmosphere. Until then I can easily throw on any appropriate Brian Eno record and bliss-out to the creation of my own Metro system, And as Eno himself wrote, ""I lose control and at last I am part of the machinery."" Mini Metro does its part well in capturing the machine driven lifestyles of the modern world and infusing it with a tactical and addictive interactive twist that anyone from casual strategy fans to serious transit geeks can get excited about.There's already a good selection of real-world maps allowing you to construct and plan anywhere from London to Hong Kong, as well as more than enough features like Leaderboards and alternative Nightmodes to play around with. Its state in Early Access is merely a sign of great things to come for an already blissful strategy game. I'm extremely excited for what's in store and can't wait for the upcoming procedural soundtrack, additional features, and very hopefully some new maps. Two cities I'd personally love to see are Tokyo and Prague (Hi Timmy!) and with enough support Mini Metro is sure to deliver on fresh content.			"

								Mini Metro is a game that allows the player to teach all those transportation moguls how to properly setup a metro grid, or how to properly fail at doing so. Odds are it will be the latter.It's an incredibly fun and challenging game, that will leave the player looking for the best possible routes.Transportation is the center of the world! It is the glue of our daily lives. When it goes well, we don't see it. When it goes wrong, it negatively colors our day, makes us feel angry and impotent, curtails our possibilities.Robin ChaseWithout any further delay, I present to you my review of Mini Metro.GameplayIf riding a metro is part of your daily routine, you'll either be extremely interested in trying Mini Metro out, or completely uninterested.The goal is to ""survive"" as many days as possible by having customers happy, which means providing them transportation without having to spend much time waiting for it. As you can easily imagine, that's pretty simple to do, but as the game goes on, not only will the map increase, more stations will also start appearing, which can, sometimes, force the player to redo all the lines.At the end of each week there will be a couple rewards, from more locomotives, to carriages, tunnels and extra lines, all of which can be used to make life easier. But choose wisely, as you may find yourself in need of either reward sooner than you think.It's up to the player to make sure they don't end up like all the metro companies in the world, full of angry customers.Pros Really good concept; Has a feel of progression looking at the map grow as the game goes on; Minimalist UI, containing everything that's needed and nothing more; Beautiful design; If you ever get eye sore from all the white background, you can also change to night mode, and vice versa; Doesn't get too repetitive, as the starting stations are randomized; Various city maps; Active development team; Price.Considering it's an Early Access (EA) game, I've decided to add a ""Neutral"" category, for details I consider important, but not gamebreakers, and could easily improve the gameplay if attended.Neutral Lack of a soundtrack/sound effects (which is already part of the developers' plan); Would be nice to see different vehicle models, even if only for each country/city.Not much to point out ""Cons"" wise, as the game is pretty solid.Cons Once you get the hang of it, it sort of becomes trivial.VerdictI'd give it a 9/10, as it offers the player a nice and relaxing experience, as well as a nice change from the current gaming trend.

												It's really easy to make a game overly complicated, so it becomes all the more delightful when you come across a simple game with a lot of depth. Every part of Mini Metro is simple and clean, from the concept to the presentation to the mechanics, but the simplicity gives way to moments of intense strategizing.Each game starts with just three stations, represented as a circle, triangle, and square. You click and drag between them to draw your subway lines, and then watch your little train zip along and pick up passengers of all shapes. Each station generates passengers for the other station shapes, so ideally you want at least one circle, triangle, and square on each line. New stations pop up as time passes, and you have to extend your lines or lay new ones to service them. Your resources are limited, however, generally only starting with three lines and three trains. At the end of every week, you get another train and a choice between two additional resources. These can be more lines, more trains, additional carriages to add to existing trains, more tunnels or bridges for crossing the map obstacles, or upgraded stations for holding more impatient passengers. The game ends if one of your stations hits capacity for too long, which can lead to some panicked re-drawing of lines and dropping of trains.Actually, it will ALWAYS lead to panic because Mini Metro is insidious in how the scenarios ramp up. Stations pop up in unequal groupings, and unique stations like stars and pentagons can appear in the most awkward places. From your three starting stations the map will explode into a nightmare network of wrong stations in just the wrong spots, forcing re-draws and overhauls of your entire service just to reach that one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ station that opened up across the river in the southwest corner. But this explosion will happen so gradually, and accompanied by soothing ambient music and pleasant jingles of services running smoothly, that you almost won't notice until its too late. Like with any good puzzle game there's pressure to perform here, but it's presented in such a way that it causes none of that uncomfortable anxiety that trying to form a clutch tetris or landing that last bubble in Puzzle Bobble does. It's a fun challenge through and through, one that never gets old or tiring.There are eleven different maps to play on right now, with each having a different layout of obstacles, different layouts of stations, and different capacities for stations. Paris and New York play very differently, for example, with Paris having a lot of tightly-clustered stations with low capacities, while New York has them spread far and wide across the boroughs. The game also has daily challenges to compete in, with everyone taking a shot at the same map and station growth patterns. There are two additional difficulties as well if you get tired of the normal game; there's a sandbox mode if you just want to draw pretty lines and work on efficiency, and an extreme mode where you cannot redraw existing lines, which makes me sweat just thinking about. If you're into achievements, they've got some good ones to keep you playing. Each city has a basic competency achievement, and then one that requires a specific challenge condition, like moving 1200 people around London using only one tunnel. If you enjoy the basic puzzling offered here, there's dozens of hours of it to be had.I like puzzle games well enough, but few have sucked me in like Mini Metro. The genius presentation using the clean subway map style makes it easy and inviting to work with. And while it certainly doesn't have the complexity of something like Transport Tycoon or Cities in Motion, I find it scratching the same itch in how well it abstracts the subway systems for each city. For fans of puzzle games this one is a no-brainer, and even if you're looking for something more on the management side, there's something to be said for Mini Metro.			"

												Mini Metro is a simplistic strategy game where you must design train lines connecting different parts of one of many major cities. You begin with three lines, three trains and some tunnels (number of tunnels depends on the city) and each week you unlock a new train to use as well as one of two other things such as a new line, more tunnels and carriages to attach to your existing trains. As time goes by new stations will open and you'll need to connect them to existing lines or create entirely new lines, managing your lines effectively is key as the game ends when a station is overcrowded for too long.+Simple but fitting art style, it looks just like London Underground maps and I can't think of anything that would suit this game better+The controls are nice and simple, all you have to do is drag your mouse from one station to the next in order to connect them+Already quite a few different cities to try out+It's incredibly relaxing to play+If the default game is too bright for you (if you have sensitive eyes like myself you may find this) then you can turn on Night Time mode which makes everything considerably darker +The UI is very basic and stays out of your way most of the time which really adds to the feeling that you're looking at a real map+There's a number of different types/shapes of stations, having to connect one of each type to each line to move passengers effectively adds a nice level of challenge to the game+As well as the normal gamemode which I briefly explained earlier there is also an endless mode where station overcrowding does not end the game and your only goal is to make your city as effecient as possible+Station positions are different every time you play+As is expected of such a game you can fast forward time as well as pause (pausing is very handy if you want to completely redesign all of your lines)+/-Sound has now been added to the game but personally I think it's a little too basic, there aren't any sound effects for the trains themselves, just your actions, e.g. connecting up two stations.Verdict:Essential PurchaseA simplistic strategy game that has a great concept, a fitting art style, simple controls, simple gameplay and is ever so relaxing to play. If you're looking for a simple strategy game to play or you're a regular user of the trains in one of the playable cities then you really need this game.No drama, Just Reviews?El K.			"

												The premise of this game had me intrigued as I am curious about how metro systems around the world are designed. I though that I was getting a sim-style game that would let me lay out a metro system in meticulous detail, but this isn't the game that I was looking for. I do enjoy the game, but it is a real-time puzzle game, and not a sim.There are many cities that you can play in, and each starts with three stations of different shapes - a Circle, Square, and Triangle. A station's shape determines the destination of/number of passengers that will spawn there. For example, Circles will spawn the most riders, but few passengers from other stations will want to go there. A station spawns riders in the shape of the station that they wish to go to, and each passenger boards trains that can take them to one of their destination type, and not a specific station. Your score is the number of total passengers delivered to their destination.Stations spawn periodically and connecting lines to them so that passengers will get picked up in a timely manner before the stations get overcrowded is the goal of the game. In addition to the three main shapes, several unique shapes can spawn as well, which ups the difficulty quite a bit. Passengers choose trains intelligently, so not always by the shortest route, but the one that will likely take the least amount of time.Each ""week"" you get a new train and another random reward that could be a carriage (more passengers for a train), tunnels (the number varies), a new line (there is a maximum number of lines on each map, and you always start with three), or an interchange (increases the number of passengers a stop can handle before overcrowding).You get visual and audible warnings when a station start to get overcrowded, and if the problem isn't resolved in about 45 seconds, the game ends. So planning ahead is vital, but you can't always do that due to the random nature of the station spawns. Sometimes you'll have a nice mix of stations along each line, and can get quite an impressive score. Other times you'll have eight Circle stations isolated from everything else and only one or two lines to service them, which is usually not enough.Games last anywhere from a few minutes to 30, and scores range from 200 to 2000+, depending on the map and the luck of the spawns. I recommend the game, but it can be frustrating when you have a good game going and three or four Circle stations spawn in inconvenient spots and ruin it. Still, it's great for when you have 10-20 minutes and not too taxing on the brain.			"

								When you take a first look at Mini Metro it all looks incredibly easy and simple. But underneath this deceivingly simple exterior lies a deep and complex, although minimalist, puzzle/simulation game where you’re given the task of moving as many people as you can between huge amounts of subway stations.You start off by connecting a couple of shapes together and each separate line you create next will have a different color. There are 3 colors when you begin; blue, red and yellow. So it’s not unlimited, you only have limited resources. More colors can be unlocked weekly at random.The more you play the more stations will eventually randomly pop up. At the beginning you can manage things relatively easily, but when you’re trying to connect your tenth station or so, things can become (more) hectic. It’s your job to create and manage the lines as efficient as possible; if too many people are waiting for a train a circle will start to fill up and once it’s filled up it is game over. Should you get there in time and at the same time take a couple of passengers with you then this meter will decrease again.Thankfully, at the end of the week you’ll earn a random award. This can be a tunnel (for crossing water) or an extra train, carriage or rails (i.e. extra color) and you can remove some of the current workload by using these items strategically.And despite all these hectic situations Mini Metro can still feel sort of relaxing. The reason for that is probably because it looks so simple and is intuitive to control. You just grab a line and drag it to the station and if there are no conflicts (like missing bridges or weird (intersecting) lines) the game will automatically readjust the rails for you. Easy as pie !This Early Access edition is missing a couple of things that will be available in the final version of the game. The music is the most important thing that’s missing and it’s something that I sorely missed. It feels weird having no sounds at all while playing. Still, you can always play your own music on the background. And it’s really not that big of a deal anyway; I’m sure once the music is fully integrated it will be just lovely and make the game that much better. It’s just a matter of time. And just check out the trailer, it gives a taste of what’s to come. Exciting stuff !Some extra modes still have to be added as well. But the default mode is there (and still being worked on) for those that want to set a high score.I don’t think the game really needs a tutorial but a simple explanation would be appreciated and I think it’s a smart idea to add it anyway. You’ll get the hang of the game soon enough, but it might seem daunting at first. It requires a bit of trial and error but it’s certainly more satisfying if you set a good score later on, knowing that you did it all by yourself.And it would be nice to see a better alert if a station gets added. Later in the game when things are too hectic and you’re too focused you won’t always notice that one or more stations are still unconnected. It’s just a minor flaw/complaint and I hope there’s a way to improve this, if only for a tiny bit because the alert is definitely noticeable as long as you pay enough attention to your surroundings.Mini Metro is an excellent game and a mighty fun one. If you like simulation (not just the ones that are too realistic) and puzzle games then you practically can’t go wrong with this game. And for this price it’s an absolute steal. Highly recommended ! [Rating: 82/100]			"

								So I discovered Mini-Metro about a few months ago, and was following its progress since. I finally got around to purchasing it for myself, and in short, I haven't stopped playing! I never knew a game in such early stages and unfinished could provide sooo much fun and amusement.Now on to a proper review: Pro's: > Simplistic, didn't have to overdo the features to get enjoyment> Smooth Look: Not made poorly, very good aesthetics> Non-Repeatitive: Always a different layout on every restart of a map> Consistant New Features: The devs are actively adding / fixing stuff all the time> Has a Night Mode, changes White to Black, much easier on the eyes! Con's: > No Sound: Atleast, not yet, I know its being worked on as the next feature> Waiting Passengers sometimes are confusing as to where they want to go> Trains sometimes skip stationsWell thats all I can think of for now. I am still enjoying the life out of Mini-Metro and am eagerly awaiting what the devs come up with next!(wink wink nudge nudge: maybe some more maps to play on @devs? eh? hehe)My overall rating: 9/10. Highly recommend the game, has a few minor issues, but thats expected in a Beta game. But hey, go grab a copy and play, you won't regret it!			"

Mini Metro is a small strategy game about making a subway map for growing city.Normal mode: You start with 3 lines and 3 trains (Blue, Red and Yellow) you must connect at least 1 line with all 3   figures (Not counting rare ones) Every week you can choose what you want to have (Train,line,tunnels etc) so it will help you later. The aim is to don't let a lot people wait near the figures, if there will be too many ""people"" you lose the game and you can continue in Endless mode.Endless mode: Is almost the same, but you decide when you lose (By quiting the game) because is Endless!PROS+ RelaxingAfter hard work when you are finally at home, you can relax with Mini Metro, game is going slowly and is always fun+ RandomMaps are the same but figures spawn randomly+ GraphicsColours are amazing!

												Mini Metro is an extremely polished, well made game by Dinosaur Polo Club (which is an amazing name, btw).The premise is that you are designing the layout of a subway/train system to get people where they want.  Instead of cluttering the gameplay with stats and names, everything is abstracted and simplified for a very smooth experience.I have 87 hours on record on steam, and many more on their alpha version they had on their website previously.You start on a map with 3 stations: A Square, a Triangle, and a Circle.  At each station, passengers will appear and your job is to connect these stations so they can get to where they want.  When a passenger appears, he will appear as a symbol, for example, a square.  And the goal is to bring them to a station that matches their own symbols.The trains themselves are smart, and will only pick up passengers that can be dropped off down the line OR allow them to switch lines at an interchange to get where they want.As the game progresses, the map zooms out so and new stations are added.  You will face increasing difficulty in the presence of unique symbols (which reinforces the need for efficient interchanges), as well as GLUT OF CIRCLES that is the doom of all system designers (once you play it, you will see what I mean).Different game modes exist depending on your tastes: Normal - The standard game where you can adjust/move your tracks at willEndless - Relaxed gamemode where you can play as long as you want with no loss conditionExtreme - Tracks are permanent, so future planning is important!They also have a Daily Challenge mode where you get to play the exact same layout as everyone else, so you can measure exactly how you stack up to other people.Everything has Leaderboards, of course, so you can marvel at how some people can achieve the results they managed.Non-Gameplay elements are also polished, pleasant music, smooth/clean UI, are all very appreciated.

												Every so often you'll come across a game that simply clicks. There might be nothing mind-blowing about it, but it will be simple, clean, and, most of all, entertaining. Mini Metro is one such game to me. It bills itself as a ""simulation"" game, setting you the task of building up and managing a train network, but it's not really. Mini Metro is more similar to a casual time management experience, where you have to use limited resources (in terms of train lines and carriages) to juggle the rapidly expanding network, and the increased number of passengers that the network brings. Leave too many passengers waiting on one platform too long and it's game over.Style isn’t something you would typically associate with a train simulation game, but that’s more of less what we have with Mini Metro. It’s easily the sleekest and most visually pleasing rail-themed game I’ve ever played. Modelling itself on classic underground rail systems from around the world (with maps to match) you connect shapes to ensure passengers reach their destinations. It’s a simple premise elevated by perfect execution.Stations are symbolised on the map as ""shapes"" (star, triangle, circle, square, etc), and each passenger has a desire to get to a specific station in order to complete their trip. If they're on a station with a line that takes them directly to their desired station, then it's all good. However, if they're on a station that doesn't take them directly to their goal, they'll travel to a connection station so they can swap lines and get to where they want to go. It's a good idea to try and get as many lines to go to as many different stations as possible, otherwise your network fills with passengers changing trains and not getting to where they need to efficiently. But on the other hand, if a single train line is too long, then trains take too long to travel it, and that in turn means that people build up on the platforms.So the goal is to balance these conflicting challenges in such a way that the train network covers as much as possible as efficiently as possible. It's not as easy as it sounds. Train tracks can't cross, meaning you need to make good use of the train stations to divert track lines. There's also a very limited number of tunnels or bridges, meaning that only a couple of track lines can pass any river or body of water. And you're limited in how many carriages you can have on the tracks, meaning you need to carefully plan for where the heaviest congestion will be.Impressively, there are a wide number of cities to play on, and each one has a very different feel to it. Japan's Osaka, for example, gives you access to a limited few shinkansen ""bullet trains"" which need to be carefully placed to account for the longer distance that it takes to get to some stations. Australia's Melbourne, meanwhile, has you building a tram network, which means trains move more slowly, and you'll need to account for that. China's Hong Kong builds up incredibly quickly, meaning you'll need to think much more quickly on your feet. In addition to the very different mechanics and environment that mark each city, there's also online leaderboards, daily challenges, and an extreme difficulty mode for extra replay value. There's even the ability to export your efforts to a .gif image format, which allows you to share your efforts online, and show friends how you were able to build up your network.As abstract as this all is - meaning you don't need to manage finances, positioning of stations, and so on - the end result is that you end up with a train network that does indeed look like real-world train networks. This is reinforced by the aesthetics, which are truly gorgeous in their minimalism. I love the look of train network maps - I actually have a framed map of Tokyo's network hanging on a wall. As such, I love the look of Mini Metro, and how quickly the network of tracks builds up.Mini Metro is a fine puzzle strategy game that has just the right balance of a quick turnaround of gameplay to maintain attention and enough depth of gameplay, gradually scaling as you play, to keep things interesting. The demands of your various stations are modest and managing the flow of traffic is basic enough. But then, as midnight on Sunday rolls around, you have to choose your tools for expanding and responding to new challenges in the coming week.There's actually not that much more to the game; as I mentioned, it's really quite simple in execution. But it is tightly balanced, elegant, and nearly perfect in execution. I think this game should be on iPad, 3DS or Vita, as I do believe it's the perfect way to get through a real train trip, but regardless, it is a brilliant example of minimalist design.			"

								Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!“Mini Metro” (not to be confused with the popular “Metro” series mod that turns protagonist Artyom into Tyrion Lannister) is the latest in a long line of ingenious, unique puzzlers to come out in 2014. Why then, you might ask, would “Mini Metro” be worth your time and money? How, you might muse, does “Mini Metro” stand out from the rest of the pack? Well I'll tell you why and how if you would just stop posing these hypothetical questions.“Mini Metro” is a metro designing simulator, putting you in the shoes of the world's most unfortunate subway planner. You're just sitting in your cramped office when word comes down from the top that you have to connect stations, plan lines, tunnels, and bridges, and deal with overcrowding. On the fly. By the seat of your pants. OH, and like all things in life, it is a pointless struggle. Eventually the city will be overwhelmed, the denizens of the metro spilling out into the street when the system can no longer handle it, consuming the weak, tired, and old, and converting the strong into public transit enthusiasts. At least that's what I tell myself the fail state is.But you will fail, eventually. The key is to juggle your increasing geometric crowds, linking corresponding triangles and circles to their stations, cutting corners and making gaps to accommodate the load. And when you're finally defeated you'll get a final score denoting the days you lasted and your busiest numbers. It's very rewarding and, at least  initially, somewhat relaxing.Right now there are a number of cities to choose from and one mode, classic, to test your skills. As this is EARLY ACCESS there are some features missing, namely two upcoming modes, zen and EXTREME, and a soundtrack. I recommend putting this in window mode and blasting your favorite music for the time being.This is a fun, chill puzzler. No bells and whistles, no gimmick. Just a sleek, minimalistic take on being a municipal planner who's getting too old for this♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

								EDIT: Since I wrote this review, Mini Metro added a lot of settings (including audio!!!), a ""Daily Challenge Mode"", and a lot of other neat things! My recommendation still stands, just beware that some of the information is a bit dated.When I first got Mini Metro, I assumed it'd be similar to games like Train Simulator, or SimCity. And it is, to a certain extent. But it also isn't. Mini Metro is packed with a very minimal design, a beautiful colour scheme, and a very intuitive interface. It just looks... smooth. It opts for a very clean, non-distractive interface, which is welcoming for a casual game to play.The gameplay is stellar. While it doesn't reach levels of complexity that Train Simulator will have, it emulates a very tough, decision making game, while still keeping its casual feel. You plan out the metro system for a variety of cities, with each city having its own characteristics (for example, Osaka features the Shinkansen, or the Bullet Train). You struggle to make sure none of your stations overflow, and at the same time make sure that everybody gets where they want to. You are restricted in the amount of trains, lines, and tunnels you have, creating a level of depth most casual games don't hold.My only critique of the game is the lack of information and music/audio, but it's Early Access! For what it is, especially its price, Mini Metro is one of the best Early Access games I've come across. I've bought the game to support the developer, and watch the game evolve, and boy, sure it has. Updates are pushed regularily, and bugs are fixed.Mini Metro is one of those games that looks simple on the surface, but has layers of complexity, while keeping its casual style. I would recommend it to anybody who wants a game to sink 20 minutes in, and have fun while using their brain!			"

												Have you ever played a game and thought,""gee, why didn't I think of that?"" well Mini Metro is that game for me. It's so simple and elegant in it's design yet at the same time incredibly complex in it's strategy. The general gist is to get passengers from point A to B in the most efficient way possible using the resources available to you of course.To add an extra level of depth we're given real world locations as stages. If you ever felt like the guys who made NYC's MTA were stupid here's your chance to do better. At first you might think it's easy enough. Go to where you're needed most. But as your city's population grows so does the need for more trains and more stops. And locations can grow quite quickly.Mini Metro has two modes for your transpo sim pleasure. The first is normal where you are free to move and adjust lines at your convenience, already quite challenging. The second is extreme, which gives you the real world constraint of lines being permanent. Every time you reach a milestone you're rewarded with 2 tools to aid your construction. Eventually you'll reach overcrowding  at a station and that's pretty much game over but then a lovely option presents itself. You can now continue building your subway system for efficiency and play till your heart's content. The graphics are very simple. Basically shapes and lines. Usually there's also a river or two, designed after whichever city you're playing in. There's a bit of a learning curve later in the game where you're introduced to a few new elements. There are also options for colorblindness and a dark mode if you're like me and rather not be starting at a blinding white screen the entire time. There's also daily challenges and leaderboards if you like comparing your work with other's.My only gripe is with the music. I love me some Diasasterpeace  as  much as the next person but the tempo increases as your subway system grows. Which means the music can get as chaotic as your level and that leads to a bit of an annoyance sound wise. I wish there was an option for keeping the mellow beginner music throughout your game. It gets harder to focus with the hectic sounds or maybe that's the point. Mute is always an option. Despite that one gripe  this is one of the best if not the best train simulation puzzle game I've played this year. Nay, I'd say this might be the best train sim game ever.			"

								I remember discovering, and enjoying, this game back when it was a free alpha release. Now it is in a (more stable) beta form, even at this stage, I still consider DPC's efforts to be more than exceptional thus far. The gameplay is simplistic and easy to pick up, but difficult to master - and that is by virtue. I think this game has the most perfect difficulty curve of anything I have played - the start is pretty simple, however, over time, the game becomes a race between land-usage (represented by the different station icons) and line-deployment.I will give this game a pass on a few things because of its beta state, so here are the pros and cons:GOOD:+ Great, simple graphics (will run on anything that can display a screen. And yes, 4K 60 FPS, okay guys?).+ Easy-to-understand gameplay.+ Addictive gameplay+ Gentle difficulty curve+ Fun-strating (FUN + FRUSTRATING! Or fun + menstrating, take your pick)+ Great location design+ Touchscreen support (it works better with a touchscreen than a mouse!)BAD:- Efficiency stage (items given per # of passengers as opposed to weekly) can get boring once you reach ""peak"" performance- Menus do not use keyboard keys except EnterOverlooking because beta;? No sound (will be introduced later, but can be plus if you like the quiet environment while playing this game)? Menus a bit glitchyOverall: 9/10, waiting eagerly to see finished product.			"

												Visiting family over Christmas, and I wanted to play a game. It had to be cheap, since I was buying through someone elses account, and it had to be something you could pick up and play for a bit and not be concerned with leaving behind any unfinished saves or whatever. My family enjoy puzzle games too, so it was the first thing to look for.I stumbled across this and it seemed to tick all of the above boxes; so with low expectations due to the price, I gave it a download.What I've found is a brilliantly simple tower defence type puzzler which upon loading offes you a plain white screen with three different shapes on it. These are in fact underground stations that will accept that 'shape' of passenger. A graphical tutorial shows you that you have to draw a (railway) line between the shapes, and once done, a small train begins ferrying the shapes from their point of origin to the nearest station of the correct shape; changing lines where they cross in a station if needs be.As time ticks by, more stations appear along with more passengers; your task is to keep the system running without any single station becoming overwhelmed - and each game week you can choose an upgrade; an extra carriage for a train, the ability to draw a whole new line, the ability to tunnel under water, and sometimes an interchange (a higher capacity station).Brilliantly simple in execution and with a calming appearance and soundtrack, this is one of those 'one more go' type games which is easy to play but incredibly difficult to master.Highly recommended for a 'pick up and play' game when you have a few spare minutes; this would be an ideal tablet game but until then - it works with a big screen and mouse just as well.

								Positives:Though still in need of some refinement and balancing—and possibly some additional features—the core gameplay of Mini Metro scratches that city-building itch without requiring a major investment of time. You can play this on a break without worrying you'll be sucked in for hours (though you won't get bored if you did waste a day on it).The interface is a case study in complex, context-sensitive functionality from simple interactions. Click, hover, drag and drag paths all combine to do just what you want without requiring a tutorial. Though you might spend your first game puzzling it out, it all just works how you'd expect on the first or second try. Pure, blissful affordance. If only more games thought out their interface so elegantly.Negatives:There is a well-known ""cheat"" that isn't really a cheat (it's inherent in the game rules) but that renders the leaderboards meaningless. The devs are still struggling with this issue, and I think it's resolution must lie in clarifying the game's biggest ambiguity: am I running a simulation of a real subway network (in which case, shouldn't it cost me something to re-route lines) or am I stress-testing a subway plan by iterative design under increasing load (in which case, shouldn't I have some prior information about where additional stations will appear). This ambiguity is at the heart of the game's ultimate success or failure, and the devs need to do more than apply band-aid solutions and ad hoc rule tweaks. I feel like the solution is to split the game into entirely different game modes which rest on different existential assumptions about what the game really is.A little more information and clarity, compactly presented, would reduce some of the minor frustrations and provide greater insight into the network you've built. How many trains do I have on a given subway line? Can I see some meaningful data on throughput or efficiency? I have trouble believing the devs haven't read any of Edward Tufte's masterful works on data presentation. They'd do well to revisit his books for ideas.[REVISED] The passenger AI is improving. Rather than being deterministically stubborn, passengers have acquired a variability that sometimes even includes whimsical train hopping in the wrong direction and then back again. This is an improvement. There's often more than one way from A to B, not to mention that sometimes B2 or B3 offer variety. It's slightly mad, but it's better than robots.Some other minor complaints:- why am I limited to 4 trains per line? Couldn't that limit be a function of the line's length and/or the number of stations?- why can't a line go around a river bend rather than cutting the corner and requiring a tunnel?- why no save feature? sometimes I'm having a very successful game, but I have to get back to work, or join friends in another gameTL;DR:Enjoyable game. Can be played casually or obsessively. Brilliant with the potential to be an all-time classic. Well worth full price. It would be criminal to wait for a sale price.			"

								Mini Metro is an elegant subway management game from developer Dinosaur Polo Club. Game play, a matter of laying out subway routes in a growing metropolis, takes only minutes to grasp. Yet the emergent complexity of your task leads to hours of enjoyable and quite challenging play. The genre of Mini Metro is hard to say. I’ve heard it called both a sim and a puzzle game. The truth is it has elements of both (as well as a feature or two I associate with arcade games): you are given a map of an urban area composed of stops your train lines must connect. Your job is to choose the routes for the lines as well as which lines to upgrade with extra train cars and which stops to build interchanges at. As you play more stops are added, putting a greater strain on your system. The game ends when one of your stations remains over-crowded for too long, crashing your system. For every week you successfully keep the transit grid running smoothly you’re rewarded with a few more resources: some extra tunnels, a new subway line, etc.. (Worth noting is that passengers are simulated individually. They are represented as shapes corresponding with the stations they want to arrive at. Thus it is easy to tell at a glance where things are going wrong. Unlike, say, Sim City, where an esoteric formula determines where businesses will flourish, the mechanics of MiniMetro’s simulation are overtly visible. I find this pleasing.)All this sounds typical of a sim. But while Mini Metro definitely is about simulating the movements of passengers on a subway system, it stylized so as to focus solely on a design puzzle not on a recreation of reality in all its minutia. Money, scheduling, and staff are not part of the game at all. Construction is instantaneous. And if you choose to tear out a line and completely reroute it this can be done at any time at no penalty. Your task is simply to figure out how to lay out the pieces you’ve been given to deal with the ever increasing load.This stylization shines in one of Mini Metro’s best features—its minimalist graphics. The entire game looks like one of those iconic London tube maps (originally designed by electrical draughtsman Harry Beck—hence the circuit-like abstracted clarity). Your “city” is composed of a general layout of bodies of water and brightly colored tube lines connecting geometric nodes. So confident are the creators of the resulting visual charm that screen capture is built into the game. The confidence is warranted.Still in Beta at the moment, Mini Metro does have some rough edges. The most prominent is the complete absence of sound. (The developers assure that audio will be implemented any day.) More irksome is clumsiness in the interface. Rerouting lines where you’d like them is sometimes rather more difficult than the click and drag interface seems to warrant. Also, lines occasionally fail to properly bend to avoid water when it seems they should.  But none of this was a significant obstacle to my enjoyment—especially as a pause button at least allowed me the time to do the needed fiddling. I still hope these wrinkles get ironed out, though.Gameplay is fundamentally open ended. There is no point at which you’ve “solved” a city, rather you simply keep building until your system collapses. Nor is there any question of memorizing a working strategy for a given city: the stops one begins with, and the order in which they are subsequently added is randomized so that no two playthroughs are the same. This is where play felt arcade-like: even though your task is more typical of a sim or puzzler, your ultimate aim ends up being to beat your previous score, that is, to transport more Londoners (or Tokyoans, New Yorkers, etc.)  than you managed to last time. It’s addicting. It’s difficult not to respond to a loss with the though “I can do better” and begin again.To sum up, Mini Metro isn’t quite finished, but it’s already a really solid choice for people who want to grapple with a difficult design problem in a very attractive package. [Disclosure: I received a review copy of MM from the developer.]			"

												When I first encountered Mini Metro it was via watching someone else play it. My first thoughts were “That looks really boring. Why so many lines? I don’t even like trains!” And that was that. Fast forward to present day, I was asked to review this title and at first was worried. What could I possible get out of such a simplistic game? What I got was a fun and challenging experience that reminded me to not judge a book by its cover. What this title lacks in flash and flair it makes up for with a solid and enjoyable gaming experience. While this might not be everyone’s cup of tea, if you enjoy a casual time with some challenge then definitely consider this game.When you start things up you’re dumped right into the action. I’m not sure if there is a tutorial, I don’t think so, I had to learn via trial and error. While it was easy to pick up I would have liked there to be a tutorial or some sort of help feature just in case it’s needed. The game has no story, your goal is to create a functioning train system in the city of your choosing, there are eleven real world cities maps to play on. Each station is represented by a shape on the map, it can be a square, circle, diamond among other shapes. Passengers pop up at the stations wanting to get to another station and you have to connect the shapes with lines. Your train line can be short or long, straight but usually twisting. Each level you start with a limited amount of resources, usually always three lines; the amount of bridges and/or tunnels varies. As you connect more stations to each other you can make more passengers happy and hit milestones where you get more resources like extra lines, carriages to attach to a train to hold more people and other goodies. The challenge is that these are limited and the levels get more difficult and harder to manage the longer you play.It’s the aforementioned rise in difficulty which makes this game fun. What starts off as simple and relaxing can turn into a disaster if you haven’t laid your tracks correctly leaving you in a panic to try and fix your lines to handle the influx of passengers. The way the cities grow is random so each time you play things will be different and you have to adjust accordingly. However, for the most part things started collapsing around 1000 passengers because of limited resources. There is also little variety in what resources are available and even with random city growth most levels tend to be a lot of the same thing since the basic strategy to the game is the same. The game does have three modes; normal, endless and extreme, which I don’t dare try. There are also daily challenges to participate in but for the most part you keep playing to try and beat your own score and try new layouts for your lines.The graphics are very simple, however they are clean and easy to look at. There is nothing fancy going on here, the maps are based off of real world cities but even then they are still only bare bones in appearance. The stations are simple shapes and the different lines come in a variety of colors, each city has their own palette that mimics real world train line colors. The game offers a colorblind mode and a night mode, while I haven’t used these I am impressed that the developers added these features. The music in the game isn’t outstanding, but is soothing and fits well with the pacing of the game, there are also sound effects. The beeps of crowded train stations can be very useful if you become distracted elsewhere on the map.Mini Metro is a great title to play casually for short bursts at a time, or even relax with endless mode. The game has Steam trading cards as well as achievements that offer a bit of challenge, some are easy to obtain while others require certain criteria be met that a player wouldn’t normally do in a level. The game can become very repetitive, however, and I personally wouldn’t mind more content or complexity. The price is decent but again, could offer more for the ten dollar price tag. Overall I recommend this title, it’s simple and fun and sometimes that’s all a game needs to be.My RatingMust buy.A good game to buy.Only buy if on sale.Mediocre.Avoid at all costs.This review was submitted for Review Experts, check us out for more reviews.

Early Access Review
								Mini Metro, currently available in Early Access (the game can be purchased but is still in development so some elements, such as sound in this case, are missing or unfinished), is a game about moving people. Where this may seem like an oversimplification, it is not, and the game is all the better for it.   Other games of this sort focus on such elements as budget and specific regions, population density and specific destinations of interest to that population; but Mini Metro instead focuses on the general and the deliberately vague; and this works fantastically given the style of the game. There is no budget with which to be concerned, there are no apparent city divisions or districts. The placement of stations is random, and also out of the control of the player. In many ways, this almost makes the goal more true to life of a real world occupation, albeit without feeling like work: somebody is presenting the player with a scenario, and the goal is to make it work by connecting the stations, and keeping people moving.The player begins the game by selecting one of three game types, and then the city that the player would like to play. These cities are mostly without features, save for waterways. The player looks upon either an off white void or sort-of-charcoal, if night-mode is turned on, with three subway stations to connect. Speaking primarily of the Commuter game mode (the one most likely to be played) the goal is to connect these stations in as efficient a manner as possible by drawing lines to connect them using the limited number of lines, cars and carriages that have been provided. With the initial three stations this is a simple task. More stations are added as the game progresses, which serves to complicate matters. Where the player may have easily begun using only a single line to connect all of the stations, this method will lead to disaster if it is maintained. The player will have to add new lines, new cars, add on carriages to those cars to ensure that no station overfills; and all of these are in limited supply. At the end of each week the player is granted an additional car, and then the choice between one other addition: tunnels, which are required to traverse through waterways, carriages, which extend the length of a train, lines, which adds a coloured line with which to connect stations, and interchanges, which increase capacity and speedily load and unload passengers.  Only two of these additions are presented as options. The stations are randomly placed with each play through, as are the choices of additions, so memorization will not help the player. A set of options are presented, and the player has to make that work. The stations themselves are without names, and are instead represented by shapes. Most commonly, these shapes are squares, triangles and circles, and occasionally 'other' shapes will appear that one could regard as special stations. The idea is that a ""person"" who boards at a circle station will never wish to travel to another circle shaped station. These individuals are also represented by shapes: a circle shaped passenger wishes to travel to a circle shaped station, a triangle passenger wishes to travel to a triangle station, and so forth. Therein lies the strategy: a line consisting of nothing but circle stations will lead to disaster as no passenger will wish to travel from one station to another. The player must try to connect as many differently shaped stations as possible. There WILL be some overlap and stations of the same shape connecting to one another; but the goal is to minimize those occurrences to maintain efficient routes and prevent overflow.The game begins in a very calm fashion. Simply draw lines, add lines, extend lines, watch the trains pick up and deliver their passengers. It is that way for a while: calm. It does not take particularly long for that to change. All players will reach a point where chaos starts to creep in. Maybe entire lines, previously perfectly placed, are no longer efficient and have to be removed and rebuilt.  As the player cannot control where new stations are placed, and what form those stations will be, new stations may spawn close to lines that already have a pair of stations that are the same shape on either side of the new addition; and that reduces the efficiency of the line.  The alternative is to extend one of the other lines out to this new addition; but the player cannot cross the lines except by meeting them up at existing stations, which will make that extension even longer in the event that it does need to cross a line to access the new station.  While such choices represent a challenge, that challenge never feels to me to be particularly stressful.  The presentation of the game simply does not allow it.  The end result could be orderly, almost a work of art where transit maps are concerned; or it could look like a scattered mess of random connections; but so long as the stations never reach capacity then presentation hardly matters to the game. It may matter to the player, mind you. During one play through I had a well functioning three-lined transit system that crossed at odd intervals and zigzagged to and fro. It worked, and I hated it. It just didn't look proper. I had nobody to blame but myself: I COULD find another way for the system to work, but I had not looked for one.The visual presentation is minimalistic. This is a good thing. Its appearance is that of a subway/metro map. The blank background populated only by single, thick lines that represent the metro rails that the player is placing and moving about serve well to illustrate the real transit maps that are out there in the world. The player is, in essence, painting the metro maps that one would see at subway stations. It is perfect, and immediately familiar to anybody who has found themselves staring at a map, plotting their subway route and transfers to progress from point A to point B. That said, those who have never ridden a subway, or are simply unfamiliar with subway/metro transit maps may be at a loss as to why this game's visuals are as they are, and it may look to such individuals as little more than lines on an empty space without knowing or appreciating the context as to why that look may be fitting. This is a fault of nobody, only the result of individual experiences.Audio. There is none. There WILL be some; but at this stage of development it has not yet been implemented. If that's a turn off for you, then back away. Otherwise just fire up some music or background noise that you feel is appropriate, and enjoy the completed music and sound effects once they are added in.Lack of audio aside, everything, for me, just felt right. The challenge is perfect, the visual style is appealing and fitting to the context of the gameplay, and the package as a whole has a polish to it, both because of and in spite of its minimalism. It is a game as casual as the player wants it to be with its difficulty settings, and as challenging as they can handle until the end finally comes as one station finally reaches over-capacity. I recommend it to anybody who is looking for something with few rules to remember, that is satisfying, and well put together.			"

												I hated shapes all the way through grade school and with Mini Metro I've grown to hate them all the more however I can't stop playing this stupid game that revolves around moving shapes around. Plus it is a very stressful game which I don't need in my life but the game is so freaking good I keep playing anyway. 10/10 would hate shapes and cause undo stress again.			"

								Please mind the gap. Between the train and the platform. Mind the gap, please.This is an awesome game - awesome idea and awesome execution. It may be listed as early access but is absolutely worth the asking price. Each game starts you off with three stations: A square (train station), a triangle (commercial) and a circle (residential). Each station spawns passengers which want to go to one of the three station types. As the city expands, new stations open up, mostly of triangle and circle types, but as hospitals, tourist attractions, airports and banks open around the city, unique stations open along with these attractions. This makes it more difficult to keep the metro working, but in a very nice difficulty curve. Each in-game week you keep the Metro running, you receive a locomotive and can spend your weekly budget on something new: A new line, a carriage, rezoning, a larger station, etc. These upgrades are meant to help you survive the next week. Well - eventually a station will overcrowd and you will not be able to  clear it. Your score is the number of passengers you delivered to their destination. If you however prefer to play this as a send box, there is a mode for you too. In this game mode, stations don't overcrowd and there is no lose condition. You simply play to have fun and be as efficient as possible. Overall a very good and very fun game. It is well polished and well paced and balanced. Please mind the gap. Between the train and the platform. Mind the gap, please.			"

												Mini Metro is a little game with minimal art where you create your own metro maps according to the needs of your city and people.Each station is represented by a geometrical symbol (you start with a cube, circle, and triangle at three random spots, relatively close to each other), and at the stations people will appear as smaller copies of those geometrical symbols, which indicates to which kind of station they want to travel. By connecting the stations with your rails, you create ways for your people to travel to their wanted stations. As time goes by, more stations will appear, usually more cubes, circles, and triangles, and it doesn't matter to which station your people travel as long as it is the right shape.You have a limited amount of train lines, bridges/tunnels, and trains/wagons. Each end of the week, you will get a choice between two additional supplies, to help you out. Choose wisely as it can make a difference between surviving the game or ending early. Luckily you can constantly change how you arrange your supplies.Later on more and more unique stations will appear in shapes of stars, ovals, crosses, etc... and you will only ever get one of each. This is where it gets tough, as travellers to those stations can crowd your trains fast. They will also start appearing more and more in harder to reach places (across water, etc...), and the stations will get people wanting to travel faster as well. The game ends when a station has too many people waiting to get on trains.The gameplay is pretty solid, the music is very relaxing, and on endless mode the game can be just what you need to have a quiet time. Each city has its own unique achievement that makes the gameplay a little different for each map, which otherwise would make each city just too similar. It makes replaying the game not a chore.			"

ESPRESSO SHOT REVIEWMini Metro is a wonderfully addictive game that involves strategy and quick planning to run a metro transit service on the fly.  Deal with making tunnels, crowded connections, weird layouts, and of course keeping all the people going from one place to the next.  In a seemingly endless combination of options, your goal is to move as many people as possible before your mass transit system overcrowds.  Even for those who don’t like management games, this is a gem of game to play through.PROS-	well thought mechanisms to create your metro-	re-playability with high scores -	a real metro look to the maps and layout, beautifully simple and modernCONS-	slightly repetitive-	can be a game you enjoy, but end up leaving after awhileFRENCH PRESSED FULL CUP REVIEWI look down and all I see are triangles, circles, squares, and lines.  Yep, just triangles, circles, squares, and lines. I’m looking at my breakfast. It looks like my Mini Metro transit map of Melbourne. Not that Mini Metro has gotten to me, naaaah.  But look, the toast triangles are so far across my plate that if someone wanted to get to the orange juice glass, they’d have to go right through the eggs.  That’s not going to work.  Especially with my eggs making a river of yolk.   And then, how is my coffee going to get around the bacon?  I’d have to go across the butter dish with a …butter knife bridge, of course.  Wait up, what if I just re-arrange my orange juice with some straws so that it goes through the eggs without messing them up?  Boy, next time I’m just having a breakfast burrito.Welcome to Mini Metro, the seriously competent micro-management strategy transit simulation.  You start with three basic stops in a variety of geographic situations, including several international cities to unlock.  London is one of the first maps and that is where I started.  Your first three stops - circle, square, and triangle - are unfortunately expanding to locales on both sides of a river.  Well, hurry to it, there are passengers waiting already.  Connect the transit lines as efficiently as you can to keep the stations from overcrowding.  People will line up, and they are represented by the shape of the station they are headed to. Easy enough, right?  Except more connections keep popping up and you have to connect them as soon as possible or it will overcrowd on you.  Then, trouble begins.  Lots of people want to connect to the square location, but all the stations on that line are triangles or circles for several stops. Pretty soon it snowballs into a screen teaming with passengers wanting to go to a station is that is nowhere near the next several stops.  So, then comes the strategy bit.  How do you maintain these metro lines?You have the following to work with: metro lines, tunnels, carriages, stations, and later some specialty trains like bullet trains for Osaka and trams for Melbourne.  Unfortunately, you don’t get all of those at once and even what you have is a finite amount.  It comes down to managing resources while you wait for the clock to pass in the hopes of another train to add to the map and relieve some overcrowding.  Connect too many stations and you may make the metro line unnecessarily long, or don’t have enough connections on the wrong side of the map and you’ll be overcrowding quickly with no relief in sight.The rivers can also be tricky.  You get across one, only to run out of tunnels. Multiple tunnels can relieve a lot of stress on the lines, but at the expense of spreading your resources very thin.  I’d find myself with a few lines across the river, only to have a station point pop on the wrong side of the river where I don’t have a good layout of my lines.  Sometimes, you have extra metro lines to take care of those stations on the opposite side of the river, but only if you didn’t opt for more transit cars. You can stop and redo the entire map, though.  That’s the beauty of it.  There are endless amounts of ways to correct the map midway.  Just pause, and retract all the lines.  You can then stop and stare at the screen a bit to see the best way to change it up.  Next, put it all back together and see if it’s better off than before.  I love this part. I’ve got total control to rethink my strategy.  FINAL THOUGHTSI sit back and enjoy the screen once I have a good map in motion –  it’s a bit like looking at a fish tank.  The map is alive, moving to and fro in it’s busy, independent life of it’s own.  And yet it’s got to be maintained, just like an encased ecosystem.  My mini metro fish tank.  The slightest stress on it, and you have a tank of overcrowded fish dying on you.  It’s this quality that makes the game rather relaxing, despite the endless hordes of passengers.I enjoyed the Osaka station the most, with the bullet trains involved.   Hong Kong was also quite frantic as it tended to overcrowd very quickly.  You may find one particular city appeals to you more than others.  It’s an aesthetically pleasing, calming strategic game.  I honestly, never play these type of games but I can see this being something I leave on my PC to calm my nerves after a frantic shooter game.  Perhaps it will come out on a phone app so I can play this on my phone too.  Wonderful game if you like high score games with an intelligent strategy design, feel no hesitation is grabbing it when you can.  Rate 8.5/10.Disclaimer: I was provided a review key from the developer.			"

												People say this game is relaxing when its not relaxing in the slightest.  It is interesting, and it's fun for a while... but its infuriating.... and in my opinion, the difficulty curve is too steep.  The game does not give you enough resources to do much better than 1000 passengers per map, and there's a lot of luck involved.  I could just not be that great at it yet, but with 7 hours invested in to it, I don't feel like I'm getting much better and it's not fun enough for me to want to become better.  I got 7 hours of gameplay out of it for 6$ and I will probably return to it from time to time, so it wasn't a waste of my money, but I expected more from it.  Buy it if its on sale.EDIT OF REVIEW:  I love this game.  I was just... I was wrong, earlier, about this game.  This game is so much ♥♥♥♥ing fun it's ridiculous.  Once you get the hang of it, it gets a lot more fun, because the game allows me to multi-task with the game in windowed mode.  I can watch Netflix, draw sketches, do homework... Really relaxing.  So, yeah.			"

								An interesting wee sim which looks simple but once things get going it gets hard; fast! Trying to get an ever increasing and swarming maze of stations work in harmony is both fun and infuriating at the same time. I've kept coming back with new ideas on how to make my next play work.What I liked most was how I had to constantly think on my feet as to how to connect this new station in to my network but also how I could use it to ease pressure on other lines. Placing new trains required thought and adding carriages not just a straight forward decision. As the game develops I'm interested to see where this goes and what other real world locations will be included.The game at this stage isn't without its faults. I've found it difficult at times to re-draw lines or disconnect them from stations but this is just nit-picking. Overall Mini Metro is a great game and a fantastic way to kill time, thoroughly recommended.			"

								This game is a very fun graph load-balancing optimisation problem :-)  You have to ensure passangers get to their destination; the tiny shapes indicated at each station/on the subway indicate where they want to go. The trick is that you have a limited number of bridges across water and you can't intersect lines, although you can run them in parallel. The other problem is that it is game over if a station fills up with angry passengers who are waiting for a connecting subway! "

												It's exactly what it looks like: A minimalist puzzle game with a creative concept.That's what you think it is, and you're very correct. The visuals say it all, and convey it all, in a manner that is easy to comprehend instinctively before you purchase. But let me expand on that.The design also conveys information INSIDE the game, not just the trailer. That's important. This type of minimalistic puzzler shouldn't sell you on simplicity and then be hard to understand. Mini Metro does what it promises so clean and so clear that you'll be surprised. It's graceful.In essence, you are free to draw a selection of colored lines between designate points (stations) along a map. When lines are connected, they allow a train car to move automatically from station to station. At each station are a number of small shapes building in a queue. When the train stops at a station, it unloads any shapes (passengers) it is currently carrying provided they match the shape of the station, then grabs the passengers at the station and carries them along its line.This plays automatically for a few turns until new stations appear. Then you need more lines.Soon you have too little carrying capacity and need more trains.As you carry more and more people to their destination, you unlock upgrades that complicate the problem at hand without attaching complications to the mechanics. The additions are fluid. It keeps the experience tight and meditative, albeit a bit stressful because it's (mostly) in real time.As you unlock new cities, the geography and use of tunnels/bridges come into play. Some levels have a faster train car, or a crazier population growth. Keep at it and you'll find yourself organically creating your own tricks: breaking down lines and moving them back and forth between overflowing stations over and over to create shorter paths for your trains, or pausing just so you can flip a train in the opposite rotation for one cycle. Every little decision can change your success.This game works. It is fun.If you've watched the trailer and read even a brief description you'll already know whether or not you like this type of experience. If you DO like it, then this will NOT disappoint you.

Mini Metro Review 
A Video of Mini Metro
By: AidanDVG

			Hello everyone! Welcome to my very first review. Today I look at the Early-Access indie simulation game, Mini Metro. Enjoy! Follow me on twitch for when I go live - twitch.tv/duvangrgataonea Friend me on Steam if you...		


          Our object of interest is Mini Metro, a charming Simulation game in which you take control of a metro and oversee how the lines connect, making tracks with the click and drag of a cursor. The game starts you off in London, a simple town with one obstacle in the middle. If everything goes smoothly, by the end of the week, you gain access to more supplies in the forms of a new locomotive and the choice between another line besides your existing yellow, red and blue ones, or a carriage to add on to an existing locomotive. It’s simple, but charming.          The gameplay is enamorating and captivating, albeit simple. People (I assume they’re people) arrive at one station, and their shape determines where they go. If a triangle person arrives at a circle station, the train picks it up and brings it to a triangle station. The fact that is uses shape-people instead of real people is a good choice. The game never tells you where the people need to go, but you can figure it out on your own. The only thing it tells you is that you click and drag to create a line from station to station. I’m drawn to the minimalist graphics and the fluid look, but what takes the cake is how the game balances your situation. There is never a moment you feel that this is too easy, nor do you feel pressured that your metro will shut down. Oh yeah, if you leave too many people at a station, your metro gets shut down. That’s how you lose.           When the game starts, you are given three separate lines and three stations you need to connect. You might feel drawn to use all three lines, but wait it out and just use one at the beginning. The things you need to worry about most are that you have to have every station covered well, and you have to be efficient. That’s why it is a good idea to never have too sharp of a turn in your line, it slows the locomotives down. I like to have fluid lines that never make a rapid stop. If a new station appears, either use another line that you have been saving, or completely redesign your track as you can delete all of it at once, or take tracks off the edges of a line. That’s the only thing that has annoyed me about this game so far- you can’t take away a track in the middle. If you don’t want your line to stop at that track, but it isn’t on the edge, you have to delete the whole thing.           Overall, I really enjoy Mini Metro. A charming, bright, minimal indie game with just enough challenge to keep me coming back, and just enough variety to keep me playing. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a game that can relax you, but also offers a challenge. If I were to give it a score, I’d say an 8.5/10. I would like more features implemented as the game improves throughout early-access. It’s a great game for a good price, but I wish there was a little more to do. The only gameplay drawback is it is a little awkward to re-route or get rid of metro railways without deleting your entire rail. So all in all, it's a great game for a great price. I implore you to pick it up and I can't wait to see new content added.			"

								This is one of the greatest games to play when I'm not in the mood for blowing up stuff. This game is a masterpiece in with evoking a seriously zenergetic feeling (yes I know I just used a made up word that combines zen and energetic into one, but you know what I think? I don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥) The game doesn't require anything to play, purely an open mind that can be plunged into pressure at any moment. Tension and tranquility are two of the most important factors in video gaming for me, and this Mini Metro nails both. I plan on buying whatever games DPC puts out, as their first has been purely spot-on.Some minor issues that you may take problem with before purchasing (I didn't, but some people may):No music or sound. I know this is a major setback for some, but I honestly thought my music library suffices. DPC has stated that there will be audio in the final game (which should be expected of any game anyway), but I don't think it's too big a lack at the moment.A fairly limited levelset. There are currently eight levels, some of which have no major differences. Here's what the devs had to say: Originally posted by peter:We're aiming to release Mini Metro with 5 - 10 playable cities, with more added post-launch.Hopefully we'll get some variation/new obstacles.Lacks content for the price. But it's still fun.Finally, here's my summary/tl;dr/whatever:An amazing game that you should most certainly give money to, minor problems (including lack of music) will be fixed before/by launch. And it's seven f**king dollars. Who can't afford a seven dollar game? And if you for some reason don't want to pay seven dollars for this beautiful creation, then you can wait for the mobile one to be released! I see no reason why anyone should have an excuse not to buy this game.			"

								A lovely game that is easy to understand and got three different difficulties, from the more stressful mode to the zen mode.  You connect ""dots"" to let people flow from station to station, and if a station gets too flooded with people game is over.I find the game compelling.Even as it is a bit tricky to come up with the best routes, even the stressful parts of this game feels relaxing.It is good to play for a little while, all from five minutes to a couple of hours. A game I will cherish and return for 10-30mins gameplay on and off for a long time to come I imagine. A refreshing game idea executed in a style I have never seen before.It does feel like it would be a touchscreen/ipad kind of game though (in the most positive manner).In short; a puzzle/brainteaser game with a simple but very nice layout.

												Having played this game since early access I must say that this game has improved immensly. With the addition of sounds and the daily challenge, this game is well worth the price and I would reccomend this game to all who might be interested.ORIGINAL EARLY ACCESS REVIEW:NON-SERIOUS REVIEW:The goal of this game is to build a subway, and then be more sucessful than Rob Ford. Watch your station platforms though, if any of them start to look like Bloor-Yonge Station its game-over and you will have to start over again.SERIOUS REVIEW:Mini Metro is a minimalist game where you build subway stations in an attempt to maintain passenger efficiency. It gets harder as stations randomly appear as the days pass and more people are in need of transit. Like all great puzzle games this one has both a CLASSIC (Commuter) mode and a ZEN (Senic) mode. "

What I liked:  Casual management game that is simply to learn What You Need to Know:  This is not a puzzle game in what most people think, there is no “real” goal. It’s about seeing how far you can go before a station gets overcrowded (always happens around 1,000 people delivered) This is more of an efficiency puzzle game, where you need to optimize and change trains, line and pause the game when you get late game (turns less casual and relaxing if you were looking for that) The game is very simple and it makes it easy to learn, but every level is mostly the same, with the only difference is the amount of rivers that will require tunnels and only 2 different trains, one fast and one smaller that are only available in one level each.(Why not give us a choice of which train each level, would add more depth) Speaking of choices, you get after a week in game, always the only train the game has, and one selection of a new lane, tunnel, or carriage, which the selection is given to you at random. So it might not give you what you need, requires you to think ahead and decide what is need more atm. If you love to optimize stuff in your game, and have yet to play the games below I still don’t recommend this game. I found this forum thread to give you better games that might be more what your looking for https://steamcommunity.com/app/375820/discussions/0/481115363863361128/ My Score: CPaid: Included in $6 Humble Bundle Main reason for dislike: Has so little gameplay depth and content Games similar I recommend that are better:   Factorio = for optimization and designing gameplay, not a puzzle game  Infinifactory and another other Zachtronics games( they make the best puzzles games in this genre)  LYNE =  casual line connecting puzzle game, actual casual game, no optimization  factoryidle = an idle game where you design your factory, has optimation, it’s quite fun  "

								At the time that I am making this review, the game is in early alpha.   This is a very simple subway/tube/metro/(insert regional train name here) management game that is very relaxing and has the wonderfully style of subway maps. You need to get passengers to the correct stops using careful planning and modifying, and not let your stations get overcrowded.    Warning: You will learn to hate the shapes of circles, and to a lesser degree, triangles.10/10 would recommend to anyone			"

												Mini Metro is described as a puzzle game, but to me it is not. A puzzle game, to me, should pose the player with a challenge to which there might be multiple solutions, but the solutions are at least static -- a solution that gives you X points now, gives you X points tomorrow. Mini Metro does not have that, as each challenge consists of the random appearance of random city types, between which you have to draw metro lines, with random upgrades appearing ever so often. Your score depends for a large part on how the random elements appear. The normal game allows you to remove metro lines at a whim, and most players quickly discover a cheesy tactic in this respect which can increase your score considerably. Unfortunately, this cheesy tactic is a chore to pull off, so once you have discovered it, the normal game is no fun anymore. There is still the extreme challenge for each map, which means that each line that you add is there to stay. This makes the game a lot more fun, but unfortunately in the extreme challenge the influence of the randomness on the final result is much bigger than in the normal game, as you cannot make small corrections to deal with the appearance of particularly unlucky cities (which happens quite a lot). Finally, this game suffers from the fact that there is no ""goal"". There are no ""solutions"". You cannot say ""I have solved this map"". You can only say ""I have been able to score 20,000 points on this map"". The next time you play that map, you can try to beat your own score, but why would you? You probably were particularly lucky when you got your high score, and thus you are just replaying to see if you can get lucky again.Despite those negative comments, I still recommend the game. It provides you with several dozens of fun hours, until you have nothing more to discover about the game. Most maps have something unique which sets them apart from the other maps. But once you have discovered each map and found a way to get a score that puts you in something like the top 10% of the players (which generally won't take long), you are done with it. Don't expect this game to have lasting appeal. But the price is right for the amount of fun that it brings.			"

Early Access Review
								Obviously — in its beta stages — Mini Metro is a work in progress by a hardworking, dedicated young company genuinely listening to the consumer. But I'm pleased beyond recognition to be part of its maturation. The concept is simple: Keep on top of a rapidly expanding metro system in a wide variety of maps (with more maps on the way) by drawing your own ""map"". As new stations pop up, extend lines, reroute lines, add trains and carriages to existing lines, or pause the simulation, delete the whole thing and start fresh. Each game is different, and each time you learn a little more to add to your burgeoning strategies.My only fault is that the better you get and the longer the game goes, the tedium seeps in. But that's certainly no reason to choose a different map and see what new adventures await on that ever-so-tantalizing blank map.			"

												This is a slightly disappointing game. It revels in its obscurity, expecting you to understand its mechanics as it slowly introduces them. But it doesn't even tell you the *purpose* of the game. There are also some weird bugs, like when you're trying to move a wagon between different lines -- difficult to describe so I'll just say it's glitchy.I also find the game to be too difficult for its own sake. It's more akin to a simulation game than a board game, yet it refuses to give information about stations (such as expected attendance?), and makes it hard to plan your lines ahead.Overall though, there's a deep feeling of satisfaction when playing in endless mode after losing a game, and seeing the trains live their life. I don't know. I'm unlikely to finish the game, and I wouldn't recommend it unless it's heavily on sale, but I can't not recommend it either. So there you go, the thumb up is there for you, you sneaky b*stards.			"

								At first glance, this game may seem simplistic and easy. It really is ""simple"" in what you do, but in design, it's very complex. Start off with a few stations and link them with a subway line. As the game goes on, you get more stations and more congestion. Suddenly you're scrambing to work out where to place new trains, subway cars and lines before your system crashes. Very addictive and very fun!			"

												The game is too committed to minimalism. While that commitment certainly makes the game look pretty, it also leaves the mechanics obscure. I suspect there are some deeper strategic considerations that come into play when deciding which stations to connect with which lines, but the game never explains them at all. Random placement of stations on the maps also makes the various levels all feel pretty much the same. Sure, the rivers are in different places. But that's about it. Regardless of which level you pick, you're randomly connecting randomly placed stations hoping that the randomly spawning passengers don't randomly overwhelm any one station. The game needs a better tutorial or better disclosure of the underlying mechanics. As it stands, it is too opaque to enjoy.			"

												Mini Metro is a devilishly clever game that uses straightforward and simple mechanics to immerse you in 5 to 15 minutes of increasingly hectic gameplay. Each round starts with lulling, zen-like ease and and music to match. As the game progresses and your transit systems becomes more and more complex the atmosphere slowly and imperceptibly shifts until you find yourself racing to pick-up passengers from an over-crowded station with the pace of the music matching your ever increasing heartbeat.Pros:- Easy to learn mechanics.- Enough different mechanics to offer variations in strategies approaches but not too many to over-burden the player with choice.- Great soundtrack and minimalist design.- Great for solo (trying to best your previous scores) or competitive (trying to top the leaderboards) play.- 5-15 minutes of play per round is great for a more casual gaming experience.Cons:- There can be minor bugs from time to time which may take a bit to get fixed but I've never experienced anything game-breaking and the devs are really involved in the community.

The different layout of stations every time you play, and having to choose between new trains, train capacity, new lines, bridges, etc. make this endlessly replayable.			"

								Just to note: I'm reviewing the Early Access version...Oh dear God!  I haven't been able to let this one go.  Okay, so right now there is no sound, no music and only two of the three game modes are complete, but I don't really care!  You see: the gameplay is right there already.  It couldn't be simpler.  Join the map's stations as they appear at random on the map with your available lines (you start with 3) - simple.  That's it.   Ha ha ha ha ha.........  Yeah, right!This game is maddeningly addictive, be warned!  I can't put my finger on why, but I can't leave the game alone.  When you are rewarded, should you take a new line colour, a tunnel or a carriage (yes, just ONE carriage so you'd best add it to whichever train needs it most - correct answer is ALL of them!  Too bad).  To make things more complex, there are rivers and your lines can only span rivers if you have enough tunnel points (you soon won't)!  And just as you sit back to admire your beautiful network of circular, triangular and square stations all running a seamless service - up pops a hexagonal, slice, star or cross-shaped station!  These specials only pop up once, and it really matters where you add these (because you'll soon have a lot of shapes crawling around your network trying to reach them).  At the end of each game week, you are rewarded with an extra locomotive, and a random choice between an additional line colour, a tunnel point or an extra carriage.  You'll actually need them all.  Again, too bad, so sad...The simplicity of the GUI is wonderful.  You can drag lines around, stretching them any which way in zen-like fashion to join up stations as they inconveniently appear on your map.  You can erase lines and rebuild (you'll do that a lot)  Your only goal is not to let any station become too busy - dead simple - except it  isn't!  Already there are tactics evolving in the forum for making temporary lines to shift the load, but that's rather like rearranging deck-chairs on the Titanic.  Your game WILL go down in a Game Over screen.  Get used to it - you'll see it a lot!  Despite this game not being finished, it is already excellent and worth that weeny £4.99.  I'm told that buying direct through Humble will also net you the upcoming Android version (I missed that one).  This is one of those rare gems that is hugely addictive, simple yet clever.  Can't recommend this one enough!			"

Early Access Review
								I have a fairly low-spec laptop, and so when a friend recommended this to me, I was terrified it wouldn't run. Even with my crappy processor and such, Mini Metro is an absolute delight to play. It is very simple, yet beautifully complex, and as such I have really fallen for this little gem of a game. You start out with three stations, connect them up, and all of a sudden as soon as new stations come along the game begins to flower as its 'simple yet complex' gameplay unravels. Circle stations are all the more frequent as you progress on your map, and finding ways of connecting these to your busy metro without having two consecutive circle stations on one line quickly becomes a challenging task. (The words 'bloody circle stations' are frequently heard from my room)As each 'week' passes, you gain a new locomotive and can then choose between a new line, tunnels or a carriage, with only a choice between two of the three each 'week'. This element of the game does rather force you to have a strategic approach to your map, and if you do not make a wise choice, you may soon find stations are becoming overcrowded with nothing you can do about it! I love that the way you route lines is not finite and you can rejig lines however you may like if things begin to get complicated. In an odd way, this game has rather given me a new respect for the rail network in real life and how difficult they must be to manage in terms of overcrowding. A very smooth running, pretty game with all the (similar) technicality and strategy of managing a real Underground's overcrowding issues. My highest praise goes to the developers. :)			"

												Solid strategy title, and a shorter/pick up and play one at that to bridge the gap between larger titles. While it's very minimalistic, and the fx/music is pleasant, it stressed me out. Every time a station was about to overcrowd, or I ran out of tunnels to bridge to a new station, or I immediately needed new trains/carriages/lines to alleviate a line, and I was several days away from the Sunday in game time, I wanted to pull my hair out. It's the best 6 hours I've wasted in recency. They pay mind to the small details, such as the train sizes, or train types. Osaka having the bullet train, Cairo having smaller trains for only 4 people. Each city has it's own geography. It definitely has some replay value, if only by your own stubbornness since it gets more and more difficult with the more passengers you have. I doubt I'll ever manage those achievements, but would play again.Every time I complain about transit in my city I remember this game, and I immediately silence myself.			"

								Mini Metro is a fantastic puzzle game with a unique art style and some really challenging mechanics.  I've been following the game since it went into Alpha and it has changed significantly with each update, adding new features constantly.  The beta release added some gorgeous UI tweaks that truly make the game feel like a proper game.  Everything from the typography, to the minimalistic graphic style is absolutely gorgeous to look at.  I can't wait to hear the music, and sound effects when they eventually get added.  The gameplay consists of a mix of puzzle and transport sim, connecting various stations (each a different geometric shape) to one another.  Each station spawns various passengers, which need to go to their corresponding station (Square passenger goes to square station, etc.).  There are so many approaches that you can take to each level that it feels like an open world puzzle game, something i've never quite experienced before.  As the level progresses and the map expands more stations pop up, forcing you to constantly redraw your routes to add the new stations and passengers.  If that station becomes too overcrowded it gives you about a minute before a game over screen.Mini Metro is a refreshing departure from the typical puzzle game, one that can be relaxing, challenging and rewarding all at the same time, all while looking absolutely stunning.  What a fantastic game, can't wait to see what the developer adds to make it better.			"

												I fell in love with Mini Metro from the first time I saw it, when it was the result of the Ludum Dare compo. It had a brilliant strategy of releasing a web-playable demo (RIP Unity Web Player), a demo so good that you could simply play it there and not buy the game.But the guys at Dino Polo Club announced the Early Access, which I propmptly bought, as the potential with this game was really visible. And it did not disappoint. I am someone that is not much into narratives, but rich gameplay, and this is what this game offers: rich, profound gameplay.In Mini Metro, you are the planner of the transportation system of a very abstract city. Stations with specific shapes will pop up all around the city, and characters will pop up in those stations. These characters will wait in the station for a train to pick up them, and the characters's destination matches their own shape. You will be able to lay down the train tracks and, depending on the mode you're playing, you will be able to change them to accomodate a bigger volume of people. If too many people remain in the station, however, the station will overcrowd and a timer will start. If the timer completes, you lose.The best part of this game, though, is the soundtrack. You will not find it anywhere, except on Gameplay videos, as it is generated for all the action that is happening in the level: when characters pop up, when you change the lines layout, etc. The music is composed by the great Disasterpeace, so if you like his music, you'll love Mini Metro's music for sure.

												I have to write a review, since the game finally received an audio update and I couldn't have wished for anything better. It makes the immersion just that much better and completely eliminates any need to put your own background music on. The game is an overall total eye-candy. From the menus, transitions, to the actual game, it's so simple and colourful. Optional features include Night- and Colourblind modes, which are a great addition. There are also fast-forward and pause buttons, so you can get through the early slow start of the game quicker, and pause if you just want to relax or chat with friends, while having the game in the background. The only problem is that it's so addictively fun that you could find yourself neglecting your chat window more often, than the game itself. Developers are also offering a demo version of the first map on their website.Try it out for yourself, it's wonderful!			"

												A fun little game, very challenging and beautiful. I got hooked on it for a couple of weeks, and is definitely worth the money especially since it has been bundled several times.It has a lot of hard achievements. The only problem is that there are still some weird bugs that can crop up that will work against completing them. For instance, I was working on a NYC challenge where I had one line doing a large loop covering the edges of Manhattan, and a smaller loop hitting about six stations  on south Manhattan. As one station started crowding up with passengers who only needed to travel to the next station on the line, I dropped an extra train on the track so that it would quickly pick them up. Instead I watched the empty train blow through the station without stopping. While this may be reminiscent of how some subways operate in real life, it is not how the game is supposed to work. (For the record I only had two other trains on the same loop, and the maximum is four on a single line.) Adding insult to injury, the next train which DID stop only picked up a few passengers and rumbled on about a half-empty. After that it was too late to save the game (over when a station crowds for too long). It ended a mere 200 passengers short of the achievement with no other problem points on a nearly full map. Aargh!!Rating: 8.5/10Excellent gameplay. Needs more bugfixes. "

												Fun little game where you basically have to manage train lines you build yourself, its a straight forward game not really that hard to learn, but also not easy to master if you wanna challenge yourself and go for the achievements tooo on the levels instead of the level objective alone, at the point of writing this review i completed 1 achievement the one from Paris where you have to get 1000 passengers using only 3 lines (took me alot of time but got it finally :D and can say it was worth my time xD), also tried the London one too (alot) but that one is just too hard, but that doesn't mean im not going back for it :D, because i definitely will get THAT ACHIEVEMENT WHATEVER IT TAKES :D!! One day.... :P!But i would definitely recommend this game if you like these types of games where you have to build and manage stuff, this game would be perfect for you if you like that kind of stuff :)! This game is Fun, Time Consuming, has multiple modes (Career and Endless Mode), has good music, The gameplay and overall design of the game is well made and just looks good :)! I would definitely Recommend this game :)!!!8,7/10 Would Rage Quit again because of the Achievements!!!			"

And I'll admit, it can be truly relaxing.If your idea of relaxing is sweating as you try to rearrange the trains so that you can get a bunch of angry squares to their station.Deserves the ""Love/Hate Relationship"" Award. Very fun game.			"

												This game is just great. it may seem like a slow game but once you get started playing you wont want to stop. For example, when i forst bought the game i could not stop playing for about 7 hours. I highly recommend  this game to just about annyone.(just a warning if you only like games with constant non-stop action you may want to think if you would enjoy it, but if you ask me i would say it is great, just a little warning)			"

								Make this game into an app. This game was practically designed for tablet use... it's casual and quick, I usually only get 10 or 15 minutes into a map before my stations overload BUUUUT I'm not a civil engineer. Shapes are hard. As it stands, this game is a go-to for when I'm on duty with no internet and it's super fun to decide between that extra train car, or adding an extra line to the Hub station.			"

												Mini Metro is a subway themed puzzle game. Not a true simulator, although it does have elements of simulation in it.A very simple game that lets you focus entirely on the puzzle without anything you don't need to pay attention to, the goal is to connect the stations and get the people to go to a station that matches their shape in an ever expanding city which just keeps getting bigger and bigger until you can no longer handle the influx of people.There are three basic shapes- The square, triangle and circle, and you begin your game having to ferry passengers who each are one of these three basic shapes to a station with the same shape. Square passengers to square stations, triangles to triangle stations, and circles to circle stations. You then get more stations to connect, you have water you need to tunnel under with limited bridges, and eventually you will get unique station shapes to connect up to your lines.While any triangle station is good enough for a triangle passenger, a plus sign passenger will only go to the plus sign station. This means that you will need to keep your lines connected to each other as well as to the three basic stations, and that you will need to figure out where and when to transfer passengers. Losing a game happens when the waiting line at a station is too long, which will slowly fill in a circle around it to show you how close it is to being a game over.Passenger AI is rather simple, but it doesn't need to be complex either. They go to their nearest matching station, using as few lines as possible. An trains pick up passengers as long as they get them any closer at all, even just a single station.Of note is that when a train goes both ways, passengers will not get in on the one that heads away from their destination, instead waiting for a train that heads the right direction.And once you're done with most of this, there is extreme and endless mode. Endless mode is a game without losing, so you can relax and build your subway system without worrying about losing. Extreme mode is similar to the original game, but where you can move and remove tracks and trains at will normally, they are locked into place in extreme mode.On losing a game you can continue playing in endless mode.In the end, it is a simple but worthwhile game to play. It doesn't have a lot of special mechanics, flashy explosions or incredibly detailed environments, but all it does have works towards the same goal - An enjoyable puzzle game you're sure to get plenty of hours out of.

								""Mini Metro"" is like a cross between ""Eufloria"" and ""Cities in Motion"" (if you can wrap your head around that).  It shares ""Eufloria's"" zen-like ambiance, but primarily tasks you with creating subway lines from one location to another.  The map starts you off small with only a few locations (which also consist of varying shapes), but as time goes by, you'll be bombarded with new locations that you'll need to connect to your existing lines.  Passengers have a specific ""shape"" they'd prefer to travel to, so you'll need to make sure that your lines are running quickly and efficiently.  I highly recommend checking this little gem out, it has a lot of potential!

												I love this game so much I've purchased it on Steam for myself, on Humble for a couple of friends, on Android for my Lenovo Book, and on the Apple Store for my iPad. Oh, I ALSO bought it on GOG (because wallpapers).Simple, bold art style; calming music that's not repetitive or in your face; and gameplay that's easy to learn, difficult to master. Leaderboards for challenges, too.If you love puzzle games... and loving metro/subway art is a plus... this is an easy purchase to make.			"

												Mini Metro is a game that hides well its potential. Behind the extreme minimalism, the simple rules and the apparent laid back first minutes of gameplay, are hidden complex strategies, situations messing up with your brain, maps with characteristics constantly changing your gameplay; all in all, an incredibly addicting experience. Despite some frustration I had by the sheer luck you need sometimes, the minor glitches or the small design flaws that appear from time to time, Mini Metro has been a great game for me these past weeks, whether I want to play it cool or to stress out hectically while aiming for the high scores or the tough achievements. It's not a game for everyone, but don't sell the bear's fur before having killed it. Maybe it's the fact that I loved drawing on pieces of paper possible extensions to the existing Paris Métro when I was young that made me love this game so much? Everything can happen...			"

								Saw this while looking through the sale. It wasn't on sale but it looked like exactly the kind of game I was after.Relatively simple to get to grips with, and pretty fun for such a simple idea. Can get very frustrating when one of your stations is full and there's not a lot you can do.I think a few ideas would be to put the colour of the station they want to go to.. could get confusing I suppose but there could be a way to do it. Because the stations are coded by shape, and some are the same, you never really know where they want to go when it gets busy.I don't notice the lack of sound as I listen to music while I play anyway. Overall a very addictive game, and well worth the £5 I paid, and I'll have fun trying out the other levels.			"

												move passengers to their destination, sounds easy right?this game starts out quite easy with few stations and few passengers but the map constantly keeps adding new stations, always at places you wish it didn't. i can assure you that you will hate circles after playing thisat the end of each week you get a new locomotive and a choice between 2 other things (bigger station, carriage, tunnels) this also sounds quite easy but these choices become hard very soon, because you often find yourself in need of both of the optionswhen you overcrowd a station for too long the ranked game ends, but it gives you an option to continue in a sandbox like setting allowing you to see where you went wrong and try to improve your metronetworkthere are 11 cities all acting differently with the growth and spawns of new stations, even within a city no 2 games are alike. which gives it great replayabilityI do recommend this game, its fun and addicting and sometimes frustrating			"

								Tl;dr: 10/10, highly addicting, buy it (Also, I now have an irrational hate of simple geometric shapes).Bought this game thinking that it would be a really simple, relaxing, time-killing game; and at first it was. Then, after losing a couple times I got into this ""ok, wait, one more time, I can beat my previous score. Then I found myself looking up actual subway/metro line maps for some ideas; and the better I got, the more I wanted to beat my previous high-score.The only thing that would make this game better (in my opinon) would be music/sound-effects (already being worked on) and some kind of steam achievements.

								Review made 27/10/2014 - Beta 8 VersionMiniMetro is the kind of Early Access game that needs to be placed in the spotlight, leaving the rough, jagged and unfinished games behind. With many early access games I can play it for hours and begin finding errors, or getting ideas of how the game could be made better. And why not? It's Early Access! That's the name of the game, right?Then I played MiniMetro, and I expected bugs, crashes and a dire need for polishing. And, aside from the lack of audio, I found... Well, a brilliant game. There's already plenty of maps, with more to come, and the simplistic nature of the game itself is polished to perfection.This game places you in control of an entire cities' Metro network, ferrying civilians from Stop A to Stop B, as indicated by various shapes. So, for example, there could be multiple people at a stop wanting to get to a Square stop. They will get on the line that has that stop available. As time progresses more stops appear randomly around the map, each with different shapes. As stations demand more stops, you'll quickly ecounter the enemy of the game: over-crowding, which you'll quickly learn is as big and scary a final boss as any other game you'll come across. All you have to do is 'survive' the week to unlock more trains, bridges or routes to be able to satisfy the need of every customer. Once you lose, and you will, your high-score is how many passengers you managed to take from A to B, and the days your service was up and running. It's a very simple and fitting scoring system that leaves you with a burning desire to play again just to beat those numbers.As time goes by you will learn to love or hate certain shapes, with particularly rare shapes getting high demand, but being in a particularly hard to reach location. I have come out of many playthroughs wishing circles were never invented, and that Triangles are satan-spawn.The pacing is fast and challenging, the only reprieve you can find being in the Pause button. The art style is minimalist and simplistic, obviously reminiscent of an Underground map. The replayability is seemingly endless, with stations appearing at random locations each time, alongside various different maps each with their own individual high-scores.I love this game, it's worth every penny, and it should be considered a complete game with incoming updates as far as I'm concerned. While it's still in Early Access though, I will suggest one thing that would be nice but is not entirely necessary: Stats for each station/line to see how many passengers are travelling on each, allowing you to micro-manage everything much more meticulously.10/10			"

												Duration - 4 hoursUnlocked and played all cities. Obtained all ""basic"" achievements. 16/32 Mini Metro is a fine little game where you place tracks and eventually get overrun by commuters.  The game uses a score system, so there is no ""solution"" which is why I avoid calling it a puzzle game.  Also, the set-up and progression is different so there is no ""optimal"" solution to work toward like in SpaceChem.  Overall, it was a fine expenditure of relaxed time, with most cities taking 5-6 minutes to play.			"

								A decievingly simple puzzle game. This game puts you in charge of connecting railway lines to circles, triangles, squares etc and your job is to make sure none of those stations get over crowded which seems simple enough and after the first 5 or so minutes of play you will believe that this game is easy but soon you will realise that it is not all that easy as more stations are made and passengers are made faster making you think constantly of a better way of handling the situation at hand. Will you make annother line to take the load of annother? Will you add more trains to make one line more effective? Will you add more carriages to your trains so they can carry more? Will you add more tunnels so you can get to those areas on the otherside of the lakes? You will have to make all these decisions in this game.-Gameplay-The gameplay is very simple, you draw lines to shapes and deliver shapes to other shapes. You have to make sure no stations become over crowded or you lose the game. The score is determined by how many 'peeps' you have delivered. You will get a train and a choice between 2 upgrades at the end of the week, currently there are (2 Tunnels, a carriage or a new line) these get randomised each week and you have the choice between 2.-Conclusion-Overall the game has a great concept and is executed very well with only a few missing features. Music is a main thing currently not in at the time of this review but of course this will be implemented in the future. I give this game a 9/10 for being unique, fun, exciting and overall intense as you make those quick second decisions. I can see this game going a long way with the 'Wishfull' features that may be implemented such as 'Multiplayer' 'Scenerario Editor' and more. If you are looking for a game you can sit down and play for 20 minutes then this is definately it. I Highly recommend checking this game out especially for the low price it is at. Video:

												It is the end of the school year and, as a school teacher, I ampretty much left with nothing to do while waiting for summer break. So, there is this day when I am done with clearing my seat (we were renovating our office) and was sitting with my Macbook Air (MBA in short) looking for something to play. My steam would not download any games in school as the school has blocked all gaming sites (IP I presume), even for staff, and I am too lazy to set up a VPN. My MBA could not handle anything that is too graphical (if you know what I mean), so I went and start Mini Metro. The game is minimalistic, easy to understand, and fun. It is simply connection lines, shapes and moving rectangles that are presumably train carts. There is nothing intriguing about it, yet it is simplistically attractive, bite size (a game last around 3 to 5 minutes) and an extremely effective remedy for symptoms arised from office boredom, such as yawning and drowsiness. After a couple of rounds, my boss, the department head, walked pass. She looked at my monitor, and asked, ""are you playing a game?""It took me around two seconds to give her an appropriate. ""Nope. I'm working on a set of powerpoint slides for my class."" ""Oh, okay."" She walked away after that.Well, that worked well, except that I no longer have any classes after that. Still, great game for these kind of situations. "

								As of Beta 2:Pretty good puzzle game. Very minimalistic, very slick and very challenging. Only one mechanic, but a really polished one.Just connect the stations in an optimal way to deliver the passengers all over the city. But don't think that it's gonna end there - stations tend to change quite frequently, so you'll have to adapt to those changes.Still, game needs some love on some (pretty minor) UI parts. Additional game modes wouldn't hurt. Plus, more ways to vary gameplay would be good as well.More details in the video:

 Mini Metro	 is minimalist puzzle game themed around mass transportation. The goal is to pick up and deliver passengers by connecting stations to your system with a limited number of resources based on trains and lines. With a design that is both sleek and intuitive, the game requires little in terms of explanation for a new player. It's so easy to pick up that it comes as a shock when the game suddenly crushes your pathetic metro system under the weight of cruel reality. Pros	 Clean, minimalist design that ties into the transportation theme Puzzles are easy to understand but ramp up in difficulty Randomized station generation offers replayability Advanced strategies are not instantly apparent and require some experimentation for those looking for a challenge Mellow ambient music lowers your rage as passengers overload your metro system Cons	 Crushes your dreams of being a transportation engineer Randomized station generation means some thematic elements are lost; ie. you won't be building the exact replica of the London Tube Maps are devoid of placenames to connect you to the actual cities featured in the game The game always ends with you losing; only solace is how far up the leaderboard you can goThe negative points about randomized station generation and lack of thematic depth should be taken with the caveat that these were obviously purposeful choices, made to elevate the minimalist design. I personally found the game very enjoyable and would recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting take on transportation games.			"

								This game is great for how simple the concept is. When I first saw this game I though that just drawing lines would not be fun at all. Now, I Mini Metro is one of the cheapest, yet best games I have bought on steam. For just $6 this game is  really well made. I think for the basic concept of making a underground system this game can bring you hours of playing. Time will fly when you play this game. It is also very simple to learn. You literally just move your mouse and draw lines and sit and relax. In Mini Metro you have a limited amount of lines, trains, and underwater tunnels. You can play for a minute or for two hours. If you have been to any city or place this game features you may have some familliarity to the map. I think it is a great value for such a cheap game.

It’s not a huge game where you’ll spend hundreds of hours but a nice little game that you play when you have free half an hour and just want to spend it relaxed playing a simple game. Controls are easy to understand (you only need to point and click with a mouse).10€ might be a little too much but if it is on sale and you want it – just buy it! "

I bought it in a recent Humble Bundle for it specifically and after a few hours I'm comfortable giving it a thumbs up, despite the criticisms that I am now about to lay out.My first caution is that, while the game is well designed and enjoyable, its content is a little thin for the sticker price of $10. There are 12 cities, and while there are some unique quirks between them, the only other practical difference is where the rivers are located. Most end up playing pretty close to the same way. It will still take you a while to invent and explore all the possible strategies for building your metro, but after about 10 hours I found my interest waning as there wasn't much else to spice things up. The three game modes help in this regard.That said, what content is there makes for quite a challenge. It's a perfect example of a game that gives you a small set of tools that can be combined to make incredibly complex systems.I also see some room for improvement with the UI. I like the game's minimalist graphics, but the interface takes this a shade too far. There were a few things that bothered me:1. Trains/carriages are a bit hard to see, being the same color and only slightly larger than the tracks, and often obscured by other objects. It's very difficult to see where everything is at a glance. Something to help them stand out, like a black outline, would be a big help.2. The stations have the opposite problem. They stand out well, but they're all the same color, differentiated only by shape. It's easy to lose track of where specific stations are since many look alike.3. Some more feedback in the UI would be nice (at least in sandbox mode, if it would make things too easy on normal/expert). Perhaps some summarized info about each line, like number of passengers waiting, number of trains/carriages active, average wait time. There's a stats page that has some of this info, but it's on a separate screen several clicks away.4. Speaking of the stats page, the minimalist design doesn't work so well there. Having to mouse over each data point to see numbers does not for easy reading make.In conclusion, Mini Metro is a simple but deep game that plays pretty much as advertised. Perhaps a bit lacking in content for full price, but still a solid pick for anyone who likes puzzle/strategy type sims.Edit: The more I play this game, the more I crave more features. I love the challenge but it's actually kind of frustrating how many times I think ""gosh it would be nice if I could do X to make my metro more efficient"", but alas, X is beyond the scope of gameplay. This really is perfect as a casual, pick-up-and-play mobile game, but if you're used to more in-depth sim type games, proceed with caution.			"

												I've been playing this off and on since the first free online version. It's so simple to learn and impossible to master. At a certain point it become a beautiful musical zen toy. The Daily Challenge and Extreme Mode unlocks are a nice touch to keep me coming back.It seems like the different cities tweak numbers under the hood, but they don't feel that different to me. My only real complaint is that I wish there was a speed option to go even faster than fast. If you're on the fence, go play the free version and if you like that you'll love this.			"

												Greetings fellow gamers! This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of an intriguing little puzzler, Mini Metro.

The ""Too Long, Didn't Watch"" Review:Fantastic little puzzler. The art-style and music are enchanting. Easy to play, hard to master. Addicting 4/5The ""Meat & Potatoes"" Review:I wasn't quite sure what to expect with this little thing. A transportation puzzler. Open and run lines to maximize efficiency. Seems simple enough, right? Especially since this isn't crazy detail, it's just lines and shapes. You get rolling, and there's this catchy, soothing music that gets going along with your lines and station placement....next thing you know, you just can't stop! You've got lines going everywhere, you're hoping to level up then dreading the decision of which perk you want (More Tunnels or a Carriage? Another Line or an extra Locomotive?). It can get rather intense on you pretty quickly. There are different levels of difficulty, daily challenges, high scores, scenario unlocks, etc. There is a ton of replayability. The visuals and the music are pleasant, enchanting and beautiful. Very nice touch for a little puzzler, really. I also genuinely thought I would take issue with the $10 price point, but cannot see a problem with that. now It is worth $10. I keep going back. It is nearly impossible to play just one attempt. 4/5 stars for this one, gamers. It's so much fun, once you try it you will get hooked!  Happy Gaming!!!			"

			Mini Metro Is a Subway Simulation Time Management Strategy Game. Available Here: Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/287980/ HomePage: http://dinopoloclub.com/minimetro/ Join us at Twitter or...		

     Mini Metro is a line based simulation strategy/ time based subway system. The art style is simplistic, and the gameplay is basic. You are in charge of a city subway system, and are responsible for transporting people from one station to another. You lose the game if you let the stations get overcrowded. The game is time management based, with new upgrades available every week when you successfully complete a week as a reward. There are a multitude of different levels and content, and each map of mission has its own leader-board, which can add to the competitive feeling as you play.      There are daily challenges, which is appreciated, but there is no expected level of completion, such as 500 people transported. This I feel takes away from any incentive a player might have towards these goals. The leader-boards for these challenges show the top 10 people, but don't give motivation or incentive for what you have accomplished on a personal level as games are meant to be personal.     Another aspect that may only appeal to certain players is that the game states directly that you cannot win. There is no end game. The game keeps growing, with new stations, complications, and population, to the point that you will not be able to keep up. You will not be able to grow your subway empire, simply manage the time you have to the best of your capability. If you enjoy time management games, this might be for you; the game is very basic- a simplistic casual game for those who find casual games too demanding.     The game mechanically give you exactly what it promises. For the current asking price of $10 dollars, I cannot recommend it, but if it were on sale, and this type of game appeals to you, then go for it. This is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watchif you are looking for a more in-depth review.Thanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here. http://www.youtube.com/c/SocioPsycho "

												I have less than two hours of gameplay in this and I've already seen everything there is to do.  I wasn't expecting too much, but was still disappointed by the lack of gameplay ;  you will be spending much more time looking at the game than interacting with it.  At a certain point it turns very suddenly from a laid back and easy game to an overwhelming and impossible race against the passengers, which may have been an intentional mechanic by the developer to end the game before the player notices that there's nothing more to do.  Unfortunately the endless play mode ruins this concept and makes it very obvious that there isn't much left to see. This game is very beautifully designed and has a relaxing soundtrack so it would have been a good purchase at a fraction of its price, but for $10 I was really expecting much more than I got.While this game looks appealing, don't buy it if you're expecting any more than an hour of entertainment.  If you're going to get it, wait for a sale and you'll get a better deal.			"

								This game is AMAZING! The graphics look excellent, it is challenging, fun, addictive and more. You get a map of a city with a few stations you work out where you want the lines to go, you get three lines to begin with and three locomotives. If you make it through to the next week (Sunday) you get to choose if you want to get a new line, tunnel or carriage as well as a locomotive which can be used on any current line or saved for a new line that you choose to build.This game is very impressive and it is still being developed, I am excited to see what the final result is as I already think this game fully deserves a 10/10 rating. It is well worth the £4.99 I spent on the game.			"

												Mini Metro is one of those hidden gems that was destined to be hidden.The graphics are clear, crisp. The colours are used precisely and in a thought out manner. It's well animated too. The fluididty is perfect for this type of game.As for the gameplay: The premise is simple. You have shapes dotted around the map. Those are stations. Each station will have passengers pop up, all wanting to go to a different shape station. The goal is to get them there quickly and efficently without the stations filling up.Difficulty's added by the limited amount of trains and lines, adding new shapes and stations and also having to sometimes go through water with a limited amount of tunnels.It's difficult, I'll say that much. I completed ""Deliver xxx amount of passengers"" achievements, but I never managed to complete the more difficult achievements. So, if you like becoming efficent in a single game, then this is perfect for you.One gripe though: Everything's slightly randomized. Because of that, some runs are doomed from the start. Like for example I had to instantly spend a tunnel because the station was slightly touching the water. You can't really move the tracks, so that couldn't be done either. Overall:7/10(All games start at a neutral 5/10 and move up and down based on their pros and cons)			"

								In Mini Metro your goal is to keep small towns or districs from becoming too crowded in a major city. Seems simple and easy, right? Well it is surprisingly difficult. You envelope quite a bit of time into each playthrough to devolpe a efficient transportation system. Whenever you achieve a smooth system, you get a great feeling of satisfaction. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategic games or is just looking for a game to kill a few hours. 12/10  Superb.			"

												A truly wonderful game. Can be enjoyed casually (just link up your network at random) but there really are more effective strategies. Each city has a unique feel because the random features (station positions and type) may be tweaked to give different proportions of station types and proportions of stations of different types on different land masses. Also, some cities have unique features like the Osaka shinkansen (fast trains) or slightly different weekly choices.There are basic achievements for each city, which lets you work out the basic mechanics of the game. Then there are more demanding achievements, with extra restrictions like only having tunnels on one line, and a much more demanding passenger target. These require a more efficient network since your network will start to crack under the strain well before you reach the passenger target. If the earlier incarnations of your network (when you have most opportunity for radical changes since there are not so many passengers) weren't efficient enough, then you likely won't make it (although you might if you're very lucky!).

								Metro leaves you in control of stations in the area you have chosen, passengers will arrive at a station and show a little icon as to where they would like to go, your job is to create train runs to different stations, trying to connect as many passengers to the stations they would like to go to, but also as quickly as possible.   Each week you are given an option of an upgrade, for example you could choose an extra line, or an extra carriage.  If passengers are left too long without being picked up by a train, the game ends. I have played this a couple of times and I really like it.  I look forward to music being added, but i'm not too fussed right now as I know its early access and will be added later on.  This is a fun little game and I can probably see this being released on tablets in the near future (maybe).30/03/2015 -  I've continued to play this game, dipping in and out every now and then.  The updates have continued to improve the game and I still enjoy it now as much as I originally did.  Keep up the great work.  I can see this working well on tablets too. (Unless it already is and i've missed that).			"

								This game is qutie a lot of fun, and it's different game modes make it even more versatile. It's new and is being updated with new features, but the updates are coming with surprising frequency and there are still many planned features that they are currently working on. I bought it not on sale and I dod not regret it.Regular mode is fun and frantic and is even more fun with a friend watching and giving recommendations (being that friend is also fun). The most part is when you realize how out of hand everything is and make emergency modifications so you can stay in for just a bit longer.Zen mode is great if you're burned out from a day of work and just need to sit back and do something simple. It still requires some thought but lacks the franticness of normal mode.This is a good game to play at almost any time you feel like playing a game, and it's my fallback for when I don't feel like playing anything. Highly recommended.			"

								*EARLY ACCESS REVIEW*This is a really fun game.  If you enjoy looking at subway maps and playing an engaging puzzle game - then this game could be for you.  The gameplay is simplistic yet challenging.  As time progresses, subway stations appear ""randomly"" and you are tasked with connecting the stations to one another by drawing subway lines in any way you see fit.  Different stations consist of different shapes you'd typically see on a subway map (i.e. dots, squares, stars, etc.).  there are a limited number of trains, carriages, and tunnels at your disposal and every game turn (one week) you get to choose what you would like to buy.  Sometimes, it pays to buy an additional subway line to start a new line with or sometimes it pays to buy an extra carriage if there are a lot of passengers at your existing lines.  And always keep track of those river crossings with tunnels - make them count as you can only do so many of them each game (unless of course you buy more each game turn).  What keeps the game fun, fresh, and engaging for me is the ability to change subway lines as additional stations randomly appear - you are not stuck with what you originally drew.  You have the flexibility to continue to change and evolve your strategy and layout of your subway grid as time goes on and passengers appear in greater numbers.  This mechanic is what keeps the puzzle game aspect engaging - rather than just an exercise of draw some subway lines and sit back and watch the map come to life (which can be fun too!) Since the game is early access, they currently have London, Paris, and New York City to start with but there are additional cities (such as Sao Paulo and St Petersburg) that are greyed out but should be playable soon.  Also, sound is currently disabled and there are other game modes not enabled but this is something to look forward to has development continues.			"

Early Access Review
								(TL;DR @ bottom)I've been playing the alpha versions of this program for a few months now. It's a very relaxed puzzle game, in which you link lines from different types of stations in order to allow passengers to reach their desired type of destination. As the game goes on the map slowly expands and adds/changes stations to force you to keep expanding/upgrading. I recommend just ignoring the score and let yourself just focus on trying to find the best way to flow the traffic for as long as possible. Mini Metro is great for when you just want to relax; personally it’s good for recovering from rage-inducing moments other games cause.Pros: -Simple, Zen-like game-Minimalist graphics that are spot on for the theme.-Easy to learn, plenty of ways to try and experiment with the growing map to keep going.Cons:  (Since the game is beta, these will likely change in time)-No tutorial yet, so most the ways you can interact with the board have to be figured out on your own.  -No sound effects/music. The music is simple to solve, but other audio effects would be nice.-If you’re still reading, 15 points to Gryffindor. (Bloody gits)My tip for figuring out the controls: Experiment of course. You can click-drag about anything (stations, ends of lines, mid-lines) you don't like, It'll Highlight/grey out if you can/cannot do something respectively. Currently, the lack of audio is a downer, but the minimalist art style (and Zen theme) go well with a bit of Jazz. Just start GrooveShark.com (or Pandora, etc.), theme search for jazz and hit play; I'm good for an hour.TL;DR = Very relaxing puzzle game. Art-style can draw you in. Simple to play, enough challenge to keep it interesting with little stress. You’ll have to provide your own music (I recommend Jazz).			"

												This game could use a bit more explanation in the tutorial -- once I had finished it, I still had no idea how to move train tracks without deleting the entire line, and several other features also went unexplained. (Did you know that you can press the space bar to pause the game and still move lines around? Speaking of a game changer!) Fortunately the Steam community has created some great guides that provided me with all the information that I was missing. Once I understood the game, it proved to be a lovely minimalistic puzzler that has you trying different things to find the most optimal routes and keep the game running. It is quite challenging, but without getting too frustrating. If a run isn't working out so well for you, well, there's always the next one!Very cool game idea that was well executed.			"

												Worths it at > -50% or get it from bundles. It is good but the fun exhausts fast.Pros- Elegant design- Language options and translations are good. Appreciated that there is Chinese (Hong Kong) for selection. They do realise all those who live with metro in their cities will play this game!- I can't even notice the map is zooming out! This is some kind of magic I appreciate.- Attention to real life details. Being a Hong-Konger, this game surprised me with all the colors of lines taken from real life railways we have here, they even put the colors of the major lines first.Cons- Lack of instructions and descriptions for some choices- Stations randomly pops up at locations unreachable e.g. requires bridge, highly relys on luck esp. in early games- Kind of frustrating when you fail: there is almost nothing you can do to save a station from overcrowd- Reconstructing lines could make you fail almost immediately if you don't have spare cars to handle the rush of passengers right after re-drawing the lines- not much difference in strategy for different maps- music is annoying in late games			"

								Mini Metro is very minimalistic in design and the mechanics can be easily grasped after a few plays. I like the colour scheme and the simple shapes. Pity there isn't any relaxing music and sound effects so far, it'll definitely make the game experience a lot more engaging, like, say, a beeping sound when a station gets too crowded. The game can be quite repetitive, but as someone who likes playing task-oriented games, it's perfect for me. I think introducing trophies would be a good idea to create a sense of achievement, and also introduces a challenge for players.			"

												Mini Metro is a realy simple but fun game to play. In the game you have certain 'points' on the map, that can look like a circle, square, triangle etc. Those 'points' represent metro stations. From time to time smaller icons like a circle, square, triangle etc. appear next to these metro stations. Those smaller icons respresent a traveler who would like to go to another metro station. For example, a smaller triangle on a circle metro station, would like to take the metro to a traingle metro station. If the traveler steps in, it will not go out until it reaches a triangle station. But it will step over on a different line if it can reach such a station faster. When you start you will just have a few metro stations, and a few lines. Every week you get more lines / locomotives / carrages or tunnels. Somethimes you will get a choice if you want for example a new line, or a new locomotive. You also have different maps to play, that are named like cities, like London, Paris, Hong Kong. Also in the game you only use the left mouse buttons, that is everything. I would say a great game if you would like a simple strategy game, but you also start a new map very soon. Becasue you get 'game over' eventualy.			"

								Mini Metro. Simplicity at its finest.The idea is simple: get passengers from station to station by building railways.The UI is simple: Click and drag to draw railways through stations.The rules are simple: No more than four trains on one track, and if any station gets overcrowded you lose.From these simple principles emerges chaos. Sheer, utter, beautiful chaos - fueled by the ever increasing number of stations you have to cater for, and driven by hasty changes to your Metro to try and provide routes for passengers to take in order to get to their destination ASAP.And yet, despite how chaotic things get, you can still employ strategy and make reasoned decisions at every turn. At the start of a new game you might choose to stick to one design philosophy or another, leading to experimentation to see which is the most effective.This, coupled with the randomly generated stations, makes the game very replayable and, if you appreciate the slow pacing, very fun.Despite this, that's all there is to it, really. After 2 or 3 hours of play you've pretty much seen it all. I imagine, after a few more hours of play, I'll probably get a little bored. In my mind, it's something I'd return to whilst waiting to do something else - in a role similar to Super Hexagon.Highly recommended if you're looking for a fun little game to play whilst rendering a video or waiting to do something else.

												Great little game. Very simple concept, but with the little variations and the random placement of stations every game feels slightly different.But the randomness also means that some games are easier than others. Another criticism is that the game isn't bug-free and seems unfinished. E.g. there are some achievements for maps that are not in the game. What's worse is that the tunnel counter is buggy and I have seen trains drop cargo in weird places, although this is very rare.If you like optimization, this is a good game to get.			"

								I didn't know it was possible for a game to be relaxing and stressful at the same time, but this game seems to accomplish that (although you can easily take out the stress element by playing on endless mode, if that's your thing). Thanks to this, I now understand why subway maps are so convoluted.In short, this game is a combination of some of the best core elements in all train-management-style games in a beautiful, minimalistic style. Seriously, the animations and visual design of this are just AMAZING. Well done. Although I'm hoping audio gets added soon, because the sounds in the trailer made the game seem even better.Highly reccommended to anyone who likes any sort of strategy or planning game, or just needs some way to relax.

												Mini Metro is very fun addictive little game that focuses purely on designing efficient routes to bring passengers that come as shapes to different stations. The visuals, audio and game play is very minimalist but definitely in a positive way. Various challenges (the achievements) keep you motivated to play the game for about 10 hours top I would say. Unfortunately the game lacks any kind of depth that could have been easily added (E.G by adding weird bonus maps with lots of water, or a mode where certain shapes could only take certain trains). With that in mind, I DON'T think the game is worth the €10,00 that it's currently sold for due it's lack of variety in game play. Worth picking up when < 5€			"

								This game is absolutely fantastic. Its minimalism is a testament to how far a game can go with just a few very nuanced mechanics. This elegance is carried through into the visual design, everything is so crisp and bright. With just a few deep mechanics and such great ux/ui design Mini Metro is the very epitome of ""easy to learn, hard to master."" I recommend this to anyone, for the price. Even if you don't get hooked completely, you'll still get several hours of enjoyment out of even just the first map. Oh did I mention it has leaderboards? Find out which one of your friends is the undisputed Marquis of Metro!			"

												Mini Metro is a very simple game, but that is one of its strengths, but for gameplay and as a stylistic choice. Anyone who's ever been fascinated by maps, and specifically transit systems, will love this game. It may seem like a niche interest but working towards making an efficient metro system can actually be highly addictive. The game is easy to start playing but hard to master, which is perfect when the ultimate goal is the just the tried and true persuit of a high score.Mini Metro offers a wide range of cities, some of which must be unlocked by scoring at a certain level on previous cities. Despite aiming for simplicty, there are a number of creative ways cities are differentiated, such as station type spawn patterns and different asset constraints.If the game were just this it would probably have limited longevity, but where it really shines for some is in the daily challenge. Once per day there's a random seed generated on a given map that everyone gets *one* shot at, and then placed on a leaderboard. This is great for those who are competitive but also don't want the hassel of setting up something more complicated or can't invest much time most days. Also great for just casual challenges in a circle of friends.Overall Mini Metro is a simple game with a set purpose, but nails that purpose right on the nose. If this game seems like your thing I'd recomend checking it out. If you're on the fence it still might be worth checking out when it goes on sale.			"

												Well it`s pretty a challenging game. Being small, though, Mini Metro features several maps like HK or London which require you to linking subway stations and deliver passengers, and each map has its own characteristics, like on normal mode in Hong Kong you will be awarded 2 locomotives weekly but the passengers grow extensively, or in Osaka you will have to choose only one Shinkansen locomotive (it runs extremely fast) or two regular conterparts (which gives you more flexibility to manage your routes). It`s easy to pick up, with no need of delibrate train to get started. But if you wanna score higher than other players you have to stick to one map for days or weeks to figure out what its mechanism really is. A good news is that it`s easily accessible for mainland Chinese players as it`s completely affordable and  it features simplified Chinese :) . It`s a good stuff to take a leisure time if you don`t like FPS`s aggressive gameplay.			"

There are many maps to choose from in which you will have to score a certain amount of points to unlock the next map (level). They become harder and harder to build your rail the longer you last. There are many different game play modes which makes the game a easy chilling or a hard thinking strategy game. I would recommend this game  "

												Mini Metro is a simple little and mildly addictive puzzle game. You can play it quickly - 20 - 30 minutes will usually be enough to play.  It is a game where you have to link different cargo supplying spots and manage the trains linking them.  You are building an Underground network trying to survive the hectics of a modern metropolis. All games you start end the same: after an increasing amount of cargo you cannot move on time, one of your stations will be overfull and the game ends.The maps are simple and reflect the colours of tube maps of the different cities you can play. I like the layout of the maps. The sounds are suttle and pleasing. Different deliveries make different little sounds, and is relaxing.If you are looking for a train simulation game, this is not it.If you are looking for a simple game where you have to create and recreate a system to optimally move different forms around (stars, blocks, rounds etc) - and look for optimal efficiency with the knowlegde that in the end you will never reach a status quo - it is nice enough.

								I ran into this at PAX and was smitten immediately. It is so hectic and yet Zen and peaceful. Like many of my favorite games, it's more about what's happening in your head than what's on the screen.This is a traffic routing game where you draw subway lines to take little shape people to the matching station shape. People appear in real time, but you can pause and redraw your map at any time. You use little rectangular trains, a few colors, a few bridges to cross rivers.The art is straight out of the classic London Underground map. But you get to make the map, in a stylized but real world city with its geography (eg London, Paris, Berlin, New York).As you deliver more passengers, you meet the challenges of growth. New stations crop up in outlying areas, forcing you to take apart the ingenious system that worked so well before and think again. New shapes of passenger and station appear, making it impossible to service all shapes with any one line. But they will transfer along the shortest route, which means you want your trains to meet at some stations. Mix in a long haul train line? Maybe you want to add a passenger car to accommodate all the people that build up as it makes its slow way.The stations and demand are randomly placed every time. The gameplay is the same every time, but the random map constantly challenges your understanding of these systems.I'm having a great time with it.			"

												I saw this game on the summer flash sale, and it looked interesting, so I scooped it up. Boy am I glad I did! This is a fantasic, little, indie, strategy game where you are managing a subway station. Your job is to lay down subway lines to connect the different stations and get the different shapes (people) to their desired destinations. It starts off slow and progressivley keeps adding more and more, so you really have to think about where to place the lanes to be the most efficient. It's super easy to learn, but will take some time to master, and it's absurdly addicting. This is an early access game but complely 100% playable. There is no music/audio yet, but that will come out soon. They use a very minimalistic art syle, which adds to it's clean look and makes it easy to understand, however, a few things might need to be clarified. Hopefully they will add a small description for the different items you have to choose from between weeks. There are a few I'm not completly understanding what they do or how they work. The beginning tutorial is very simple, although they do not show you how to move tracks or divert them. I kinda found that out by accident, so hopefully they will expand on a few of these things.I also hope they make it possible to save some of your games/city tracks you have made in a future update.Overall this is an awesome little game, that is well executed, and 100% worth the full asking price. 10/10			"

Welcome to Mini Metro, very ordinary looking (and I didn't buy this for a long time because of how it looked, seriously) but if I had to describe Mini Metro in 2 words I would say Deceptively Simple. with all the emphasis on deceptive.""I got this"" you think to yourself as you link the triangle station with the square station and onwards to the circle station. Out of nowhere comes a diamond station and everybody wants to go there. So you throw down another line all smug-like and watch the numbers building.EZPZ!! 200, 300, 400, 500... Oh. What? I have no bridges? I''ll go around. 550... Wait. What? Why is that station overcrowding? Aha.. I'll just add a carriage. No?? A train then? Errr. Nope. Reroute, reorganise... Ahh that's better.... AHA, a new station. I'll just link that with the blue line. Oh oh. Can't cross... Oh. What do I do?? Aggghh!! Game over. You managed to shift 578 people in 48 days. Dammit.

												I absolutely love Mini Metro! I've played it since before it was even on Steam. Anyways, the one thing I have always been wishing to see in every update was a Los Angeles map. LA has an every expanding system, with more than 100 miles of Light Rail and Heavy Rail transit. I can also confidently say that if Los Angeles were added to the game, a lot of people I personally know, as well as so many more people would become interested in buying Mini Metro for that reason. I mean, have you seen all the fictional Los Angeles transportation maps countless people have made over the decades? Well, if you haven't, believe me when I say that the ones on Google Images are only the tip of the iceburg. I really do feel Los Angeles is worthy of a spot in Mini Metro for these reasons, and I really do hope adding the city is seriously considered, because countless people would seriously love to see that happen. Thank you for your consideration!			"

												It's a thematic puzzle game with minimalist visuals and simple mechanics!The theme? Misery.You see, if you play Mini Metro only aiming to reach the minimum goal for each city then it's okay enough. Fairly short but the challenge is reasonable. Overall, it's passable.The problem lies in trying to push the game any further.Mini Metro relies mainly on RNG to keep itself fresh. Map layout for each city is always the same but starting points, station placement and resource availability are randomised. Being a puzzle game, that would require very careful balance so the player has sufficient tools to keep stations from overcrowding (the game's fail state) at least most of the time.Unfortunately, that's not the case here. Games start fairly slow with a steady increase in activity for a short while, before cranking the difficulty up to eleven absurdly fast with stations popping up far away on the edges of the map, population increasing like nasty cancerous cells and don't even get me started on those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ same-type station clusters always forming WITHOUT FAIL.Resources to deal with all the junk being thrown at once? You only get to pick one at the end of each week and the selection is limited and also randomised, which is clearly one of the biggest flaws here, since there's no reason to lock the player out of vital options in a puzzle game, especially when urgency becomes a constant after just a few minutes and they might desperately need those bridges to save an urban planning career from an early catastrophe but WHO CARES IT'S JUST WATER HERE HAVE ANOTHER LINE.For three weeks straight.You could try exploiting the fact that you can change the routes and replace the trains as much as you want (it's not a simulator in the slightest, after all) but, really, having to do that every 3 seconds to prolong the inevitable for maybe another week at best just makes the whole thing a chore to play and you'll end up looking even more pathetically desperate.Unless this game gets some much-needed rebalancing, it's not really worth it. Until then, for anyone looking for a challenging and fair puzzle game, Mini Metro is most definitely going to look like one big RNG train wreck.Yes. I'm so clever.			"

												There is a hell and it is circular. ---You will enjoy this game. I enjoyed this game. It is deceptively simple and allows you to cultivate your own preferred playstyle in the absence of any substantive tutorial and with an overly compliant difficulty curve geared towards early success. As someone looking to recline and take in some enjoyment, Mini Metro is sleek and superb - accept the invite and try it, and there's a number of solid hours of glee as individual levels are 'beaten:' with the player ultimately losing, or retiring, with enough points cached to earn an achievement. Mini Metro then politely deadlocks the door and insists that if you want to reach the high scores, to obtain the achievements which are (in this context) the only real signifiers of completion, you'll have to put up with obnoxious RNG and unfavourable spawns. You will  require  some kind of bizarre foresight to overcome the random placement of the map's stations: four of one kind a row, with the game neglecting to provide you in the weekly update (in-game-time) with the upgrade you require (a tunnel, line, carriage, or whatever it may be given the precise circumstance), and Mini Metro quickly becomes an unpolished turd. The fact that the most exclusive achievements are possessed by a fraction of a percent of the playerbase in the port of a phone game should be evidence enough. Mini Metro is fun, but more of a joyous minimalist idea than a polished, concise video game experience:  there is no win state except that which is self-imposed, and if your self-imposition relies even remotely on Steam achievements, then your win state is a monumentous gamble away. I'd have recommended this game for the first 6-8 hours I played it. Now I'm triggered, several attempts at one of the level's achievements later, and I no longer think it is worth the time: other reviewers have praised this game's reward structure, but I think it undeserving. ~			"

												Such a simple concept, and yet so much fun!  The graphics are absolute basic, almost comical, but that does not take away from the gameplay.  The interface is very intuitive, and I found myself playing immediately without even bothering to look up anything about how to play.  This game is relaxing, yet challenging.  You'll soon be trapped by the ""next time I'll do it so much better"" feeling, and before you know it you've been playing for an hour...Your goal is to connect the metro stations together.  New stations pop up at random on the map, and you decide whether to extend an existing train line to service that new station or to create a new line.  You can add extra trains, extra cars, and even extra-fast trains to your lines as the game progresses.  Use your tunnels and bridges sparingly, because you only have so many to work with.  Also, the total number of train lines, engines, and carriage cars are also limited, but you can choose which items you want more of at the end of each simulated week in the game.  When people have to wait too long at a station to catch a train, the game is over.  Simple, right?  Ha!  If only...After you've played a few rounds you begin to think like a traffic engineer.  How can I best eliminate this bottle-neck?  Should I add another line to short-cut between these two large hubs?  Or maybe just add another train to the line?  What about making a loop?  You find yourself trying all sorts of different ideas, and cursing yourself when a new station pops up across the river and you don't have any bridges or tunnels left because you foolishly squandered them early on to make an inner-city loop!Mini Metro has a calm, relaxed atmosphere, and it reminds me a bit of the original Railroad Tycoon, but in this game there is no real economy.  There's nothing to buy, and the supply of track is unlimited.  Your only real adversary is time.  You need to keep the people moving, and the trains only go so fast...  An average game lasts about 10 minutes.Tons of fun, especialy for such a simple concept.  If you liked Sim City or Railroad Tycoon, chances are good that you'll love this game.  And at only 10 bucks, it's pretty cheap too.			"

												A fun if somewhat frustrating game, I've done a couple of the maps so far and look forward to checking out the others and progressing in my ability to play the game as I go on.It appears to be quite simple but actually gets quite difficult as you constantly redraw routes and balance your trains and cabs available on each line to prevent a big queue at the stations.

Early Access Review
								This game is ridiculously addictive.  It's a pretty simple concept.  You're creating a subway to get passangers of various shapes to their correspondingly shaped stops.  You have various train lines and a certain number of tunnels you can construct.  At the end of each week you get an additional train and one of a few options (extra carriage, extra line, extra tunnels). The actual gameplay is hypnotic.  As you work to make your lines work as efficiently as possible, more stops pop up. Your trains go back and forth or around in a circle on your track and it's simultaneously engaging and rather cathartic to see all the little passangers getting where they're going.  I can't wait to see what comes up in future updates.			"

I am utterly hooked on the early access release, and I'm very excited by the prospect of more maps and game modes.

												It's a thematic puzzle game with minimalist visuals and simple mechanics!The theme? Misery.You see, if you play Mini Metro only aiming to reach the minimum goal for each city then it's okay enough. Fairly short but the challenge is reasonable. Overall, it's passable.The problem lies in trying to push the game any further.Mini Metro relies mainly on RNG to keep itself fresh. Map layout for each city is always the same but starting points, station placement and resource availability are randomised. Being a puzzle game, that would require very careful balance so the player has sufficient tools to keep stations from overcrowding (the game's fail state) at least most of the time.Unfortunately, that's not the case here. Games start fairly slow with a steady increase in activity for a short while, before cranking the difficulty up to eleven absurdly fast with stations popping up far away on the edges of the map, population increasing like nasty cancerous cells and don't even get me started on those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ same-type station clusters always forming WITHOUT FAIL.Resources to deal with all the junk being thrown at once? You only get to pick one at the end of each week and the selection is limited and also randomised, which is clearly one of the biggest flaws here, since there's no reason to lock the player out of vital options in a puzzle game, especially when urgency becomes a constant after just a few minutes and they might desperately need those bridges to save an urban planning career from an early catastrophe but WHO CARES IT'S JUST WATER HERE HAVE ANOTHER LINE.For three weeks straight.You could try exploiting the fact that you can change the routes and replace the trains as much as you want (it's not a simulator in the slightest, after all) but, really, having to do that every 3 seconds to prolong the inevitable for maybe another week at best just makes the whole thing a chore to play and you'll end up looking even more pathetically desperate.Unless this game gets some much-needed rebalancing, it's not really worth it. Until then, for anyone looking for a challenging and fair puzzle game, Mini Metro is most definitely going to look like one big RNG train wreck.Yes. I'm so clever.			"

												This game is so stunningly simple and yet so complex with just the right amount of difficulty. So glad I took a chance on this game. Feeling like you're redesigning the major metros/subway systems of the world was cool, relatable, and satisfying. I hope more cities are added in the future.. Especially Chicago and Toronto- I thought the EL would've been a no-brainer. That being said, this game has high replayability. You always want to top your best score and that's difficult for a game to accomplish. Solid 8.5/10 from me. This was an absolute STEAL on the steam sale- it almost feels criminal. ALMOST.			"

												I never write reviews, so that should be some indication of how much I enjoy and respect this game and it's dev.  It's an addictive real-time simulation of the Travelling Salesman problem, combined with a bunch of probability statistics, and with a graphical interface that is a work of simplistic beauty.  Oh, and did I mention the music/sounds?  They're pretty much one and the same, and I honestly think one of the more under-rated parts of this game.  It's literally as if the trains were generating the music.I've only had this game a few weeks, but have already racked up dozens of hours of play.  And I'd also like to say that from what I can tell, the dev is an upstanding, modest person who takes pride in making a good product at a fair price, listens attentively to users, and even appears to offer excellent customer support (he mentioned that the new build of the game won't run on an older Mac OS version, and offered refunds to anyone who wanted one if they were affected.  Whoever you are, you're a class act, mate.Oh, and as a Cities Skylines fan, I can say that Mini Metro has made me a LOT better at designing roads, bus routes, and railways.  So if you want to improve your C:S skills, this game is totally worth it just for that reason.			"

Early Access Review
TL;DR - Mini Metro is a top-down iconographic map-planning and resource-management simulation in which you build a metro system that somehow manages to pop new stations up at an alarming rate.  Your only resource is time, and you will eventually lose - the satisfaction in this game comes from creating a well oiled machine.  I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoyed building transport networks on Simcity 4 or find themselves building all possible city improvements in Civ just because they like to see the city doing well.This (as of writing) is a game in Beta, but still thoroughly enjoyable.  Your task is to create a metro network by facilitaing the transport of shaped passengers (circle, square, triangle, star etc) with the same shaped stations.  This is done by connecting the station shapes with a coloured transport line - a train will automatically carry passengers back and forth along the line's length.The difficulty comes from the fact that each station can only so many passengers - and once a station has been full for 30 seconds, it's game over.  This becomes more and more likely as the map progressively bigger, more stations are added, and more shapes are included - your only tools against this are earned at the end of each week; more trains, more lines, and more carriages.  To throw one more spanner into the works, each map contains a river which can only be travered through the use of 'tunnels' - again, only to be earned at the end of each week.  This causes  for some very difficult decisions to be made about whether you should pick more trains to add to your system, or whether you're going to need to get over the river with one of your lines before the week is out.The aesthetic mirror's the current London Underground colouring and angling - meaning that even when you end up losing the game, looking back over your map is a fairly satisfying experience.I definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys intense resource management and optimising pathing; the skill in this game is in weighing up many different routes simultaneously and evaluating which is the best.  An oddly satisfying experience all the way through; one that will be even better once the music and sound effects have been added into the game.			"

												I ask myself, Why didn't I make this game?As simple as it may seem. YOUR WRONG. It is not simple at all and it really puts a different view in my mind about the people who made our train systems. The people who have to deal with us by working at that train stations, out in view and behind the sence. You have to think is it better to have one main place for everyone to be transfering like Penn Station on the north east side of the USA. Should it flow different like the BART system on the west coast of the USA. Sadly, it is not one or the other. Some place make changes all the time to better time and get more people around where they need to be.You could start off simple with one line or just keep it three lines but you may find yourself finding the people getting upset and the game ends quickly. A lot of pressure or maybe it is no pressure at all if you like puzzles and strategy. With this game you will have to keep changing your strategies through the game or maybe just in the beginning depending on how you read the game. Even how your draw the line between spots has strategy all on its own.I do enjoy this game. It is very relaxing to my engineer mindset which doesn't seem to turn off, this game makes it slow down. The music is calming as well. Personally, I am not sure if they change the music through out each different stations, but never the less, it does keep me calm. Plus it is so simple to learn how to draw between stations, my mother who hasn't toucch a computer since they did punch cards for programming, can understand it and enjoy it as well or help me play along.

												Mini MetroFirst of all I have to admit that I think this game is presented in a very appealing style. As an architect it is my day to day job to think about graphical appearances of drawings and diagrams so I see myself capable to state that the art and graphic style of the game is phenomenal. The greatness of the presenation starts with the use of pictogram's and symbols, includes great color management and concludes in a nearly flawless minimal design game.The game is a great ""time killer"" for optimizing fanatics because fully understanding the game takes quiet a while in my opinion as it is not a as straight forward game as it looks like in the beginning. Its not mastered by thinking ""I am going to connect these stations and lets see what happens!"". A situation which shows that there is more effort put into the design of the game than in a strait forward browser games. The game also has great balancing as each factor is important but no game factor has a ridiculous overwhelmingly impact. For example the drawing style of each player is different and the game sometimes draws the metro lines so that he trains actually lose some time on each station. If the player redraws and tries to put the lines in the right angel he achieves a optimization of some milli second. A factor that helps the player to make a better score but it is also possible to make good scores by concentrating on other ""small factors"" like the one just explained.Finally I have to also state that the game has an factor of addiction as the player always things ""one more time, this time I'm going to make a score over 2.000"". A situation (which again) shows very good inventing, designing and balancing potential by the developers of the game. So putting all together this game is totally worth its money as the player will play for a throughout great design and thought through little puzzle game.http://architectonreview.blogspot.com.tr/ "

												Mini Metro is a beautiful game to experience. In gameplay terms, it's easy to pick up but hard to master. For good 'runs', you'll need forward-thinking, adaptability and a bit of luck, which gives it a perfect one-more-try feel. Achievement-wise, it rewards both newbies and masters: half are devoted roughly to ""beating"" certain maps by reaching certain passenger counts, the rest toward map-specific challenges involving one bridge or limited lines/locomotives, some of which border on fiendish.With Workshop support promised by the devs in the near future, Mini Metro also benefits from frequent updates and a small but dedicated community. I'd comfortably recommend this at full price, and implore you to buy at any less.			"

												A very addicting game. The game is balanced on Chance.The station that spawn are at random location and at random shapes, you can't create a perfect line to accomodate the ever growing stations. Some say it is part of the challenge, I say it limits the fun factor a bit.You also have limited control on your weekly upgrades, you only have two choices from four, the game is not smart enough to give you a choice that matters because it is also random. I don't understand why the player can't choose from the four upgrades since it is a vital part of the game. Often times you are at the mercy of the game to give you the upgrades you really need.This game is also rage inducing.I will recommend this game though, even if its random half of the time it is still fun to play.Which reminds me, I mostly said bad things about the game.

												Very nice little optimization puzzle game. The screenshots alone don't really do it justice. Each level starts off easy but then gets gradually harder when more and more stations pop up and passengers start to appear in a quicker pace. After each in-game week you get to pick one of two perks, such as tunnels or a new locomotive. These choices are interesting, there's no right answer that works all the time. The game also forces you to make interesting choices all the time in the name of optimization. Shorten that crowded line, but make another one longer? Add a carriage here or a locomotive there? Recommended, especially right now when you can get it in the Humble Eye Candy Bundle along with some other nice games. :)			"

								Mini Metro, a strategy game by Dinosaur Polo Club that is so simple yet so fun, you’d think that they actually made a game equivalent to Sudoku.The game revolves around you, a bunch of shapes that resemble stations, train lines and customers that look like shapes. You have to connect all the stations together and get all the passengers to where they want to be without the stations getting crowded. The maps slowly expand revealing more play area to which more stations open up for you to connect to. You can make numerous train lines or add more trains and carriages to existing lines to help transporting passengers.There are numerous levels to play on, each with rivers where you have to make tunnels through, despite the limited supply. You get a train given to you every week and a choice of an extra tunnel, carriage or train line to get to help you win. Even though it looks easy, it isn’t really. They added an extra mode which is the equivalent of a sandbox mode, where the stations can get full of passengers but the game doesn’t end, this allows you to just build and deliver passengers as you please, while still working with the limited supplies. They plan on making another mode which will be hard-core, only for experienced players, more cities, customers but maybe less or normal amount of assets.Mini Metro is In Early Access currently (time of review posting) and therefore isn’t finished, a simple game with lots to do. Despite the lack of music, there are big plans for the future and it’s exciting to imagine what comes next. The game comes with the ability to change between colour-blind mode and not colour-blind mode, meaning that players who have trouble with colours can still play the game. There is even a Day and Night mode that changes the colour of the game, white for day and black for night so it doesn’t hurt your eyes. These two features aren’t given often in games but should be added for those who need these options.This game, despite its easy looks it is quite hard, and that’s something you don’t see much anymore, hard games that look easy. Dinosaur Polo Club have developed a game that is really fun and challenging, something that strategy game lovers need in their steam library.I rate this game a 9/10. Not a 10 because of the lack of features, but since it’s an Early Access game, a couple more updates and it’ll be a 10/10.			"

								It's very easy to say that Mini Metro is my newest addiction. After traveling to various cities and experiencing multiple transit lines, it's fun to be in the commanding seat to map out where everything goes. Having familarity with the cities is a huge plus when playing the game, and adds an extra level of amusement. The design of the game is so simple, pretty and just amazing to stare at. My favorite part has to be when you get a huge city going with dozens of stops, multiple color lines, and trains, it's just great to see all the colors moving around. The city never stops moving.

												The first thing you notice in Mini Metro is the clean aesthetic. The minimalist graphics are both pleasing to the eyes and reminiscing of the many subway maps we have around the world. That graphical happiness is soon followed by the pleasure of drawing the metro lines, in a very intuitive way. But then come the passengers...after a few minutes things start to become hectic and you're scrambling around trying to fix your network that is inevitably doomed. And then, you want to try it again to do better.But after theses first few games, you will begin to notice a pattern...the first few minutes of the game are boring. Setting up a basic network is easy for anyone with a few games under their belt. Even on fast forward, it still feels too slow...until it doesn't, and suddenly you notice your network has congestion all over the place. You fix things here and there, but usually once congestion start to set in, it will just go downhill. And now you notice the main problem of the game: pacing.Pacing in Mini Metro is weird. Things are usually either too slow, or too fast. The sweet spot, where you have to fix stuff but you still have time to think and do things coherently, is such a small part of each game. The endless mode offers some of the pleasure of doing things at your own pace, but it encourages a playstyle that is dumb (serving the minimum numbers of station, leaving 2/3 of the map unconnected).Another big drawback of the game is the randomness. Stations spawn completely randomly, and an important station spawning at the wrong time or the wrong place can utterly destroy a game that was going well. On the other hand, you can sometime be saved by stations popping up exactly where you need them. This randomness is both frustrating, and greatly limit the strategic aspect of the game. It's hard to know how well or how bad you're doing when things vary so much from game to game. Therefore, it's even harder to learn to play the game properly. Expert modes, challenges, or simply highscore chases can become very frustrating when you get bad stations spawns.All of that makes Mini Metro a tough game to evaluate. It's original, it had a good idea and great visual, but the minute-to-minute gameplay isn't quite there. I wish Steam would let me gives a ""neutral thumb"", but since i have to choose between a ""up thumb"" or a ""down thumb"", I'm gonna go with a ""play the free flash prototype for a few minutes, but skip this full game version"".PS: if you do play the full game, I recommend you cut all sounds (there is no option to cut only certain sounds), because the awful music they've added doesn't improve the game, and actually gave me headaches. I recommend playing with your own music as a background, even if that mean you don't get the important ""overcrowding station warnings"".			"

												It's fun, it's relaxing... and it's not worth the asking price.My biggest gripes with the game is that as a strategy-puzzle game, I don't feel like I got better at the game when playing it. I don't feel like I discovered a more efficient strategy or anything. Like, is a looping rail way better than a non looping one? Is a station with many lines connecting to it a good thing or not? Is having passengers transfer via many station a good or a bad thing? The game just doesn't offer any feedback to my strategy.And God, I hate the random system so much. On one playthrough I didn't get any additional bridge at all, so I have to minimize the amount of bridge needed. On the next playthrough I got so many bridges, making everything I learn before useless =/			"

								Mini Metro is a puzzle game about stringing up as many different shaped stations in a line as possible. The challenge comes from the imbalance and numerousness of the spawned shapes, and your task is to figure out the logistics of shipping any cargo to its desired type of destination as efficiently as possible, without overflowing its spawn station, or any interchange stations on the way. The art style will be familiar to anyone who uses their local metro system, however unfortunately this game is not a simulator by any means. If you want to build any metro line in a way that vaguely resembles reality, you will lose and you will lose hard. The screenshots you see are only representative of the first 5 minutes of the game, they are not representative of anything you might end up with - There will never be enough lines or trains supplied to allow you to create anything orderly - your trains will weave around the map, twisting and turning to gobble up all un-connected stations like a nokia snake. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants an interesting puzzle in a metro theme. However I have to downvote it because the description is misleading - If you're looking for a subway management simulator, look elsewhere.			"

								Clever little addictive strategy game that is deceptively simple and visually appealing. Using global metro/underground/railway maps as the motif, you'll try repeatedly to shuffle passengers around to their correct stops (based on shapes) as you juggle line layout, variety of shapes, and number of locomotive and engine cars to move them. At the moment, there is only one game mode, limited tutorial, and no sound, but if you like strategy games -- even fairly casual ones -- there is enough to keep you busy for quite awhile already at this Early Access state.

Mini Metro is a game of make-believe mass transit.Hear me out.Mini Metro allows you to build a subway system in imitation of the systems of major world cities.  The stations you must link up appear randomly within an area, and each station has a different shape.  ""Passengers"" are represented by smaller shapes.  Triangles need to go to triangle stations, and so forth.  You start with a few lines and you can connect your stations -your passengers can make transfers- and work around the waterways of the city.  You have trains (needed to make your lines work), carriages (boosting the capacity of packed trains) and tunnels/bridges (to work around the water).Mini Metro starts with London and Paris, and the other cities unlock, one by one, by transporting enough passengers on the city before it.  New cities bring new challenges and new resources. Mini Metro allows for brief play sessions.  I'm not particularly good at this game, so it's usually Game Over after about 20 minutes of play, which allows me to get up and do other things, rather than getting sucked in.  I'm getting better, I swear!If you played SimCity and want a briefer experience, or played Roller Coaster Tycoon and wanted something more... grounded... you should play Mini Metro.  I strongly recommend it, even at full price.  It's fun, and pleasing, but it is not exciting.  City planning rarely is.I bought this game for full price, I became interested in it after seeing it mentioned in one of the ""Games You May Not Have Tried"" episodes of Extra Credits.			"

												Don't get caught offguard by the graphics. Despite looking fairly simplistic, there's quite some depth to the game and the different maps. You constantly have to make strategic decisions based on the amount of bridges, lines and wagons you own to keep the stations from overflowing. On top of that, changes in acceleration and speed between the various trains and metro's make each map feel distinct.Eventhough you will eventually get overwhelmed, the pace and simplistic graphics of Mini Metro make it a perfect last game before bedtime. It's very satisfying to see your network expand while the numbers get higher.			"

												If you like the adrenaline rushes that accompany micromanagement, this game is for you. As the one overseeing the construction of your metro, you are expected to strategize and be able to adapt to sudden and often unwanted changes in an attempt to move passengers from point A to point B.Picture this: you have a beautiful, stable system with no overflowing stations. You sit back, sporting a grin of pride on your face, until suddenly, one of your stations has changed and a new station has appeared on one of your tracks to ruin your delivery efficiency. As you scramble to tweak your lines, an army of circle stations all appear on one side of the map. And even with an entire line now devoted to these stations, you begin to experience multiple overflows. This unavoidable stress and the knowledge you gain from learning how to better construct your railways are the alluring charms that make this game so replayable.However, don't be discouraged by the inevitable-  the moment when a handful of people at an overflowing train station all collectively write enough bad Yelp reviews to put you out of business.

												This game is perfect for those times where you just want to relax and enjoy a simple yet hard puzzle game. Its perfect if you ever want to just relax and play for fun. I really recommend this for anyone. Life can be stressful and hard so a simple game like Mini Metro is perfect for those hard times where you lose sight of whats good in life.			"

Although I'm usually not so much into ""little games"", Mini Metro is very enjoyable and it is always much fun to launch a new game hoping to beat your own score.			"

								Interested in transport simulators but found Cities In Motion a little to complicated and hard to understand or play? Good, welcome to Mini Metro. This quick-paced game places you in the hands of a subway train line designer. Your goal is to draw a subway map, connecting stations of various shapes and ensuring that each shape has an easy way to get to a different shape. It sounds a little confusing, but one play and everything will make complete sense. Great game to play.			"

								This is a game that makes you happy to quit in furstration. While early access the game is very playable as it currently stands. You build a subway and if you make it through a week without overcrowding any station you get another locomotive and a choice of upgrade from between two items. You usually really need both and it makes it hard to pick.Somewhere in week five you have a jump in diffcultly where you have to scramble to keep everything going. I save a carriage and a locomotive just for that hump. You keep growing and growing until you have a station overcrowd and you fail. I can usually go four or five games before I get furstrated with failing. I've played hours on the beta version before they came to early access. I was happy to play until I quit in furstration and come back to try again later.There is supposed to be a zen mode coming. When that hits I'll be playing lots more.The delevopers are very good about feedback. I mentioned my family needed a colorblind mode and they were very good about asking what would make it easier for us. I've seen where things I've suggested (that I'm sure others suggested too) have been implemented already. This is early access done right. When it gets closer to finished I'll be buying this for a friend if they haven't given in and gotten it by then. And that's the best recommandation I can give a game.			"

								Mini Metro distills logic and joy of multi-day train-route management games into a free-form art that can be enjoyed in 30 minutes.  Rather than work through tables of numbers or try to optimize the profitability of lines like a traditional train game, Mini Metro offers a lighter fair that encompasses the same core aesthetic without the complexity.  Suprising depth for a simple interface.I normally hold Early Access Games in contempt, as they are making a promise about a future game that they rarely deliver on.  Mini Metro's gameplay is functionally complete (aside from a sound to accompany the visual warning that a station is backing up).  I wouldn't care less if they didn't update another thing.			"

Decide how you layout your lines, which resources you would actually need, and whether to take it step-by-step or reconstruct everything from scratch--all while making sure every one of your stations doesn't get overcrowded. There are multiple modes to play depending on how much stress you're willing to take. Personally, I'd take being stressed here than the actual MRT.			"

 Game is still in Development.  But you can see where its going. The Game is solid, if you like games like Civ, Anno and other construction / management games you should take a look. But don't get me wrong. This game is only about building a Subway System on a map, not about ruling and expanding your Empire. The stations will spawn randomly and you have to manage your resources (trains, tunnels, wagons) carefully. There is / isn't much time to improve your Metro sytem. Easy to learn hard to master :) A little bit of luck is needed to fight for the highscore.			"

												If you like the adrenaline rushes that accompany micromanagement, this game is for you. As the one overseeing the construction of your metro, you are expected to strategize and be able to adapt to sudden and often unwanted changes in an attempt to move passengers from point A to point B.Picture this: you have a beautiful, stable system with no overflowing stations. You sit back, sporting a grin of pride on your face, until suddenly, one of your stations has changed and a new station has appeared on one of your tracks to ruin your delivery efficiency. As you scramble to tweak your lines, an army of circle stations all appear on one side of the map. And even with an entire line now devoted to these stations, you begin to experience multiple overflows. This unavoidable stress and the knowledge you gain from learning how to better construct your railways are the alluring charms that make this game so replayable.However, don't be discouraged by the inevitable-  the moment when a handful of people at an overflowing train station all collectively write enough bad Yelp reviews to put you out of business.

												""Wait, Auckland doesn't have a...""""Oh. OH. I SEE THE JOKE HERE.""Brought the game on the strength of that joke alone. However, the game is strong enough on its own merits that I'm very pleased with my purchase. On endless, you've got a fantastic idle game you can fiddle with while listening to a podcast, trying to up your efficiency. On normal, you've got an intriguing puzzle that requires your constant attention, analysis and problem-solving skills [along with the occasional gamble] as you try and make sure that the people flow so as to not get left standing on a station to the point where their complaints get you shut down.As a side note, I like to imagine that this represents the complete anarchy of people who're waiting on a station platform for too long. An hour is fine, but when they're waiting for a whole day to get to work, they're probably going to start burning things to get your attention.The way you draw 'lines' in both the sense of a metro and in the sense of them being literal lines is a kinaesthetic pleasure. The visual and auditory senses combine to create a meditative yet active and engaging mood. Fantastic work on that sound, by the way. Very few games combine what's happening in the game with the sound the player hears that well. You can see from screenshots, too, the aesthetic appeal of the game. If you don't get some amount of pleasure just from looking at the game, then you might want to check whether or not you actually want to buy it. In normal [which in some ways feels like 'survival', at the end of each week you get an upgrade to your system. These vary from map to map [In Cairo your trains only hold four passengers, in another of the maps you can get fast bullet trains] but you always get another train of some description which you can plop on an existing line or use as the basis of a new one. After accepting this, you get the choice between one of two additional upgrades, both of which you'll sorely need. Perhaps you need another two bridges to complete some loops, or another car to double the capacity of a train, maybe a fourth line so that you can make each more efficient. Whichever you choose, you may within moments regret your bad, stupid choice, because there's now a station on that one little island you've been looking at, wondering how soon you'll need more bridges to access. Now you have to redo a track or two to free up a bridge to make a line that reaches it. And a line it shall be, because although loops are generally more efficient, you just can't do it with that track if you want it to cover where you need it to cover.Thus is the loop of the game. Meet demand. Watch demand rise. Panic. Meet demand. If I must provide some outright negatives, I'll say that the game does what I might call a shoddy job at teaching you the basic controls. The tooltips telling you how to play only pop up once, so if you missed them, good luck. You can fiddle around a bit and make peace with losing a couple of games prematurely in order to work it all out, but some things it doesn't even seem to tell you [at least in enough detail you you'd understand it at first], like the fact you can click in the middle of a line between two stations and drag it to another station to add it to the link. A basic tool at your disposal, though not indespensible, the alternative way to perform the action is more time consuming, which gets in the way of the main appeal of this game, which is its creative flow. That being said, all in all, this is a fantastic minimalist piece of logical art. The couple of issues I had learning the game at first were all resolved within the first hour, and I've had a great time since  then. It's fresh, and even after you understand it, the occasional curveball always keeps it interesting, as does the pursuit of perfection.Nice to see a brilliant indie game from NZ.			"

This has unbelieveable build quality for a beta, in the 10 hours I've played I've only encountered one 'maybe' bug (In Zen mode the weekly funding stops suddenly.) I can only imagine how incredible this game would be when it is ready for release.  The only minor gripe is that I wish that there was a true sandbox mode where you can create your own map, actually have control of station placement, and be able to name your lines and stations. But that doesn't really affect my enjoyment of this game. I absolutely would recommend this for those simulation/puzzle lovers who just want to let go for a little while and just lay some rail.			"

At the moment, there is only one game mode, limited tutorial, and no sound, but if you like strategy games -- even fairly casual ones -- there is enough to keep you busy for quite awhile already at this Early Access state.

												Don't get caught offguard by the graphics. Despite looking fairly simplistic, there's quite some depth to the game and the different maps. You constantly have to make strategic decisions based on the amount of bridges, lines and wagons you own to keep the stations from overflowing. On top of that, changes in acceleration and speed between the various trains and metro's make each map feel distinct.Eventhough you will eventually get overwhelmed, the pace and simplistic graphics of Mini Metro make it a perfect last game before bedtime. It's very satisfying to see your network expand while the numbers get higher.			"

												Mini Metro is a fun minimalist strategy/puzzle game. Unlike many strategy games, each run lasts maybe 20-30 minutes, so it's great for playing one sitting at a time. You can pause whenever you like, so even when it gets tough it's not heavily stressful or anything. Combined with the dynamic soundtrack by Disasterpeace (you might know his music from Fez), it's a lovely game great for when you want to sit back, relax, and play a quick game.			"

												I bought Mini Metro when it was in Early Access for the first two or three months. I loved it, but there was a lot missing, which was expected for such an early version of the game. I forgot about for a long time, and when I remembered how the game was fun, I decided to check it out, since it was officially released. The game is great! It's pretty casual, the sounds are great (and I personally love how each new line has it's own sounds), and there are almost no problems, the only one I've encountered in 3.8 hours of game was that the sound glitched and turned into a one-tone buzz that was only fixed by restarting the game. I definitely recommend this if you appreciate casual strategy games.			"

Mini Metro is one of those games that is very addictive. It's one that might come up behind you and say something like, ""Hey, I'm single..."" and creep you out, so you might be not that keen of it if you just look at the outside (trailer, screenshots, etc.) I know I wasn't! But then, one of my friends bought it and recommended it. He told me to give it a go. I did. I immediately fell in love with this game. It's one of those games you play a little each week or month and you keep coming back to it now and then. Unlike COD or CS:GO or TF2, it's one that you play a little at a time, not 12 hours straight!RATINGS:  Subject Score   Gameplay 9/10   Price 10/10   Difficulty 7/10 (10 is easy)   Audio 58/10*   Overall Rating 8.5/10 NOTES:• *Audio, as of writing, has been implemented less than a week ago.

												This is a nice and simple puzzle game that makes you connect 'stations' of various shapes with other 'stations' in order to use 'trams' to transport shapes to their corresponding station. The reason I put stations and trams in citation marks is because I think the theme of the game could easily be something else entirely. However does it matter that the theme is not the strongest? Not at all. Mini Metro is not a game that requires a lot of theme. It is a fun little puzzle game that gets harder as you progress and as you create more and more elaborate lines. I really enjoy how easy the game is to understand without the need of a text heavy tutorial. I like that the game maintains simplicity in design while adding complexity in the options the player will have to solve each puzzle. You can arrange and rearrange your lines as much as you like and you can deploy and redeploy trams and carriages at your convenience. So wherein lies the challenge? Well, to me, the challenge comes from a limited set of lines and trams available combined with a growing number of stations and passengers. A line that I might have had no problems with before, suddenly becomes overcrowded and I have to rearrange my lines or trams in order to deal with the situation before it is too late.Obviously, as the game is so simple and minimalistic, it is not something that I have played, or even see myself playing for hours on end. But I rather enjoy bringing it out when I have to kill a quarter of an hour or something along those lines. The puzzles change every time so I don’t feel like I’ve exhausted any of the cities in the game yet and in fact, some of the cities have now become a race against my own previous achievements. The game also has a nice tranquil feeling to the design to the point where it can feel both stressful to decide where to place the next line or which tram to give an extra carriage, as well as calming to watch the gentle movement on the pure white background.All in all, a good game worth a look if you’re into puzzle games.

								The thing I like about this game is that it is extremely simple but appropriately tough as nails at the same time. Watching your network run is just mesmerising, even with no sound. I can see myself spending many sleepless nights playing this. This has unbelieveable build quality for a beta, in the 10 hours I've played I've only encountered one 'maybe' bug (In Zen mode the weekly funding stops suddenly.) I can only imagine how incredible this game would be when it is ready for release.  The only minor gripe is that I wish that there was a true sandbox mode where you can create your own map, actually have control of station placement, and be able to name your lines and stations. But that doesn't really affect my enjoyment of this game. I absolutely would recommend this for those simulation/puzzle lovers who just want to let go for a little while and just lay some rail.			"

								A total time-suck, just like riding the MRT-3 in Manila! However, there are stark differences:Pros:+ You don't have to queue up for hours to get a ticket+ You never have to worry about smelly, sweaty passengers sticking their armpits just right up your nose+ You won't encounter snatchers, pick-pockets and thievesCons:- Currently has no audio*--bring your own music player (just like IRL!)- Currently has no achievements** (if you don't achieve anything riding the metro IRL, sorry but your life sucks)* Early Access review; they plan to add these features later** Feature has been addedMini Metro is a minimalist strategy-simulation game that's easy to get into but hard to master. Decide how you layout your lines, which resources you would actually need, and whether to take it step-by-step or reconstruct everything from scratch--all while making sure every one of your stations doesn't get overcrowded. There are multiple modes to play depending on how much stress you're willing to take. Personally, I'd take being stressed here than the actual MRT.			"

								Mini Metro distills logic and joy of multi-day train-route management games into a free-form art that can be enjoyed in 30 minutes.  Rather than work through tables of numbers or try to optimize the profitability of lines like a traditional train game, Mini Metro offers a lighter fair that encompasses the same core aesthetic without the complexity.  Suprising depth for a simple interface.I normally hold Early Access Games in contempt, as they are making a promise about a future game that they rarely deliver on.  Mini Metro's gameplay is functionally complete (aside from a sound to accompany the visual warning that a station is backing up).  I wouldn't care less if they didn't update another thing.			"

								For me this game is totally awesome! Why?Because in this game, you can explore the idea of creating subway lines, focus on the networks between each location. The challenge is, every few minutes, new location comes and ask for you to build the lane to that location. And every few minutes, you also get a new train (which you can use in your current subway lines or use it later if you got a new line), option between new line, new carriage (so your train will be able to load more people), new tunnel (because at some points in the map, you need tunnel to draw the line if there is a river on the top of it), and also intersection to make a location can be reach by more line (usually a place limit is 2 line in one location).You can edit your current line anytime, and to make you more focus, you can even pause the game, draw it, then continue the game.If you are people who are happy to be challenged, you will like this game!And also, the size of the game is friendly for people with low internet quota heheThank you and let's play!

												I have always been fascinated with simulations of real life things. As a kid, I dug SimTower trying to build the greatest skyscraper everrrrr (unfortunately, it took a lot of micromanaging so I got bored after I hit 4 stars). With Mini Metro, I lay my hands on a very simplistic type of simulation: You have to connect different spots on the map (which is based on real life cities) in order to build a functioning public transportation system. Starting out slowly, you soon hit the point where your passengers get annoyed and complain because they have to wait too long (it's not like nobody has ever been in that state of mind). It takes careful planning and managing your lines to be successful until the inevitable overcrowded station. Different cities also have different assets to their system such as high-speed trains or interchanges that don't overcrowd as fast. It is a lot of fun on the way there and adds some variation by the Daily Challenge as well as a sandbox-like endless mode. I enjoy playing it whenever I am sick of the fast-paced multiplayer games I usually play.			"

								Mini Metro is a zen puzzle game with simple yet addictive gameplay that keeps players interested for hours. I had the good fortune of stumbling over Mini Metro whilst reading about one of the Ludum Dare competitions (26 I believe); the game is a successor to 'Mind the Gap' a game of a similar premise.The simple design and user interface will no doubt sit well with players, although I do wonder why there was a shift from the old in game menu which in many ways--was simpler--a simple flick to the left of the screen would bring it up. The actual gameplay is very good. Your objective is to maintain your underground system for as long as possible without too much overcrowding. If a station incurs too much congestion for more than thirty seconds, game over.I cannot be certain as the game is still in pre-release, but there seems to have been some nerfing of gameplay in the form of bonuses you acquire at the end of the week. You now gain a new train every Sunday but there seems to be a lack of station upgrades. One of the things I was expecting was more choice, rather than less.Some features are currently unavailable but in the works; maps and music come to mind. I'm looking forward to seeing those implemented over time. I caution Dinosaur Polo Club about adding new maps as DLC though (I still see a fairly lackluster amount of additional maps to be unlocked as the game is updated), and I hope we as players are buying the full game, rather than half of it!One last point of contention is the game's varied art style. Some maps are very minimalist such as London and Paris, with a plain white background. Others, such as Cairo and New York are yellower and although this is a very very small point, I can't tell if this inconsistency is good or bad yet.Over all Mini Metro is a solid game, especially for the price, well worth picking up!8.5/10			"

								This game that started out as a browser game, may look simple. But as many other games, this game proves that graphics should not be the main reason for trying out a game. That said, the graphics is very functional and good looking when you get into the symbols and gameplay.When you got past the graphics, you just cannot put it down. You have to try to make the most efficient network. When it's game over you just have to try one more time. And then you question yourself, why it you haven't got anything done today.The concept is simple, but it is based upon the network building in all the traffic tycoon games. Which is probably the reason why some old games still is going strong today (Transport Tycoon for example). And it's has also added a puzzle element, that I will be a bit careful calling a puzzle. It's more a challenge of optimization.If you want a transport game that will last just a few minutes, look no further. As long as you know you can quit when it's game over...This review was written when in Early Access. So no sound was added yet. This is the only thing that I miss.

												Simple, Elegant, and Wonderful.It's incredibly satisfying to create an efficient Metro system, even if the game is trying it's hardest to make your perfect system crumble under the demand. The controls are not completely explained, but five seconds of fiddling will allow you to figure it out. Other than that, everything's pretty intuitive. There's also plenty of maps available for you to work around, so there's damn near infinite replayability. The developers did an excellent job.			"

												I must warn you against purchasing this game.  It is addictive.  It is narcotic.  I do not know where the last five hours went.  I sat down a short while ago and drew lines on an exessively simple map and watched basic geometric shapes move from one spot to another.  I have no idea what happened to those hours.  But the clock confirms they are gone.  You, my friends, have been warned.Seriously though.  For a pretty darn simple game, this has been awesome.  Two purrs and a tail twitch.			"

It's also extremely rewarding if you manage to play your cards right.It also plays flawlessly on both my rather new PC and my 6-year-old MacBook, it isn't too heavy on the graphics.The only thing i'm bothered about is the lack of cities to play through, but hey, it's still in early access and is already this good!

												A puzzle game where you have to keep passengers moving on a series of subway lines. It is simple to learn, with a minimalist design, but the levels get hectic rather fast. There is also a rather nasty random element to the game. You can get a cluster of the same type of stations and that will make it really hard to do well. That’s a pain, but overall the game is still worth buying.			"

												I have always been fascinated with simulations of real life things. As a kid, I dug SimTower trying to build the greatest skyscraper everrrrr (unfortunately, it took a lot of micromanaging so I got bored after I hit 4 stars). With Mini Metro, I lay my hands on a very simplistic type of simulation: You have to connect different spots on the map (which is based on real life cities) in order to build a functioning public transportation system. Starting out slowly, you soon hit the point where your passengers get annoyed and complain because they have to wait too long (it's not like nobody has ever been in that state of mind). It takes careful planning and managing your lines to be successful until the inevitable overcrowded station. Different cities also have different assets to their system such as high-speed trains or interchanges that don't overcrowd as fast. It is a lot of fun on the way there and adds some variation by the Daily Challenge as well as a sandbox-like endless mode. I enjoy playing it whenever I am sick of the fast-paced multiplayer games I usually play.			"

												Bought this game because I loved its design and simplicity, and it turned out to be a lot more addicting that I expected. It's a game all about optimization. If you're looking for a light puzzle game you can relax to after a long day, this is perfect for you. I love how short and sweet each game is - typically around 15 minutes or so. However, if you are looking for something that will really challenge your thinking abilities until your brain hurts, this is probably not the game for you. In Mini Metro, you won't ever really have an ""Aha!"" moment that a lot of puzzle game provides because there is no definite end goal or solution. You just keep on optimizing until the city's population overwhelms your metro system.			"

												Mini Metro is a casual strategy game with a minimalist aesthetic. You play as a train system designer connecting stations together in the most efficient way possible, but new stations and more passangers use your system over time. The difficulty of this game ramps up so nicely, starting as a slow, casual connect-the-dot style game with relaxing music to a fast-paced strategy game where you'll be thinking about how to restructure a metro system without interrupting the current flow to minimize use of distance, interchanges, and bridges. All in the span of about 20 to 30 minutes.			"

												TL;DR 10/10 addictive and very challengingThis game is absolutely amazing. At first it looked like a very easy game with extremely easy control, but soon it turns into some extreme mind-boggling puzzle requiring real time strategy.- GameplayAs time goes on, new stops are built and you need to connect them in such a way that passengers can move conveniently without overcrowding on the stops. Per week you get new resources, such as the ability to construct a new line, getting additional locomotives or wagons, tunnels, bridges etc., being a finite resource. The only infinit thing is the way and length of the tracks. The amount of passengers increases and stops keep appearing at random locations and you need to find the most efficient way to get them from A to B. The passengers and stops are somewhat marked to where they desire to go and what the stops look like, but it's very abstract and it's there to give you just a basic idea.- The game itselfThe game is designed according to a very abstract concept. It looks as clean as it could be and is really all you need. The sounds are also somewhat pleasing, you can turn it off if you wish though.- ConclusionIt's a fun and challenging game to play after a hard day of work and what seems like a relaxing game, turns into a very complex puzzle and requires you to pay attention all the time and sometimes even to pauze and fundamentally redesign your network. Yet, it stays fun and you are free to do what you want.			"

								Really simple game but that doesn't mean it's no fun. It's far from being boring. In the game you only have to bring passengers from one sybmol (Station) to another. For delivering them you get points... That's all. Well that's why you get hooked on Mini Metro 'cause you want to beat ""the""/your highstocre. When one station is overfloated by passengers you will loose. The result then looks like a real metro plan.Also  it's pretty unseful that you can decide if you want to play in day or night mode. This feature changes the color of the game from bright to dark. So your monitor won't dazzle you at night ;D ...I hope the audio comes soon and will be as great as the rest of the game.Like it or not, but this game is awsome!			"

								The simplicity of the design is fantastic.  The visuals perfectly match those seen on metro maps around the globe.  The gameplay is clear to the player from the outset: help passengers get from get where they are to where they want to go - and do it in a way that scales.  It gracefully strips away the unneeded bits of land use you see in Sim City and presents a city as stations, minimalist topography, and people classified according to their intended type of destination.I cannot wait to see the finished product with audio to match.  This team is doing an awesome job.			"

												I have not a single bad thing to say about this game. I bought this game around April this year when it was early access after I saw a youtuber play it just out of the blue. As I was watching the video I thought that this could be a game that I would enjoy. After purchasing it I played it for a little while and could see myself getting addicted to it. The concept of the game is simple; run a subway/metro at one of the many locations from around the world that the developers have offered. To do this it is as simple as clicking and dragging the lines to the new stations that continue to appear as your progress through the weeks. At the end of the week you receive a new locomotive and you also then get the choice between two options that are given to you. They could be a new line, a new carriage, tunnels (which come in handy on the maps that have bodies of water that must be traversed) or even an interchange (these come in handy when you have one particular stop with many lines running through it.)The actual design of the game is simplistic and minimalistic in nature. Since April the design of the interface itself has changed and developed into one of the nicest looking interfaces I have seen. It is easy on the eyes and is easy to navigate so any new comers could easily immerse themselves in the game.The developers themselves have been continually updating this game for the players, adding new challenges and content to keep it interesting. Never fear however, even if these challenges were not available you would still find yourself lost in the game. Each play through on any map is extremely different to any previous play throughs due to the fact that each station that spawns in is random. Thus this keeps the game from becoming stale and keeps it rather interesting as you can never guess where and what kind of station will show up next.Keeping up with everything can be a real challenge at times, especially as more and more stops appear on the map and more and more passengers wait at these stops. Even so that does not make the game at all stressful and is actually oddly peaceful and satisfying to play.Every time I play I find myself saying, ""Just one more week (in game) and I'll stop"" but that one more week turns into two more weeks which turns into three more weeks and before I know it I have spent 3 hours in the game. The simple drive to keep the lines running as smoothly as possible and to get as many passengers to their destination as possible is the thing that becomes rather addictive.  Overall it is fantastic. The design is utterly perfect for this kind of game (it looks just like a metro map would), the controls are extremely easy, there are plenty of cities to play, the interface is minimalistic and overall the dev team have done a wonderful job. I would suggest anyone buy it really. Even if you only play it on the off occasion for an hour or two it is totally worth it!			"

								This game is pretty-much exactly what it seems to be - you draw the map, make sure the passengers can get where they're going.It's super-charming and great to play.If I have a complaint, it goes slow, slow, slow, slow, faster, FAST, you're dead - I think a bit of tuning to that would be nice (I spend 7% of every game waiting for things to happen and 25% desperately trying to STOP then happening!)Fantastic idea - really well executed - just needs a few tweaks in the difficulty curve perhaps?

								Mini Metro is a mini strategy puzzle game. The idea is to link up stations so commuters can get to there destination. The longer you are in the game the more demanding the commuters become and this is where you need to place you railway lines strategically.The games concept is simple but can get difficult quickly. This makes each game you play short and sweet. It is fun and can be addictive, trying to better your high score each time.The graphics are simple but effective for a game like this.There is currently no sound however I believe that this is one of the things they are currently working on.This game is no way complete and there are many things they need to add. However there is plenty to do for the price you play.Highly recommend this game. The games are short depending on how good you get. Also the idea is simple, fun  and addictive.			"

												I respect the hard work from the developers and appreciate the frequent updates, however some of the major design flaws make the gameplay more of a frustration than a mental challenge.A few glaring flaws:1. RNG decides how well you do. There are situations where it's absolutely impossible for you to get the city specific achievements. You can be using exactly the same strategy, and do exceptionally well/poor in different ocassions. That's unacceptable for a game that's essentially a time waster (even at maxmum speed, each game can take a long time to complete, with the first 10 mins completely boring and unnecessary).2. The game challenges you by making the same stations appearing in close proximity - many times had  I had over 6 circles (and zero of any other kind) on the same island. At this point, it becomes a chore to manage the situation, and you wonder why the developers didn't try something more refreshing to make the game challenging.3. The train loading optimization is poor - the simple rules the developer put together simply aren't enough. Here is an important one: a train should drop off passengers to pick up high priority passengers (those who are going to unique stations and the only way for them to arrive is through taking this one line).  4. The maxim speed in the game is way too slow, there should be way more then 2 levels of speed, I personally think the highest speed should be at least 3 to 4 times faster than the current maximum speed. This is very simple to implement, and making the game much less of a time waster. (At least giving the player control of how they would like to play the game.)If the developers are able to make changes to address the design flaws, I would gladly change my reccomendation to positive. After all the execution of the game is quite well and the idea has a lot of potential to be a truly fun strategy/puzzle game.			"

												Mini Metro is a calming, charming minimalist puzzle game - lots of buzzwords there I know, but it's very pleasant in its simplicity. You draw lines between stations, which are denoted with shapes (triangles, squares, etc) and passengers want to go to specifically shaped stations. Gameplay therefore is optimizing your lines so square passengers aren't waiting forever to get to the square station, and so on.Complexity is added with special stations, an increasing spawn rate of passengers and new stations (thus increasing the pressure on you) and upgrades that you get every week, from new lines, new carriages, to other, special things. There's a good variety in maps, too - not only do they have new layouts for the stations, they throw in rivers and lakes that you need to navigate around or over with your limited stock of tunnels and bridges.It hits that sweet spot between simplicity and complexity, basically. So - extras. There's the main mode, there's an endless mode, there's Extreme mode where you can't redraw any of your lines (yikes!) and there are the daily challenges, which hand you a random map and mode and compare your score with the internet's. There's a speed setting, so you can pause the game or speed it up as needed, although it doesn't go as fast as I'd like in some of the slower levels...but then you hit places like Auckland and you play that map at the main speed because going slightly faster will drown you!Now: Most of Mini Metro is chill, as you sort out your trains and enjoy the maps. It's a game you can meditate to as you finish levels and collect achievements.Then you hit the second half of the achievements, where they give you crazy challenges like ""you can only use two tunnels"" or ""every line must connect to one station"". These are hard, and require total mastery of the game's mechanics as well as a little luck - but they're also a good learning curve! You realize you have to play more carefully with the first one, then slowly ramp up until you're ready to face San Francisco and Auckland. The game goes from being chill to this crazy rush where your lines must be optimized perfectly as you rush around triaging passagers with your extra lines and hoping it's enough to last until you have a high enough score.In short: Mini Metro is a lot of fun, and the challenge is nicely optional. Check it out!			"

												Quite ok but not perfect.A small strategy game, starting with a blank map, where different kinds of upcoming stations (that produce waiting passengers) must be connected via lines. Trains added to lines have to transport the passengers before the waiting time gets too high. Unfortunately passengers do act less logically sometimes. When a train enters a station that connects the current station to one the passengers want to go to, they still do not enter, if in the other direction the same kind of station does exist more closely as well. In reality this would make perfect sense, in Mini Metro however not really, for the passengers just should want to find any way to such a station. In my case this meant game over just before finishing the city's goal because noone entered the train. A Pain in the♥♥♥♥♥for sure. Another thing is that in San Fran from one second to another the numbers of passengers in all stations really explode so that the game is lost currently. Some updates are yet to be made to fix such issues. For some entertainment meantimes and 10€ it's a quite and nice idea however and kind of fun.			"

								I haven't been lured to write any game review till date, but I couldn't resist the urge to express how I feel about this game in specific. Although from a scale point of view, Mini Metro is probably one of the smallest games I have ever played, but this game will give you an amount of ""addiction time"" mega scale games can't compete with!Mini Metro get's you hooked on little things with very deep and addicting strategy addiction. Being able to play a strategy game with little things such is very rewarding. Things like a) How should I divide my routes b) Which stations should I create connections c) Should I increase carriage or lines d) which stations should connect to which linesI am a fan of large scale strategy games from Sim Cities to Tycoons to Business Sims, but this simple, minimalist yet very enjoyable game gives you instant joy without needing to wait ages for results of your strategic decisions. This is extremely valuable if you are a busy person and don't have time to play games that need hours for things to shape up!If you like strategy games and would like to get a chance of playing strategy games in casual mode, I don't thing anything can currently beat Mini Metro. Absolutely wonderful!			"

												Disappointing this could have been an awsome game. At first, I was totally swallowed up by this game but there is a problem. There is a low ceiling to this game. Just as it gets interesting the stations overload that ends the game. And at first, you think it is because of your strategy. But that isn't the case the problem is their algorithm. Each type of station has a shape and that shape generates all but its own shape. That's not the problem. The problem is that some games only have one square station. I played Osaka this has one square there are twenty-five circles and eleven triangles they are all producing squares at the same rate as triangles and circles. At about 2500 point you will fail you can't get the square passengers all to the one square without overloading a station. And if you overload a station you loose. Now you might get a little higher in a different scenario but that's only because you have more squares.			"

												I would recommend the game only with strong reservations. It isn't really as much a game of skill as I hoped after trying it the first time. After playing somewhat longer, it proves that the way the game progresses, it is practically impossible to really as much solve a routing problem than hope to get lucky with how the different stations appear. Design- and looks-wise, the minimalism and Tube-map style of the graphics is appealing, but unfortunately the game depends on other factors than player skill after a certain point in the normal mode.

								This is simply the most fun and simple puzzle game I've played in Steam. It has a great minimalist design, and starts off as simple as can be: connect stations, add trains, make new lines. Soon enough you'll find yourself managing an entire network of trains and enjoying every second of it. Now that they've added audio (and it sounds amazing), I can fully recommend it. It'll soon increase in price as it gets ready to exit early access, so I suggest you get it NAO, worth every penny either way.			"

Its catchy visual style attracts unreservedly and dedicated to people keen on minimalism and infographic style.Every day more and more people from different reigns need to get to different places.

City department will help you with you task, and  on the beginning of new week you'll gain a bonus. It could be an additional vagon to existing train. Or you can purchase extra tunnels for establish underwater ways. Maybe, you'll need a new line for decrease an overload on existing branches. So far, only ""survive"" mode is available for now. How long will you support and reorganise your subway line before inevitable owerload (that leads to closure of all train branches) of human flow? I hope authors will make some new modes with obvious golas later. Still, Mini Metro is a simple (but not easy) and neat puzzle logic game with pleasant appearance that gives enjoyable pastime			"

								I've only just purchased Mini Metro but I have been following it for quite some time and have played the demo extensively. This is a really fun game, one that will challenge your organizational skills while at the same time imparting a certain zen-like satisfaction when things work out the way you intended. Be aware that it is early access, so there is (as of the time I wrote this review) no audio and some tracks and some modes are not yet available. With that in mind, however, the game is very playable right now and the developers appear to be commited to making this better and better.			"

								Lovely game. Actually alpha, not much bugs and increasing features.Time after time there will pop up station points. You have to connect them with the metro lines you have. After a week you'll get new resources. Choose wisely: A new line ore more tunnels/bridges.			"

Looking forward to the Music and Sound Design to get put in but already this is an incredibly polished product. Its a steal at it's current price as well. Can't wait for the mobile version, Highly recommended!			"

								Mini-metro is simple, elegant, engaging fun. It takes the ""less is more"" principle and runs with it! I wish it was slightly more feature heavy (money, express trains, player created maps, etc) and a little more balanced (bloody circles). However even with these issues it is still endlessley engrosing. Besides, I really can't complain about an open access game. The price point is a bit steep. This game should cost no more than a subway fare. Maybe with maps as DLC.			"

												A masterpiece of design. Clean, simple, elegant, easy to learn, and yet hard to master (try getting into the top 10% on every level). Not more than it has to be nor less, it is as close to perfect in the execution of this design concept as can probably be achieved. The only criticism I can level against the game is the randomness of the choices between days. Sometimes you just don't get any 'tunnel luck.' Also, the music and sound are pleasant at first, but as the game runs long it can layer into an annoying dishormony of sounds. Overall I highly recommend it.			"

												This game takes what could have been a great idea, and it reduces it to an embarassing collection of mistakes.The largest gameplay problem is that you will repeatedly connect cities only to find that your new connection carries zero passengers. This doesn't happen all the time, but it happens at precisely the worst time. So, it's either bad coding, or something done deliberately, and I don't understand either. The game has been out of beta forever. Why is this still happening?Additionally, as you can find on threads here and there, you have people artificially pumping up their success using whatever cheat software they do. It's easy to establish that this is happening, easy to address...and crickets. Luckily, the game is cheap, so it's not a waste of time or money. It's just the attention to detail that is lacking.

												This game is as casual as it gets.Mini Metro is a strategy-puzzle game where you must connect stations, which pop in at random intervals and are of a certain shape (circle, square, star etc), with lines and move commuters to their destinations. The commuters also possess shapes corresponding to the shape of the station they want to get to. There can be multiple stations of a certain shape (2 squares or 5 triangles and so on) so a triangle commuter may get down at any triangle station but as more and more stations pop in and your network grows and the number of commuters increase, it becomes a frantic game of figuring out which lines to connect to the new stations and where to provide new cars and trains which is where the strategy kicks in because almost everything is limited. This includes the number of lines you can place, the number of bridges (It must also be mentioned that all maps have rivers which can only be crossed by using bridges), the number of trains you are provided and the number of carriages you are given which can be used to increase a train's capacity. You are also limited by the fact that 2 lines cannot cross each other except if they meet at a station. The one respite you get is that lines can be infinitely long but even then you must be careful because a train cannot change directions midway and must move the entire length of a line before it turns back making overly long lines almost completely useless.If all this sounds frantic, it's because it is. But the beauty of this game lies in the fact that you can control the pacing of the game. Want a zen, calming experience of simply drawing lines between stations and watch commuters move almost akin to a screensaver? Or do you want to be challenged and find your way to the top of the billboards and high scores and make your mark? ell, they have that covered too. But the surprising amount of strategy required to play this game ensures that it really never gets dull even after many hours of play, partly due to the random nature of the placement of the stations hat pop up over time. There is no optimal line placement and train assignment because every play is unique. Despite being random though, the game never becomes unfair or too punishing. This might either be due to the very nature of the game and how it deals with the randomness but I never once found myself feeling that a station was unfairly placed where it was impossible to reach or unserviceable. All the various systems come together very cohesively to make for a light, casual experience or a fast-paced and urgent, but never unfair, game.The graphics are exceedingly simple, borrowing heavily from the route maps one sees on real life metros. The art style lends itself incredibly well to the gameplay, making it very easy to understand the flow of commuters at a glance simply by following the colors of the lines you placed.The audio is equally minimalistic with small sounds to indicate the flow of commuters and trains but it never crosses the line into being realistic and loud. It is simply indicative of activity and adds a lot to the already Zen nature of the game. I literally dozed off for a minute or so once playing this game and that is absolutely not a bad thing, especially after a long and tiring day of work.If you want nothing more than to sit back, relax and enjoy some calming gameplay, or if you want something with strategy and quick-thinking involved, then Mini Metro has you covered on both fronts. I highly recommend you pick this game up.			"

												Mini Metro's distinct levels--all inspired by real-world metro lines--definitely have deep nuances that affect your tactics for each and reward your experimentation and practice.It's a lot like Flight Control, except more complex.I love the meditative, minimalist aesthetic, especially with Night Mode enabled. FEZ composer Disasterpeace has crafted a lush, warm, subdued soundscape full of soft sines and small clocks that grows, shrinks, or shifts dynamically in response to your actions based on conditions in the game. Though even at full volume on my laptop, it wasn't loud enough for me.At their core, simulation and management games are about optimizing a particular workflow or mastering a certain system as best as you can. Mini Metro falls into that category, even loosely--just on a smaller, less permanent scale. I admit, a larger and lasting scale of some kind would be even more interesting here, but it shares these traits of ""starting all over"" with both score-chaser Arcade games and procedurally-generated Roguelike games.Yet even with all its depth and variations, the gameplay itself is eventually too simple to be this repetitive, and too repetitive to be this simple. I guess that makes it more suited to being used as a palette cleanser between games or between life, once you've played past using it as a game. Hence the inclusion of a Daily Challenge.Overall, there is far more praiseworthy about this game than not, and too few games accomplish similar concepts this beautifully. I hope to improve at it regularly and look forward to whatever features and content future patches will bring along!			"

												This is a wonderful, relaxing little puzzle game with an attractive, minimalist style to both its audio and visuals, and mechanics straightforward enough that the game never needs to explicitly spell them out for you. Despite the simplicity of the mechanics, though, this is a brainbender extraordinaire; those of you who enjoy setting up systems to work in the most efficient manner possible will have an absolute blast here.The concept is simple: you're in control of the subway system. Stations open across the map gradually, and you need to connect them with different coloured lines. Stations have different shapes, and the shapes of the ""commuters"" that appear at each station represent where they want to go. You will, then, need to plan out your routes so that there's minimal inefficiency; ""circle"" commuters will only ever want to go to ""square"" or ""triangle"" initially, for example, so there's little sense in making a line entirely out of circle stations.As the game progresses, the map expands and the number of possible shapes for the stations increases, too, until eventually you're having to consider things like interchanges extremely carefully as well as just the routes for your lines, particularly if you're playing on the ""Extreme"" mode, where once you've laid a line down, you can't change it!This is a highly enjoyable, inventive puzzle game, then, and particularly recommended to those who want something a little ""gentler"" than the big-budget fare of today!

												Minimalism: It is a minimalist game, above all it is minimalist by design. You can read this post[devlog.dinopoloclub.com] by the developers of this game blog.The game is really, really minimalistic, do not misunderstand me, I like also minimalistic games, but the first Steam tag is ""Strategy"", then ""Simulation"" tag. Here you will find no strategy and no simulation, just minimalism.About the gameplay, you have very few things to control, stations pop out in the game randomly, and above all even if disconnected from trails the people start to wait and going upset if they are unable to reach their kind of destination. You have no money budget to spend in something you think you need when you need it, there is no construction costs, but instead, every week you could get a new train or a new trail or a new vagon or an interchange improvement for a station, or finally a new tunnel/bridge. Naturally you can only get your week things budget if and only if your week score is high enough...There is no construction or demolition time. Stations have no range, just people that need to reach their kind of destination. If you change stations with nodes and people with weight you could play with a subset of the math graph theory...LOL...At the moment there is no editor.So, finally if and only if, you are looking for a really minimalistic game, you could be satisfied, apart the price that is not such a minimalistic price, maybe best to wait for sales, otherwise this game is really too much minimalistic...Sorry but, I have to not suggest this game to the public.

												The minimalist design is beautiful, and it's a pleasant casual game. I'm not recommending it because there's just not a whole lot to sink your teeth into strategy wise. Unlocking the maps was trivial with just my very basic, unchanging strategy - and trying to top my own high scores just wasn't enough to keep me hooked for long.			"

												EH.I played it a bit, and I can definitely see the appeal, but this game isn't for me.  Each level starts off easy, but quickly spirals out of control. The game tosses in new points and people for your network to accomodate, and though the growth rate of the network accelerates, your rate of aquiring assets does not. What's worse, is that I kept feeling like I just wanted it to pause for a minute so I could figure out if I was doing things right, but it grinds reletlessley forward withough giving you time to think.  I guess what I miss the most is a chance to learn and improve, but each round gets so out of hand that I don't have time to learn what I'm doing wrong. I suppose enough trial and error would get me there, but I like a game that gives me a ramp to climb instead of expecting me to fail my way through.If you dig quick games, and you enjoy hectic game play, then this may be the game for you. It's easy to learn and hard to master, and the interface is nice on the eyes. The audio ties into the actions occuring on screen, which got old quick for me, but others seem to really dig it. There's multiple game modes, and many levels.All in all, I suspect that this is a great game that I happen to have no taste for. Though others seem to love it, I don't think I'll be reccomending it to any of my friends.			"

												This is a truly unique game that should be in every puzzle lover's collection.It seems simple enough, make sure your passengers get to the stations they want to get to (your passengers being a wide array of shapes, denoting which station they want to travel to) and keep your subway system running as smoothly as possible until too many passengers overcrowd one station.It's the next Tetris. A deceptively simple brain teaser that progressively gets tougher and more unwieldy. I friggin LOVE it!You can spend hours just veging to this, and the sounds and music are relaxing and go very nicely with the game, it's an experience you should treat yourself to.  "

								This is an interesting little game which is still in development at time of writing but is definitely worth a play!  The aim of the game is to create an efficient network of subway stations, so as not to allow a build up of waiting passengers at any one place.  The difficulty of the game increases the longer that it is played, allowing it to maintain a level of difficulty even when you think that you have figured out the best way to plan your network, this keeps the game playable for longer. Each time you start a game the initial nodes are randomised so no two games are identical.  There are three different modes to play the game in thus far:Normal - Don't let the stations overcrowdEndless - Aim for the most efficient networkExtreme - Lines cannot be changed once placedIf you want a game to fill a fifteen minute gap this could be for you.If you want a stratagy game which will keep you playing for a little longer, this could also be for you.

												A puzzle game about building a highly abstracted mass transit system - there is no “solution” to the puzzles, just the question of how long you can keep meeting an ever rising demand.I admire both the aesthetic and pacing of this game.The interface is beautifully minimal, both providing everything you need to understand and play the game while evoking the classic topological underground map.The pacing is well executed with periods of calm where you feel in control, followed by periods of frantic activity as new stations and special stations force rapid change across your network.So why haven’t I played it more?Access to the depth - I don’t think the game lacks meaningful choices; when I look at the scores people have achieved (more than doubling my best on my most played cities) there are clearly things I can do to improve.  However the game progression doesn’t challenge me to discover new strategies or provide the signposts to improvement in the same way that my favourite puzzle games do.Well worth a look but don't be too shocked if the initial rush expires after 8-10 hours			"

								A strangely compelling puzzle game. The mechanics are simple and intuitive (they could use a more in depth tutorial for track editing, loops, and so forth, however), and it's one of the few puzzle games that felt like creative thinking was necessary. Even at Early access, it's a well made game. The solid aesthetic is refreshing, I only ran into a bug once, and it feels polished. Not finished, mind. There's still a few levels and modes missing, as well as sound (hopefully that will change for the better)			"

It's hard to get a feel for what's working and what is not. It's very interesting through, I think I just need a little more advice and information. For instance, what are the advantagtes and disadvatages of a circular line? How many people leave and visit each station? How about some interesting stats about the various metros around the world.

 Summary I have only played this game for 50 minutes now, but I'm in love! It is simple and easy to understand, but offers enough challenge. The background music is very relaxing. Pro's: -A lot of maps to play-Good background music-Enough challenge to keep things interesting-Cheap Cons -Nothing			"

								This game is very simple and is worth every single penny. The game at the moment has no audio. The aim of the game is to keep your transport system fluent. If stations are crowded the game will end. The game features in several different cities. At the end of the week you will get a locomotive and 2 tunnels/carriage or line. At the start its best to make sure the most common stops like(circle,triangle,square). This will prevent transferring passengers from one place to another. Holding passengers is a bad idea as it just makes the stations more crowded. The map its self looks like the London Underground map by Harry Beck. Please consider that you will need to do some self learning. My first try wasnt bad but i slowly got better.			"

								Yeah this is a pretty solid puzzler that is in Early Access. Even though there is no music, and limited features, I certainly will get my money's worth here (6.99$). Really solid gameplay mechanic that is easy to learn and probably near-impossible to master. Great minimalistic design aesthetic with addicting gameplay. The developer's also seem in-tune with the community, and really, what they claim they will add does not seem that far from what they already have in place. If there was a transport sim rogue-like, this may be it. It has:-Random depot spawns-I believe (Random) spot along the river where the focus starts-RPG-like leveling up via weekly upgrade choices and resource management-Permadeath-The ability to pauses and make decisions is not *quite* turn-based, but damned close-Ability to solve goals using different strategies (high complexity)-Player vs. worldThere is not:-Fantasy elements-Grid-based			"

												It's a very simplistic and nicely designed game. If your not one for ""realistic"" graphics, and prefer a cleaner, and more simple design like Portal, check this out.The gameplay is repetative after a while, even though I've only played around 8hrs, which is fairly disappointing. But, if your bored one day and want to have a strategic London Underground map making simulator, give it a shot, as it's fairly cheap.7/10Pros - Simple, easy to pickup.Doesn't require pro hardware.Cons -Pretty boring after a while.No mod support.Gamemodes basically the same.

								A strangely compelling puzzle game. The mechanics are simple and intuitive (they could use a more in depth tutorial for track editing, loops, and so forth, however), and it's one of the few puzzle games that felt like creative thinking was necessary. Even at Early access, it's a well made game. The solid aesthetic is refreshing, I only ran into a bug once, and it feels polished. Not finished, mind. There's still a few levels and modes missing, as well as sound (hopefully that will change for the better)			"

This removes the game from the ""Perfect Games"" counter on steamuntil you complete them. Overall I'd recommend this game for relaxing while watching collored rectangles move across predetermined collored lines.			"

												One of those games you can just zone out to, while still being challenging if you want to build a perfect system. It's easy to unlock all cities, but to master the game is hard. A new station will always pop up in a location that'll mess up your entire perfect looking metro loop. Play it on endless to just zone out, or try and get a high score if that's more your thing.All in all, it's a very hypnotic experience, with the subtle little bloops mixing well with the ambient background music. Quite good for a minimalist experience.			"

								It's a great unique little game, but it seems like they've sacrificed some essential controls and visualizations for a simplistic look. For example using two or three mouse buttons would be much better than the counterintuitive dragging. Trains need to be highlighted so that they're not hidden under stations when you need to change things around. It's already worth money but it has a lot of room to grow.			"

												A more fair pricing would be $5, like in iOS. :)[Edit 10/27]The game is skewed against you.While playing the game, most will reach a threshold impossible to maneuver out of, especially because of the seemingly random nature of the game. This is so because the weekly completion reward of one train does not increase exponentially with the increased amount of stations/passengers, especially increase in 'varied' stations. Then as one reaches around ~2000 passengers, the congestion becomes impossible to maneuver out of, not matter how good you play. Of course, there are some that can reach 3000 or even 4000, but this is simply due to the luck of the straw, or luck of what stations spawn where.This is a major oversight by the developers, one which shouldn't have existed to begin with. What is the point of playing something in which you know full well you will reach a certain threshold from the very beginning? Why is the weekly reward of one train when having 10 stations the same as having 30, 40 or more varied stations? Doesn't make sense.Possible fix? Increase the amount of weekly trains rewarded exponentially after a couple of weeks of play.I have asked for a refund after playing three games because there is no getting better and one can only count on better luck, not to mention it gets very repetitive. Replay value is also severely diminished knowing your imminent fate at a certain point in the game is certain.			"

												I wish I liked this more than I do. I sort of get the basics but I feel like the RNG is too random to the point of just creating unfair situations you simply don't have the resources to deal with. There's an endless sense of hopelessness underlying this game and it just ends up really frustrating and unfun to play. No mater what you do you're going to fail eventually, and sometimes it'll be your fault, but most other times it'll be the game refusing to give you bridges or spawning 6 circles in the same corner of the map.

												I'm not supposed to like this game, if there is a type of game I never play, I've never liked, I go out of my way not to own, it is THIS type of game.Except I do own this game I have played this game, I never liked it though, I loved it! There is something about Mini Metro that keeps you playing, actually a few things, the different locations, the challenge, the wanting to do better, it is one of those 'Just one more game' type of games that you have just one more game then a few hours later realize just how long you've been playing.The game-play is fairly easy to grasp, connect the train stations, keep the passengers from ammassing on the platforms, as you progress use new stuff to expand your operation and try to be as efficient as you can.  The simplicity of the game-play is maybe what makes it so good, and so addictive.I honestly can't recommend this game highly enough am really glad I bought it.			"

												A minimalist game where you start off with a map with three stations: one circle, one square and one triangle. At each station you have people wanting to go to one of the other stations: some wanting to go to the circle, some to the square, and some to the triangle. You connect the stations by drawing a line between them and a train starts running back and forth along it. Problem solved... until another station randomly pops up on the map and you have to connect that as well.As the game goes along more stations pop up and the number of different shapes of stations increase. To combat this you are given more train lines; more trains; more carriages and so on. You have to decide how best to connect all the randomly placed stations with the resources you are given, but eventually you'll get overwhelmed trying to get the right passengers to the right type of station and one of the stations gets too many passengers waiting at it and it's game over. It's all a question of how long you can last and how many passengers you can deliver.It might be a nice little time waster for some people, but I think that the random placement of stations pretty much cancels out most differences between the different maps you're given to play on, and I don't see much fun in trying to connect a bunch of circle stations, that have all randomly appeared adjacent to each other, to the network when nobody at a circle station wants to go to another circle station.

												UhNot too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes insteadIngredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

												Imagine buying diablo and there are only 5 levels of dungeon - As others have said, this game does have a good enjoyable core - but once you break free of that, which is not hard, it gets pretty dull. After 100 or so passengers a day in endless, you stop gaining things. It just keeps going, but you can't aquire any more cars or tracks. And while the design looks clean and simple; there are some very frustrating interactions. want to lay down the red track? first, select the red track then click on a station - oh wait, its laying down a blue track. There are a lot of good things done well in this game - things I really think are worth celebrating - Attentions to details that I find really exciting, and a core concept that is beautiful and elegant. I guess if anything, I would describe this game as such: a finished unfinished game with no updates in months. It's only fault is that there is not enough of it.  "

Each week you are given a choice of upgrades to choose from, and the upgrade you choose can make or break your tube system.

								I really like the concept but unfortunately that’s all it feels like right now: a concept – not even a working beta. I can’t recommend this because it really feels like nothing more than a web-browser game. It is still open beta and it is only like $6 but still I wouldn’t pay $6 for a flash game.Aside from things clearly still in development like sound, more levels, a bunch of options and stuff like that, there’s just no meat to the game. Essentially all you’re doing is dragging lines between dots on the screen not unlike the zillion air traffic controller clones for mobiles. While I’m looking for casual as opposed to a transport simulator, it still needs more to feel like a game. How about currency, pricing, upgradables, a map that zooms out and enlarges as the game progresses, etc.?Don’t get me wrong, the game is fun and super addicting for like 5 or less hours. After that however, there’s just nothing else to do. If you can accept this and have a couple of dollars to burn, go for it. If you are neurotic and have to do simple repetitive tasks to maximize efficiency, play away. If you are looking some actual content or something more than your average free mobile game, I wouldn’t bother. "

								I came across this game through a Let's Play on YouTube and immediately bought it for myself. I really, really wanted to like it. Something like this is right up my alley! Disappointingly, though, I couldn't keep lying to myself and just no longer enjoyed it. In ""Normal"" mode, once you hit 1,000 passengers (even lower on some stages), the difficulty just seems to spike and all of a sudden, multiple (not just one or a few, but like 8) stops suddenly start overflowing, even when my system worked pretty well beforehand, and all of a sudden, my good game comes to a stop. The consistency of this happening caused me to stop playing, sadly. May revisit in the future though.			"

								What is supposed to be fun about this game?  It starts off just telling you to click one place and another to draw a line, but I have no idea what the rules are.  I know the general purpose, you have to connect stations that have a shape and passengers waiting with other shapes to stations that are those shapes, but I don't know why I can't draw a line between certain stations.  Mildly entertaining for about 2 minutes, but if this is supposed to be a puzzle game, I can't figure out how it's meant to be.			"

								I love casual games, but I have to say this game is really boring. I know I haven't put much time in it, but that is because I got bored really quickly.This game feels like a more boring version of ""Pipe Dreams"", which for the younger crowd is a game where you have to build a piping system before liquid would flow and points were rewarded for the length of pipe the water traveled through before flooding out of the pipes.I digress. This game is about setting up a ""metro"" system to pick up shapes and deliver them to a station of the same shape. While you are setting up your ""tracks"" new shapes randomly appear as well as patrons. Those shapes have to be integrated into your system before the patrons get frustrated and leave at which point you lose.The bigger problem I have with this game is that there is no way of planning your system as the shape locations appear at random. There is a way to restructure your system but the interface feels unintuitive and I'm never sure if when I remove tracks/trams that they return to my inventory. From what I can tell - trams do not - and therefore you are punished for a restructure that you couldn't have planned before.This game feels like a mobile game, best experienced on the crapper.I hesitate to say this game is horrible as it has many great reviews, but as a fan of casual games - you can skip this one. Sorry devs.I will give this game more time and if my opinion changes I will update this review.			"

								This game is Better suited for Mobile. It's terribly simple in it's current state. It has some fun replayability to it. It just feels so light on content.  If this was a mobile game i wouldn't hesitate to recomend it for around $5-8. I thought the game would be more about financially managing a subway system and managing passenger loads. It's more of a game that you just manage dots floating around the screen. "

Early Access Review
								Minimalist, conceptually fun transport strategy game, but very buggy and badly designed. Can't accomplish anything with strategy when you spend literally all your time fighting the horrible route interface and the arbitrary, random, nonsensical design decisions that make the game more of a time waster where success is based as much on luck as on skill. I read several strategy guides and managed to make headway in the game, eventually beating all the basic level goals, but it was never enjoyable in any way because the game is so fundamentally broken and badly designed. I prefer strategy games, not luck based time wasters. The game has no sound and I literally had more fun listening to my Solar Fields ambient trance albums in the background than I did playing the game.Some examples:Metro lines frequently refuse all attempts to revise their route for absolutely no reason unless you chop out the ENTIRE line and remake it. This is a huge headache and by itself makes the game unplayable when the randomness requires adaptation. I know you can click the route near a station and then drag over the station to remove that section of the route -- I'm saying that sometimes it simply doesn't work, and for no reason that I can discern. EDIT 6/19/2015 - This was fixed in the last patchNew stations spawn randomly (you cannot build stations) and often in places that make level goals inaccessible (e.g. ""Carry 1000 passengers using only 1 tunnel"" but then new stations keep spawning between 2 rivers and long before the map opens up to give you more route options). Or how about the Hong Kong level goal: Move 1100 passengers with only 8 stations per line. Sounds reasonable, until you recognize that stations often spawn INTO your routes and instantly ruin your entire game on the spot. Or Berlin where you must carry the same huge number of passengers using only 1 locomotive per line. What's that? You say the end of week choices didn't offer you another line to run your end of week locomotive on? Too bad. Hit restart, try again, maybe next time you'll get luckier.Passengers often accumulate at a station with multiple empty trains passing by regularly without picking them up for absolutely no reason (connecting lines properly placed to destination, sometimes destination was even on the same line!) and this is yet more hair pulling insanity because within 30 seconds or so of passengers not being picked up at a station it's BLAM GAME OVER because the game ends the instant people have to wait too long for a train pickup. Why? I have no idea. That's just what the developer chose. Several times I got Game Over despite clearing the passengers out of the station just before the timer ran out. I don't know why. There seems to be no fundamental locational supply and demand for stations (it's all random) and only a tenuous connection between time of day and passenger movements, if there IS any connection. I get that the different geometry icons and the way they evolve independent of the player is designed to simulate a city economy moving and the metro having to adapt to changing demand but in practise the implementation is so scattered, crazy, and random that it makes no sense and is the antithesis of fun to have to deal with. Real world metrorail transport doesn't work this way. Combine this with all the other interface headaches and you'll likely be passionately hating the game before you get too far.These fundamental problems make the game generally unplayable, unenjoyable, and outright annoying, and I could not possibly recommend this pile of disasterous development and unsound design. The fact that the game has no sound has no bearing on the final verdict. It's just bad.---------------UPDATE 6/19/2015I've played this game several more hours and beat all the maps since I wrote this review and I still feel essentially the same. A patch removed the problem with track route not changing but the more I play the more I realize that the main game mode (not endless or extreme) is based almost entirely on luck of the draw with you predestined to fail sooner or later. To get the goals and unlock the extreme modes you have to have some combination of lucky starting position, lucky station spawns, and lucky end week choices. Sure, you need good planning and careful manipulation of the routes on top of that as well, but do you really want to play a game that force fails you based on luck no matter how skilled you are? I don't. I still don't recommend this game unless you like wasting time. It's a decent time waster, but a bad strategy game.			"

WARNING: THIS IS A VERY VERY OLD REVIEW AND IS NO LONGER RELEVANT!I HAVE NOT HAD THE TIME TO PLAY AND REVIEW THIS GAME SINCE THE UPDATE THAT ADDED SOUND!TL;DR: There is NOT ONE SINGLE SOUND in the entire game, which makes it suck.If you are thinking about buying this game then do one thing for me before you do:1) Go up to the video trailer and watch it with the audio muted.Do you like the game without sound?  Well that's what it will probably be like forever!  This game was released nearly two years ago and doesn't even HAVE A TIMELINE for when audio will be added.  This game went from ""fun"" to ""boring"" in about one hour and the primary culprit was the complete lack of audio.Update:The developer responded to me (in detail) about the complications surrounding audio support and gave a projection as to when it should be finished.  I am interested in seeing the result, but time will tell if I change my mind and start recommending it.			"

								I was kind of amazed to find out that there is absolutely no sound whatsoever in this game. Judging by the developer's comments on the forum it looks like there's some holdup with the procedural audio generation which is totally reasonable considering this is Early Access... but not even a single placeholder effect? Really?To add to the confusion, turning the sound on and off is an option in the Main Menu... but it does nothing because there is no sound to turn on or off.Seems like it might be a fun game once it's done, but beware of the developer's estimation that it will be released in ""mid 2015"".

								Feeling more negative than positive at the moment. May change my mind later once it's released proper andsome more changes via updates arrive.Idea is good but can't give it the thumbs up yet.Too many circles keep popping up next to each other [not random at all!].....they make up nearly half the shapes. The loops loop the wrong way on some shapes which then make it impossible to lay other routes over them! Then you get stations popping up on existing routes which are then 'throughplatforms' so trains don't stop there!Would be nice to have levels/goals for each city and to earn the tunnels/bridges/carriage/line quicker than at present.Sound is coming later...so a bit boring without it at the moment.

								Its a pity that this game fails where it could take an interesting concept and make it a great game.There is no ""levels"" so you basically play on the same terrain until you are overwhelmed - I've played to easily over 40+ stations which is *really* crowded on a screen you can't scroll - this game always leaves you with he fealing that you have failed with no chance of an achievement like finally completed London at level one for example.The only real obstacle is a river for which you have a limited number of tunnles - randomly you sometimes can cross one line with another, but this is never explained in any kind of tutorial so who knows what the rules are....!Maybe one day it will have a proper tutorial and some kind of progression, without any sense of progression the game is rather bland and not terribly interesting - a real shame...

								I bought this game thinking it would be a nice way to spend my Sunday afternoon/evening with a bit of a brain puzzle, based on all of the good reviews here.The game only kept me entertained for 29 minutes.  I know the game is supposed to mimic the look of a transit map, but the plain, flat, minimalistic shapes were really boring to look at.  Did not at all put me in mind of moving people from place to place.  These type of visuals might work much better on a mobile device than on a full PC display.I was frustrated that I could not choose the type of upgrade I needed at some points.  When I needed tunnels, it only offered me lines and locomotives.  When I needed lines, it only offered my tunnels and carriages.Trains seemed to drive by passengers for no good reason - train was not full, and destination stop was only one or two stations down the track.  This really affected playability negatively at higher levels.Maybe in a few more iterations this might be fun, but not yet...			"

												Do you enjoy moving little shape people from place to place? Than this might be the game for you!Mini Metro is a cleverly designed (dare I say cute) strategy game based upon public transportation systems. You are tasked to design metro layouts on the fly as your city continues to exponentially grow.Note that I didn’t say simulation game. That’s because at it’s core it isn’t. Mini Metro’s approach is very simple, relieving the player from ticket prices, pan-handlers, collisions or anything that makes real transit systems a nuisance. Don’t come into this game expecting a realistic train simulator by any means. The only objective is to move passengers as efficiently as possible for as long as you can.Session can go indefinitely. The incentive is to reach a curtain high score to unlock new city maps. Passengers are represented by basic shapes. Circles, squares, triangles, etc. Their shape is also an indication as to where they want to go to; as all the locations are basic shapes also. Each map starts off with a few station locations and you simply click and drag out “lines” (tracks) between the points.In the beginning this quite easy but as time goes on and more locations appear it gets more and more challenging as some of the shapes are less common than others. This forces the player to not only work at a local or micro level but work city wide. Making you create new lines across the entire map to ensure the riders can get to their destination.Thankfully the game is forgiving, allowing you to delete, modify and rebuild lines at anytime. This is very nice as a design that may have worked with on a earlier when the city was less complex may no longer work on a complex, city-wide system. If you want more of a challenge this feature can be disabled.Overall I’m very impressed by Mini Metro’s balanced of simplicity and difficulty.			"

												Mini Metro is beautiful and elegant, soothing, but not boring, a challenge, but not imposing. Its visual design, interface and subtle sound are impeccable. The game is simple, intuitive, and excellent value. Minimalist game mechanics may see easily bored players through quickly, but Mini Metro is not so much a game to be completed or finished, as a game to be soaked in. I lost with a sense of satisfaction and ease, and left with a smile. I will be back.Five stars.			"

Early Access Review
								Easy game to pick up and play. No need for a tutorial, controls are simple and intuitive. Difficulty curve becomes a little steep once the game picks up, but sort of reminds you of old school atari games that just keep getting harder. Beatiful interface and the transitions are well designed.Complaints: - Some of the menu transitions or dropdowns are slow, and a little clunky (for example, clicking on the clock in-game to change the time).- No messages informing you of problems when placing lines. New players might not understand that they are out of tunnels, or why their line is otherwise being rejected.- No way (or at least no simple way) to choose the direction of a new locomotive. - New stations, especially well into a game are easy to overlook. If that isn't by design, a clearer sound notification or an outline or something might be of use.Commendations:- Very smooth feel. Hardly any ""loading"" or time when you aren't doing something.- Simple layout that still conveys all the info you need.- Calming, relaxing music that fits well with the game.- Variety of map options that mix up gameplay without actually changing the mechanics of the game.Has plenty of potential for community workshop maps. Also looks like it would only take a bit of tweaking to work great on mobile.The price is a little steep for a game with arguably little content. If you already have a game to play, might want to wait for a sale. Otherwise, go for it.			"

												For such a simple game, there is a lot of strategy packed into it. Minimalistic graphics prevent distractions from the real purpose of the game: create a subway layout that is efficient. Using only the three starting lines, you must adapt and quickly change based on where new stops open up. Easy to play, difficult to master. I like becauseupon opening the game for the first time, it puts you in control immediately. You must learn on the go. If you want easy to win, this isn't for you. While challenging, it is simple enough that anyone can pick it up in the matter of a few minutes.			"

								Mini Metro's in Early Access, so what I say in this review might change. Nevertheless, I hope it stays relevant!When I first got Mini Metro, I assumed it'd be similar to games like Train Simulator, or SimCity. And it is, to a certain extent. But it also isn't. Mini Metro is packed with a very minimal design, a beautiful colour scheme, and a very intuitive interface. It just looks... smooth. It opts for a very clean, non-distractive interface, which is welcoming for a casual game to play.			"

								This is one of those fantastic little games that starts off seemingly so simple yet swiftly escalates into a frantic scramble to keep everything going as things get ever more complex and demanding, and perfectly nails that 'just one more go' addictiveness.  It may seem a tad overpriced for such a minimalist game, but it's well worth picking up and can easily swallow scary amounts of time without you realising it, very much recomended.			"

So now I get to make my own lines and help folks on their way to work, museums, or a restaurant. It feels very therapeutic coming up with a better strategy for every playthough; such as re-routing and upgrading the lines.Pick this up if you want a challenging but relaxing casual game to mess around in.You won't be disappointed.

												In short, probably the best game you will ever play about drawing lines to get that circle to the square.Mini Metro is an action puzzle game. Probably the closest comparison to it is the amazing Trauma Centre.I have been playing this game since the late stages of its early access. Unlike most early access games, it was playable and fun from an early stage. It didn't have music for the longest time, and honestly, probably still doesn't need it, although it does add to the experience.Oh, and in case you care, it does the daily challenge thing every indie game does now.

												Do you enjoy moving little shape people from place to place? Than this might be the game for you!Mini Metro is a cleverly designed (dare I say cute) strategy game based upon public transportation systems. You are tasked to design metro layouts on the fly as your city continues to exponentially grow.Note that I didn’t say simulation game. That’s because at it’s core it isn’t. Mini Metro’s approach is very simple, relieving the player from ticket prices, pan-handlers, collisions or anything that makes real transit systems a nuisance. Don’t come into this game expecting a realistic train simulator by any means. The only objective is to move passengers as efficiently as possible for as long as you can.Session can go indefinitely. The incentive is to reach a curtain high score to unlock new city maps. Passengers are represented by basic shapes. Circles, squares, triangles, etc. Their shape is also an indication as to where they want to go to; as all the locations are basic shapes also. Each map starts off with a few station locations and you simply click and drag out “lines” (tracks) between the points.In the beginning this quite easy but as time goes on and more locations appear it gets more and more challenging as some of the shapes are less common than others. This forces the player to not only work at a local or micro level but work city wide. Making you create new lines across the entire map to ensure the riders can get to their destination.Thankfully the game is forgiving, allowing you to delete, modify and rebuild lines at anytime. This is very nice as a design that may have worked with on a earlier when the city was less complex may no longer work on a complex, city-wide system. If you want more of a challenge this feature can be disabled.Overall I’m very impressed by Mini Metro’s balanced of simplicity and difficulty.			"

								Mini Metro is simple. Draw some lines, connect some dots, and make your own mass transit system. As your citizens become more complex, as do your challenges. But, simple doesn't mean easy or boring. The simplicity lends to the game's elegant aesthetic. There are different color schemes to match your preferences and even pander to the colorblind audience. ""Simply"" put, it's a beautiful game. Minesweeper is simple, but if you throw yourself on Expert and try to get a score under 60 seconds, you'll want to pull your hair out.It's already a smart, fun, and beautiful game that shows promise of ""taking you even farther"" with it's awaited final release.

												I was hesitating to buy this game and kept it on the wishlist for a longer while, as it seemed expensive. When the Summer Sale came, I decided to buy something I really wanted to play. I felt like a transport sim, but Cities in Motiton didn't get good reviews, while Cities:Skylines were not cheap enough for me. Therefore I had only one choice within my budget and - to my surprise - It seems to be one of the best games for me in my collection!First off, one of my favourite games of all time are: - FTL - a more or less typical rougelike with significant strategy portion - Transport Tycoon / Locomotion series - where one of the main tasks is to build efficient networksCombine the two above and you get MiniMetro :).I'm a busy guy, and I don't have more than a couple of hours every day to play games. Therefore I turn more and more frequently to short games, that I can finish in a day or two, with high replay value. Mini Metro fits this description perfectly. Randomly generated stations are always a challenge (fourth circle or triange station in a condensed area drive me nuts!), while variety of cities encourage to try different strategies. I hope the descriptions will be added soon, although discovering the differences is also a kind of fun.One can look at the game as 100 years of a city growth condensed to 15-30 minutes. There are no resources - every ""week"" you get something to expand your network. It might seem strange, that you can re-rout your trains in any possible way. That way the creators avoided making the game extremely difficult - fortunately the ""extreme"" mode exist, adding that piece of realism for hardcore city transport organizers.With such minimalistic design, there is a lot of room for immersion. It's very easy to imagine that triangle and circle station represent every day destinations, like work/home/market. Square is probably a railway station or airport - unique but important. Then there is a bunch of unique ones, that can easily translate to a football stadium, hospital, or other touristic attactions. Even with no sound, you can hear all those crowds, looking at the train with six symbols - each representing a traveller and his destination.One of the best things about this game is the fact, that you are 100% focused on the core - designing the network as efficiently as possible. You don't have to waste more than a few seconds to build the route or add/move trains. If Transport Tycoon was simplified to a white board and lines with rectangles instead of detailed tracks and trains, you could finish the game in a fraction of usual time.Overall - GREAT game! I was not expecting that much from such small game.It's still early access and the devs are working hard to finish it - updates/hotfixes are frequent.FULL VERSION UPDATE: EVEN MORE AWESOME!!!			"

												I don't have many hours in this game on Steam, mostly because I have it on mobile and I often play it when I'm waiting for appointments and sitting in traffic. I have, however, still played enough on Steam to know that there's no true difference between the two versions.This game is an example of a casual game done right. It's a game you can just pick up and play. You don't learn through lengthy text tutorials, but rather through visual cues and your own personal experimentation. It's fun and relaxing, but also presents a challenge. Its difficulty scales over time, and eventually, you will lose.This game is a must for any casual gamer, but I recommend it to gamers of any description. Everyone needs to relax sometimes - even the most hardcore gamer. It's like having a little sand garden on your desk, but with a really chill soundtrack accompanying it.			"

It's one of those rare ones that can be picked up whenever you just have a little time and quickly played as well as when you have lots of time to beat a high score ;). The game is simple to comprehend but has extreme depth and requires a lot of foresight when planning routes (or the will to reorganize your whole network if things start to get ugly later).The moment I saw the first screenshots of this game I knew I needed to have it - lucky for us all it turned out that the creators knew how to deliver a great implementation, too!

												Beautifully-designed game. Literally perfect UI. Looks easy at first but then rapidly builds to become engrossing and complex. Daily challenges to see how you fair against others worldwide. Also good value.Games take 10-15 minutes. Ideal for people that like strategy/puzzle games or appreciate wondeful design.			"

I believe the £6.25 (It was on a 10% sale) price tag is more than reasonable for this game due to its numerous game-modes and very nice and clean art scheme. I feel this is a game has the beauty of anyone being able to pick it up and I think that if you are looking for a simple strategy game or a cheap game to pass the time, I would highly recommend it! :D			"

								Mini Metro is amazing value for money, for me at least. I have played 15+ hours so far and this game does something that not many other early access games do for me, it keeps bringing me back to see what’s new every month. It’s great for podcasts or just being in the background while you do something else in endless mode and also great if you want to really knuckle down and strategize. The art style is ok, nothing unique for a minimalistic game, but definitely not dull. The is no music and it has been promised since the game came out. To be honest, my play time will probably double with an amazing soundtrack. The leaderboard aspect of the game is great, should be a standard in most games in my opinion. The unlock system is actually pretty cool, they use the same formula for each tier of unlock, but the fact the dev realises the difficulty level of each map by the amount of things you have to accomplish really shows how much testing has happened behind the scenes and how much they pay attention to the data and the community which is refreshing to say the least nowadays. So I’m going to give this game a 7/10 purely because lack of music, otherwise a solid 9/10.			"

												This puzzle game is surprisingly very soothing.  The music is procedurally generated and is mostly made up of subway beeps and tweeting birds.  When you hit the Game Over screen, the music just fades away as the sound of waves plays over the effect.  Aesthetically, it’s also very soothing, even though Colorblind Mode tends to put the most obnoxious yellow against a white background that makes it barely visible.  Gameplay is very simple and kind of therapeutic.  This is one of the few puzzle games where I didn’t find myself swearing at the game when they would change something up to make it more challenging.I definately recommend this game, especially if you want to play a low-stress time-killer puzzle game.

Early Access Review
								Stumbled upon this game when thumbing through the minimalistic genre. As it happens I have become quite a fan of it. Let me give a quick rundown of what happens here:* you select a map to play on* stations appear on the map* passengers appear at the stations with various destinations in mind* these stations all require the player to connect via transport lines* as time runs on, things get more hectic, more stations appear with more passengers..etcStations are denoted by shapes. Passengers appear next to the stations as a shape which tells where they want to go. For example a square station with a triangle passenger shows up you need to shuttle them to the nearest triangle station. As time goes on you will have many triangle stations on your map. The passenger does not care which triangle station you let them off on. This means the most efficient lines have all different shapes on them. Connecting a bunch of triangles together in one line is not really a good idea. Passengers that are waiting at a triangle station will never be triangle, so having the next three stations in your line be triangle is not efficient. They will ride the train until they reach their correct station, or wait at that station until the connection can be made by getting off on a station with multiple line connections that eventually lead to their destination. (basically like a hub station) This is where it gets tricky. The shapes on the map can change over time. Special shapes also appear that are rare. This means that you will undoubtedly have only one line that reaches a special shape. This will cause a buildup at the hub ""interchange"" station which for me usually ends up to be the square shape. There are many ways to play the game. Hopefully that short explanation will help new players get into the game.There are resources, in that you have a limited number of train lines, trains, passenger cars, and tunnels to traverse different map layouts that have bodies of water. You can also control the time by pausing it (which is very helpful later on in the game) or by speeding it up. It appears to me that both the stations and passengers at the station are generated randomly on the map. I am not that good at this game but maps generally last about 5-15 minutes before game over. It can get to be hectic toward the end of a round, where pausing and micromanagement comes in if you want to move 2000+ passengers before game over. This can be obtained by reworking lines, moving passenger cars and trains around, etc. You can even pick up a train and toss it back down in another direction if one half of your line is getting crowded.For a quick technical run down, this game appears to use the Unity engine, and currently uses less than 300MB of disk space. The game runs fine on Windows 10. The interface is clean and modern with large readable text. (thanks for that) The game users colors in an important way to denote lines/trains and includes a color blindness mode. The game is quite minimalistic from a graphical standpoint, using solid colors and thankfully has a night mode. Night mode dims the color palette which is amazing as I usually play this game at the evening hours in low light conditions. All good stuff here.I am no expert but here are some early tips on playing the game:* you can ""loop"" in new stations by dragging a nearby line to connect it* you can redraw a line by moving around either end of the line where there is a T marker* you can delete a line by selecting the color swatch at the bottom of the screen* you cannot cross lines when out in the open away from a station* trains and carriages can be moved from one line to another (you can even remove all trains from a line)* same as above and you can place the train back down going in the opposite direction* try to make sure lines do not have the same shaped station connected in a row* don't forget special station shapes and make sure multiple lines can see them* keep on the lookout for shapes in your line to change, this happens and can go unnoticed* spacebar key will pause and resume the gameC = circleS = squareT = triangle(the most common shapes are C and T, S being less common and specials not included into below basic examples)Example of good lines:  CST, CTCSTCT, TCTSCTCExample of bad lines: CCC, CSCCCCT, TSTCTTTTThe good idea above is to try and center the SQUARE station so it isn't all the way at the end of a line. It is a semi-rare station so on a long line it is helpful to have in the middle ground. Also note the rotation between common shapes, this allows trains to dump the passengers right off at the next station. The bad line has connections of same shaped stations together, with the semi-rare SQUARE at the far end of a line. It gets much more complicated as the game runs on but hopefully this helps explain the idea.Glad I purchased this game, and thanks to the developer for making it![edited in full review content]			"

								I think this game is really neat. It's quick and fun to learn, it's certainly a nice departure from the twitch shooters  and bigger strategy games. I like having something like this to pass the time, it'll go for however long you'd like it to or are able to service the passengers.  I get the same kick out of this as games like eufloria, its visually pleasing and calm, yet hectic at the same time. I suggest the nighttime mode, it's just a darker paint scheme but I rather like it.			"

								When I first got Mini Metro it was in very early stages of the game and ever since then it has kept on improving.

								I haven't played Mini Metro for months. Not because I thought it was ...meh... but more because I overplayed it when I picked it up the moment it was available on Steam.Today I've played it again and I like the changes/additions to the game. One of the best additions are the (big) interexchange hubs added to the game. This way the stations 'survive' longer with the large numbers of passengers. Also the addition of achievements was very surprising.Sadly still no sound though for the game. I surely hope that'll come SOON™...			"

								This is a game that I will play for the rest of my life. I really love the originality and simplicity of the concept. The user interface is nice. If I were to mention any complaint it would only be that a few of the updates seem to be a step in the wrong direction, although they don't ruin the playability of the game. It's not critical, but I would like to see some sort of multi-player in the future and am expecting the achievements to develop as the game moves along. Thank you, makers of this wonderful subway management game.			"

								This game isn't so much a transportation network simulation as it is a subtle puzzle game. The key to sucess is to not overload your lines with the same symbols next to each other because that will cause stations to be backed up. Make sure to stagger the symbols! (triangle-circle-triangle is good, triangle-triangle-circle is bad.) This is easier said than done because many times you will have no choice but to have four circles in a row on one line.The second secret is always retool your lines as you play the level. More stations are added as the game plays out, and you will find what worked for the first 300 passengers all of a sudden isn't as efficient and you have to clear the lines and re-lay them out for the next 300.There's a lot of strategy in this game, from how you lay out the map to what bonuses you get every level. I've just sat here and played through all levels for the past five hours and even went back and replayed a couple of early levels that I didn't do so well because I hadn't figured out the system yet. This is a fun game!This game is low on flash and high on substance, it's a must have for anyone who loves puzzle strategy games!			"

												Mini Metro is a minimalistic casual game that's great fun. The goal is simple: you manage a subway system starting with only three stops, and see that it succeeds as the number of stops grows. Rather than being a subway simulator, the game is a simplified, more gamey version of that. Each week, you get additional resources (extra subway lines, passenger cars, etc.) to help you. The passengers keep coming faster and faster, stops will gradually be added or changed, and when you get too many passengers for too long at one stop with your limited resources, you lose! Each game is perhaps 10-30 minutes depending on how good and how thourough you are (you can pause time to lay down lines more strategically at any time). There are a couple different modes to change how difficult the game is. The gameplay is fairly addictive, and the acheivements add interesting new challenges to each level. Hopefully the Overwhelmingly Positive review rate also makes you give it a look.Also, it's great to play on a tablet!			"

												Bought this game in early access and since then it's gone from strength to strength. It's so beautifully minimalistic but with a lot of depth to it. It's possibly one of the best puzzle games I have ever played and continue to enjoy. With leaderboards, daily maps that you can only play once (making them frustratingly difficult), and steam achievements, the amount of gameplay you get for your money is astounding. Every choice that you make in this game seems to be huge; One wrong decision can render your game over. This makes the game frustrating but hugely addictive. Would definately recommend to anyone.

								The game is very simple but that's it's charm. But I think there are descriptions missing to explain what which ""item"" does. Also a little notice that the time can be altered. This option saved my metro a lot of times and it's very helpful if you want to reconstruct your metro. Unfortunately, I only figured that out by accident.Nevertheless, Mini Metro is very addicting. It's  a game you can play for a few hours every now and then and it makes fun because at some points it is quite challenging even though it's not too hard either. Besides, stopping the time makes everything much easyier during critical times. ;)			"

												The game is addictive in part to the simplistic nature of it's graphics and premise.   The goal is simply to connect the geometric shapes with lines to keep the transit cars efficiently moving the passengers to their correct shapes.   The maps are reflects of different global cities, and each one presents different challenges to keep the commute flowing.This is a great game to wind down from playing a FPS or other intense action game, or if you only have 20 minutes to kill.  I definitely recommend having this game in your library.			"

												Although I've played it a fair bit over the past few days, I can't fully recommend Mini Metro.It uses the theme of a subway and subway map, but the experience of drawing subway lines doesn't feel close to that. New nodes pop up sort of randomly and every day the subway gets a little busier, until a single station gets overcrowded. The mechanics, such as not being able to cross your own tracks, except at a station, and the fact that every train *must* stop at each connected station, make it hard to recreate traditional subway lay-outs, such as local vs. express trains. In the end, Instead of a making a system that's easily navigable, you're optimising it for mathematical constraints, and often end up with a sytem that's incredibly gerrymandered and Kafkaesque, rather than something a sane person would want to navigate.The result is that  during too few moments do you feel that you're running a public transport system, even in the abstract. It ends up a, somewhat interesting, puzzler where you're trying to optimise for mathematical constraints with a little ""transport sauce"" poured over it. Although the various maps have their own little quirks, almost none of them display true character, nor do the differences affect gameplay much, with possibly the exception of Osaka, where you get the use of ""Shinkansen"" trains. As a result, as it is, Metro Mini hardly makes a difference  playing London, Sao Paulo or any other city. You could just as well be playing on some randomly-generated map.All-in-all: an abstract puzzler with some limited appeal, but best avoided if you want some semblance of realism.Overall: 5/10The designers should've either gone for more realism, or ditch all the references to real-life and keep it a fully abstract puzzler. Now fans of neither genre get what they could have had.			"

This makes it awkward as if you need to change something in the settings you have to quit and you lose your progress, so maybe progress should be able to be saved or have options accessible in game. Overall, however, the game runs brilliantly, so overall i would rate it 9/10.			"

								Simple in its design and interface, yet fun and challenging to play.  So much so that I can't put it down!  The design of playing the game on a traditional subway map rather than a real-world representation (e.g., Sid Meier's Railroads) is just plain brilliant.  It's still classified as an early access game, but aside from sound and music, it appears to be ready for prime time.			"

								Great game with strategy. Its simple to learn, but hard to master. At this moment in time there is no sound, so if the dead silence of the game bothers you, I would recommend buying it at a later date.			"

								Less is more, and that is definitely true for this game. It's a puzzle strategy where to use the available metro resources in order to serve every station, and every customer on those stations. I really enjoy this game in between boring stuff, just to get a little excitement.It's not a game one can play for hours on end, to try and try again, but it is an excellent change of pace and brainteazer to lighten up dull moments.

								Public Transport can be horrible. Especially trains. Most people say: ""I can do a much better job at that!"" Well, lets see if you canThis is a game where you control the London underground, exept it's not always in London. It could be Auckland, New York or even Paris! The developers - Dinosaur Polo - are always open for ideas, so if you don't like something (how?) it would be fixed.The controls can be a bit dodgy, removing a station for example isn't as easy as it sounds. You get upgrades every Sunday which allow you to:Add a carriage (max 3)Add a train ( max 3 I believe)Increase the amount of tunnels/bridgesAdd a line ( max 7, start with 3)and more!The game comes with 2 modes, with one coming soon:CommuterScenicRush hour (to be added)Commuter is the normal, standard, frustrating gameScenic, you can't lose. You get points by how many passengers use your metro per weekRush hour will probably be a ery intense commuter modeIn the game we have four types of stations:Circle (common)Triangle (uncommon)Square (rare)Special (very rare)Even though some are rarer then others, you will get at least one of these each game. The map is randomly generated however, so you never know where they will spawn.That should finish my review. I do reccomend this game and rating out of 100 would be:                                                                   97.5/100 "

								This is an absolutely glorious little game. I can see myself just wasting hours and hours watching those little trains run around in scenic mode. Also scenic mode is good because you can pull the whole map apart and start again. Fabulous. Commuter mode is a great mix of challenging and casual. You can look away for a few seconds and not be stressed that everything is going to blow up. I can't wait for sounds and music I just hope the music will ust amplify the whole casual feel this has got about it.			"

								This game can be summed up in a two words.Frustratingly Awesome. THe idea behind it is to create a mini metro network between stations, or shapes as they are in this game, and deliver the right shapes to their respective stations. The shapes will change trains, from one line to another until they reach their destination.You can stretch your lines aslong as you want, but be warned, doing so will decrease your abiltiy to collect passengers quickly as each line is limited to four trains.The challenge of the game is great, having to wait till the end of the week to top up your supplies is very challenging, especially when you get close to having all 8 lines running, those extra carriages can be lifesavers.I highly recommend this game, and if it can get any better Im eagerly awaiting the full release from the developers.

								Just a crazy simple, beautiful, extremely polished strategy game.Place metro lines to connect stations that randomly appear as you play.  That's basically it.  You have a limited number of lines, a limited number trains and cars to place on your lines, and a limited number of tunnels to cross water, each of which you recieve more of as you play.  You can place and delete and rearrange your lines and trains as much as you want for no cost (and there is a tactical pause).  All you have to do is keep getting polygonal people to their polygonal destinations smoothly as long as you can, while the number of stations and passengers keeps increasing.Although the game is still in early access, this is really an incredibly polished game (the only thing missing is sound, which I don't mind).  It looks clean an modern and beautiful, it has a lovely UI and menu system... it's extremely clear and easy to use.  I've spent several hours playing it so far, and I definitely intend to play more... it is a great casual game - easy to pick up, with short self-contained sessions - but it also has some real depth.  You can put a lot of thought into your metro designs, or you can just throw something down and watch what happens.  It's quite flexible in terms of ways to play.  Each map/level/city also offers unique constraints and layouts (semi randomized each time of course), and the difficulty of the levels ranges from hold-my-hand to crushingly difficult, giving you access to all of them immediately, so you can explore your ability and comfort level from the beginning, and aspire to those harder cities.The only negative thing I can think of to say about the game is that I wouldn't want to sit and play it for hours straight.  It's more of a pick-up put-down game.  Also, there is no tutorial, and while the UI is relatively straight forward, understanging the princples of the game might take you a couple minutes and/or google searches.  Hopefully a tutorial will be added soon :)Highly recommended!  I think this has a lot of appeal for a lot of different types of people.			"

								You'll know exactly what I mean when I say that sometimes, you just want a fun, simple game that you can sit down and play for half an hour before daily life resumes. This game fills that role perfectly, artistically, and like it was designed for that express purpose. I find I can't really get invested in this game. I can play for a half-hour before I get bored, but that's fine, because that's really all I NEED to play. I can sit down, beat one of the cities, and resume my daily life.The game has you designing underground metro train systems for major cities, the likes of which include Hong Kong, New York, and Sao Paulo. The colorful little graphics are incredibly soothing, coupled with the calm background music. The game definitely does get frustrating at times, especially when you run out of bridges or your line doesn't work correctly. However, it teaches you to find a way to move past that. It's almost a puzzle game, but not really. If I had to classify it, I'd put it in the casual strategy category.I actually cannot think of any cons that this game has. It is early access, and man, for an early access game, it's amazing. I tend to associate 'early access' with 'broken, unfinished and poorly-optimized', but this goes against all of those stereotypes. I have found exactly zero glitches, and the game doesn't feel unfinished, - perhaps constantly-growing is the right word. I'd love to see more cities, maybe a bus element, I'm not sure. I'll leave that part up to the developers.]Overall, yes, I do recommend this game. And for the modest price of $7.79, why not?			"

												It's a gorgeous Thursday morning. You're up earlier than usual, with a spring in your step and a song in your heart. You're daily commute lies along the District Light Rail, an overground train through the outskirts of London. Perhaps not the most spectacular view, but certainly a step up from the 'scenic' grey of the underground. You've arrived a few minutes before the train is scheduled, giving you time to glance around the station.You see a few people standing, arms crossed, seemingly scowling at the thin air in front of them. You can't empathize their gloomy mood; it's too nice a day. Far in the distance you see the train stop at the station before yours, but with only a few people at this station, you make no rush to stake out a spot.You realize your error much too late as the coming train pulls into the station. From end-to-end the rail is packed with people, and none are getting off. They've staked their spot to take them all the way back into London, with you stuck in the station until the next one comes. Of course, it is only the one train, right? Surely this one is only packed because of the rush hour commute. Your mood sours only a little as the train takes off without you, but your spirits are lifted by the rays of sunshine washing over the land....Several hours later, as you stand white knuckled and dripping with sweat, you pray this train will finally have some space. Your boss has called numerous times to angrily inquire as to your tardiness, and you fear your job may well be on the line if you don't show up soon. The station is now full of grumbling, groaning, greasy, grumpy Gus', and you bitterly realize you're just another one of the bunch. As you push back all the people clambering to the front of the line, you hear a horrified wail from the near end of the station. Your heart sinks rapidly as the approaching train audibly rolls into the stop, carrying with it what must be the entire London populus.The station, now eerily quiet collectively holds it's breath, hoping, praying that there is space for them on that train. The doors open, and to your surprise, the entire station politely lets off the passengers. Well, just the one passenger, actually. A lone man, who upon exiting the train notices the unsettling silence that has enveloped the station. He clears his way slowly through the throng of people who watch as he goes by, eventually reaching the exit and leaving them behind.A shout from the back of ""IT'S MINE!"" breaks the deadlock, and suddenly you and everyone else are clambering to make your way onto the train. The passengers already aboard are terrified, the train itself begins to violently rock back and forth from the wave of people crashing into it. Alarms blare in the din of it all, set off by the dislodging of the train from the tracks, but no one seems to care. It's not about getting to work, or making it to the restaurant for your date, or getting home before the kids set fire to everything. It's about getting on the train.A loud bang echoes from nearby, and screams soon follow suit. An elderly man, clearly fed up with public transit system set up, begins to open fire with a handgun. You seem him blindly firing into the crowd, hitting men, women, children, all like fish in a barrel. Time seems to slow down as you watch the carnage unfold, people dying right in front of you, family trees uprooted with a single bullet. You try to turn and run, but you can't peel yourself away from the carnage and terror that has taken place. As you take one last look at the shooter, you find yourself staring straight into his eyes as he pulls the trigger. And as the blood drips down your forhead, you notice just how pretty the sun looks when tinted with red on this goreous Thursday morning.So for all of you hotshot's who think this is just another game, remember: This is what happens when you let your stations get overcrowded. 10/10			"

								Easy game to pick up and play. No need for a tutorial, controls are simple and intuitive. Difficulty curve becomes a little steep once the game picks up, but sort of reminds you of old school atari games that just keep getting harder. Beatiful interface and the transitions are well designed.Complaints: - Some of the menu transitions or dropdowns are slow, and a little clunky (for example, clicking on the clock in-game to change the time).- No messages informing you of problems when placing lines. New players might not understand that they are out of tunnels, or why their line is otherwise being rejected.- No way (or at least no simple way) to choose the direction of a new locomotive. - New stations, especially well into a game are easy to overlook. If that isn't by design, a clearer sound notification or an outline or something might be of use.Commendations:- Very smooth feel. Hardly any ""loading"" or time when you aren't doing something.- Simple layout that still conveys all the info you need.- Calming, relaxing music that fits well with the game.- Variety of map options that mix up gameplay without actually changing the mechanics of the game.Has plenty of potential for community workshop maps. Also looks like it would only take a bit of tweaking to work great on mobile.The price is a little steep for a game with arguably little content. If you already have a game to play, might want to wait for a sale. Otherwise, go for it.			"

								Fun, little game. Sort of logical thinking, problem solving one. Not much to do with a real metro, i guess.... So if you're looking for metro-building sim, it's not it. Nevertheless, it's good for short bursts, nothing that will engage you for hours.  If you fancy logic games, offcourse.			"

												I'm gonna have to jump on the ""there has to be a neutral review option"" bandwagon here. I'm not going to praise or describe the game much, so if you want a detailed review, go read someone else's.My review is positive in that this game well deserves a try. It's just that it sh!ts me off how the game is not awarding me achievements that I should definitely have gotten. It's really frustrating having to sit through 20 minutes of intense thinking and planning and find out at the end of those 20 minutes that the game thinks you screwed up 19 minutes ago already. (You'll see what I mean when you go achievement hunting yourself.)You want an enjoyable experience with this game? Ignore the achievements. At least until they get their act together and fix their criteria for them.			"

												I have played very little of this game (to date), but it has been sat on my Wishlist for 2 years, and I have known about it since just after the idea for Mini Metro was conceived.First of all, go buy this game.It is incredibly cheap for infinite amount of fun. It's like the PC equivalent of a good mobile game. No wait-timers. No microtransactions. Nothing fiddly. Just a simple concept, that is executed to perfection.I would however, recommend having something else to do whilst you play. Maybe watch Netflix. Maybe have Sky Go on in the background. Maybe listen to a podcast. Maybe watch some YouTube! Maybe buy all your friends copies of this fantastic little game.The reason I say it's fantastic and that everyone should buy it, is because I believe everyone could get something out of this. Whether it be a way to relax, a fun puzzle game, an intense management game, or a way to kill time, I think anyone and everyone can, and should, get some enjoyment from this wonderful little ball of trains.

												Simple: Draw metro tracks and choose how many trains go to each. No budgets, no construction time, etc.Calming: In normal mode, you lose once the metro stations start getting backed up. This prevents the game from getting hectic which makes it a nice game for destressing. It also has a minimalist interface with a calm sound scheme.Complex: While you could play it as a casual game, it's not merely a ""casual"" game. When I first started, I played it like a casual game. ""New station pops up? I'll connect the nearest metro line to it. It'd look a lot prettier if the line was more symmetrical."" You can do that, but you score in the bottom 25%. Then I realized, there is actually a ton of strategic depth to this game despite its casual appearance. Each time I play I realize new strategic factors in things that seemed like they didn't matter before. Now I'm in the top 10%. So, I think it's fair to saying it's more than a casual game. You can play it ""casually"" but you can also play it ""seriously"", analyzing every tiny detail.			"

												Quite possible one of the best small strategy games I've ever played, this beautiful and almost calming game seems to never get boring. With its modern, simplistic gameplay, you create subway lines in different cities around the world, and while doing that, also create music with the tracks, trains, and passengers on your metro lines. This game achieves what so many other, minimalistic games fail at: Staying fun and engaging while at the same time keeping true to the core idea of the game. This game is simple to learn, yet challenging enough to keep me coming back for more. I love it!			"

								Stumbled upon this game when thumbing through the minimalistic genre. As it happens I have become quite a fan of it. Let me give a quick rundown of what happens here:* you select a map to play on* stations appear on the map* passengers appear at the stations with various destinations in mind* these stations all require the player to connect via transport lines* as time runs on, things get more hectic, more stations appear with more passengers..etcStations are denoted by shapes. Passengers appear next to the stations as a shape which tells where they want to go. For example a square station with a triangle passenger shows up you need to shuttle them to the nearest triangle station. As time goes on you will have many triangle stations on your map. The passenger does not care which triangle station you let them off on. This means the most efficient lines have all different shapes on them. Connecting a bunch of triangles together in one line is not really a good idea. Passengers that are waiting at a triangle station will never be triangle, so having the next three stations in your line be triangle is not efficient. They will ride the train until they reach their correct station, or wait at that station until the connection can be made by getting off on a station with multiple line connections that eventually lead to their destination. (basically like a hub station) This is where it gets tricky. The shapes on the map can change over time. Special shapes also appear that are rare. This means that you will undoubtedly have only one line that reaches a special shape. This will cause a buildup at the hub ""interchange"" station which for me usually ends up to be the square shape. There are many ways to play the game. Hopefully that short explanation will help new players get into the game.There are resources, in that you have a limited number of train lines, trains, passenger cars, and tunnels to traverse different map layouts that have bodies of water. You can also control the time by pausing it (which is very helpful later on in the game) or by speeding it up. It appears to me that both the stations and passengers at the station are generated randomly on the map. I am not that good at this game but maps generally last about 5-15 minutes before game over. It can get to be hectic toward the end of a round, where pausing and micromanagement comes in if you want to move 2000+ passengers before game over. This can be obtained by reworking lines, moving passenger cars and trains around, etc. You can even pick up a train and toss it back down in another direction if one half of your line is getting crowded.For a quick technical run down, this game appears to use the Unity engine, and currently uses less than 300MB of disk space. The game runs fine on Windows 10. The interface is clean and modern with large readable text. (thanks for that) The game users colors in an important way to denote lines/trains and includes a color blindness mode. The game is quite minimalistic from a graphical standpoint, using solid colors and thankfully has a night mode. Night mode dims the color palette which is amazing as I usually play this game at the evening hours in low light conditions. All good stuff here.I am no expert but here are some early tips on playing the game:* you can ""loop"" in new stations by dragging a nearby line to connect it* you can redraw a line by moving around either end of the line where there is a T marker* you can delete a line by selecting the color swatch at the bottom of the screen* you cannot cross lines when out in the open away from a station* trains and carriages can be moved from one line to another (you can even remove all trains from a line)* same as above and you can place the train back down going in the opposite direction* try to make sure lines do not have the same shaped station connected in a row* don't forget special station shapes and make sure multiple lines can see them* keep on the lookout for shapes in your line to change, this happens and can go unnoticed* spacebar key will pause and resume the gameC = circleS = squareT = triangle(the most common shapes are C and T, S being less common and specials not included into below basic examples)Example of good lines:  CST, CTCSTCT, TCTSCTCExample of bad lines: CCC, CSCCCCT, TSTCTTTTThe good idea above is to try and center the SQUARE station so it isn't all the way at the end of a line. It is a semi-rare station so on a long line it is helpful to have in the middle ground. Also note the rotation between common shapes, this allows trains to dump the passengers right off at the next station. The bad line has connections of same shaped stations together, with the semi-rare SQUARE at the far end of a line. It gets much more complicated as the game runs on but hopefully this helps explain the idea.Glad I purchased this game, and thanks to the developer for making it![edited in full review content]			"

It's really beautiful in its simplicity, and you can lose a proportionally large amount of time to it (it's one of those ""has it been two hours ALREADY?"" games). However, it may be a little TOO simple; don't expect to have many hours on it for a while. On the whole, though, I would reccommend it. It's a nice, relaxed little game in the midst of incredibly intense experiences like Battlefield and Call of Duty. A good repose.			"

A simple concept executed well...'Take passengers from one station to another before stations overcrowd and shut down' sounds so simple.  Add in the different shapes (types of passenger) and per-city limitations on the number of lines, trains, carriages and tunnels - and suddenly a simple concept becomes a very tactical strategy puzzle.The Steam Achievements have been well thought out - the first tier are pretty easy (Deliver X passengers in Y), the second tier vary from moderate to fiendish (for example, ""Deliver 1500 passengers in Auckland using no more than two tunnels"" has a 0.3% success rate so far) and will certainly result in some frustration... before you start another game anyway!It's a game that can be played for 15 minutes, or for a few hours at a time.  As well as the normal game mode, the endless mode allows you to focus on optimal configurations (as stations cannot overcrowd) and the extreme mode forces you to think even further ahead as you cannot revert changes!The random nature of each game is a mixed blessing - it provides replay value but occasionally will give you games that are frustratingly difficult (such as large clusters of circle stations together).  Thankfully those levels can be predicted early on so you can abandon them and start again if you wish.£6.99 / €9.99 / $9.99 might be towards the top end of pricing for a game such as this, but it offers considerable replay value.  Additionally, the developer provides a link to his Trello board in the news updates, which provides insight into what new features may be coming in the future.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine  PLEASE NOTE: This review is/was written when this game was in/is still in Early Access. Think twice before buying/playing this game Ever since I was a young lad, I always was amazed with trains, especially with the London Underground, and Mini Metro does bring that sense of creating your own train system to life!Usually I don't buy early access games, as I feel that I am worried that if something happens, all my money is wasted. I also usually don't buy early access games because either they are unstable or broken and are not fixed or may cause problems. However, with Mini Metro and other early access games like Prison Architect, I really feel that Dinosaur Polo Club know what they are doing, they constantly update the game and the game is very friendly with its players.The game is not easy and can sometimes frustrate you with the way the trains work, however, it is a fun game to play and can sink many hours in gameplay time!The music (which has been added recently) is absolutely beautiful and the sound effects that play along with the music really rhyme together pretty well!Obviously this game does have bugs and some glitches, but through my playtime I have not noticed any bugs! In an early access game! Very impressive! The game runs very well, the presentation is really nice and I am very happy that I bought this game. This will probably my second and last early access game to buy!Well done, Dinosaur Polo Club! RECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY! (What's this? :- Like some games get ""Best Game of 2014"" or ""Best Indie Game"", etc... So I have decided to make my own!)  "

								This game is simple, yet challanging. The purpuese of this game in my opinion is not to give the player a gigantic RPG like experience nor something to pour thousands of hours into as you master every element of the game. This is not a traditional game, by that I mean that you will most likley not call in sick one day of the week, buy tons of snacks and binge play Mini Metro for a whole day. This game is more zen like and works great with a podcast or an audio book in the background. I think what makes this game great is that it's a simple time killer, but what makes this game different from other time killers like Flappy Bird and Cookie Clicker is that it does not feel dumb. An enjoyable game many should consider having just in case they are waiting for something or have something to listen to and want something to do during the mean time.			"

								TL;DR: Simple, beautiful, minimal, engrossing, inspiring.Mini Metro is a minimal, surprisingly relaxing, puzzle game. You create tracks between various different types of station in a bid to keep your city rolling smooth and efficient. Your resources are finite, and as your city expands you need to be strategic about how many tunnels you use, where you place junctions, which lines you put your trains on, how many carriages they have and the order in which your lines intersect different station types.Endless mode provides the most zen experience, with no overcrowding on stations, you can just watch your metro grow stress free. A beautifully minimal sound track sets the mood- again, zen. I have no experience playing this before the sound update so can't comment on what it was like before.			"

								Simply one of the best games in my library. Addictive. Everything about it from the minimalist, smooth interface to the recent addition of audio, to the core gameplay is top class. I picked it up last Xmas sale for about €2.50 but at it's current price of €9.99 it's still worth it. When it is fully released with additional features such as sandbox mode and additional cities, it will be even better than it already is.			"

												Mini Metro is beautiful and elegant, soothing, but not boring, a challenge, but not imposing. Its visual design, interface and subtle sound are impeccable. The game is simple, intuitive, and excellent value. Minimalist game mechanics may see easily bored players through quickly, but Mini Metro is not so much a game to be completed or finished, as a game to be soaked in. I lost with a sense of satisfaction and ease, and left with a smile. I will be back.Five stars.			"

You'll start to notice fun little shapes and oh wait, I'm out of bridges? Okay that's no big deal I'll just destroy this line... move this one over here there! Everything's fine again. Wait now this station has become a bottleneck... alright I'll complete a line into a circle around the fancy shapes and hold on: why is that circle way out there? Why are there so many circles?!? Get on the train! Move it backWARDS OH NO IT'S ALL BACKED UP AT ONCE WHY CAN'T YOU PEOPLE WALK!?10:10			"

								I've only played 3 levels but I'm already in love.You start playing about 2 seconds after clicking 'play', where you are thrown into a remarkably elegant first level that teaches you how Mini Metro works. The iconography is so simple and the aesthetic so clean that learning how to play  just happens naturally.Deceptively simple, the depth really starts to reveal itself a couple of levels in.An excellent way to tease your brain and dazzle your eyes when you have 10 - 20 minutes to get a quick gaming fix.

								It's a pure strategy title and by fully embracing their limits it does everything right. The goal is simple, transporting little passenger blocks to their desired stations. The UI is simple, dragging subway paths along the stops and adding carts on existing lines. At the start of every week you can choose between one of two upgrades. That's basically it. The depth? Surprisingly complex. With the ever increasing number of stations that you have to connect to your network and the ability to add new lines, the game gets ever more challenging. To solve this you can choose many different strategies, and even derive from real world subways. Star shaped, circle, checkerboard? Everything is possible (though not always efficient).The game is still in development and lacks certain important features, such as sound. If you don't mind you should buy it right now! Otherwise it is planned to be released in November 2014.			"

								This game is hella fun. Strategy is paramount here as you decide how to build your rail lines. Build up your rail fleet or cater to more ppl with better access (ie: more track)is the name of the game. With the game going until your passenger buildup becomes too much. Superb little time waster especially if you like railways/subways. Soundtrack is on the way, but quite frankly no music at all suits this game just as well. You lose nothing with early access. Can only get better. Beats the crap out of a lot of Triple A games for pure addictiveness and ease of play. Well, Buy it already!! 5 out of 5 stars.			"

								Mini Metro is simple. Draw some lines, connect some dots, and make your own mass transit system. As your citizens become more complex, as do your challenges. But, simple doesn't mean easy or boring. The simplicity lends to the game's elegant aesthetic. There are different color schemes to match your preferences and even pander to the colorblind audience. ""Simply"" put, it's a beautiful game. Minesweeper is simple, but if you throw yourself on Expert and try to get a score under 60 seconds, you'll want to pull your hair out.It's already a smart, fun, and beautiful game that shows promise of ""taking you even farther"" with it's awaited final release.

								Ever sit on a subway or metro train and get lost in the map, well they made it a game.  No hand holding, the game just throws you onto the map it is up to you to decide where passengers will go, and what the shortest route can be.  It is a game where you can think you have it completely under control, then you lose because of station overcrowding.  Picked it up today on a whim and the overwhelming response, and I am addicted.  I have only played for 2 hours but I can see this one clocking a lot.  Plus, it's still early access, I cannot wait to see what other fuctions they will add for a bit more depth.

												I really enjoy this game.  My laptop doesn't allow Cities Skylines to run very fast or for very long without over heating lately.  This fills my immediate need for managing mass transportation.  I wish there was an IOS version.  This would translate perfectly to a tablet or phone and I would buy it.  I would play this a lot more if it was mobile.  Overall, great game.  Easily waste an hour at a time playing and then walk away.  You will be back.  I highly recommend and encourage the developers to release an IOS port!			"

								I'm not really sure what it is about this little indie game, but seriously, if the subject matter interests you at all, then I recommend you pick it up.It is, by far, one of the most compulsively playable titles I have set my hands on in quite some time. Even though it resides in the early access areas of Steam, it can comfortably sit beside others that are deemed to be finished. The only thing missing from this game is sound. That being said, the sound is something I couldn't care less about. It is the least of my concern as I continue to further the efficiency and optimal layout of my subway lines. The game itself is played through various stages, in this case, cities of the world. Each stage provides you with a basic layout map and routes or ""lines"" to place between stations. The stations are represented as shapes on the map that you must connect using your lines. As you do so additional symbols are shown on the map to represent the passengers.   Your locomotives move around the map autonomously along your set routes picking up and dropping off passengers as they go. This would present itself as an easy puzzle to solve, however, as the days and weeks go by in game, that couldn't be farther from the truth. It becomes a complex balancing act to try to get passengers to and fro as quickly as possible without allowing them to build up at an individual stations. This, as far as I can tell, is the only end game state. If a station has too many passengers, the countdown begins until finally the game notifies you of your defeat.The game is so simple and elegant, yet complex and harsh, all at the same time. I haven't played anything like it before. It sits by itself in a world of indie games that are increasinging in quality all the time, yet somehow all have a familiar feeling. This eschews that familiarity for something altogether different. Something playable, satisfying, and ultimately, something worth spending your hard earned money on to enjoy fully. If you aren't sure that you would in fact enjoy it, I recommend you go online and type in Mini Metro in your search engine of choice. There you will find a link to the developers ""alpha"" version of the game. It is very bare bones compared to what we have here, but it will no doubt allow you to get a taste of things for yourself. I don't think you'll be disappointed.Highly recommended!  10/10			"

								It's simply amazing, for short that is. But really it is, amazing. The simplistic and minimalistic 2D artstyle is really nice. The way the game works is overwhelmingly good to be in an Early Access stage. The first few ingame days are quite simple while the further on you get in the game the harder it gets, more clutter with more stations, lines and locomotives. The stress gets real in this game. Really good game. If you haven't already bought the game I recomend you do so now.			"

								This is a great game. The one thing I would change is that each piece transported should pay a fare, then at the end of the week, the player should have the option to use the fare to buy a new line, a new carriage, or build a tunnel/bridge. The way it is now, it is completely random, and nothing is more frustrating than having a beautiful, efficient map, then having a station show up on an island when you don't have a tunnel, then not having a choice to build a new tunnel at the end of the week. Maybe this is the effect that the developers are going for since this is a puzzle game, but it can be pretty annoying.Also, why is Hong Kong so ♥♥♥♥ing hard????			"

And the game is in early access, so more is to come, i assume. (Helsinki metro would be awesome :P) If you like casual strategy or subway planning, this is a definite pick.			"

												This  game has that simplicity and addictive ""I'll play just one more"" nature to it that all the classics (Tetris, Angry Birds, etc.). When you first run the game, you think it is doing a tutorial, and you are right, but then you realize you have also actually started your first real game. The learning curve is gradual and fun as the first game you play teaches you how to play. I have only played the London map so far, and I feel like I could play it over and over and try different techniques to figure out the best strategies--I cannot imagine how much more fun this will be when I try the other maps like Paris and Berlin.The user interface is clean and fun to look at--it uses the actual metro symbology of simple lines and colors and connectors to actually provide the graphics for the game and interface, all in one. Genius decision. As an added perk, you can save your games after you finish as screenshots and animated GIFs! Such a fun game!Some might critidize the lack of multiplayer, but as quick as the games are, you could make it multi by challenging a friend to the same map and watching them play. Even watching a game is mesmerizing!UPDATE AFTER 9 HOURS OF PLAYThis game is so awesome. I come back to it almost every day and play a round or two. I am trying not to go on to the next map until I have done 1,000 passengers...but this broke down when I hit Hong Kong, where I cannot get more than 500 or so. So hard! I went ahead and went on and lowered my standard to 500+ passengers per map before I go on, and so far I can hit 1,000 passengers on all of them up to Osaka, which I just played today--Osaka, which has a really fast train engine on it! I did not know this game had different engines later in the maps! This made an already addictive, fun, challenging, innovative, elegant game that much better! So good. When this comes out on Android, I will buy it again so I can play on my phone and tablet!			"

												[EDITED]Good puzzle game in which each level progessively gets harder. Like 'old school' games where you don't beat the level, rather you keep on playing to get as high a score as possible. It would be easy to think that the levels are 'samey' but I feel they're different enough for each level to have it's own challenge, have their own aesthetic and even come to have a favourite level.I would say that, personally, the background audio needs some working on as after you've lost a level it can loop on an uncomfortable pitch and won't change once you've started a new level.

												This is a puzzle game, above all. It's not a building game. Yes, the maps you create can look cool - but they need to be efficient. It's all about keeping your stations unclogged and running smoothly. But you also need to make sure you're using your tunnels and trains well, because you have limited amount. Thankfully, you can rearrange your lines after they're complete. It took me a while to realize that, so that's why I'm mentioning it. As for the cities, thedifference is the shape of the rivers and shorelines. These will effect how you use your tunnels. After a few maps, it does get pretty difficult.If you're looking for puzzle game with a unique theme, give this one a try.			"

												Beauty so often goes hand in hand with simplicity. Dinosouar Polo - the developers of Mini Metro took that ddesign pholosophy to heart. For starters, Mini Metro is a wonderfully minimalist game about owning and managing a Mini subway in a plethora different cities. Different shapes pop up, your job is to link these shapes together with lines representing railway lines in order to ferry passengers from staion to station.Sounds disarmingly simple? Well, in a way, yes it is: the colourful, flat graphics make information easy to asertain, the gameplay never change and to the mechanics are easy to learnd... and yet impossible to master. As your interconected railway gets more and more passengers youu must fight to make it as efficient as possible - as if a single station becomes conjested, your metro is closed and that's game over. To summarise, Mini Metro is a beautifully simple, easy to understand game that you can pick up for barely anything. It's basically Train Simulator for people who don't actualy care about rtrains and just want a caual, intuative, endlessly replayable puzzle game. Although, I must say, yu can complete the levels in a matter of hours and after that you're just retreading old ground. 8/10 - not enough train.			"

								Brilliant puzzle game - great fun. Very well made, in terms of functionality, and it's incredibly simple to get going from the off; no instructions necessary, and you'll quickly begin joining the dots (almost literally). The UI is basic, clean and pleasant, which helps to keep the game simple. Definitely worth the £4.99 price tag.Only gripes are that there is no audio (yet), however this is being worked on, and also it would be nice to be able to zoom in and out of maps.			"

								I have found game to be very... great at what it does, (I hope thats making you sit down shutup and concentrate) because it did that to me for an hour just sitting their reconfiguring all my trains just thinking that 'I like Trains' all that I wish for is to be able to have a sydney map then this game would be perfect. Overall it's a great game even though its an early access game and I plan on playing it for many hours to come, good job developer all that I require is a map maker			"

								Another fantastic minimalistic game like Eufloria & FTL (Faster Than Light), which is focused on getting people from A to B before each station becomes overcrowded.The game starts simple but picks up pace quite quickly and if you don't prepare accordingly it can lead to your downfall; it is like FTL because of its ability to pause and solve the current problem before continuing.Currently in Early Access: The game lacks sound, is limited to 3 levels and no other gamemodes are avaliable.On the bright side the game seems really stable for me and when you fail you can take a picture of your Metro map with passengers and without as if it were a real Metro Map.

I've been playing this game since it was a browser game and only had one map. It's cool to see how far this game has come and is well worth the money and time you put into it. The devs do frequent updates, so don't think it'll be one of those games that limbo in early access for its entire life.			"

												Mini Metro is one of those games that is just deceptively simple, and yet can be quite challenging.It's essentially a puzzle/simulator, with really simple mechanics of 'add some trains to lines' and 'get passengers from A to B quickly'. From the get-go, that doesn't seem very hard, but this game does a good job of ramping up the difficulty. By the time you've gotten to the more difficult levels, or are trying to complete the achievement challenges, you realize you need to consider a lot of problems and juggle lots of different possible configurations of lines and trains.The graphics and sounds in this game match the simple premise, and help to avoid distracting you from the simulation at the base of the game. I did find that this made it hard sometimes to get the game to do what you wanted, like going around a river bend rather than using up a tunnel by going through it, but overall it works well.Definitely worth playing if you're interested in transport/management simulator games.

												This game is infuriating. I can't even get through level 1. Extremely fun game, but I literally cannot, in good consciousness, invest my time into a round I know I'm going to fail.A single overloaded node, which can happen in a matter of seconds, will ruin your game. Avoiding this is absurdly difficult, requiring an immense amount of time invested in the pause screen, planning your lanes, which may or may not be worse than what you had before, only to be ruined once a few new locations pop up.I, no doubt, just suck at this game. But I feel like this needs something more to help players avoid that inevitable game over screen.A population per node, perhaps. People per second, heat maps, popular spots, whatever. Just *something* more to help during the planning stage.Regardless, this is a great game. I just wish I could play more of it.			"

								Even though real goals are still lacking in the game (NO LONGER TRUE, SEE REVISED PART), this game has great potential. However, as the adding of badges is announced (which you can see as some kind of 'goals') for one of the next updates, I think this game has everything necessary to become a top 'under 10€' game. Gameplay already runs smoothly for me (no obvious bugs) but a soundtrack and a (short) tutorial (with some explanation on the different game modes) should still be added in my opinion.  All in all a good, decent, low-cost game!REVISED REVIEW: The game now has achievements included (to unlock next levels) and more are to come.

This makes it awkward as if you need to change something in the settings you have to quit and you lose your progress, so maybe progress should be able to be saved or have options accessible in game.

Cons: I have latency or memory leak in the scenic mode when I get to about 60 passengers. Odd this doesn't occur even on commuter mode with 900 passengers. Hopefully there is a fix in place for this one day.Sidebar: Maybe we can have an emergency bus route we can use once a day for ""emergency"" situations?

								This is, hands-down, the finest first-play experience I have ever had from a casual game.  Mini Metro is an outstanding example of perfection in minimalism, and a resounding lesson that gameplay trumps all.  As of this date, there is no music, and the graphics are simple transit system line art.  In short, you could have knocked this out on a VIC-20 in your basement-- if you'd been this much of a genius.The concept is brilliant, and the execution is perfect-- but this is still early access at this point, so there's a bit of a level shortage.  That's alleviated somewhat by the several subtly-- but importantly-- different play modes.Also, there are not a lot of upgrades at this point.  There are only three or four limited, important resources, and they're all really major.  A handful of more subtle, minor-tweak upgrades would make things a bit more visually interesting, as well as giving you a few things to tinker with when you're waiting to see how well a major change plays out.Nonetheless, this is absolutely the best casual game I've played in years.  Highly recommended, and definitely worth the money.  The only real question is whether you will also want it on your phone or tablet, where I expect touch-and-drag would only add to the fun.			"

								Simple game with lot of fun. At some point of time you will always loose. The challenge is about transport more passengers then ever and survive as long as you can. You can already play, but as you can see by my list of (-) there is still a lot to add and do before it is a complete game.+ easy to understand+ no harm, just clever game for all ages (family)+ as the city grows, it gets complex and challenging+ simple interface- sometimes it feels like the trains (or passengers) do silly things which gets one in trouble- when re-arranging tracks and or re-arranging is done, trains just wait for some time (and looks like calculating) instead of moving on- re-arranging tracks is hard, sometimes you need to remove the whole track and re-do it from scratch- max 4 trains for one road (why to limit?)- re-arranging a railroad from a currently visited to make it unvisited by drag and drop to nowhere not possible- no long trains possible (just too little bonus of passenger train)- no big/huge railroad system possible yet- at some point it just spawns circles to end the game instead of growing balanced- no options to set up rules for own map- no sound yet			"

That is why pretty minimalistic games are reachin` popularity, and Mini Metro is such a product. All it can offer is pleasant colourful lines and several maps, but this is all you need there. A wonderful escape, which relaxes the brains and cathces the attention. Also different music while playing is enjoyable. Simple and pleasurable. Like it.			"

Early Access Review
								Just a crazy simple, beautiful, extremely polished strategy game.Place metro lines to connect stations that randomly appear as you play.  That's basically it.  You have a limited number of lines, a limited number trains and cars to place on your lines, and a limited number of tunnels to cross water, each of which you recieve more of as you play.  You can place and delete and rearrange your lines and trains as much as you want for no cost (and there is a tactical pause).  All you have to do is keep getting polygonal people to their polygonal destinations smoothly as long as you can, while the number of stations and passengers keeps increasing.Although the game is still in early access, this is really an incredibly polished game (the only thing missing is sound, which I don't mind).  It looks clean an modern and beautiful, it has a lovely UI and menu system... it's extremely clear and easy to use.  I've spent several hours playing it so far, and I definitely intend to play more... it is a great casual game - easy to pick up, with short self-contained sessions - but it also has some real depth.  You can put a lot of thought into your metro designs, or you can just throw something down and watch what happens.  It's quite flexible in terms of ways to play.  Each map/level/city also offers unique constraints and layouts (semi randomized each time of course), and the difficulty of the levels ranges from hold-my-hand to crushingly difficult, giving you access to all of them immediately, so you can explore your ability and comfort level from the beginning, and aspire to those harder cities.The only negative thing I can think of to say about the game is that I wouldn't want to sit and play it for hours straight.  It's more of a pick-up put-down game.  Also, there is no tutorial, and while the UI is relatively straight forward, understanging the princples of the game might take you a couple minutes and/or google searches.  Hopefully a tutorial will be added soon :)Highly recommended!  I think this has a lot of appeal for a lot of different types of people.			"

												I highly recommend this game. It's really, really addictive and so simple yet challenging.The goal here is simply to keep your city's (from which there are quite a few to choose from) subway running. And by running this game means business, you can't just connect locations and hope the passengers don't crowd the stations, but you gotta react to the needs of the people, meaning where do people want to go from this spot and manage efficient lines.After playing this game I can finally appreciate what those architects in London accomplished. Before I always wondered (aka complained) about how many times one had to change lines simply to get from spot A to B, but now I finally get it. Life ain't easy for engineers when everyone wants to get everywhere in no time at all without ever having to walk.And in case any of the developers read this; having pedestrian walkways between stations in this game would really be awesome, you know, so you don't have to connect stations by tube, but could simply put shortcuts for passengers in the game, so maybe someone would actually take ten steps instead of crowding my circle lines. Sure, not likely many people would walk those ten steps, but not entirely impossible. I've seen people do it.			"

								This game is quite fun and about right at the 5$ price tag.  My only problem with it is that what it really needs is a career mode.  The endless mode is fun for a while, but with no ability to save and no concrete objectives other than 'more people' it feels like a browser game.			"

								This game is interesting, but simple. It's good for maybe about an hour or two of play, at which point you're ready for something else. I guess it could evolve into something more, but for now it's really more like a mobile or tablet game than a PC game. You'll enjoy it, just be cautioned there's limited depth and you may bore of it fairly quickly.			"

								I was confused when I first opened the game, there's no initial tutorial but it's fairly intuitive. I saw this critique before and I think it bears repeating, sometimes the same generation creates the same shape in a cluster which creates more back up than beneficial to the game. There's a high number of circle locations that appear and few squares that are generated which makes it incredibly difficult to make an effective line if i'm connecting a string of circle stations together. I'd like to see the station generation balanced a bit differently from where it currently is. I've enjoyed the game as a calming puzzle, it's relaxing with the limited color pallet and the clean design. I've already recommended it to people.I look forward to seeing this game completed and how things might be tweaked from early access to full release.			"

I know its still in the works, so I'm anxious (in a good way) to see what updates it receives over time. It has certainly been a fun experience so far. I know audio is going to be added, but its certainly cool right now that I can play my own music and just zone out as I restructure the metro.			"

								This game is one of my favorite casual games, even if it's only in beta. The updates to the beta have been fantastic and regular, and every time I turn around they're adding something that makes this game worth coming back to. If you like casual puzzle games and/or sims (depending on how you look at it) this game is totally worth it. I've played through evey city at least once on every mode, and I've come back multiple times to replay when the layout has been redesigned or they've added new features and such -- and it just keeps getting better and better, without getting (noticeably) more complex to play.

								This game isn't so much a transportation network simulation as it is a subtle puzzle game. The key to sucess is to not overload your lines with the same symbols next to each other because that will cause stations to be backed up. Make sure to stagger the symbols! (triangle-circle-triangle is good, triangle-triangle-circle is bad.) This is easier said than done because many times you will have no choice but to have four circles in a row on one line.The second secret is always retool your lines as you play the level. More stations are added as the game plays out, and you will find what worked for the first 300 passengers all of a sudden isn't as efficient and you have to clear the lines and re-lay them out for the next 300.There's a lot of strategy in this game, from how you lay out the map to what bonuses you get every level. I've just sat here and played through all levels for the past five hours and even went back and replayed a couple of early levels that I didn't do so well because I hadn't figured out the system yet. This is a fun game!This game is low on flash and high on substance, it's a must have for anyone who loves puzzle strategy games!			"

It's not critical, but I would like to see some sort of multi-player in the future and am expecting the achievements to develop as the game moves along.

												I absolutely love this game. As a kid, I grew up with taking the metro in Washington D.C.  to visit the areas downtown. So now I get to make my own lines and help folks on their way to work, museums, or a restaurant. It feels very therapeutic coming up with a better strategy for every playthough; such as re-routing and upgrading the lines.Pick this up if you want a challenging but relaxing casual game to mess around in.You won't be disappointed.

												I was hesitating to buy this game and kept it on the wishlist for a longer while, as it seemed expensive. When the Summer Sale came, I decided to buy something I really wanted to play. I felt like a transport sim, but Cities in Motiton didn't get good reviews, while Cities:Skylines were not cheap enough for me. Therefore I had only one choice within my budget and - to my surprise - It seems to be one of the best games for me in my collection!First off, one of my favourite games of all time are: - FTL - a more or less typical rougelike with significant strategy portion - Transport Tycoon / Locomotion series - where one of the main tasks is to build efficient networksCombine the two above and you get MiniMetro :).I'm a busy guy, and I don't have more than a couple of hours every day to play games. Therefore I turn more and more frequently to short games, that I can finish in a day or two, with high replay value. Mini Metro fits this description perfectly. Randomly generated stations are always a challenge (fourth circle or triange station in a condensed area drive me nuts!), while variety of cities encourage to try different strategies. I hope the descriptions will be added soon, although discovering the differences is also a kind of fun.One can look at the game as 100 years of a city growth condensed to 15-30 minutes. There are no resources - every ""week"" you get something to expand your network. It might seem strange, that you can re-rout your trains in any possible way. That way the creators avoided making the game extremely difficult - fortunately the ""extreme"" mode exist, adding that piece of realism for hardcore city transport organizers.With such minimalistic design, there is a lot of room for immersion. It's very easy to imagine that triangle and circle station represent every day destinations, like work/home/market. Square is probably a railway station or airport - unique but important. Then there is a bunch of unique ones, that can easily translate to a football stadium, hospital, or other touristic attactions. Even with no sound, you can hear all those crowds, looking at the train with six symbols - each representing a traveller and his destination.One of the best things about this game is the fact, that you are 100% focused on the core - designing the network as efficiently as possible. You don't have to waste more than a few seconds to build the route or add/move trains. If Transport Tycoon was simplified to a white board and lines with rectangles instead of detailed tracks and trains, you could finish the game in a fraction of usual time.Overall - GREAT game! I was not expecting that much from such small game.It's still early access and the devs are working hard to finish it - updates/hotfixes are frequent.FULL VERSION UPDATE: EVEN MORE AWESOME!!!			"

								A relaxed but hectic game is a good description. It's relaxing to play the game, true, with its now-existant soundscaping that really is quite lovely and relaxing, its pretty, smooth lines, and the constant motion of the subway cars. The whole setup is calm and relaxing.However, the game's pace quickly becomes frantic, a race against the clock. You WILL lose. The only question is of how quickly you will do so. It's a nice game to play in short periods of time between doing work things, or when you simply need to wind down, but it is genuinely challenging when it wants to be. I like that.			"

I get the same kick out of this as games like eufloria, its visually pleasing and calm, yet hectic at the same time.

								Easy game to pick up and play. No need for a tutorial, controls are simple and intuitive. Difficulty curve becomes a little steep once the game picks up, but sort of reminds you of old school atari games that just keep getting harder. Beatiful interface and the transitions are well designed.Complaints: - Some of the menu transitions or dropdowns are slow, and a little clunky (for example, clicking on the clock in-game to change the time).- No messages informing you of problems when placing lines. New players might not understand that they are out of tunnels, or why their line is otherwise being rejected.- No way (or at least no simple way) to choose the direction of a new locomotive. - New stations, especially well into a game are easy to overlook. If that isn't by design, a clearer sound notification or an outline or something might be of use.Commendations:- Very smooth feel. Hardly any ""loading"" or time when you aren't doing something.- Simple layout that still conveys all the info you need.- Calming, relaxing music that fits well with the game.- Variety of map options that mix up gameplay without actually changing the mechanics of the game.Has plenty of potential for community workshop maps. Also looks like it would only take a bit of tweaking to work great on mobile.The price is a little steep for a game with arguably little content. If you already have a game to play, might want to wait for a sale. Otherwise, go for it.			"

								This is, hands-down, the finest first-play experience I have ever had from a casual game.  Mini Metro is an outstanding example of perfection in minimalism, and a resounding lesson that gameplay trumps all.  As of this date, there is no music, and the graphics are simple transit system line art.  In short, you could have knocked this out on a VIC-20 in your basement-- if you'd been this much of a genius.The concept is brilliant, and the execution is perfect-- but this is still early access at this point, so there's a bit of a level shortage.  That's alleviated somewhat by the several subtly-- but importantly-- different play modes.Also, there are not a lot of upgrades at this point.  There are only three or four limited, important resources, and they're all really major.  A handful of more subtle, minor-tweak upgrades would make things a bit more visually interesting, as well as giving you a few things to tinker with when you're waiting to see how well a major change plays out.Nonetheless, this is absolutely the best casual game I've played in years.  Highly recommended, and definitely worth the money.  The only real question is whether you will also want it on your phone or tablet, where I expect touch-and-drag would only add to the fun.			"

								Mini Metro is a game about management, Simple and intuitive UI/UX keeps you on the edge of your seat, not because of action or thrill; but rather micro-management and the thought of ""How can I make this metro better?” The actual gameplay is satisfying and also link to the UI/UX simplicity. Something about those little rectangles carrying triangles, squares, wedges, etc. is extremely addicting.The added game modes complement the experience my introducing casual modes, different aesthetics and varying maps that subtly change the experience. Highly recommended for those who love a simple puzzle game. Although it would be a shame not to see a mobile port of this game. "

Early Access Review
								This game is one of the simplest yet best quick little challenge/strat/thinking/brainpower ect games I have played. you get stressed a bit, not to the point of a mental breakdown but just enough to make it entertaining. As this is early access I will be talking more aboult the con's than the pro's to help the curators along.cons:1 why doesn't it open in full screen in the first place. pretty much every body i know would put this in full screen, it is just more sensible.2 it didnt seem to auto adjust to the res this was annoying until i found you could change the res and fine tune it.3 the bar at the bottom was not obvious in daytime mode, and would be better if the handle was a different colour. Also i feel it should start locked so that new players can find it easily (like me)4 there aren't adjustable intensities. slowing down the rate at which ""people"" spawn would be nice for when you're tired and don't want to play on a full out fps and dont want the full stress of what it is now. options like ""slow"" ""casual"" ""normal"" ""hard"" ""intense"" would be great. if there are these they are not obvious.5 night time is WAAAAYYYYY better than day time and this option should be easier to find.6 changing line shapes can be annoying sometimes i had to completley undo a line to fit in just 1 more station. to be able to break the line at any station would be greatThat is all the cons I can think of so just remember that I focused on the cons. The gameplay is awesome even if it is very simple and is very addicting. It loads quickly which is awesome. it is nice and bright. it is simple enough to play when tired. and just get it. you will be addicted. AND ITS CHEAP AS CHIPS. All around an awesome game and I can see it really becoming something as it progresses.			"

												For a fairly bare-bones transport sim (you're only delivering passengers, although there is some managing of which station people want to get to, and good luck if you're playing Osaka and you run out of tunnels), it's surprisingly complex, and very addictive. Definitely worth the asking price, would not refund.From playing about 90 minutes, I think the best strategy is to make circle lines and connect them with main lines. But this tends to fall apart when the loops get too big to deal with the passengers, and you run out of lines, and oh God I think they're rioting.			"

												Efficency Simulator 2015, more commonly known as Mini Metro, is a connect-the-dots puzzle game where you try to get shapes from one shape to the one that matches them. Presumably the shapes represent what station the people are trying to go to.This game has a handful of things going for it, from sleek minimalistic design to the matching audio design, for the right kind of person this is a relaxing and therapeutic experience. If you find yourself panicking on a strict time limit, this game may not be for you, but for everyone else it comes highly reccomended.10/10 would connect the shapes with colorful lines again.			"

								Very fun little game. Simple but addicting mechanics. You control a city's metro system, you build different lines by connecting the ""stops"" which show up on the map. Each stop is shape-coded, and passangers want to go to specific shapes. I like to think of this as a kind of zoning metaphor, circles are residental, squares are malls, etc. But that's all secondary to the gameplay. Passengers are simply randomly generated at different stops, and your trains show up to take them where they want to go (hopefully). The map starts off very simple, and slowly expands and new stops are randomly generated. Every week you get a new train, and a semi-random perk. And that's it. At this stage there is a lot of room to build different modes that are more differentiated from one another, but as it stands a game that is very fun to play for easy quick gaming sessions.			"

								I'm not usually a fan of early access games, but the minimalism present in this game really appealed to me. When I first played a couple of months ago, I was a bit disappointed with the lack of variety. There were only a couple of maps, which all played very similarly, and Rush Hour mode was not yet finished. When I started playing again recently, I was pleased with what the developers had done. More than double the maps were added, all which now play quite differently from each other, and Rush Hour mode was complete. At this point, it would seem the game is complete (minus the lack of audio), but it seems the developers still have a few things in mind.Overall the game is very easy to pick up an play. It's simple, relaxing and, despite being somewhat slow-paced, very challenging. I'm still not certain if you can actually ""win"" a game, but that doesn't keep me from trying. Highly recommended.

												+ Smooth interface+ Relaxing background 'music'- Repetitive gameplaySimple to learn, difficult to master, Mini Metro is a great casual puzzle game. Don't be decieved by the colorful shapes and soothing tones, however, as it becomes very tough the longer you play. This game is perfect if you want to chill out for twenty minutes, but can be easily obsessed over by the compulsive organizers and managers out there. If you aren't one to obsess, then you might find this simple puzzle game stale after several playthroughs, as each map has little to offer in differences. Each level has a slow statup as well, since you must begin with nothing and work from the ground up each time. But if you are a fan of simple puzzle games, as well as resource management, then Mini Metro is a great choice for you.			"

								This is, hands-down, the finest first-play experience I have ever had from a casual game.  Mini Metro is an outstanding example of perfection in minimalism, and a resounding lesson that gameplay trumps all.  As of this date, there is no music, and the graphics are simple transit system line art.  In short, you could have knocked this out on a VIC-20 in your basement-- if you'd been this much of a genius.The concept is brilliant, and the execution is perfect-- but this is still early access at this point, so there's a bit of a level shortage.  That's alleviated somewhat by the several subtly-- but importantly-- different play modes.Also, there are not a lot of upgrades at this point.  There are only three or four limited, important resources, and they're all really major.  A handful of more subtle, minor-tweak upgrades would make things a bit more visually interesting, as well as giving you a few things to tinker with when you're waiting to see how well a major change plays out.Nonetheless, this is absolutely the best casual game I've played in years.  Highly recommended, and definitely worth the money.  The only real question is whether you will also want it on your phone or tablet, where I expect touch-and-drag would only add to the fun.			"

								I have played this game since the very early Alpha versions before it was on Steam.  This game has successfully captured the fun of creating a subway map.  The game looks like a subway map.  The trains go back and forth on the lines like subway cars.  There are several different modes of play for quicker challenges or more long term optimizations of design.  It's loads of fun, has tons of replay value, and quite a few different maps.			"

One of my favorite games from my youth was Sim Tower; this reminds me of the core traffic management aspect of that game, distilled into a visually pleasing game which manages to be time sensitive without being twitch inducing.  While the rabbit hole isn't a bottomless pit, the games are quick enough and diverse enough to allow for good replay value.  It seems like a good candidate for a mobile game as well.Would buy again.  :)			"

												Great, simple game.Minimalistic graphics and easy to learn but hard to master gameplay.I like that the achievements give you some more tasks after you played through all the cities. Plus the daily challenge thats adds to the replayability. Still this game is small and simple and not necessarily worth 10 bucks.			"

												An excellent ""Mini-Game""; it takes just a minute or so to understand the concept, but quite a long time to craft a strategy for each of the cities. Strategic thinking combined with an element of chance and a relatively short playtime for each round make it one of those game's where you ""just play another round"" fill 5 am.			"

								I originally bought this game with some leftover money from buying another game. It has been almost a week and I still haven't even touched the game I wanted to buy. Mini Metro is just so addicting, and simplistic, that its hard to put down. The graphics are smooth, the colors are pretty, and the challenge is pretty challenging. I haven't been able to even beat a session on regular mode! For a game thats still pretty young, it has very little issues. There is no sound, as of present, but I heard the company is working on that. It's a really good game. 9/10  stars			"

								The simplicity of this game reminds me of go. The concepts are simple and easy to grasp but the game quickly becomes increasing difficult, challenging the player to plan ahead or get crushed by the number of people trying to use the station. Just bought it and couldn't put it down for 4 hours. While this is in beta, it is perhaps one of the most complete and fun betas I've playing in a long time, and is really only missing audio (which is coming soon).  Can't say enough about the UI as well. Clean and crisp and easy to navigate. Definitely looks like a london underground system map. At present build (beta 15) this game is an 8/10. Once complete I can't image it being anything less than a 10/10. Buy it! Really inexpensive for the fun. (P.S. to the dev's, this game would be awesome on an Ipad.) "

								Mini metro is a fun casual strategy game about, you guessed it, metro lines. It´s a simple and entertaining game that you can just hop in and out of, but it can also get quite hectic in the endgame. The pricepoint isn´t too high and the levels are varied enough. And the game is in early access, so more is to come, i assume. (Helsinki metro would be awesome :P) If you like casual strategy or subway planning, this is a definite pick.			"

												Mini Metro is a revelation; it's been a very long time since I last played a game so original and addictive. Picking up the basics of the game takes moments, but the more you play it, the more you see the inherent depth in the game. The various playable cities at first seem very similar, but after a while you realise that each requires very different strategies. The minimalist art design is excellent. The use of smooth crisp, sharply coloured diagrams really makes you feel like you are creating a tube map. It's amazing how immersive such a graphically simple game can be.I have a few minor gripes; occasionally trains get stuck in the stations for no apparent reason. The random spawning of stations, whilst giving great replayability, can also sometimes make games unplayable. But these are minor issues and I hope they will be fixed soon,The game is a natural fit for tablets and I'll be interested to see a release there, and hoping this will see it get more attention. In my view a real classic.			"

												This puzzle game is surprisingly very soothing.  The music is procedurally generated and is mostly made up of subway beeps and tweeting birds.  When you hit the Game Over screen, the music just fades away as the sound of waves plays over the effect.  Aesthetically, it’s also very soothing, even though Colorblind Mode tends to put the most obnoxious yellow against a white background that makes it barely visible.  Gameplay is very simple and kind of therapeutic.  This is one of the few puzzle games where I didn’t find myself swearing at the game when they would change something up to make it more challenging.I definately recommend this game, especially if you want to play a low-stress time-killer puzzle game.

												I love this game. It's a puzzle that starts out relaxing and meditative and slowly, ever so slowly, becomes intensly stressful as crowds build and you desperatly watch the clock, waiting for the end of the week and your next upgrade to try and satisfy the rushing masses. Those masses are represented by tiny little geometric shapes, which indicate which stop they are looking to reach. Bonus points for how the acheivments are actually goals that make the game more interesting. Each map has two acheivments tied to them, one is the simple victory condition to unlock the next map, the next is a proper challenge to really push you to the limit. Anyone can ferry 500 people around, but can you ferry 1,000 with only one tunnel?Then, to keep you having fun, every day comes with a daily challenge map for everyone to compete for high score on.You need this game in your life. Trust me.			"

												This is only my second review for a Steam game, so that should speak to how I appreciate this game, I suppose.In short, I'd like to say that Dinosaur Polo Club has earned my trust as a game developer. I purchased this game when it was still in Early Access, and was impressed to see that it actually LEFT Early Access and became the game it was meant to be, unlike so many other titles I've seen in the last year.If you are looking for an adventure out of this game, then you are going in with the wrong expectations. This is purely an arcade-style strategy game, very minimalist in design, and it doesn't promise to be anything other than that. The thing is, it's really good. Especially if you're a casual gamer and just want to wind down a bit at night. (I really love the night version of the game. It gives you a black background instead of the bright white.) The audio is very calm. There is no music, but the sound effects were so well crafted that you will swear there is a gentle tune playing.It's a very simple game but can get incredibly difficult, so you may want to refrain from the more hardcore modes if you're  just using this to turn off and go to sleep to.If you are colorblind, this game is also great for you.My only con is it can be a bit finicky when adjusting pre-existing track routes. If it was a little less insistent on connecting to the station you are trying to disconnect the track from, everything would be perfect. Otherwise, I have no copmlaints and this game is simply worth the price.It's fun, it's challenging, it's easy to understand, it's relaxing, and it receives regular updates from a development team that actually seems to care. I have learned to avoid Early Access ""games"" (more like vaporware), but this is one developer I would gladly go Early Access with again.			"

								Such a simple and enjoyable game. Marvelous.Perfect if you don't want to get into long play sessions which would require your attention and time. This little game can give you fun 10-20 minute sessions. Good if you are waiting for somebody or something or you need a break from something.			"

								When you stop and think about how simple the mechanics are for this game, it's pretty amazing how fun it is.  Draw lines, watch the symbols move around, and relax.  Or not if you're playing Rush Hour mode.  I've been pretty cautious with Early Access games lately, but this one is a keeper.			"

								I love this game, the minimalist style is beautiful. It is well designed and unique, in my experience. However, I have a few criticisms, that i think could help improve the depth and breadth of gameplay greatly. 1. Customers using the transport system should be able to pay for its , for a price set by the player.This could generate income, too buy upgrades for the system. 2. Statistics on how each line is performing, too anticipate traffic, capacity and demand.3. Allowing for the building of more than seven lines at a time, this is an arbitrary limit with little practical use in the game.4. Enabling lines to have multiple branches that diverge and converge with eachother.5.  What about multiplayer?			"

								A surprisingly fun little time waster. Controls are easy although it took a while before I figured out how to unbind a station. Starts of with a handful of stations and grows until you have a massive mess of train lines that you are constantly looking to improve on and connect so that people are able to get from their circle station to the + sign in the far corner.I also can't help but think that this would also be a brilliant game for a tablet.

								This game has caught me, and i m glued le it like paper on other paper. This game with amazing yet very simple graphics, always changing gameplay with rules to that gameplay. Thats why i love this game. Plus if you want to make a metro anywhere on the planet you can. With this game you have the option. And if you take to count that this game is only early access, i want to see the full release. Because this is amazing game all along. I mean behind this is a small idea, that grew and its still grownig to this date. If you are a metro-realism fan you could but really shouldnt buy this game. Because  there arent real metros and you cant drive them by yourself. On the other hand, if you are looking for amazing yet simple game, this is the game for you.			"

								Both cohesive and pleasing to the eye, this train game is not just another train game.  While this has been said of almost every train game, Minimetro, offers simple game mechanics with increasing difficulty that provide entertainment and a challenge for anyone.  Micromanage, in realtime, a subway system in one of the world's greatest metropoli. Prevent your stations from overcrowding in an effort to get all of your passengers to their destination.  Offering three gamemodes of varying difficulty, The game can be easily picked up, but will continue to provide a challenge for months to come to even the greatest strategist.   Certainly worth its value this early access game only lacks a soundtrack. Glitchfree and carefree this game excels!			"

								This game is good fun. But! You really have to be into the whole ""city management/ efficiency"" type gaming to enjoy it. Spawn points pop up for new passengers to be delivered. You must keep the rails/tubes from backing up or you fail (which isn't really a fail) It will ask you to continue or restart and you can rearange your lines.The objective is clear, but it is also endless.You are given multiple city layouts to play on starting with London, Paris, Tokyo and New York. Many more as well, I just haven't played them all. It is all click and drag. There are no hot keys, but the interface is very friendly. No music yet... (early access stuff in the works) Overall I very much enjoy this game. It's simple and fun to play when you just want to chill and listen to some music while toting aroung you pixel people from station to station.			"

								I originally bought this game with some leftover money from buying another game. It has been almost a week and I still haven't even touched the game I wanted to buy. Mini Metro is just so addicting, and simplistic, that its hard to put down. The graphics are smooth, the colors are pretty, and the challenge is pretty challenging. I haven't been able to even beat a session on regular mode! For a game thats still pretty young, it has very little issues. There is no sound, as of present, but I heard the company is working on that. It's a really good game. 9/10  stars			"

								This games is great and i love it bought it 2 days ago and still dont understand how to survive for longer than 4 weeks on London. I know this game is still in early access and i am looking into creating a YouTube channel where i play games such as this and other Indie Games out there. I do want to just add a few things that i would like to see in future versions of the game. More maps at the moment the 10 odd maps are more than enough but i think that once players can understand how to be succesful then they will need new, harder and different maps to test them. I would like to see just more cities from around the world on there such as Singapore, Milan, Veince with the cannals would be awesome and some other big cities aroung the world.Can't weait for the full version of this game to come out and at £4.99 it is a steal!!Great game and a must buy.

								Mini metro is a fun casual strategy game about, you guessed it, metro lines. It´s a simple and entertaining game that you can just hop in and out of, but it can also get quite hectic in the endgame. The pricepoint isn´t too high and the levels are varied enough. And the game is in early access, so more is to come, i assume. (Helsinki metro would be awesome :P) If you like casual strategy or subway planning, this is a definite pick.			"

								A simple concept, executed cleanly, with a rudimentary learning curve. The beauty of Mini Metro is in how it teases you to come back for ""just one more."" I think the creators of Mini Metro should be commended for demonstrating such a pure gaming concept, avoiding excessive complications and unnecessary ""stuff"".I hope the upcoming soundtrack enhances the experience further! (IMHO, the Osmos soundtrack is a fitting example.)			"

												I fully enjoy this game and even though it's still early access it's still worth picking up.Basicly it's a puzzlegame where you connect stations represented by different shapes and transfer passenger, represented by corresponding shapes between them. It got tons of replay value with its random stationplacing which ensures that you'll try out new strategies for each game.Edit: It has gotten a lot better after release. More maps, different modes and more of a progression.			"
