												It is a very simple concept but still very enjoyable and a great time killer. It is also the best puzzler/ adventure game on the market which successfully combines farm animals and aliens. 4/5.    "

Sleeping, running around!+ You are an alien ship, kidnapping these animals without disturbing them to point of self-destruction. You gotta be smooth :O+ Graphics are cartoon-like and colorful.+ Sounds are fun and not annoying.+ Lots of levels & multiplayer option.Have fun. "

												Flock! Flock! Flock!I bought this Game on a sale for 99 Cents and it makes sooo much fun. Im sitting here, play that game and I´m laughing because its so funny to see the ships, bunnys, bulls and chicken run away. All Levels are different and challanging, its not easy to reach in all levels gold.Game also works very smooth with my XBOX360 Gamepad. You also can create your owen map, I tried it a bit out but a tutorial would be very helpfull for the first time. I didn`t tried the Multiplayer yet and I think now (2014) there is no Multiplayer more because gamespy is dead. I wish they would do this game Steamworks and add Steamworkshop so you can create and share your map and download maps from other player.I realy would give this game 10 points but since it only work 60% I have to give it 7 from 10 points.Single player makes realy fun and 99 Cents (on sale price) its worth to buy.

												Sometimes in life we need to be introspective, and ask ourselves difficult questions...questions which require us to look deep within and examine the very essence of our core and being.      With that weighty premise in mind, ask yourself THIS question:  Have I ever wanted to abduct sheep (and cows and chickens) by using a small UFO to bully them into a bigger UFO?  If you answered yes, then:  A. You are probably a very bad person (or an alien); and B. You just might enjoy Flock!  I know I'M enjoying it, even if the experience is a tad frustrating at times (think ""♥♥♥♥ me, soooo close...do I really have to play this level AGAIN?"")...but on the whole, a very ""cute"" and cleverly-constructed puzzle game, and one that's not toooo hard (at least not so far...I'm up to level 15 or so).     Oh, and just in case you require further existential impetus:  MOST HILARIOUS SHEEP SOUND EFFECTS IN VIDEO GAME HISTORY.  And the music is pretty ♥♥♥♥in' groovy, too.  About the only thing it's severely lacking in is MONKEYS, but hey, you can't have everything (its longevity and replayability may also be up to some question, but for this price, you'd have to be an♥♥♥♥♥to complain)... Verdict: 9/10.			"

												Not really my style.  It's less a puzzle game, more a speed challenge.  Push the animals toward the mother ship, do your best to keep them from falling off a cliff or falling behind, and get the bare minimum there before the time runs out to seal your gold medal.  I don't think it's a bad game, so, strange as it may seem, I'm recommending it on a conditional basis.  If a more arcade-y, challenge-type game is what you're looking for have at it.  If you're wanting a cerebral experience, probably not.  (It does depend on how smart you are to begin with, I suppose.)			"

												This game ist totally hillarious while being absolutely serious fun at the same time.All you have to do is chasing animals with your UFO to your mothership. Over time the levels get more difficult by adding obstacles, introducing various animal types to chase and even some enemies like wolves that can get really annoying while trying to do a double gold star rating on some of the levels.As a child I had a toy that was an enclosed A4 shaped plasctic case with a clear top covering filled with little plastic pieces that you had to push around with a little truck that was moved by using a magnet under the bottom of the case. Somehow this game reminds me of it.I had great fun with this thing during my childhood and man am a I having fun with this game here now.I can totally recommend this game to everybody who likes a deep challenge from a game that looks so cute while being brutally difficult at times to master.And the music ... you've got to listen to the music in the main menu. Man I love that sh*t oozing that 70's scifi flair out of every inch ...(Though I have to admit while it's perfectly playable with your standard X-Box Controller, playing with your keyboard and mouse could get a little bit complicated as the difficulty keeps rising in the higher levels making it nearly impossible to win the missions without a controller ... you know what? This game is the perfect excuse for you to finally get yourself a Controller too ... I'm serious!) Check the demo, have fun with it and then go an buy the game. It's totaly worth every penny they're asking for it. "

												Though some of the levels are a bit tricky to get a gold perfect abduction on, it is possible...with some practice of course. The music is fitting and it's upbeat, the controls can be changed from to completely mouse, to completely keyboard...or a mix of the two. This is for a casual gamer, someone who enjoys playing games but isn't out to get into anything too serious and is more or less just looking for something to pass time on. Another benefit is that levels can be replayed at anytime, should you find yourself getting silver instead of gold. The game also provides upgrades throughout your playing experience so that you are not just stuck with threatening to abduct and can't.Bottom line: if you're a casual gamer, like me...then this is for you.

												What all the reviews say is true about Flock.  But there are two features I did not find in any of them that make it a thumbs-down for me.  One, this is a score-game.  The point of playing is to generate a score, not to encourage good gameplay.  This is closely tied-in with the timer in the game - it isn't a game about abducting livestock well, it's a game about doing it fast.  This is a twitch game with no button mashing.  Second, the key to what gameplay there is depends on inefficient controls.  The controls deliberately are less accurate than the player's movements.  This isn't always bad in game - Banjo Kazooie Nuts & Bolts did a pretty good job of it, creating a zany (often hilarious) environment.  In Flock, I find it annoying.  The game is simply using time pressure + unreasonable control to create a frenzied atmosphere.  The concept and visual presentation are good.  The gameplay is lacking.  The soundtrack relentlessly insists that you keep raising your blood pressure, but the slow movements of the spaceship prevent you from achieving the frenzied pace that the music demands.  A secondary annoyance is that while gameplay is 98% mouse motions, you have to keep leaving the mouse to press Enter at all the menus (you cannot point at click at menu options), and you have to use the above-mentioned inefficient controls to select your next map (you must hover the spaceship over the map name, and it has the same tendency to miss the target as it does during gameplay.  The UI sometimes frustrates efforts to maneuver low enough to select certain maps).  The graphics are charming, but if you're trying to get the gold medal you won't have a half-second to appreciate them.  If you thrive on chaotic tension in a game and are not too concerned about gameplay depth, it might be a good buy.  The cuteness is there.			"
