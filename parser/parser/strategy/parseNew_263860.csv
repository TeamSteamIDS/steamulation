												On the outside: Appears to have huge potential for stripping strategy combat down to its core.On the inside: Build more fighters faster, win the game. It doesn't matter what defenses you've built, how your economy is better set up, etc. If you have fewer fighters, you will lose. The ""combat"" system/simulator does not evenly distribute damage or focus in any way. It's completely random and can result in fights of 15v15 with one side taking no casualties, just minor damage spread across the board, while the opposing side is completely wiped.I don't recommend. Combat has been stripped down too far resulting in a loss of player control over their own ships and a ridiculous imbalance in even close fights.			"

												This at it's core is a straight forward graph analysis strategy game. It's simple to a fault after about an hour of play. The gameplay provides a series of graph maps that have three variables of defenses to overcome, the player has 5 options to construct fighting more the time than the actual difficulty, but often time for the objectives.The main issue I have with the game is that the construction done by the AI is constrained by different rules than the player; to put it flatly it cheats. The AI seemingly constructs ships out of bases at intervals rather than based upon the rules that the player must follow to construct ships, yielding an artificial difficulty that is thinly veiled once one starts pursuing other solutions of the objective maps.While the mechanics of the game are solid for a game of it's genre, it's very flat in comparison to it's peers and feels more like a stripped down board game for the computer.

												TL;DR - good for a few hours, lacks the replay value that good strategy games should have.Starts well as a really simple strategy game but quickly deteriorates into near-impossible missions that can only be completed if you divine the rules that they don't tell you. As if that wasn't enough, the same rules aren't applied consistently in later missions - it's a completely different game each time.Add to that the fact that the AI plays by different rules to the player - if there are no shipyards or ships in an area then a player cannot summon more ships fom nowhere, but your opponent can. This really detracts from any strategies you might try to use and turns it into a simple resource management game. A really simple one - practically speaking, your only resource is time.The thing I love about strategy games is that it's all down to the player and you can learn to do it better. This game deprives you of that fundamental feature.			"

												WARNING: No saving mid-mission.For some this won't be much of an issue.  To others, like me, who cannot commit to long sessions this essentially renders the game unplayable unless you stick to the smallest of maps.  As far as I'm concerned, then, the game is fundamentally broken.  The developers were very dismissive when I contacted them about it, so I'll return the favour and not bother to write anything else about the game.			"

												TL;DR below.SPACECOM is a simple game of empire management and combat. In terms of graphics, it features a nice, simplified and sleek aesthetic and it looks pretty great visually.The game itself centers around (in my opinion) the following concepts:Planetary defense: resources travel on the straight lines seen on the map. Some planets generate resources, some planets can repair units, and some planets can build them. To build units or planet upgrades, the resources must actually travel to that location. Your units can choose to fly by enemy planets, rushing by to hit targets not adjecent to your planets, but a DOT (damage over time) is applied to units in enemy territory, making this a risky (but sometimes necessary) strategy.Ship-management: choose what ships to build - attempt to counter your opponent's composition. Mostly this consists of making sure that your opponent's fighters are not engaged with your non-fighter units. Also: units rank up and attack faster if ranked up.Unit-harassment. For instance: right before a blitz against a planet, send a single fighter to where your opponent is holding the majority of their forces. This will delay that fleet significantly since that fleet must first destroy the attacking ship, wait for the combat timer to end and then move to the attacked planet. Another example would be harassing an enemy point by constantly contesting it with a single unit to prevent resource-flow through that point.In my opinion, this is on the surface an okay concept - it pushes the players to be aware of the battlefield and thinking quickly since there is no way to pause.However, the following issues are prevalent:Inaccuracy in and partial lack of travel timers. When an enemy fleet is moving towards one of your planets, a timer is displayed showing how long it will take for that fleet to reach said destination. There are two issues with this: the travel timer is given for the entire route, not the next destation, making it in many cases useless. You are not given a preview travel timer when trying to figure out if you can reach one of the intermediate planets by the time the enemy fleet passes it. Which sort of brings me to the next point:When does a fleet actually pass an intermediate planet? The fleet-icon can be literally next to the planet itself and it will be counted as ""no longer on that planet"" - simply because the next travel has started. Meaning that the timing-window here is really really small. It seems that the fleet is only on intermediate planets for a single simulation-step.Fighter superiority. The entire game basically ends up being a race for the numerical superiority in terms of fighters while holding enough ships to be able to do ground invasions against critical planets holding the key resources. This means that there are two basic early-game build-orders: either go fighter-heavy, deny your opponent the right to expand or try to create a balanced force of fighters and ships used to capture planets.No global build-queue. This is just a huge pain. If you decide to build two things at the same time, it feels really random in what order the build-tasks will receive resources. Optimally, you queue in such a way that you have always-rising resource-bars on all tasks - starving and overfeeding none of them. This is a micro-heavy and quite boring task, however: achieving this is hard - if not impossible and should've been done by the game itself.Combat randomization. I think this might be the biggest problem. There is no strategy in combat - only random. 1v1 between units with the same rank always ends the same: mutual destruction, however, the moment there are two units involved, everything might flip rapidly in someone's favour. Instead of focus-firing on the first unit in the enemy fleet or letting the player set an overall tactic, all fire is random. This means that in a 2v2 between equal units, you can have situation where one side is always focus-firing, taking out the enemies in exactly 5 shots per ship (in the case of fighters) while perhaps not even sustaining casualties because the enemies incidentally spread the fire.Rigged campaign. AI does not need resources to produce ships. This means that it isn't possible to deny resources or apply certain concepts while playing the campaign.AI doing senseless things that incidentally may bring up the difficulty curve. The campaign AI loves to send a single ship which is used to capture planets against 3 of your fighters. At other times, it manages to perfectly coordinate a joint strike from multiple directions against a single target - completely murdering your units there.Not possible to auto-siege or auto-invade. You don't want to have your units floating around enemy planets or even neutral ones. It delays your strategy, it makes your units take damage (if around enemy planets) and it is a boring chore to constantly check if your invasion forces are doing their job. An option to auto-invade the destination planet should be added.Lack of at-a-glance information: you can't see how combat is going unless you click on the system where the combat is happening. You can see what kind of ships there are on a given system, but not the amount of said ships nor their total health.Lack of a minimap.TL;DR begins here:While the concepts included in this game are in general not a bad idea, parts of the execution of said ideas has suffered. Most notably certain visual apects (unit-positions), resource-management and combat randomization. Overall, this gives the game a very shallow feel and it often feels that in some battles.. the RNG just said ""NO"".To the developer:Test out combat tactics and consider making health something which is always continuous and make damage distribute evenly.

SPACECOM is a space strategy game with a simple to understand, yet entertaining gameplay. If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.What is happening in the game:There are multiple planets in the galaxy. You have a different task to complete in each mission, but mostly, you have to beat the enemy or capture the planets. Although the game is very simple to understand, you will spend quite some time thinking and planning the strategy to beat the mission.Pros: The Concept and Its Execution | You there are 3 different types of spaceships and each one serves its purpose. Those ships can be directed to a planet to conquer, attack or defend. It's a concept seen in quite a few games, but this one just feels one level higher with the ships that even have ranks and health! Game's Graphics | This game looks 2D on the screenshots, but it's actually more than that. I'm not sure whether this is just a really well-made illusion or the real deal, but when you move you camera around the galaxy, they look like you're slightly rotating a sphere with planets on it. Otherwise, the universe in the background looks the way it should and the overall visuals are kind of peaceful and pleasant to look at (which is important, as you may spend a long time playing just a single multiplayer match). Gameplay Hours Quantity | There are 13 missions in the game, which might not seem a lot, but you should know that you will fail some of them a considerable amount of times. Also, each one of them has optional objectives, which is many extra hours for completionists. There is also Multiplayer mode and Skrimish mode, which is basically a giant map with many enemies to beat. Pretty cool and even more time-consuming! The Soundtrack | The soundtrack consists of subtle songs, perfectly fitting the gameplay and the space environment. As it should be, it's a soundtrack that doesn't bore you after a long game, even though you heard a lot of it. Simplicity | I have to confess that I'm not the best player when it comes to playing or, rather, understanding this type of games. But, undoubtedly, this game is simple for players to understand, which is great in my opinion. I got used to the controls pretty quick and started solving puzzles in no time. Pricing | This game costs 9€ and, in my opinion, it is indeed worth it. The price used to be higher, but the developer lowered it after a number of suggestions from the community, which was a very good move. OS and Steam Support | You can enjoy this game from Windows, Linux and MacOS along with the Steam Achievements, Cloud, Leaderboards and Trading Cards!Cons: No Save Function | I am really bothered by the lack of the saving/loading function. As I mentioned a couple of times above, matches or puzzles can take a long time and it would be cool to be able to save the game. Online Leaderboards | It's cool that this feature is included, but everybody on the Leaderboards is labeled as [Unknown], which makes this function pretty much useless. Duration and Speed of the Game | Building ships, attacking and other actions take ages. Although you have the ability to speed up time, it's still kind of slow. It's not a big problem, except if you're short on time and you want to do a quick game or a mission.The final verdict:This game is good-looking and it's concept is executed as it should be, so I think this game certainly deserves my recommendation. For its low price and long included game time, it's a pretty good deal. I enjoyed playing it mostly because of its simple yet exciting gameplay.Greetings,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

												While the premise and concept of the game both were big selling points for this game, I cannot recommend it. Beginning Issues:1. Nobody Plays Multiplayer - While there is a structure for having MP games, there is no one to play with online. The most people I have seen online at one time were three, including myself. 2.  AI Games are just bad - There is really no other way to say this, but in the two hours that I have played this game, it has only been against AI. These games typically amount to me pushing forward and finding the ""battle-line"" and then holding that until I can make enough units to move forward. Now one might think that to be the appropriate way to wage war in this setting, but the games eventually become a grind of fighting off waves of enemies that are too small to do any serious damage to your fleet and that just hurl themselves at you using no particular strategy. This is further more exasperated by the fact that the MP community is dead. More Serious Issues: 1. AI - FIX IT2. Concept - While the concept is what drew me in at first, it soon became clear that it was a lot harder to execute than planned. In game, there are only 3 types of ships, Invading ships (for taking over planets), frigates (for fighting other starships), and the destroyers (they just destroy planets so enemies cannot use resouces). While only having three types of ships may fit the ""simplistic"" theme of the game, it is almost too simplistic, making the game boring because of the lack of variety. Summation:Overall, I really wanted to like this game. I really thought that the concept was interesting and different, and at first glance, the developers have done a good job with the base game. But when looking at the greater picture, the boring mechanics, the grindy gameplay, the $hit AI, and the Empty MP, I simply can't recommend this.			"

												The Real-time-strategy genre in many ways represents one of the far poles of videogames, sitting across from the visceral in-the-moment combat of fighting games. They speak to a different part of the competitive psyche, and stand unparalleled in their capacity to exemplify the sense of utter victory. From the alternate, war-torn histories of Sid Meier’s Civilization franchise, to the immortalized institution of chess, the RTS is our modern avatar into the pressures and considerations that come with the title commander. Flow Combine’s Spacecom is an elegantly simple and intensely engaging addition to this long-standing history.As far as the “why’s” go, Spacecom is not a game that a person is going to play for the story and it never advertises itself as such. You are a commander for the Sol Dominion, a far future conglomeration of planets, who is thrust into the low-gravity thralls of battle when a suspected terrorist attack ignites the fires of war. As you earn the respect and faith of your leaders through your har- fought victories, you’re placed in charge of larger expanses of territory, ordered to achieve more elusive goals, and forced to push back the enemies who seek to destroy you. Pretty straight forward.As the game’s first few stages kick the tires of your strategic mind, the first thing most players are going to notice is this game’s bare-bones aesthetic. The flash and spectacle that many modern gamers may have come to expect in an RTS is nowhere to found here. Even the icons that represent your various units are only slightly altered versions of the same pizza-shaped wedges that stand in for your various fleets. This, however, isn’t an early sign of a low-budget experience to come, but rather an indication of a true strategic simulator. Distractions, even that of the slow, hypnotic troll of your icons across the board can quickly mean defeat if they pull your attention away from a colony under siege. The only thrills Spacecom wants you to focus on is that of the shifting tides of battle, and of that there will be plenty.Whether it’s you versus the AI or other living opponents, all the units that will be available to you will be the same, primarily consisting of three different types of combat fleets. Battle fleets excel at ship-to-ship assault, Invasion fleets are necessary to capture enemy or neutral territories, and Siege fleets can raze defeated planets, making them unusable for anyone (Except for corpses I suppose). While all these units are purpose-built for particular functions, they can engage one another with varying efficiency, depending on the configuration. While your units will gain a type of experience from surviving multiple battles, making them more hardy and reliable to perform minor military miracles, learning the rock –paper-scissors of what-beats-what is at the heart of Spacecom. While in-game unit creation and deployment is part of the strategy just like any RTS, time is very much a critical factor and rarely on your side. Having to fight off several enemy waves while still waiting for one additional fleet to be produced is a common affliction, and one you will need to learn how work toward your advantage. Sure, maybe your four Siege fleets will peel apart like tissue paper while holding the line against six venerated Invasion groups, but if they can hold out for those few precious minutes while your primary Battle group finishes mopping up a prior engagement and races to their location, you may suddenly and violently claim a surprise victory.The options don’t begin and end with fleet deployments, however. Different star system offer different benefits or limitations, varying how much (and more importantly, how quickly) they can be fortified, their wealth of required resources, and whether they’re a vital locale that must held at all costs or just a navigational junction for doing battle. All the systems in the game are linked via “lanes” which are essential for directing your fleets throughout the cosmos and ferrying supplies. Capturing, obstructing, or even pirating these trans-galactic freeways is as much a part of being victorious as having the dominant fleet in the area. Fleets on the move must pass through systems in order reach their destination, and even if there is only one enemy vessel between them and that location, they must stop and engage. This makes attrition a very real and functional strategy in the game, so much so that ships that are even just orbiting enemy control planets take regular “attrition” damage until they either conquer the world, depart, or are destroyed. I know I lost many a fleet when after I took down an enemy battle group in a foreign system, I shifted my attention away to another engagement, only to look back and see my once victorious units vaporized.But, even if it was only a passing thought, do not mistake simple for easy. If you’re slow to pick up even the early lessons the game is willing to share with you, just the tutorial sections of this game will quickly flatten you or shame you with a frustrated “click” of the surrender option. This game’s beauty is found in its minutia, and the flexibility a clever mind can carve out of its few rules. No two battles will ever go the same, and thinking ahead as far as possible is the only thing that will weed the weak from the strong. Sacrificing a planet to choke enemy supply lines, baiting your enemy with well-timed feints or changes to your fleet’s course, or even the classic massive attack with dozens of units is all possible here if you are willing and able to learn Spacecom’s finer points. Spacecom is a super-fun strategy game, and a truly unpretentious take on the RTS genre. The minimalist approach, patient and finely honed execution, and truly limitless amount of replay value that combination offers is something rarely seen in an era so overwrought with style-over-substance entertainment. This game is a must-buy for any RTS gamer, and a definite recommendation to anyone who enjoys real strategic competition.			"

												Very simple, slow paced RTS/tactics game where you trundle your ball of Rock/Paper/Scissors ships across connected nodes and conquer the galaxy via a grind of yawn-inducing attrition. Whoever gets bored and closes the game first loses. Has a lot of annoying mechanics, like the fact that just one enemy ship touching your production planets shuts down all production and destroys resources going to that planet until the ship is destroyed, plus an extra 8 seconds for some reason.Oh, and that thing I said about Rock/Paper/Scissors was being overly generous, since one ship type beats the other two ship types, both of which are just for capturing/conquering planets. So it's more like... Rock/Inanimate Object That You Have No Real Control Over/Scissors.			"

												Great game, fun low-key visuals, great music, and the action can get frantic in the late game. I easily give this a 7/10 but as far as counting on multiplayer to keep going, its a 0/10 since nobody plays it anymore. The single player campaign is quite good, but only truly gets challenging in the very last mission, which leaves you wanting more. Sadly no more is to be had. You can play skirmish vs the AI, but even on the highest difficulty, they can be overwhelmed by rushing them. A fun little strategy gem worth playing between friends if you can.			"

												Lovin' the look of this game. Highly recommended if you are really into the pros listed below but are willing to put up with some missing features (in my opinion).PROS:- Awesome minimalist & stylish interface (probably one of my favorites)- Great ambient music and sound effects- Various difficulty levels- Overall very accessible & easy to pick up for an RTS- Games can be as quick or as long as you want them to be depending on map size- Simplified design with abstractions at just the right places while maintaining a strong emphasis on strategy & deep gameplaySuggested improvements:- Keyboard shortcuts -- This is a must for any fast-paced RTS. For example, it would be great to be able to bookmark my shipyard so that I could hit ""1"" then ""A"" to build a battle fleet without having to keep locating it on the map and navigating through the menu to queue a unit.- The ability to set a waypoints or rally points for resulting shipyard production. Oftentimes my shipyards are at least a couple hops away from where I want my forces to end up.- Another player on the forum suggested the ability to see ""at-a-glance"" how well I'm performing in a battle without having to click on the battle itself. This would be extremely helpful in hectic situations where multiple battles are occurring simultaneously.- An at-a-glance display of the number of units of each type currently occupying a system. Instead of having the one icon indicating just the types of units present, there might be two icons if you had for example both a battle fleet and an invasion fleet. Both icons would have their corresponding fleet counts listed. (Or maybe just three counts next to the single icon?) This would be very helpful for quickly planning strategies to amass forces proportionately.Overall though, a game with a lot of promise; it's very easy to sink a bunch of hours in it the way it is.  Keep up the good work devs.			"

												Though this is a bit ""i wish there was meh-choice""; I would recommend this, though with following notices:- I feel it lacks depth with only 3 types of ships you can build, and nothing called ""research"".- The soundtrack is pretty nice and suits the game and it's atmosphere.- Don't expect it to be neither Homeworld, Red Alert or even Supremacy; It's definitely NOT!- The game i find most comparable to this game is DEFCON.But with that in mind, i think you wont get dissapointed.

												Fun and addictive no-frills, casual RTS.Simple controls, graphics and maps makes for easy navigation and play. You can attack enemies planets and/or defend your own, invade and capture new ones, or lay waste to them in order to hinder your enemies' progress.However all is not perfect. Everything is nail-bitingly slow paced, from ship building and repairing to resource mining. There is way too much room for improvement, and sometimes it almost feels like the project was abandoned after the very basics were finished, just so it could be marketed.Traveling between planets can be quite frustrating as once you set your path you cannot retreat half-way through: you have to reach the original destination first, meaning that sometimes you're forced to engage in battles you didn't intend to.Also, there are no ship or colony upgrades. You cannot make your fleet more powerful, nor can you speed up production, repairing and mining, for example.When playing solo, the AI can be pretty dumb, often favouring siege over invasion, meaning that you'll end up with a whole lot of destroyed planets long before you have the chance to reach them.Even with all the negatives, I think it's still worth a shot, but not if you're planing to pay the Steam price of course (*cough* indie bundle websites *cough*).And last... it's got cards, so if you can get it for a few cents then the cards should pay for most of it.

												I really want to love this game ! And if I manage to play a few multiplayer games, I might be able to like it. I love how it looks simple, how it allows to play a multiplayer strategic game in less than an hou, how it allows the player to take its time. I do also really like the look of the game and its mecanism :Few units with very distinct roles, feed lines that can be hijacked, simple fog of war and combat sytem giving its full value to scouting and sentries, simple but efficient planet upgrades, highest speed in systems you control... Really, that's plenty of clever and well thought minimalist mecanism.However, when the developers states ""Heavily focused at multiplayer"", it does not mean that multiplayer is particularly weel done. Actually, many features are missing to correctly organise games and interract with your oponents. No what it means, is that simple player, and more specifically the AI, is a joke.First, the AI does not follow the same rules as the player : ships are produced at their headquarter. The ennemy does not even try to develop its economy, nor properly attack you. It knows how to produce ships in its factories, but rarely does so. While conquering an HQ, I noticed that it was filled with siege and invasion ships : enough to wipe out half of the map, and conquere the rest. But none of these ships had ever moved from there. Worse : the ennemy did not seem to have produced any fighter, which could have helped him, against my strike. So, it really feels like the dev did not even try to implement any kind of AI, or that if they tried to do so, countless bugs severely crippled it down.""Missions"" might be more interresting, but they play like tower defense.So my only hope to fully appreciate this game would be a proper AI update, a more efficient way to organize multiplayer games (taking in account player scarcity), or be lucky enough to have someone logging at the same time as me...There is some great potential there. But the game needs more love !Should I recommand it ? Well, if you are ready to wait for someone and play multiplayer yes. Otherwise, no. Or hopefully, not yet...			"

												This was a very fun game, the campaign was neat (but short!) and the game is simple to get the hang of but actually has some layers of tactics. However, there is one big flaw: The AI is too easy. After playing the campaign, which wasn't terribly difficult, I attemped skirmish against two Medium AI's and completely wiped the floor with them. Then I tried against two Expert AI and did the same thing - the AI just kept sending single ship attacks for the most part. I very much enjoyed the few hours I spent in this game, but as of now there is nothing left for me. The online part is empty, it said there were five players but I couldn't see a game and nobody joined my game for a half hr (I expected it to be at least somewhat populated since it is in the Humble Bundle currently). The Skirmishes are too easy. The campaign doesn't offer that much replayability, the few optional objectives are mostly just ""don't lose more than X ships"" or ""complete mission in under X minutes"" which isn't really my thing.Had I paid $10, I might have been disappointed that I only got a few hours out of the game. At $3, I am more than happy with the money I spent on it. If there was more to do in the game (longer campaign, map editor, more difficult AI, etc) I'd pay $10.It is currently in HumbleBundle and Steam sale for $3 or less, and at that price: BUY IT! :)			"

												TL;DR: Not flashy, not tactical; pure and unadulterated grand strategy with a beautiful atmosphere and deep, satisfying mechanics. Easily worth twice the price.This game is everything I've wanted in space grand strategy since I played Empire at War at age 10. The atmosphere, conveyed by the cleverly-animated background, the consistent and beautiful UI style, and the brilliant but subtle music, is reminiscent of DEFCON: Everybody Dies. While the game might appear simplistic and shallow on the surface, the variety and quality of the maps and a well-thought-out, perfectly balanced array of game mechanics makes it infinitely re-playable, especially with friends.A must for: anyone who wanted to be Ender, who likes DEF CON, or who thinks that the Galactic Map was the best part of Star Wars: Empire at War. This game is effectively the same as playing SWEaW in Galactic Map and always using autoresolve (but, of course, much better balanced for that purpose).Avoid it if: you preferred Call of Duty: Modern Warfare to Supreme Commander in 2007, or if what you most appreciate most in Total War games is watching the little men fight.

												Spacecom is a strategic-to-the-bone starfleet-command game with a heavy focus on multiplayer. Using 3 types of fleets (siege, invade, battle) and 4 types of planetary systems (hubs, shipyards, repair yards and supply systems) command your armies to dominate in the galaxy. Capture enemy hubs using proven maneuvers learned from military legends (blitzkrieg, burnt-ground, cut supply lines, outflanking) or devise your own plans. Raise smart thinking over fast clicking in galaxies with up to 6 players in Multiplayer mode.The music and sounds floating around in the background are nice – they give off a feeling of floating in space, listening to radio traffic. The music is standard for a space game, with ethereal haunting notes that seem to echo around your speakers or headphones.SPACECOM keeps things relatively simple. No tech trees, no ship modification, no complex planet management. Instead, you have three fleet types – Battle, Invasion and Siege. How you use the fleets you build to control systems is important, since your opponent is working against you every second of the game. You’ll also be able to build things like a Kinetic Shield to slow the enemy from controlling a system (and it makes a huge difference during space battles, since enemy fleets may focus their fire on the shield instead of your fleet), Battle Stations to fight back, and Ground troops to slow enemy invaders from conquering the planets. The fleets are were it counts, though.All in all, SPACECOM is a game that will have strategical/tactical gamers coming back. Why? Because it’s deceptively easy and fun. You have a rating, as well, to tell you how well or bad you’re doing, but don’t let that get you down. You can win games just by being persistent.So, to sum up – SPACECOM – It’s a strategy/tactical game about planning and executing that uses minimal graphics, simplistic units and easy to learn. If you like games with depth that don’t involve hours of research and detailed space battles, then you’ll like SPACECOM. If you like fast, real-time strategy with tense moments, you’ll like SPACECOM. If you want to fly a ship around space, track every little detail about every battle, micromanage planets down to the individual citizens … well, SPACECOM may not be your thing.Good luck and have fun everyone!

												Great game, super fun. It's simple but addicting. RTS boiled down to basics without a bunch of different resources and confusing unit types.Unfortunately it's lost all my save game progress. I emailed support, and also just looked around for cheats. I don't really care about my saved games, I just want to be able to play the next level! It's a critical bug for me, sadly. Otherwise I would strongly recommend this game!			"

An awesome take on a well established genreSPACECOM is a really neat game that takes on the well established 4X genre, boils it down to its most simple elements and presents it in a very approachable and playable fashion.  Somewhat akin to chess this doesn't ultimately make the game any less complex or deep because beneath the simple surface lies a hard-core strategy game that provides some amazing experiences.  Adding to the experience is the dichotomy that this game is both fast and slow.  What I mean is that you can play out a full battle in just 20 minutes, though most scenarios are longer, but in each session you can change strategies and try a different approach multiple times.  Bad decisions are not always fatal and often you can flip your entire approach around and claim victory from what you thought would have been defeat.  As you play you begin to see this shifts in strategy as mega strategies in themselves.Overall SPACECOM puts hard-core 4X strategy in a neat and simple to learn multiplayer package.  It's the kind of game where even when you lose you are usually having fun.  And isn't that the point of any game?One note, the single player experience is pretty simple and the AI fairly easy to defeat.  The real action is in multiplayer.  However with a small community around this game expect to open a game room and wait a bit before someone joins.  That said, your patience is almost always rewarded.			"

												SPACECOM is a space RTS similar to that of ""Planets Under Attack"" in that you'll build fleets and move them around to capture solar systems.  It's easy to pick up and play, I thought, but the different fleet and planet types serve to keep things strategic and interesting,  Well worth the asking price of $14.99.

												Spacecom: A Beta ReviewPlaying this game for at least 8 of my 9 hours, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The idea behind the game is to simply build and conquer, either destroying the enemy or invading them with the three different units in the game. Gameplay can be slow at times, going through the motions if you would, but at times of getting rushed by 3 AI on expert it gets pretty fast (and upsetting.) The artwork for this game is very simplistic. In general, most or all of the art is 2D but since the game is played through an eagle's eye view, moving around gives the game dimension.While playing, bots/AI were either very easy after the first few times to extremely obnoxious. It took me a while to figure out the strategy of the bots in each difficulty, but after around 3-4 matches you could understand how to beat them fast.Mulitplay was the trickier bit for me. As of now, I've played 7 matches online, but dropping out for a total of 3 of them. The 4 games that were actually played were fun considering I knew I was against another person. The only recommendation I would ask for multiplayer is some kind of reconnect timer (such as DotA 2's 5 minute until it's safe to leave or StarCraft 2's minute timer) since beta still has issues in servers.Overall, fun game, pretty simple to grasp, PLENTY of strategies to find out.

												[THIS REVIEW IS BEING MADE ON THE BETA VERSION OF THE GAME. I'LL REMOVE THIS MARK WHEN/IF I UPDATE THE REVIEW LATER ON WHEN THE GAME IS OFFICIALLY LAUNCHED.]Mess something up and let the rage of space rain on you.SPACECOM is a pretty simple game with a pretty simple goal. Take over the galactic territory of your enemy. You must gather resources to face off what could secretly be a large empire.In this game you are faced against an opponent and you must both learn to use your ships to either invade, destroy or attack galaxies and enemy. You must withstand the pressure when being attacked and use cunning to send your ships at the right time. It's all up to you if you wish to get resources first, start by devastating the enemy before he can do the same or even come up with a wicked strategy that will blow your enemy away!I recommend this game if you are willing to encounter stressful situations. Victories are highly satisfactory because they are proof of your effort and good work.Bear in mind it is stressful sometimes to watch an immense wave of enemy spaceships fall over you and take away all the things you acquired with your effort. So consider this before getting the game.Good luck. You'll need it.			"

Every game I've played multiplayer I've learned a new facet of this game and have seen a full spectrum of strategies from the other players.I've had some disconnection issues during games, which sucks. I think that's the worst part of the multiplayer. Try to keep it in the same region when picking multiplayer games.As the game gets populated the games should pick up.I definitely recommend this game.			"

												Well visualized! The game is ""Simple, but affective"". For what I've seen, the game is small. The RMB move trick was hard to find. Took me a few minutes to figure out. The game itself is ""slow"", but honestly thats the way to play this game. Also the FF or FFF buttons are great! Missed them in almost every strategy game since the Tycoon games. The game is hard to understand for someone who does not play strategy games, but it's like Portal sais, ""Keep Calm And Continue Testing"". If you want a small game just to try out, (would work better on a Tablet tho), this game is worth a try. Gameplay: 7 the (Simple) Visual style: 9.Note: The sound the menu buttons make is not very nice :S.			"

A sure sign that the programmers have never built a computer in their lives, and enjoy spending twice as they need on pre-made crap computers from Walmart.There's nobody on multiplayer at any time of the day, even on weekends, because this game is so terrible that nobody wants to play it, and the AI is so terrible that single player isn't enjoyable either.

												Wow! I am happy I bought this game, this is a real gem, the game is well made and so far I have not noticed any bugs, I love the background sounds and the distorted radio effects, they are incredible, they give you that feel you really are in space, I recommend headphones! so whats the game about? it is a real time strategy game where the gameplay is very simular to Sins of the solar empire games, or Starwars Empire maybe is more the hammer on the nail, if you like that kind of game play you will love this game, you capture the solar systems and build improvements on them, you can build 3 things, first is a battlestation, second is a shield, and third is ground forces on the planet, wich makes them a lot harder to re-conquer, there are 3 kinds of planets ""systems"" and 3 kind of spaceships, the first planet or solar system is a repair system, where you can repair your ships after battle, production planets are to build the 3 different ship models, and the third planet? I really haven't figured that out yet, the ships you can build are, battle fleets, these are the ones you destroy enemy ships with if you haven't figured out, the second ship is invasion fleets, you must have these to being able to invade, it's really self explainatory, and the third ship is siege ships, so what can you do with those? take a wild guess! I played this game for 2 hours now and I would have played longer if I didn't win, ""easy settings"" there are easy normal hard, this is the kind of strategy game you can play when you want to kill a few hours but not days. and it's great fun. well, if you have the settings to hard then maybe it will take days, I have great hopes for this developer in the future, I think there will be something really awesome to come. so what do I think about this game? it's awesome, I can see my self playing hundreds of hours in the future, even it is not deep in any stretch of the imagination, it is definitely a very simple game, there are no diplomacy, no research, then you probably think this just a crap game, it is not! the game is incredibly good and it is well made and nicely polished and the sounds are like from heaven, so then you might wonder why is it so good even when it apear so thin? the game is good at ocupying you to strategize how to beat the enemy, it is good to let you experience the kind of gameplay of games like Sins without the need to do a lot of research before you attack, you just dive right into it. go buy it now! it's well worth the full price.

												The campaign structure and story leaves a lot to be desired, but the simplistic mechanics (3 ship types, 2 types of structures and 1 type of land infantry) means that it is easy to get into. The game has an interesting mechanic where going over your unit capacity is permitted, but with a heavy penalty to production so using a small fleet is a rewarding strategy. And looking at what is in a system it is very easy to estimate who will win a battle so you can conserve resources if a large fleet attacks you. I also like that destroying systems is not the result of an overly expensive superweapon, but just a part of general gameplay, so running risky missions to take out a unit production facility is not only easy to cost, but worthy strategy as your opponent will have to manage without an important system.

			I try my hand at galactic battles and management with this atmospheric strategy game.		

It's not expensive. Let me start by saying that. Otherwise, this is a pretty fun strategy game that gives you three types of ships that are each good at different things (in a rock, paper, scissors kind of way) and then let you conquer the (small) galaxy.			"

Still the multiplayer has some implementations needed, like team games and a lobby chat.Anyway, the game is great fun and it does not require a 300 APM korean to play, so normal people can actually play it and enjoy it!Recommended.EDIT: not recommended anymore because game is dead, nobody playing it.

												I love this game...At first I was really torn wether to buy it or not because of some of the reviews but when I gave it a shot during a sale I got what I was expecting: A strategic game.You are a fleet commander who gets orders to conquer this or that system or (in skirmish) exterminate every other player in your cluster.Your capabilities are: Deploying forces, using infrastructure to maintain your fleet (build/repair new ships), destroying whole systems or conquering them for your own empire.Be aware that every decision you make impacts the whole game: If you destroy a star system you will not be able to use it again.Keep in mind that your empire can only support a finite amount of military infrastructure (see screenshot upper left corner), more military means more worlds to conquer.With every battle won your ships gain rank and can enhance their firing rate!If you are expecting something where you can micromanagement the ships, the planets, diplomacy --> don't get this game, buy (e.g.) Galactic Civ instead!

												The basic idea, i.e., to just keep the strategy part of a strategy game, is a good idea. However, playing the actual game feels a bit shallow. The three types of units available just feel too few. Also, due to the lack of micro management during battles makes battles boil down to be as simple as ""whoever has more fleets wins the battle"". Overall, I feel like playing a computer version of a board game. These might still not justify for a ""No"" to the recommendation of this game. The two main reasons I chose ""No"" however are the following:  The main campaign is very short and  nobody is ever online in the multiplayer section.Really, it only makes sense buying if you already have friends to play with.

Product received for free
												If you want a 4x type space game that you don't need to learn a whole manual, and you just want to get in and play for a short time instead of knowing you have to invest at least 20+ hours in one scenario, then this is a great quick game to play.It has quite a few challenging missions that teach you the game, then you can play on an assortment of maps (some will take an hour or more, others could take a few hours).  A good game to just get in and start taking over star systems.  Computer AI will take back systems that you do not protect so do you leave a few ships behind to protect them or take a chance and use them against an all out attack further up the map.  Maybe you have a hinge pin system that you think best to build a battlestation and maybe even a shield but that takes away from how many total ships you can have.  Each normal sysem you don't spend the time capturing means one less maximum fleet you can have but there are better systems that provide healing to your fleets (shipyard), or producing raw materials to speed up building more of your fleet.If the game is on sale and under $3 then you would be crazy not to get it, but if still in doubt then download the demo.  Hey, you can even play against your friends and soak up all their tears!  MadMyke bought this for me, thank you.			"

												I came in expecting the simplicity of Galcon Fusion, but got something in between Galcon Fusion and Sins of a Solar Empire (though closer to Galcon). This is a pretty good complexity level as you can understand everything. By contrast, in a game like Sins of a Solar Empire, I don't really get it all, so I end up doing stuff because it seems right, not because I really understand the nuances, which makes strategy a bit dissapointing. This is partially the games fault, and partially my fault. The first third of the tutorial (what I'm calling the incredibly short campaign/story mode) is nightmareishly painfully slow to get through at first, but gets much better about a third of the way through. They overly spell things out for you, while not explaining other things your become interested in out of bordom that they shouldn't be showing at all. I think a single page overview of all iconography and abilities (without going into strategy) would have been more ideal.The difficulties don't seem right. There are 5 settings (we'll call 1 easiest). Difficulty 4 feels like 2.6. I have yet to try difficulty 5, but will with my next game. It could be perfect (until one improves), or could be too high of a jump from 4. We'll see. Multiplayer seems non-existant. I hope you can can set it before the game starts and not change it (other than limited pausing). But I can't test any of these things. Match reporting is a bit bare bones, but does exist for a handful of stats.So it's not perfect. Nice piece, but lacks polish. General gameplay feel is fine. Could use space jumping to alters, map selection preview, line graphs stats, match time, and some other very minor things. But this game and the other two mentioned in this review are all fun. All recommended.			"

												Not a bad game... Easy Game to figure out and play... Once you understand the 3 types of Fleets very easy game to play... Veteran Fleets and Ground Troops tend to fire faster... The more Resource planets you have the faster your productions go... The game is based on strategy of understanding the star map with the resouce planets and that every system helps boost how many fleets and space stations you can build... The three main types of special planets are Resources, Repair Yards, and Building Yards... If you build Ground Troops on a Planet or use a Invasion Fleet to become Ground Troop for that Planet, the how many Fleet/Space Stations is opened up by each Invasion Fleet becomes a Ground Troop, and every Ground Troop that is built and or lost does not affect how many fleets you can have... The only main problems/draw back of the game is trying to find people for Multiplayer battles, either the game is not very popular, and or the Cross Platform Multiplayer does not work for Macs and Pcs, so Macs and Macs, PCs and PCs, and you can not save games in Skirmish Mode and Single Player Missions... The game is fun and I would still recommend it, the Multiplayer is a little bit of problem/draw back because you really have to find players to play, and also you can not save in skirmish games and Single Player you have to finish them completely...
