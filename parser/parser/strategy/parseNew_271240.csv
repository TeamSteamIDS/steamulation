Early Access Review
								I was excited to get this game - Civ4 was my favorite civ and so I expected a lot from Soren Johnson.This is a much more accessible game than Civ. The complete lack of a combat system revolutionizes the RTS genre and feels alien, yet the core mechanics can be understood within 30-45 minutes of play. The interaction of the game sytems is complex, and mastery and strategy will take a lot of time to develop.You play one of four factions, each with different bonuses and penalties. It is vital to play to your factions strengths, because you are severely resource constrained and must make difficult decisions about how to expand.You interact with other factions in five ways: the map, auctions, the stock market, the black market, and the market.On the map, you compete for resources and tile placement. Taking a key tile from another player can be enormously damaging by preventing adjacency bonuses.In auctions, you bid against other players for a special bonus. This is the most ""head-to-head"" aspect of the game. Depending on game options, you are not constrained to bidding with cash on hand. Instead, you can go into debt to purchase the item. If you arent careful, you might win an auction to your overal detriment.On the black market, you purchase attack powers. These seem to suck, though perhaps I just don't understand how to use them effectively yet. You are very rate limited in how quickly you can purchase these powers, they go up in price quickly, and they are usually very weak. Disabling a tile for 60 seconds is painful, but doesnt seem to be enough to cause any long term damage.On the stock market, you buy and sell ownership stakes in each player's faction. You win by forcibly buying out the other players.And finally the market. You buy and sell resources, and your actions affect the price of the resource. In my view, a critical weakness of the game is that the market supplies unlimited resources. Resources are not supplied by other players; instead, the market steadily raises prices. One consequence of this is that there is no resource tech race - you can buy any resources at the start of the game, which really break the idea that you are a startup colony on mars. You also get no real benefit from being the first to supply another resource.The game also gives you very limited insight into the price elasticity of demand - how much price will change in response to a purchase or sale. This is probably because there isn't a ""real"" market system. In order to allow you to buy an unlimited amount of resources on the market, the game must model its own price elasticity of demand curve. This is contrived and can fall out of sync with the specifics of each game. You also have no insight into the global supply of a given resource - there is no way to answer the question ""Is this resource cheap because no one needs it or because everyone is producing a surplus?"" Perhaps if you had some way to view the global aggregate stockpile of each resource, this could be improved.Because of the way the market functions and the lack of insight into its details, it doesn't quite feel like you are playing with other players. Again, maybe this is just due to my inexperience.There are a couple UI issues:* An easy way to see the space market price for goods.* An easy way to find your buildings/tiles on the map.* Graphics performance is ok, but not good.Overall, I'm still pretty excited about this game. Its a new idea in RTS. It greatly reduces micromanagement compared to other RTS. It needs polish, but I think its going to make for some amazing multiplayer matches. "

Early Access Review
								You *might* like this game if :You are into very simple economic gamesLike short gamesAre into realistic sci-fi themesYou won't like this game if :You like to sink your teeth into empire / engine buildingFind economic games boringYou like direct in your face interaction between playersIn the notes for this game the designer states it was his goal to create a short playing economic RTS - Starcraft based around trading not fighting if you will. A New Kind of RTS.Uh huh. Well, they've certainly succeeded. But does it work ? And is it actually new ?In the main it does not work and is not actually new. When you stop and look at what it's doing you realise it's not that far away from any of the Railroad Tycoon games - except there is no railroad building or locomotive managing here.So that comparison bears some inspection. In RT you ship goods around to make money, buy stocks, bid on auctioned inventions, buy industries all in a goal to buy out your opponents.In OTC you ship goods around to make money, buy stocks, bid on auctioned things all in a goal to buy out your opponents.Sound familiar ? The difference here ( apart from one being set on a green playing field and one being set on a red playing field ! ) is that whilst in RT the shipping and management of that shipping forms a large part of the challenge in the game, in OFC its abstracted - build your resource producing building, and you're done. The shipping just ""happens"".With the shipping abstracted the challenge in the game for a player lies elsewhere. But. Uh. Where ? Choosing what building to build next ? That's it ? What's left is a very thin game - one which comes down to cracking the (simple) puzzle of what build order you should build buildings in - whether to skip some, concentrate in others and so on. In fact this is pretty much the economical part of the RT games. There's literally nothing else to do in OTC however - apart from a bit of sabotage, which by and large comes down to paying X dollars to knock out Y building for Z seconds. Call it an EMP blast. Dynamite. An uprising. The upshot is largely the same.Given a relatively simple resource / building tree in the game ( it's a short game ) there is no complexity there either in figuring out what sneaky specialisations you can bust out or great economical wizardry you can pull off. This is definitely at the lighter end of the resource manipulation gaming tree.Also, because of the target of the game design to make a short economic RTS based game, you are never going to get into an empire building, economic engine developing kind of position that world building and economic building players typically like. This is all about getting in, making your fast bucks, and buying everyone else out in quick order. So for those that *like* those kind of economic world building games,  this game isn't going to float your boat either.There is much made of ""every game being different"" and amazing replayability, which boils down to the map being random, resources being strewn around the map randomly, and depending what small build orders people build, the price of some goods being different. Think random map creation in Railroads. Or Civ. But. It doesn't actually have a huge impact on your gameplay here - because the bit where you interact with the world is largely abstracted - you just choose what to build where. So no matter the world, or the players, you will still be sitting down every time and making a quick decision about which 3 or 4 key buildings to build in which order. Sure others can impact some of those decisions, but really, it's not going to have you in knots of chess like deliberation. It's going to have you reaching to spam the sabotage and buy shares  buttons.Despite all that I've enjoyed my time with the game, I appreciate the attempted design of the game, I like the martian theme ( which is just fluff ) but it really at this point strategically, tactically, whatever has no legs at all - its an interesting experiment, its largely met its goals, but it doesnt make for a great replayable game.If you are into the board game sphere, then this game is like a super light and simple Euro - and probably wouldn't hold your attention for more than a couple of games.One last point, the price of this game is wayyyyy too high for what you get. No way is this a premium price game, and I would say unless you either don't care about how you spend your gaming bucks, or have a desperate need to buy this game, I would avoid.			"

												I have read several negative reviews with valid criticism in them, but it rests on certain assumptions about what kind of game OTC is supposed to be. If you expect 4X, you'll be disappointed. Likewise with Starcraft. This isn't an RTS or a 4X game. It has elements of those games, but the comparison is unhelpful when trying to capture the kind of experience OTC offers.I would describe OTC as a real-time market and logistics management game, since that almost entirely describes it. You place buildings that process or gather raw materials, and placement has strategic value, since you must spend fuel to transport goods, and if your enemy is the only source of fuel, they can ruin you.There are no units to control, and building placement is highly restricted. Most of the time, you are trying to gain control of the economy by top-down actions, like choosing what to produce, buy, and sell. The bulk of the game is spent doing this, so liking this part of the gameplay is a requirement for liking the game overall.I have one major criticism, and it has to be said that this is a significant blow to the description of OTC as a market. One could expect a market simulation to take into account at least very basic economic principles. OTC does not. There is a tension between ""supply and demand"" that anyone would expect, but there's a problem with resources. Even if nobody on the map is producing something, every good is available to buy in an unlimited supply. Scarcity is never a serious concern since the amount of goods produced doesn't rely on anyone actually producing them.The quantity of goods on the market is never a factor. Also, the system of stock purchasing doesn't resemble real life. In particular, if someone can afford your stock, you must sell it, but you can never buy it back. These sacrifices were surely made to improve gameplay at the cost of simulation. This is a problem in all game development, and virtually no games get the balance right except by luck. Because of this, it's a problem I choose to forgive.My other problems are mostly about the UI/UX. For instance, lack of the ability to pause in multiplayer (except the host, and even then the option is hidden in submenus.) The lack of a minimap, and the inability to quickly and easily find and identify structures and transports are two more absent features. These things become a serious drag on the game after just a few play sessions, and will irritate players who like a good UI.My minor criticisms include a dull, drab setting (pumpkin sand forever in every direction), and ignoring a few accessibility features like color deficiency. Other than that, the AI is sub par, but again, whose isn't?Overall, I would recommend OTC because I enjoy the gameplay, but unfortunately I find it very difficult to describe the gameplay sufficiently. There's no substitute for trying it out.P.S.If you're a programmer or mathematition you would benefit from this additional information. OTC is like trying to constantly apply a linear optimization program to changing inputs. Or maybe solving a system of linear differential equations in real-time?			"

												Offworld Trading Company is an economy building simulator, set in a sci-fi futuristic space setting. The game exited Early Access on April 28th 2016. The game had been in early access for a little over a year, after initially being released in February 2015. With the developers being constantly updating the game over the past year, the game exits the process in a really strong position. The game’s introduction tutorial is very in depth but still guides you through the processes within the game in a helpful manner. To begin with I felt a little overwhelmed with all of the numbers, UI functions and other mechanics in the game, but thankfully this tutorial is one of the best I’ve seen in a long while.  The game play itself is essentially make as much money as you can, using trade markets, sabotaging your opponents and espionage.  The game takes place on Mars, there are no combat mechanics or forceful attacks to use on your opponents, and only through economy gain can you wipe them off your planet.  The tutorial consist of 7 missions, each having their own individual objective which differs from a standard skirmish mode, where your ultimate goal is to just beat your opponent by purchasing all of their stock.  The game’s campaign mode also offers a different set of objectives, but you also get to make a few choices which effect in game numbers, such as more jobs, and bonus money.  This is quite possibly one of the most in-depth games I have ever had the chance of playing. It is certainly a very deep rabbit hole you can get yourself into. Your company’s share price is affected by everything you do on a mission, meaning you always run the risk of a hostile takeover from your opponent.  If you like watching the stock markets and crunching numbers, you may just have met your perfect match already. Visually, OTC looks really slick and clean.  The game’s hardware requirements are low, given that resolutions higher than 1080 are not supported sadly. The game’s models are all really interestingly designed. Mars itself is perfectly presented, with a real rustic feel to it. A little unknown fact about the game is that the maps you play on are actually based off the real red planet itself.  A smooth animation of units also tips everything off nicely. Honestly it is just a real treat to sit back and watch your economy grow with this aesthetically pleasing game.Given the amount of detail that has gone into the game play in OTC, the difficulty levels really depend on how well you get to grips with the system. If you are able to pick up all of the processes, build orders, and able to study the numbers in front of you to a T, then the game will be just about challenging enough. If you are like me and even after the well-designed tutorial you still found yourself struggling to comprehend the amount of information being thrown at you, then you may be in for a bumpy ride. The difficulty ceiling is not a bad thing at all – this is obviously a game for a very specific market of people. The tutorial section of the game, as well as the skirmishes afterwards, took me just over three hours to complete. I am about a quarter of the way through the campaign currently but I am starting to hit that virtual brick all, where my opponents are just too clever for me to be able to progress further. The game’s online modes, as well as single player skirmishes allow for an endless amount of replay ability. Other than the game not allowing any higher resolutions than 1080p, I am pleased to say I had no technical issues. The game runs at a steady 60 FPS, and can even be capped at higher rates if your hardware allows it. Offworld Trading Company is a fantastic niche title that will happily find a home in anyone’s library that has even a passing interest in any sort of economy. Like I said at the start, you can really find yourself in a deep rabbit hole with this, you can get so in depth with all of the different trade markets and stock prices that you may as well just take up a second job as a market broker afterwards. This is the first game in this genre that I have tried, and I already believe this to be the aiming point for any others wanting to break into the economy genre.  The regular retail price of £29,99 may price a few on the fence buyers, so some may want to find a cheaper re-seller online or wait for the sale season. People who want a game that will more than likely suck hours of time out of their life with an extremely in depth game play, you will find no better game out there at the moment than Offworld Trading Company.  Personally I am going to give this game a recommendation, purely because it isn’t my favourite genre in the world, but I want to give this game merit where it is due.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

Early Access Review
								I really, really love this game. But nearly every single game, I get frustrated about the market mechanics. Bear in mind that this review is written based on beta as of Sept 2015.The game bills itself as a market simulation, and yet the price mechanics of pretty much everything just seem wonky. As far as I can tell, resource prices are probably influenced by what the other players are buying/selling, but in both cases, they're not using a supply/demand system, but instead some formula that bumps the price up and down with every sale/purchase. The net result is that prices fluctuate dramatically over the course of the game (which is not bad, and could be actually good), but that you never really feel like you understand why.The second part of this -- and the far more frustrating part -- is around the (current, as of Sept 2015) mechanics around winning, or ""buying out"" your opponents. Firstly, the concept of being ""bought out"" at twice your share price -- and thus ""losing"" -- is kind of weird, but in some circumstances it's incoherent. In a recent game, I owned 70% of my own company's stock, in addition to 60% of my opponent's stock. In real company terms, this would give me unilateral control over both companies. But no, instead, my opponent has a warning counter that starts at 50% and slowly ticks up to 100%, indicating that they have that percentage of the amount of money needed to ""buy me out"" and thus win. But at the same time, I'm saving up a hoard of cash to try and buy them out. But that doesn't seem to matter. My hoard of cash that's 50% of the value needed to ""buy them out"", my 70% stake in my own company, and my 60% stake in my opponent, all don't seem to matter. The stock prices seem to be ""faked"" much the same as commodities are, and they bear little connection to the actual value of the companies.That all said, I do recommend this game, as it's fun, and I love economic sims and there really should be more like this (I was really hoping for something more like Capitalism Plus, but alas). I hope and wish that the game's developers might put some energy into making the systems make sense, though.Update: Here's a screenshot demonstrating the phenomenon above. In this game, I took over two of four opponents and then just hoarded money and resources for a while. The remaining opponent eventually bought me out when their company had less cash on hand than I did, suggesting that the company stock prices are drastically undervalued. https://www.dropbox.com/s/kkosmyvvwd90hjk/Screenshot%202015-10-01%2011.50.43.png "

												I have found this game to be very intricate and engaging, and have enjoyed it immensely.  I feel that most people who are disappointed with this are expecting another Civ4, set in space.  Common complaints are lack of story, short games, lack of content diversity for replaying.  However if you have the right idea about what this game is, it is amazing.  This is a fast paced competitive strategic battlefield, played with production, stock markets, and espionage, rather than armies and warfare.  Played in real time, if you sit back and try to make a happy little colony you won't last long.The very solid yet short tutorial gives you a decent understanding of a game that is easy to start, yet very tricky to master.  I have not yet ventured into competitive multiplayer.... The ""campaign"" mode is really just an extension of learning, and the skirmish or multiplayer modes are the real meat.  Every game starts much the same, and rapidly spirals off in a different direction; directly influenced by your choices and those of your opponents, with a small amount of randomised external forces.What I really appreciate about this game is the total lack of paper-scissors-rock ""counters"" that exist in most strategy games.  Everything is viable, and even if your current strategy is shut down, you can pivot to something else and still be heavily competitive from behind.  The only wrong move is inaction, however the smallest things you do will be felt elsewhere.  I wasn't fully sure what I was getting into with this game, and tbh the first couple of hours against easy AI felt shallow, however I rapidly discovered that this game is satisfyingly deep and pretty much perfect, and that the AI 'easy' level was called that for a reason.....Additionally, the strength of a game based on numbers and definite cause and effect such as this is that the AI can be intelligent, unfeeling, ruthless, efficient, and incredibly challenging.  In summary; this game is darn near perfect FOR WHAT IT IS.  If you are wanting empire building, long protracted games, campaign as a main feature, then this game will not be another Civilization.  If you want short fast-paced matches in which you can test your instincts and decision making skills against opponents, while able to use a whole variety of strategy combinations, then this game will keep you happy for a long long time.

												The roguelite trend of the last few years has brought us a ton of games which are punishing or difficult without actually being complex or interesting, often using some kind of metagame progression as an escape valve for the player’s frustrations. Meanwhile, the strategy space is increasingly filled with bloated epics that take eons to complete and require relatively little player input. Offworld Trading Company is the perfect counterpoint to both trends, providing endless varied games of meaningful complexity in a timeframe that makes losing palatable; it's compact enough to make you want to challenge yourself, and complex enough to actually let you.Offworld Trading Company is not a 4X game, but it manages to capture the consequence-driven excitement of the first 50-100 or so turns of something like a good game of Civ while chopping out everything that has the potential to become tedious or irrelevant. You have to determine priorities and bootstrap your way up the growth curve by pulling resources from a very limited number of tiles; payback horizons are short, and everything you do every matters immediately in obvious ways. Your ability to recognize and exploit marginal effects will dramatically affect your ability to put your grand strategy into effect.OTC not only gets create this sense into a completely different format but actually manages to expand on the number of critical decisions without muddying or obscuring their consequence; choice of faction and choice of where to settle now feed back into decisions about when to settle and what to exploit. These decisions are in turn directly affected by opponent decisions via the game's stock market; even a sound strategy fitted to the map is not certain to succeed because awareness of opponent play has become part of its execution. The brilliance of, say, a Sid Meier design is generally the feedback between a number of subsystems and a larger game that incorporates them; this is as true of the fencing mini-game in Pirates!™ as it is of worker placement and city management in the Civ series: your degree of success in one area feeds into your performance in others, directly or otherwise. OTC features feedback of this kind not only between a variety of systems, but  between those systems and opponent decisions. To succeed you must play the map, play your faction, and play your opponent. The implementation of the market and its interplay with the supply chain gameplay results in an absolutely brilliant explosion of the strategic space without introducing obscurity, without needless complexity, without even direct control of units, and it all plays out over about a half hour.It also has a campaign mode that's both distinct from the skirmish mode and mechanically satisfying. I'm reminded most of the campaign in Rise of Nations; no gimmicks, just a series of games whose persistent rewards can push your strategy in surprising directions. Like everything else in OTC, it's concise and satisfying.I will say that while all of this stuff is going on in the game, the game is not screaming at you about it. It doesn’t call attention to everything that’s going on; you need to be able to find it, and if what you want out of a competitive game is a lot of onscreen flash reflecting your decisions you basically won’t find it; you have to be satisfied by your own ability to recognize and participate in what’s going on.There are just two things I would warn potential buyers about. My primary caveat is that this game is so well-designed that it will ruin your patience and tolerance for many of the kludges that are grafted onto purportedly strategy-driven games in order to maintain a relative uniformity of user experience. So many games basically involve waiting for different kinds of buckets to fill up so that you can do X or Y; you can affect the pace, but you’re basically on a treadmill. Offworld Trading Company has made this impossible not to see and difficult to tolerate. The second is that this game is taxing; you are coping with a lot of variables and consequential decisions over a short span of time. It’s extremely satisfying, but it’s definitely not the kind of thing I can settle in to for like a whole weekend afternoon. I can sit and play something like Civ IV for four or six hours; I can play maybe two or three consecutive games of OTC.			"

Early Access Review
								-EARLY ACCESS REVIEW-Before I continue writing this review I want to state that I'm more in the middle ground in terms whether or not I suggest this game.GENERAL OVERVIEWWhat is Offworld Trading Company? Simply put, Offworld Trading Company is a RTS without the conventional functions that we're used to seeing in RTSes today, that being a focus on military might and tactfulness. Instead of focusing on countering your enemies unit types and movements, maintaining map awareness and control, etc., you're in a race, so to speak, to survey the land of mars, identify what resources are rich and poor as well as what the best places to found are, figuring out the best way to maximize your profits while stiff-arming your opponents, and ultimately buying out their companies and declaring yourself the sole CEO of corporate mars. This is a lot easier said than done, of course, as there are lots of things that you need to be aware of and work around.At the beginning of a match, the only thing you see on the map is the main trading hub and the tiles surrounding it, with the rest of the map covered in fog of war (you can see the terrain, in the fog of war, just not the resources that might be lying within the covered tiles). You start off with 6 ""scans"" and gain another one every few seconds, You click on a tile that has already been exposed completely and the scan will further reveal tiles in a radius around it. If the border of your scan is near a resource that's hidden a yellow beam will extend from the tile it's in, and if you include the tile within your scan it will show you the tile's yield. As you begin to uncover the location's resources, you need to immediately begin figuring out how you want to start. For example, if you're finding the planet is heavy on iron, it might be wise to try playing as the Robotics or Expansionist division as steel is a major component for their progress and it will be something you will likely not have to deal with, while on the other hand if iron is short you may want to choose Scavenger as they are not dependent on steel like the other divisions, and also try to snatch the iron and refuse to divulge supply so as to drive the price of steel up and make the competition pay through the nose in order to expand. You'll also want to make sure you do not found your colony too far from the resources you plan on claiming, as blimps use fuel to transport their goods, and if you have lots of long routes then your blimps will -absolutely- chew through your fuel reserves (or lack thereof).Once you pick your division and landing spot, it's time to start building. Your colony HQ will start at level one, and you will have a handful of claims which are used to...well...claim tiles on the map, which then allow you to build your production buildings. You will learn quickly that in order to thrive, you need to amass claim rights so you can continue building production buildings and the resources which will give you what you need to expand your buildings as well as amass the capital you'll need to trade for goods you may not be able to produce and, ultimately, win. There are three ways to gain claims; upgrading your HQ (which takes resources, such as aluminum, steel, and glass, for example), buying claims from the black market (which become more expensive each time a player buys one - grab em' while they're hot!), and auctions (which often becomes very expensive). Once you've amassed enough capital from the market you've so devilishly cornered, you can proceed to buy out the competition, taking over their buildings and HQ (which you can also upgrade if they haven't and get more claims). There are a handful of other things I haven't touched on: additional black market abilities, special buildings, resources, and patents to name the main ones, but as for the basic gameplay that about covers it.THE GOOD- Break from the current status-quo of RTSes- Moderately in-depth and complex resource and production trees- Procedural maps, meaning you'll have to fine tune your strategy game to game- Decent AI- Promising campaign mode; you get to choose what missions you tackle based on their rewards which will help you upgrade your company for the missions to come.THE BAD- Anti-climatic, nonsensical winning condition (You win by buying your competitor out of their own company, which results in the last moments of the game being a frenzied click fest to shotgun your opponents; a mindless-feeling ending for what's supposed to be a strategy game, albeit there is a sort of strategy to when you do commit to the kill.).- Sub-par interface. Right now the interface ""works,"" but is somewhat ugly and uninformative, namely the important status reports which pop up in small text off to the side. They are difficult to read and sometimes you can miss out on important tidbits such as resource shortages/surpluses or sabotage events (luckily their are fairly obvious audio ques for more important events that draw your attention to them, such as a crushing soda can for an aluminum shortage). In addition, I found that a couple of the special buildings such as the hacker relay lag out the interface when you bring them up, but that's likely due to a simple bug.- First impressions of the pace of the game make me feel like the gameplay is rushed. I'm not going to make a strong point about this as I don't really have an explanation or concrete examples to point to adequately support the point. After watching the trailer I was expecting the game to determined by who thought the smartest, not the fastest, which it is to a degree, but a major part of the game is jumping on map position and resources before anyone else does. This is probably mostly attributed to the nature of the game being it is a RTS. This may well be something that tradition RTS players like (rushing to gain decisive map control).- Some strategies can be unbalanced in some circumstances, and can be annoying and feel very gamey at times.FINAL VERDICTShould you purchase this game as of the time of this review? Depends, really. I gave this game a recommendation because I, personally, have a fun time with it and I expect it's quality to rise over the next periods of development as I have faith in the credentials of the developers. However, this game is not for everyone, especially at it's price tag. Taking into account what I've experienced as well as what many of my friends have, I would say that for the average consumer ~20$ is a fair price tag for what you're currently getting. Bear in mind, of course, that the game is still in early access and may well be undisputably worthy of it's price tag, but until that day is etched in stone I would simply follow this game and watching where it goes.

												The game is alright, but not terribly deep. A few rounds is all it takes to understand the mechanics of the game, and without a huge amount of complications it becomes very repetitive very quickly.On the bright side, the game is absolutely functional. The economy works in a way that is responsive and satisfying. Your opponents actually seem to know what they're doing (at least on harder modes). The sound and visuals are both good.On the down side the gameplay is shallow, leaving the player wanting more after a fairly short amount of time.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It's been a few months and the game has now come out of early access. I'm afraid that the only difference I see between the current game and the original game is Far better AI, and a nicer UI. The depth of the game hasn't been changed, and basically no new features have been added.My review remains very similar to what it was before: The game is solid in what it does, but what it does isn't all that complex, and with so few tradable items and minerals the game becomes a straight race to get Offworld Trading Companies, and flood the market. There is some nuance at the beginning depending on the map, but beyond that every game basically plays out the same.			"

												I built a great company, some of the greatest assets in the solar system. Millions and millions of dollars.  I get along with everybody, I get along with the robots. I love robots, great people. Robots are killing us in trade. Look at what the robots are doing, devaluating their water. They take our jobs, they take our money. We're not winning any more. We need smart competent leadership. Right now we have leaders. They don't know what theyr'e doing. We're going to Make Mars Great Again. Believe me.			"

												M.U.L.E. was Dani Bunten’s ingenious commodities-driven deathmatch bidding arena. I didn’t play it when it came out in 1983, because it wasn’t on the Apple II. I didn’t even know what it was back then. It wasn’t until many years later that I finally tried it with some friends. In the same room, of course. That’s how all games worked back then. I figured we’d try it, although I thought we were in for the strategy game equivalent of Pong. No one wants to play Pong ever again, just like no one wants to gin his own cotton, read Beowulf on a long flight, or hang up a poster of the Bayeux Tapestry in his living room. Pong is a musty relic with no modern relevance beyond its role in videogame history. That’s what I figured was going on with M.U.L.E.But it turned out M.U.L.E. was (and still is) an amazing game. Sure, it’s ugly. Good graphics hadn’t been invented back in 1983. But Bunten managed a simple — not simplistic! — player-driven cutthroat economy based on real estate, commodities, and auctions. God, I’m making it sound boring, I know. But it’s really not. It’s really, really not. M.U.L.E. is freakishly before-its-time game design, as if someone had made the movie Casablanca at the moment the daguerreotype had been invented. The only reason you’re not playing M.U.L.E. today, in some form or another, is because the videogame industry — really, it was more of a scene at that point — was about to explode based on Doom’s appeal to adolescent male power fantasies learned from action movies. It would take a while before the rest of the world discovered what we were up to, and by that time, Sid Meier and Will Wright had carved out their own niche where Dani Bunten’s work would have been.But M.U.L.E. is a nearly unrivaled work of game design genius that will hold up if you gather four friends around a single screen. Sure, some of it is dated. You play it with joysticks, for Pete’s sake. We don’t even have those anymore! But the design is timeless.After the jump, if it kicks like a M.U.L.E…Offworld Trading Company isn’t shy about its 30 year debt to Bunten and M.U.L.E. There’s an actual M.U.L.E. in here, and a reference to Bunten in the tutorial. But more significantly, this is an ingenious commodities-driven deathmatch bidding arena, the likes of which you haven’t seen since 1983. Or the last time you tried M.U.L.E.There have been other strategy games about economies, with armies nowhere to be seen. Stardock’s Entrepreneur was among the better ones. All those resource management tycoon games come from this idea. Running a business in a videogame is nothing new. But what sets Offworld Trading Company apart, what connects it directly to the genius of M.U.L.E., is how it uses real time strategy as its gameplay foundation. The only reason M.U.L.E. wasn’t in the category of real time strategy games was because, like good graphics, they hadn’t been invented yet.Calling Offworld Trading Company an RTS can be misleading, since it doesn’t use the aspects of RTSs that some people find daunting. There is no micromanagement. Your attention isn’t one of the resources. You will never need to worry about your APM, or even know what APM means. In fact, when you’re not playing online, Offworld Trading Company automatically pauses whenever you’re doing something that you might want to stop and think about. You choose a building to build, and time freezes while you consider where to put it. Nothing is going to happen when you’re not looking. And if it comes down to it, you can always just slap the spacebar. Everything will pause, but you’ll still be able to fully interact with the game. The real time aspect isn’t at all about multitasking or reflexes or the tension between thought and action.Instead, what Offworld Trading Company takes from RTSs is everything but the stuff that scared off everyone who isn’t still playing Starcraft II. It’s about player conflict, consistent pacing, varied strategies, immediate and almost tactile interaction with the map, real time resource management, and ultimately one player (or team) winning completely, all within a short enough time span that you’ll want to go again as soon as you’re done. These were also things in M.U.L.E. These are all things you don’t get in other games about economies instead of armies.Not to say Offworld Trading Company is a throwback. It positively glows with the care, attention, and production values you’ll find in a contemporary AAA game. The sharply defined, intricate, and informative graphics. Everything means something. Everything has some visual expression. The buttery — yes, buttery! — rich and smooth interface. Okay, it could use a few more hotkeys, but I’ve never met a game that couldn’t use a few more hotkeys. The unique dynamic single-player campaign, which stacks onto an already great game a great game framework. This is the most indepth and replayable RTS single-player campaign since Rise of Nations and its add-on. The tutorial for maximum information and accessibility. The manual. Oh, wait, there isn’t a manual. Which is as you’d expect from a contemporary AAA game. Like I said, it’s not a throwback. Even the soundtrack. Good lord, the soundtrack. Christopher Tin’s score belongs on my playlist alongside iconic sci-fi scores like Hans Zimmer’s for Interstellar, Clint Mansell’s for Moon, and Vangelis’ for Blade Runner.I hope I haven’t made it sound boring. Some folks might get the impression it’s boring. A game about an economy in space? All those little buildings and numbers in those screenshots? You have to make oxygen from water? But it’s really not. It’s really, really not. It’s a freakishly smart game design, as if someone made M.U.L.E. back in 1983. It’s got a learning curve because it’s a very particular setting about people living on Mars, provided for by different types of companies (the four companies are as distinct as the factions in Starcraft). You have to understand how the pieces interact before you appreciate how this is so much more than a spreadsheet with pretty graphics in front. But it’s carefully built to get you to where everything clicks.At which point, it is the exact opposite of boring. It is every bit as thrilling as something with constant explosions. It’s the sort of game you’ll be thinking about at work. It’s the sort of game you just might want to try online. It’s the sort of game with a campaign you can play and replay and replay some more. It’s the sort of game with so many settings and options and variables that you might never need another RTS. Okay, maybe you’ll occasionally need your fix of one of those less interesting RTSs with tanks or a MOBA with fireball spells or whatever. But Offworld Trading Company is the sort of game that isn’t going to let go of you for a long, long time. Maybe even 33 years.			"

												If you are looking for a different kind of RTS this is it!I am a both a big Civ and RTS fan (growing up on Age of Empires etc.) and I have found OTC to be a very nice balance between these two types of games. So if you like strategy like Civ but with the adrenaline and frenzy of an RTS this is your game. I won't go into the mechanics of the game as you can read plenty of that and there are great tutorials online alread. I do want to address the comment of the game being ""too simple"" without a lot of depth. People who say this are only thinking in terms of learning all the rules and mechanics, and once they figure that out in a few hours they think there is not much left to the game. Dead wrong!You need to think of OTC more like a real-time and complex board game, like chess. Yes, learning the rules and how the different pieces in chess doesn't take long, but the game is infinitely complex. OTC is similar, once the mechanics are down the fun begins! I actually like that the game is 'limited' in some ways - the map is only so big, there are only so many options for attacking your opponent etc. But the variation is infinite and it is all about moves and countermoves and improving your gameplay and skill. The best kind of game is one that has elegant rules and gameplay but provides for a lot of imagination. Combined with the fact most games only take 20-40 minutes and it hits a nice sweet spot of a satisfying experience without dragging on for hours like Civ (hey, I like Civ, but it is nice to have a quicker game!)Give it a chance to really learn the strategy and I think you won't be dissappointed.

Early Access Review
								I can't recommend the game right now; obviously it's Early Access, so I write this more to inform other people to probably wait to see how it improves. Even with all possible features they could put into this game; it's almost insultingly overpriced. It just needs a little more 'something' in the game at its current price point. From what I got from playing, I felt like it should have been priced around $20 max. I'd ceretainly appreciate to hear from the developers as to why they believe the cost of the game is this high. The only reason I purchased it is because I'm usually the person that grabs games of interest in our community and I let them know if it's worth it or not. I can't recommend it at this price point.The UI needs some works; it's pretty sluggish. The 'Notification' system is lackluster and need polish. They just pop-up in the lower-right corner 'Chat Window' so you really need to keep an eye on it at all times so you know when things are going to be effecting you.Don't expect to just jump in this game and know what to do; it has a high learning curve so expect to spend some time figuring a few things out before you get to know what you're doing so you can beat other players.The fact that an AI (or a player) can just race to earn a ton of cash, and then buy people out... is a silly win condition. I understand it's a 'Trading Game' and that's sorta the point; but I think there needs to be more to it than just ""Stockpile Cash -> Insta Buy-Out Player"" - You learn to counter this by buying your own stock of course, when possible.I expect to see a lot more from this game at this price though; and I just don't see the value yet. I'm going to keep playing over the weekend and I'll update this review after a few more play sessions.---------- Review Update -------------I still can't really recommend it yet. Winning doesn't really feel like anything special. Here's why; you spend most of the game just attempting to get a good supply of things going, then in the last 2-3 minutes of the game everyone scrambles to start 'Selling All Their Stuff' so you can just buy everyone else out. This seems extremely anti-climatic to me; I feel like they just don't have any other ideas on how you can 'win' at the game. Once someone starts buying the stocks... it's just a silly race to finish buying everyone out in the next minute or two.So here's my constructive feedback on 'How To Win' should be done in the game. Since it's about ""Saving Humanity"" and all that... you shouldn't be buying stock on the other companies; instead players should be 'Offworlding' their goods to ""Earth"" in order to 'Save Humanity'. The first 'Trade Company' to meet the demands of ""Earth"" should win. You could have ""Earth"" have random demands every game, or even shift/change in the middle of it if you want to get crazy.It's odd that that isn't how you win? Maybe it is? But all my games always just end up being ""Stock Buyout Races"". Who can press the minus and plus buttons faster than the other. TL;DR Version - Winning isn't rewarding; the game builds you up, but just doesn't know how to finish yet.			"

Early Access Review
								Pros: - Completely playable game with very little bugs, very good for an Early Access Game - Competent AI - Single/Multiplayer Skirmishes are fast paced and intense(even vs AI) - A breathe of fresh air for the Strategy/4X genre - Intuitive Interface, for a complex economic game, the interface makes it easy to understand things - Every map is different, this means you or any other person cannot rely on the same strategy everytime and will have to adjust their playstyles accordinglyCons: -  A bit too pricey for an Early Access Game -  Multiplayer games are hosted by Players, lags later in the game is nearly inevitable -  Single Player Campaign feels a bit too short in comparison to other Strategy/4X games (Civ, Total War & etc) - Games are shorter in comparison to your standard Strategy/4X games. -  The game targets a very niche market, thus this may be a boring game to someone and an addicting game to another -  Needs more polishing on the interface (e.g. Events Notification is nearly unnoticeable if not for the SFX accompanying an event)Verdict:The game delivers what it promises, if you like what you see(check out Mohawk Games youtube channel and watch some VODs) and don't mind shelling out a high price for an Early Access Game, then it is a good buy. While the game is still in early access, the foundations of the gameplay itself is well polished. However there are still a lot of room to grow for this game and one may get frustrated or regret his or her purchase. If you are a 4X or Strategy games enthusiast I suggest buying this game, otherwise waiting for a sale may be a wiser choice.Mohawk Games: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCasmHPTajRU9kXWHjJqJD_g "

Early Access Review
								If You like board games, playing with people on multiplayer than ist game for You (but still much overpriced - i suggest buying it on sale or something). I suppose its game for like 20-40 hours depending on how much You like playing with people on multiplayer. Its rather casual game, that you will return to play a match from time to time.Good:- Something fresh- Nicely done- Easy to playBad:- AI is dumb, easy to beat- Short campaign- Much overpriced- No dedicated servers on multiplayer so in 90% cases -> You finish the host, he quits, and game stops, throwing all of other players to the lobby.I give it a plus, because its nice game, and gives a lot of fun, but beware ITS MUCH MUCH OVERPRICED. Its rather worth like 20 USD, so I suggest to wait on some sale.			"

												This is a brilliant, polished game. It has everything that should make it an addictive experience for me... pausable real-time, many divergent strategies for victory, brutally smart AI opponents, some nice tongue-in-cheek atmospherics, different factions with totally differing playstyles, and more.So why the thumbs down? Why aren't I playing the game right now?What it comes down to is this: to keep ahead of the game, you need to keep track not only of your own company's development, but ideally that of all your competitors as well. Your AI opponents will try to sabotoge you using dirty black-market tricks, and you have to do the same to them to win. That means you have to know what's really going to hurt them, and what's not. That means you have to understand their strategy. Which means you have to look over their operations on the map, count their buildings, try to work our what they're up to.I could pause the game and do all that, but even if I did for each of the 3-7 opponents, I'd have to do it all over again a few minutes later, because that's how quickly the game moves.Info about your opponents is not easy to find. There's no summary screen of how many building of each type each opponent has, which might allow you to piece together their strengths and weaknesses at a glance. Instead you have to maually count buildings if you want that info. I hate situations where a game makes information available, but very hard to access!Another turn-off for me is the difficulty of assessing what investments will generate the best return. I end up making most of my investment choices using a sort of intuition, but I have the feeling that on higher difficulty levels you really need to flawlessly min-max to win. Again, I could pause the game and do a bunch of calculations by hand to min-max... but that's not much fun. Too much like my real job. So despite being very drawn to the game in concept, I find in practice it just leaves me feeling frustrated at being unable to keep up with the constant min-max calculating that the AIs are able to do in real time. I could pause the game every 30 seconds and try to keep up, in my feeble human way, but why bother?			"

												Played this for a little over a year throughout the Early Access. Can't recommend it enough. Here are just a few of the assorted points as to why I love it so much:- The AI had been dramatically improved over the time and is quite, quite competent now. To a point that a newer player might struggle with it quite a bit until he really gets the hang of the game.- Getting the hang of the game might seem challenging - the learning curve is quite steep and usually that's a sign of a deep game. And trust me, this game is deep in spite of what some people might say. I can see how playing AI can get repetitve but in a multiplayer every game is different and every game presents you with plenty of important and difficult decisions that you need to make quick.- There is no one way to victory. Every game you have to adapt to the ever-changing environment, fluctuating prices, resource spread and geography, shortaging, colony growth etc.- I have very little RTS experience. In fact nearly none and I am hardly at all inerested in the genre. Yet somehow when I first saw Offworld I got interested in it and after watching a whole pile of videos I realized that I HAVE to play it. Now, I understand it's not a feeling everyone will have, not immediately for sure. But I think that if you like RTS, if you want something new and different, if you like a highly competitive game, you should definitely give it a shot.			"

Posted: May 1, 2016
												I am very pleased to give this game the thumbs up - I own it since its launch on Steam. I had a feeling it will grow well and achieve a good level of greatness by the time it was finihsed. Coming back to it now, over 9 months later, I cannot help but enjoy what the developer (Sören Johnson was the lead designer of Civilization 4) has achieved. Regardless whether in single player or multiplayer, you are treated to a fast-paced, ever-be-on-your-toes gameplay. To me, this is the best fast-paced economic sim I have ever played.So, let's take a look at the good and the bad.The GOOD:1. Extremely engaging gameplay - that, to me, outweighs everything else. The game is built in such a way that keeps you on your toes all the time. A small slip-up may result in a loss. I can tell you, there are some real sharks out there.2. Strategic Thinking + Awareness combo wins the game - you need to know exactly what you want and how to manipulate the situation you have been put in. You need to play a few moves ahead and you need to be ready to adapt and commit to the plan you have in your head.3. Great single player - the developers have really programmed the AI well, as I expected of them. Even on lower difficulties (say, Employee or Assistant) the AI may suprise you and even buy you out in a skirmish game. In addition to that there is a great campaign (explained in #11), daily challenges, leaderboards, pretty much everything to satisfy your single player demands.4. Multiplayer is damn good - but be aware, there are people out there who have played the game for a long time and will destroy a newcomer in no time. I know I have 26 hours in the game and got trashed. Do not get disheartened and do your best to learn and improve.5. You can pick from a number of companies to lead to victory - and each one plays differently to boot! It is quite surprising just how much a dependence on one resource can affect a game, and how huge of a replayability it may provide. You may opt to play the sneaky scavengers, the tech-crazy scientists, the extremely expansive... um... Expansive corporation that gains extra claims on plots, or the Robots, which need no sustenance, but have to replace their parts and chips in a timely fashion.6. Many ways to victory - while in skirmish the goal remains the same, to be the last man standing, there are many ways to achieve it. You are given lots of obvious and subtle ways to do so. Do not take your eys off that black market, I can tell you that much... or for the same reason off the resource table... or the shares table... uh, I am quite sure that you get my drift.7. Many hours of enjoyment - due to its awesome replayability, you will easily be looking at 20+ hours of enjoyment, more if you want to test every corporation in various situations, and then go ahead and do some skirmishes, play through the campaign, do the daily challenges, and maybe play online vs other people.8. An extremely pleasant music - the soundtrack is awesome, very nice and relaxing.9. Good tutorial comprising of ways to teach you how to win, a number of practice games vs the AI up to Manager difficulty, and in my opinion, a great design decision to have you actually win a game in skirmish first before diving into the campaign. The campaign can be a bit overwhelming, I can tell you that from experience. The AI won't sit back and let you feel smart, MLG Pro gamer. It will crush you like a maggot if you don't play well.10. Post-game statistics - the post-game statistics have been improved and made even more in-depth, much to my delight. I really like taking a long hard look at them and analyze what I did wrong or not.11. Great single player campaign -  In its essence, you are given 7 weeks worth of challenges, with your chosen company, vs 3-4 AIs of a difficulty that you choose in the beginning of the campaign. From week 1 to 6, you use the cash you make to improve an AI colony by buying any of the 4 upgrades for it over a 7 day period. The winner with the most purchases gets the best weekly cash bonus. In the final week of the campaign, you enter a skirmish match with the top 4 companies left and to win you must buy them out. Each company starts with a number of upgrades, and you can hire additional staff either for a week or permanently to further boost a building's efficiency (you can boost a windmill's energy output, a metal mine's efficiency so that a single metal mine supports 3 steel mills, etc.). Then you are allowed to select one of the 3 missions given to you. Each one of them carries a different challenge which is clearly explained (example: limited resources, black market items, special conditions, etc.) and satisfies a certain earthbound sponsor (UN, USA, Russia, China), which, gives you another reward (like extra claims, better scans, etc.). Depending on how well you do on the mission, you get to carry more week-based revenue home and use it for further upgrades to your production buildings. And if you think that's not enough - you can even unlock a secondary or even tertiary sponsor and use it on a certain mission! Limited water with a scientific? Play robotic then!Now, let's take a look at the BAD:1. The graphics - call me weird, but I actually preferred the basic Early Access, more blocky and sci-fi-ish graphics. Since then, the game evolved into a more colorful, cartoonish look, which to my taste, was unnecessary. It sure gets the job done, but not for me.2. The UI - the UI underwent a number of changes, which in my opinion made it more complex than it needed to be, with way more tabs and sub-tabs than necessary. Coming back to the game 9 months later, I was a bit overwhelmed myself for the first 5 minutes of play. Granted, I managed to make my way easily around it, but for a new player it will be a lot to process.3. Punishing AI - yep, that could be a bad thing. If you are not ready to play vs tough AI who can exploit your mistakes, best stick to the lowest difficulties or... stay away from the game.4. While a number of changes were made, the game did not change dramatically from the first early access build. But then again, the starter build was already quite good, polished, and enjoyable.5. Huge skill difference in online games - many people who play online since alpha have way better understanding, time proven tactics and thus, the upper hand on someone who's just starting.6. The price is a huge gripe for many people, and I can understand why. Yesterday, I was looking through my mails to see for just how much did I buy this game, and I was very surprised to find that I got it for 18,50€, which is roughly half of what it costs now. I would argue, that if you watched youtubers play it 9 months ago, that you should have already realized its potential and bought the game. However, on the other side I can totally understand how people like to wait till a game exits early access first, and then buy it. For them, the price tag will be high.7. Last, but not least, the game suffers from the snowball effect. Once you get ahead, and if you know what you are doing, you will most likely stay ahead till the end of the game. That is a tad off-putting to some gamers, but I can tell you from experience, you can still turn it around... to a point. Then you just lose :)Conclusion:If you are willing to forgive the current price tag, this game is an easy buy for gamers who enjoy economic games comprised of a lot of wheeling and dealing, tormenting their opponents by scamming (cook the books for the win), crashing the market, freezing their best production plots for a time, boosting your own effectivenes, destroying their resources (underground nukes, yay!), or even toying with them as they spiral into huge debt. I, personally, find the game a great experience and am looking forward to playing the new and improved campaign, learn the new tricks and quirks of the game, and enjoying myself thoroughly in the process.

Early Access Review
								First Impressions:I was super-excited when I first learned about this title, as there aren't many economic RTS's out on the market right now (if any).  I finally don't have to worry about memorizing hot-keys to queue up marines or peons or whatever else I may need to reach my keystroke per second quota.  Instead, players will each get a HQ, choose a business model, and attempt to buy out their competition by buying low and selling high.  This game features both raw materials and finished goods, with the price of each being affected by supply and demand.  It reminds me of ""Sid Meier's Railroads"" a bit, though you are limited in your building placement by ""claims""...that is, a resource that allows you to unlock one hex on the map for your personal use.  There's a bit of a learning curve and the AI can be somewhat difficult, but I found myself wanting more with each gameplay session.  The $40 price is a concern for those on a tight budget, but for those who can afford it (and love the idea of an economic RTS) should pick it up.

												What you get out of Offworld Trading Company depends heavily on what you expect and how much time you're willing to put into it. OTC is based around 25-40 minute skirmishes (or 10-15 if things are very lopsided) rather than being a sprawling epic. As such, there aren't a tremendous amount of different mechanics available, but what is here is very well balanced and allows for deep, varied games. Make no mistake: there is a very steep learning curve here, and a lot of the depth isn't necessarily readily apparent because there's so much going on.Note on the learning curve: the basic concepts are fairly simple, and getting to the level of competence only requires a few bits of knowledge (that aren't necessarily obvious). Really mastering the game takes a fairly deep understanding of the game, though, and really good players can exploit small advantages to open up large leads (though those can also be countered by black market and other tools if players stay attentive).Offworld absolutely delivers on the promise of being an RTS without units. In place of the usual micro-heavy unit management, there are myriad map quirks, prices, opponent actions, and random events to pay attention to and try to take advantages off of long-term. Even with over 700 hours put into the game, mostly playing multiplayer with some of the best players in the community, there are still plenty of things in a single game that I will fail to notice. Success at this game, rather than being reliant on high APM, depends on having good awareness and a good understanding of how and why prices will move, how to appropriately react, and especially countering your opponents. Single player is somewhat more difficult to evaluate. The AI is relatively well-made and able to put up a fight or pose a serious challenge for newer players. With experience, there are some predictable aspects and flaws to the AI that let you beat them consistently, but until then, skirmishes against the AI should prove somewhat interesting and useful as a learning tool. If you're a competitive person, going for the best times on the Daily Challenge can be a way to keep single player fresher. Trying to figure out what strategies work or the exact way to manipulate prices to make the AI do what you want it to do can be interesting, and with the variety of maps and restrictions set for each day's challenge, it's nontrivial to find optimal strategies. Being able to see how other players approached the same challenge (using the in-game replay feature) is useful both for learning new strategies or figuring out how to make small optimizations.The campaign is essentially a series of skirmishes where you start with limited production and are able to unlock perks and better production as you advance. All but the final week of the campaign are a bit different from your standard skirmishes; rather than race to buy out your opponents, you are competing at investing in the central colony. You can choose from 9 different executives to play as, and a lot of work has been done to make them play differently. Once you find a working strategy and manage to build a solid foundation from the first few weeks, though, applying the same strategy over and over until the final week is fairly viable, so the campaign can drag a bit. Once you get to the final week, the standard skirmish with a different set of tools than you're used to can be fun.Basically, if you're willing to put a lot of time into learning how the mechanics of the game interplay and are interested in multiplayer, this game will definitely reward you with a deep, consistently interesting experience. Single player can be played more casually and is enjoyable in its own right, but doesn't necessarily have a great deal of lasting appeal if you reach a point where the AI isn't particularly challenging. If you're not willing to put time into overcoming the steep learning curve, a lot of the game can seem overwhelming and incomprehensible (or else pointlessly simple if you play on very low difficulty levels), and probably isn't worth your time.tl;dr - Buy the game if you want a rich multiplayer experience and aren't worried about the learning curve. Buy the game on sale if you're mostly interested in single player and the game's concept. Look elsewhere if you're looking for a game with an epic scale or with mechanics that are simple to master.

Product received for free
Buy low, sell high! Welcome to Offworld Trading Company, an economic strategy game developed by Mohawk Games. Your goal in OTC is simple, make more money than your competition and, eventually, buy them out completely. You’ll need to manage all of your resources, expand your company’s HQ and maybe there’ll be some corporate sabotage thrown in to the mix.The core gameplay all revolves around harvesting resources and then using those resources to produce other resources (for example Silicon is used by the buildings that produce glass) and sell off anything you don’t need to boost your cash-flow. It sounds easy but you only have a certain number of tile claims. If you have five claims available that means you can only build five buildings. However, you can get more claims, mainly by upgrading your company’s HQ (up to the maximum level 5) but there are in-game auctions and you’ll sometimes be able to bid on extra claims or an actual tile as well as other things such as patents (technologies that provide a positive bonus to your business) and black market items (some of which are used for personal gain, others which are used to sabotage the competition).As with all strategy games, OTC’s gameplay is split into early-game, mid-game and late-game. The early-game in OTC is all about securing the resources that are essential to your faction (one of four), without these you’ll find yourself in a lot of debt very quickly and you’ll be unable to expand your HQ. For example, Seneca Development is a human faction so they need food, water and oxygen to run their base but Yoshimi Robotics is run by robots so they don’t require these (though you may still want them in order to sell them). It’s also important to secure at least two of the three resources you need for upgrading your HQ in the early game so that you don’t have to spend too much money buying other resources. OTC’s mid-game is essentially about preparing for late-game. By the mid-game you should have secured all the resources you need to run and upgrade your HQ so now you’ll be thinking about increasing your HQ level and starting to look at producing resources which you’ll be able to make huge profits from in the late-game stage. If you have any resources to sell off, mid-game may also be when you start purchasing stocks in other players to prepare for buying them out. The late-game stage is when you’re going to be making most of your money. Prices will be at their highest now as the human colony you’re supporting will be very large now so this is the time to sell off resources you have large stockpiles of (in small amounts so you don’t push the price down too much) but it’s also when you want to be thinking about building two or three Offworld Markets. The Offworld Market building is a rocket which will launch 100 of whatever resource you choose to asteroid mines for insane amounts of money, several times more than simply selling your resources to the colony. Once you’ve sent up a couple of rockets you’ll have enough money to buy out the weakest competitor(s) and soon you’ll have enough to buy out even the strongest of the competition, as long as they’re still behind you.The main way to limit your competition is by sabotaging them with black market items as I mentioned earlier. Some of the items which are for your benefit include bribing officials to give you an extra claim or using a M.U.L.E to collect 200 units of a resource. The sabotage items range from EMPs which will temporarily disable a few buildings to Mutiny which will give you any profits from a building for around a minute (particularly effective when used on Offworld Markets). Some of these items did feel unbalanced to me, for example an underground nuke reduces the number of resources you harvest from a tile, if an enemy uses this several times it can be incredibly damaging as you’ll then have to focus on getting more of that resource rather than making money. It also seems that AI are more likely to target human players than other AI players which is of course problematic if you’re playing single-player. While some of the individual items feel unbalanced, the black markets presence in the game is handled very well. Once you’ve purchased an item from the market you’ll have to wait one minute before you can purchase anything else and every time a player (human or AI) purchases an item its price increases for everyone so you can’t just spam a load of EMPs. Furthermore, there’s a pool of items and you only get a random selection of them for each game (the number of items also depends on the size of the map/number of players) which adds a little bit of variety to the game.Although I’ve really enjoyed playing OTC (especially multiplayer skirmishes with friends) it does have two major issues: a lack of depth and a high price for what’s on offer. The former feeds into the latter so I’ll talk about it first. The problem I have is there’s not really any variation in gameplay or strategies. I’ve played quite a few matches in my ten hours with the game so far (they usually last between twenty to thirty minutes) and I’ve used the same strategy every time, winning all but two or three matches. Even when I played as a different faction I only had to make small tweaks to my strategy in order to win the game. Sure, if you play on the higher difficulties it’s more of a challenge but I still didn’t feel as though I needed to do anything differently to what I did in my previous games. Obviously I don’t expect it to be so varied that it feels like I’m playing a different game every time I play but I shouldn’t feel like I’m playing the same match when I play. It’s this lack of depth that makes the £30 asking price way too high, I feel that a price point of around £20 would be much better value.A couple more things to tie up. OTC is a really good looking game, the style of the game fits it perfectly and, though it’s only a small feature, I enjoyed watching the little transport ships fly from my resource collection buildings back to the HQ. While Skirmish is probably playing most of the time, there is also a campaign mode. It’s well designed and offers slightly different gameplay to Skirmish mode, giving you seven days on a map to be the player who buys the most modules for the nearby colony. Personally I didn’t enjoy it anywhere near as much as skirmish/multiplayer but that’s not to say it’s bad. The tutorials are very good and explain everything very well though it is possible to screw up in the tutorials (for example if you build an extra building you won’t have enough claims to complete the tutorial) which means that you may have to restart the entire tutorial mission, a bit frustrating considering it’s not explained. Lastly, the game’s soundtrack is absolutely fantastic!Verdict An enjoyable economic strategy game that’s good for a few hours of fun despite being overpriced and lacking depth. If you’re a fan of strategy games and you’re looking for something different I’d highly recommend picking it up on sale.Lone Ranger Reviews.El K.			"

								Offworld Trading Company is a new type of real-time strategy game, it's not a combat-war type RTS, it's a numbers-war type game, it's a player-driven, market-driven game, where money and resources is power, and power is law.From when it was announced, I loved the simple graphics, and playing it now I'm loving how it looks, the simplicity in the design, the deep colors, the nice eye candy effects, and the quick but charming animations, all of which are splendidly made.


YouTube™ Video: Game Shock - Offworld Trading Company Beta Gameplay Preview 

			Views: 370		

			Fun refreshing economy-war type RTS More info at: http://www.ksalue.com/_/game-shock/offworld-trading-company-beta-preview-r706 End video song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVafDaVTVkk ~Twitter:...		

There isn't a story of the sense that there's a campaign with that's lengthy with a big story to tell and characters to meet, it's only where you have to be the best of the best company that should represent what the future life of the human race, in terms of the market life. But in the campaign itself, you start off with limited equipment, and as you progress through it you will start to unlock what's been locked by purchasing them, until you got everything and finish the the campaign. I haven't finished it yet, but I'm working there.Notice: This game does not have an offline mode yet.The gameplay itself is the same as an RTS Command & Conquer, but with a mix of a hex-based movement / placement like a Civilization game, and sort of a mix of an Anno game with how building and trading is. Combined with the new idea, one that at least I haven't seen, of power management in the market area by gathering resources, buying and sell them, advancing your buildings to produce more materials, try do some shady tactics to over power your competitors. It's new and fun, and what I like about it is that it's simple yet complicated in a way, simple enough for most to learn.At first I was skeptical with what the game is facing the price that it has, but after playing the first 3 tutorial levels, I fell in love with it, so my skepticism went away and I was happy with the game and the price, obviously followed with playing outside of the tutorial of course, playing the single player content and multiplayer. I see my self playing this for a while, and I was kind of hungry for this type of game, so win win. Also, while the game is sufficient enough to keep it self going for some time, I wouldn't mind seeing more buildings and units to play around with, just more content.Shameless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.

												This game is simply brilliant.  I'll leave it to other reviews to extol the value of the gameplay on offer here, but this is easily the best strategy game released in the last year.Several negative reviews criticize the game for being too easy or too simple.  Difficulty options easily address the first point, as the AI is perfectly competent and can challenge even the best players.  If you think the game is easy, you need to step up the difficulty level or try your hand at a human opponent.  They don't bite.Anyone who says this game is simple has no grasp whatsoever of the nuances of the design.  Under the hood, the game's primary system is a simulated free market economy.  On the surface, you can influence prices by buying and selling goods, but the ability of the player to influence both supply and demand through interaction with the colony and other players is really what the game is all about, and those possibilities are limited only by your capacity for foresight.  That's the way a strategy game is supposed to be.  The player who wins is the most clever one who can exploit whatever situations present themselves, not the one who can click the fastest or can memorize a hundred opening builds.Of the short list of critiques you can level at Offworld Trading Company, lack of depth is absolutely not one of them, and the mere thought of it is preposterous.

												This game is clearly meant to be a multiplayer romp against your friends that's played in short 7 sol sessions to see who is the best space capitalist on martian soil. It doesn't actually have a campaign in my opinion: the ""campaign"" is just a string of skirmishes with the AI with some tech/building limitations at the beginning to spice things up. It lacks a story, interaction between the characters and a more directed approach to objectives.It's a real shame since the tutorials are incredible: they not only give you a good gist on how to get started with this somewhat complex market trading game, but they also establish characters and some backstory for the game's corporations. The dialogue is also very well-written and shows the potential for at least a single player story.This game isn't bad, and I am sure that if a few players get together, they can have a blast Making Mars Great Again, but I bought it expecting a more thorough individual experience, hence I cannot actually recommend it for that reason.

												I enjoy RTS games and I thought this would be a good spin on your ""average"" RTS.  I believe that all the right elements are there but they're not put together in a way that makes for lasting play and replayability.   TL:DREvery match is really short and quickly boils down to one company taking over all the other companies.  You find yourself selling everything you have to buy that company out before they completly buy you out.  Campaigns have promise but fall short due to having to to buy DLC's to complete 0 of X missions and not being rewarded at the end.Pros: - Graphics are good- Soundtrack is good- UI is easy to understand- Managing the game is funCons: - Games are too short- Campaign could be a drawing point to the game but after I beat my first campaign game, I wasn't given the credit and I didn't get the money.- They sell DLCs that should've been in the game in the first place.- The biggest con, imo) There all these great options to sell to colonies, increase your wallet, and build your company but the games always end really quick when a competitor starts hostile takeovers of everyone.  You suddenly find yourself trying to buyout companies and buy their company before you get bought out.  The game becomes a ""hostile takeover game"" and it takes away from the game as a whole.  There are so many cool things that could happen with this game but they fall short.I just can't recommend buying the game for $40.  I bought it for $14, on sale, and I regret it.			"

Early Access Review
								When I bought this game, I though that it would be something different than what it is; and, I feel many of those not recommending this game made that same mistake. What this game is NOT is an economic/city builder simulation where you continually grow (ie a 4X). What it IS is a resource management RTS (others have gone into further detail) - probably the first of its kind (at least the first that I've played). In any case, it is very innovative and very good for what it is, in my opinion.I read through the other reviews to see if there was anything that I could add to what others have said, because I agree with most of the things that have been said about the game. One thng that I others haven't really talked about is how much strategy is actually involved in the game. First of all, others haven't really talked about how important the stock market actually is. As others have said, the ultimate goal of the game is to buy out your oponents stock; and conversely you must defend your own stock. Your stock price (and I might be a litttle bit wrong here) is based off of your net assets; that is the value of all your resources, buildings (including your home colony), minus any debt that you may have accrued; but more importantly, it also includes the value of any stock you buy in other (your opponent's) companies (also maybe your own?). The part I'm not sure about is how much the actual buying/selling of shares actually influences price. At the beginning everyone's stock price is low but it rises as the game progresses. If you can buy shares early on, not only will it make it easier for you to defeat your opponents in the end, you will make it much harder for them to beat you, since the progress they have made during the game has driven up your own stock price. Secondly, the fundamental question that the game asks the player is what is the the best/most profitable way for me to use my limited resources. By resources I mean the game's 12? resources (basic like iron or water, or advanced like electronics or chemicals), your cash, and most importantly the number of claims you have. Your claims equal the number of buidlings you can have and so are the limiting factor to your profit; that is you must maximize the profit from your limited number of claims. this raises a number of interesting questions and decisions. It may be profitable to scrap buildings for others if market prices for an output are much higher than the input, if you can buy a stockpile at a low price, or if you already have a stockpile. You may want to turn off a building if the input is more expensive than the output. Another result of this is that you are always (or should be) watching the prices on the market, and be aware of how they relate to the other resources.  Another result is that watching what your opponents are doing is important - they are working in the same market as you so, if they over or underproduce certain resources you can use that to your advantage. This is where the black market comes in. I agree with others that some of the sabotages are overpowered - but you need to remember, this game is still in early access so balancing issues should be ironed out. However, what they are not is underpriced; if the price is low, that just means that the players aren't using the market to their full advantage. The prices grows incrementally, so by the late game they should already be expensive. And as I said above, what your opponents produce - or don't, in this case - affects the prices you buy and sell at, so you can use sabotages to help you as well as hinder your opponents.Anyways, this got much longer than I intended, and I'm not sure how clear it was; but, I just want to say that I'm enjoying the game as it is, and eagerly await any improvements.

								I'm reviewing this in its current state.  I'll keep updating this review as updates get released.Decent game - has tons of potential, but it's just too bland and predictable to recommend right now.  I agree with other reviewers that say that it just needs an extra ""something"" to be fun (differing AI, more varied games, much better balancing, definitely optimization).  The part that I dislike the most is the balancing of the black market.  It's way too easy to buy an EMP to use on your opponents (and likewise for your opponents to use on you).  The only games I've won have been games where I constantly buy EMP's and disable my opponent's power plants or water sources.  This definitely needs to be balanced by maybe making them much more expensive and much less powerful.  I'm sure these will be balanced out over time.  *Edit:  As mentioned in the comments, you can disable the black market at the start of the game.  This is actually how I prefer to play since then the AI can't gang up on you and take away any advantages that you were smart enough to get at the beginning of the game.  I know this works both ways, but personally, I enjoy planning out everything without having to worry about the black market.  Maybe I'll come around to it with future updates.*Overall, currently, I don't think it's worth the price tag unless you want to be a part of the development process, but it may be in the future.  I'm looking forward to updates, as this game could be great!Update:  They've definitely been listening to the players with their updates, and they've updated the game twice since release which is great!  Nothing major that I can notice, but small tweaks that make a significant difference.  I'll keep updating as things progress.			"

Early Access Review
								Have you ever played an RTS or 4X game and thought ""I wish non-military victories were more viable?""  Well let me tell you about Offworld Trading Company.In Offworld, you are a company looking to compete with other startups and get rich by mining Mars for as much of the thirteen available resources as possible and drive opponents out of business.  There are NO military units.  Economic victory is the only victory.There are four factions, but you don't select one until you've had the chance to survey the map.  Resource availability and diversity is randomly generated, giving you the chance to plant the faction you think is best for the environment. APM will not save you, Starcraft fans. Resource tile claims are very limited.  You will NEVER have all thirteen resources immediately.  Some can be extracted on the spot, and others can only be produced by combining resources.  What you can't collect yourself, you can purchase in an always available market where prices fluctuate on your behavior and the behavior of your opponents.Your ""score"" is your Share Price.  It is your net worth minus your debt.  You defet other players by buying up massive amounts of their increasingly expensive shares.  When you purchase all of their shares, you get everything they've been building.  Your goal is to buyout all the other players.The ""essential"" resources are Water, Oxygen, Food, Fuel and Power.  Will your colony starve if you lack them?  NO!  ""Starvation"" does not exist, unlike Civ.  You will automatically buy what you need from the market passively and accumulate Debt instead.  Scrambling to acquire them all initially to avoid debt is a beginner's (or Civ player's) mistake.  What good is staving off debt if you grab all those things without producing precious Aluminum or Steel to allow you to upgrade your headquarters and edge closer to victory?  At the same time, you can't ignore them forever, because too much debt reduces your Share Price, allowing players to buy you more easily.As you upgrade your headquarters, you are provided handfuls of more claims to tiles to help you collect and produce more resources, and build fancier buildings that will help you generate the wealth you need to buyout your opponents.And then Sabatoge comes into play.  Just because there's no militaries doesn't mean you can't take your opponents down a peg.  The Black Market opens at regular intervals, allowing players to buy EMPs to temporarily disable opposing buildings, fake Mutinies to steal buildings, Dynamite to destroy buildings, or devastating, nonlethal Underground Nukes to permanently reduce the yield of an opponent's production tile.  You can also buy precious claims when you want just one more building without having to upgrade, or Goon Squads that defend buildings from attacks (and then throw them back at opponents).  There are four factions.  Three of them are human and require Water, Oxygen and Food.  The Expansive humans are great if you're hungry for lots of tiles, because they get an extra Claim on a tile every time they upgrade.  They also require less Steel for upgrades.  The Robotic colony doesn't care about Water, Food or Oxygen, but instead require Electronics (the final, most expensive resource) as well as massive amounts of Power.  Scientific colonies have the unique ability to plant production facilities directly on top of a raw resource, therby ""skipping"" a step.  This is huge if you use it carefully.  My favorite faction, Scavengers, use Carbon instead of Steel and can use the Black Market more frequently.  They are my favorite because while other players are fighting over Iron and spending claims changing that same Iron into Steel, I can just use Carbon for everything (yet they are useless on a map where I can't find Carbon.)  Again, when you play the game, you scan the map for resources FIRST and then choose the faction you think will work best with what you can grab.As of March 2015 the game is aesthetically rough.  There are only two songs, simple, loud sound effects, and placeholder robotic voices to announce events in game.  Still, I cannot put this game down.  Its positively brilliant and addictive, and it will only get better as the game develops.			"

								Too simplified. The premise is great. It would be a winner if games were much longer so actual strategic decisions could be applied. It seems whoever positions themselves better during the ""mad rush"" at the start will win - ceteris paribus.I think a turn based, long haul, approach would be more satisfying. Also, the game as it sits is just not justifying a $40 price tag. In the current state: short gameplay, graphical clipping, et cetera - it should sit around $15-20 with a potential scaling bump as content/development grows.			"

												OTC is a nice game, but dont be fooled that it is anywhere near the CIV series.  It is a basic resource management game in a very polished GUI.  A game can last around 30 minutes so you can play online or with friends but it doesnt quite scratch my itch.My problem is that it never really goes anywhere, each new game seems the same as the last and the limited number of ""factions"" dont add the variation considering there are not any real variations with maps.This biggest issueby far is that when you start a campaign, only 33% is unlocked, the rest is DLC.  It's like watching the adverts before a youtube clip, right after you paid to see it without ads.  I understand the desire to get more cash from customers, but this isn't candy tank crush sage bubble witch.  Shame on you.What should be a fun quick game is repetative and begging for cash.  Now I know what Trading Company"" refers to.			"

												It's like realtime Settlers of Catan.It's not much like city builder style economic games (such as Tropico, Dwarf Fortress, Factorio, the Settlers series) because you are heavily limited by the number of tiles (ie resources) you can claim. There's no optimising your road layout because there are no roads - your cargo flies where it needs to go.The limited number of tile claims you have slows the pace from totally frantic to manageable. The game is bursts of frenetic energy and aggression as you seize an available opportunity, then back to waiting. It feels a bit like a turn based boardgame with a chess timer.I bought this game thinking I was going to have a nice quiet time building up a peaceful economy, as in the games I listed before, and that I wasn't too keen on the competitive aspect. Two hours later, I'm a cutthroat wheeling-and-dealing space CEO.That said, it's very easy to make unfixable mistakes, and the game's not much good at teaching you how to play it. I think a lot of plays will be necessary to figure out good strategies. There are also some rough edges in the game balance - there are a few ""I win"" buttons in there, which I'm expecting will get nerfed in future.It's a lot of fun, though. Just expect to think on your feet, very quickly, and to go for the throat.			"

								'This isn't going to be like other RTS, it's going to be economy based instead of blowing things up' ... Put's in a 'black market' where you buy things to blow stuff up.I like the game concept, but I feel as though the black market is detrimental to it. You are meant to outfox the other companies, by speculating on price and going after the resources that will be needed. It's like playing MULE or Settlers of Catan. The problem is it just reverts to any other RTS when the Black Market comes into play. If someone tries to plan ahead, see what is going to be needed, invest, ect. Other players just shut their stuff down. Sure, there are no armies, but is has the same effect. It's just lazy. Imagine Microsoft, instead of competing for market share with Apple based on innovation, could just nuke one of Apple's manufacturing plants. That's not how it works. Should we add a rule to Monopoly where you can obliterate Hotels? This is not in the spirit of this sort of arena.Please remove this and replace it with something else. There are auctions, price manipulations, etc. that are better suited for this game. More ideas like those, and less 'sabotage' type things would be MUCH better. If you don't want this to be like every other RTS out there, then don't make it like every other RTS out there. There is a lot of potential here, please don't drop the ball.I enjoy some aspects of the game, and see where it could be fun, but I cannot recommend it unless the direction is changed.			"

								I felt this game didn't really offer all that much long term playability for its price point at $20, and now at $40 its become a blatent rip off. The basic idea was strong, but the mechanics and arcade-ish gameplay do a serious diservice to their stated gameplay goals.			"

								You'll see some people referencing Civ, or even Endless Legends in their reviews. Ignore it, except for the hex-based map they have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with this game.OTC is a fast-paced game, trading done platformer style: no time to pay attention to anything, just go go go go.Surprisingly, that actually turns out to be more fun than it sounds.But if you are looking for a deep simulation, it really isn't here.

								I honestly can't recommend this game enough. I've played it so much and i've never gotten bored of it. NEVER. Playing multiplayer especially against other experienced players is an amazing challenge and no two games are ever alike. The replayability of the game is through the roof. Go buy this game! The community is fantastic, the gameplay is challenging and ever changing, and the sights and sounds are phenomenal. Very well balanced game.			"

												I was somewhat intrigued but not sure about an economic RTS having got bored of most trading games pretty quick, so I held off on this title for a while but picked it up on special recently. Not at all what I expected. Strategy is as fast and fluid as the market. Everything polished to a high shine. Let's plays don't do justice to how tight, refined and fun this game is. Highly recommended - especially if you like resource based board games eg. Catan, Puerto Rico etc.			"

												I was intimidated upon hearing about the premise of this game... It sounds like one of those games that are only fun to people with very specialized knowledge and tastes. But actually the developers have succeeded in making a very approachable and fast game about economy, business and finance, with clear tutorials and interface, and with a focus on multiplayer but still having a fun singleplayer experience.Every building needs special materials and produces something else, but all materials can be bought or sold at the market, with dynamic prices based on supply and demand. Imagine if in warcraft 2, you could sell your extra lumber to other players. There's no military combat here, but economic attacks, defense and espionage are integral to the game.You may be interested in the premise or not, but don't skip the game fearing that it will be too complicated. The mechanics are simple at the core, and may teach you an abstract thing or two about how business works in the real world.			"

								Given the oft and loudly proclaimed provenance of this game I expected a 4X-RTS experience, except with markets instead of militaries.  I imagined hours of playing vast, sprawling games across the surface of Mars, replete with complexity and grand strategic depth.That's not what this game is.  In fact OTC is a scion of the great RTS's of the late 90s, and it operates on that same tense, refined, match-oriented, competitive level- in which the genre name becomes an anachronism, because the actual gameplay is so tight and focused that it would be best described as tactical rather than strategic.  Matches are fast-paced and relatively short, demanding a combination of quick clicks and quick thinking to stay on top.  Resources, tech, and production are all tied up with each other in a single intertangled ""tree"" of progression.  You can buy or sell any resource or product at any time if you have the money, and one of the key facets of playing well is using this ever-market to drive up the value of your surplus goods and drive down the value of your opponents', while still making sure you are keeping your levels where they need to be to avoid halts in production or debt accumulation.  There's a moment sometimes in a match where suddenly you see a way that you can make the market perform for you like a puppet- a few minutes and some well-placed clicks later and your stock is way out on top  (assuming, of course, your plans aren't deflected by your opponents' own devious machinations).  Victory in OTC occurs when one player owns all the stock of all the corporations in the match.During the best matches I experience that same sort of premium-grade thrumming that I used to get from a good game of Starcraft in college, complete with peculiar blink of bewilderment at match's end as my brain powers down its High Alert protocols and returns to normal functioning.  I find it interesting that the devs keep emphasizing how not like Starcraft this game is, and yet my gut-level experience has been very similar for the two games.  It's interesting as well that the devs were so worried about multiplayer catching on without any combat outlet for players.  And yet this game shines most brightly in the cutthroat multiplayer arena.  I think they underestimated our creativity when it comes to eradicating our opponents.  The markets of OTC can be just as disruptive and violent (and satisfying) as any zerg-infested terran marine making a bee-line for your base.Overall 7.5/10Pros:+original concept with a classic feel+elegant, streamlined gameplay+relatively short matches+rewards creativity and decisiveness+compelling soundtrackYou decide:+/-quick clicking can be a major factor in your success+/-limited options in terms of tech and production+/-the differences among the corporate classes pose some interesting market problems for players but ultimately gameplay is pretty much the same for everyone+/- Early Access...sometimes you find a diamond at the end, sometimes it's a lemon.  I do tend to trust Stardock though.+/-high tension gameplayCons:-high, inflexible price point (a side effect of Kickstarter)-graphics and glitches need a lot of work before they are polished-occasional imbalances-game doesn't prepare you for its experience (watch some LPs, it helps a lot)			"

Early Access Review
								A brief description of this game may read ""resource management and competitive economics on Mars"" - its free from combat (at least of a gun-play kind) and runs at ""realtime"" - Sounds good (if you like that sort of thing, which I do) and faily original...BUT there is one central and perhaps critical flaw...Offworld Trading Company has some truelly fantastic and compulsive elements - it has simple yet dynamic gameplay which takes seconds to learn and forever to master; the claiming and extraction of always limited resources before your competitors is simple enough (at least in theory) - the refinement of the resources into goods that demand higher prices, none too complex - manipulating the market for your benifit needs a little practice - However, learning how and when to combine black market tricks on your competitors with manufactured price hikes that trash their stock so you can buy them at a snap -- this takes time.  Sadly, time is the thing that you simply don't have.  Whilst the interface, the gameplay and the graphics are all on a scale between good and outstanding the games pacing feels all off.  It's like watching (the original) Total Recall at twenty times the normal speed; you know that there are some great moments in there that you would love to savour but it's gone before you've noticed you're enjoying yourself.  If you're victorious then it doesn't feel like you've worked for it, if you lose it dosn't feel you've had a chance to put up a fight.  A game lasts around a half an hour to an hour and moves at a pace that would give Usain Bolt jet lag...And this is worries me because I don't know how it can be changed without removing all that makes the game stand-out from the crowd.  The Unique Selling Point of this game is ""realtime"" competitive economics - but that's not strictly true; REALTIME economics is slow, careful, managed.  Sure, there is shouting and screaming on the trading floor, but the wider economic world around it moves at a more measured pace.  RTS is a format that suits combat orientated games - it's frantic ""WHO IS SHOOTING ME/WHEN DID THAT BLOW-UP!!"" quality is appropriate to its content - war is (I imagine) chaotic and frantic - it's central gameplay is built around event's that can be drawn over realtime - namely gunfights.  But if we had a TRUE RTS economics game you would need to pass it down several generations to win - Neither nation nor global corporation gained market dominance over thirty muinets, it takes hundereds of yeears.... something thats nicely communicated and simulated in the format of a turn-based game.  The question is ""who want's this game"", or perhaps rather ""When do I want this game""?  If I'm in the mood for something fast-paced but stratigic it makes sense to look for gunplay, if its long lasting and stratigic economic is better.  This has the flaw of being neither and both.In the end, for all of Offworld Trading Company's good points (and it has many), its format seems irreconcilably at odds with its content; it ain't realtime economics at all, its economics so fast it feels like you can't breath - think Arnie in the red dust with eyes about to pop.

												Other reviews have covered the excellent sound, graphics, and market-driven gameplay. I will just add this: rarely have I played an RTS where the AI was so hard to beat. On Manager (where neither side has an advantage) I have only managed to win once out of about 8-10 games. You can play on an easier difficulty setting, of course; but it is refreshing for me to have an AI that provides such a challenge. (Playing online with friends has been great as well.)Oh, and from my experience (and what I have read/seen on streams) it is absolultely not true that the game lacks depth. When playing on a proper difficulty, a combination of terrain, faction, and the behavior of your opponents will force hard choices that do not play out the same every time. Highly recommended.			"

								“MONEY is POWER”Highly recommended M&A simulation RTS.Concept : Fresh and Unique. Real Time Strategy but like a BoardgameObjectives : Make money, buy stocks and M&A opponents to winMaps : Randomly generated maps each game with some kind of tile setsOptimization : Pretty goodDisplay : Not bad but also not goodSounds : Unmemorable music with awful voice on black marketDifficulty : Pretty difficult to beginnersFirst impression of this game, when I heard and saw the concepts about OTC, it looks very interesting. But While watching the developer’s youtube tutorial videos, it looks a little boring because of there was no actual controllable units, and graphics and interface was looked too much simple. And today, after release as Early Access, while played first tutorial, it was looked really simple. But after play 5+ games? This game appeared ‘complex’ and ‘painstaking’.Compete auction to take high resource depots, regulate funds and debt, buy, sell and control the value of resources, bother opponents by black market... Above all, despite the difficulty was only employee level, AI players are not stupid :)This isn’t a perfect AAA game, but I think it’s worth of $40. It’ll be advance better and better until official release in 2016.			"

								For an early access game, it has outstanding potential. Listed below are some of the pros and cons:Pros:-Great deal of strategy including resource management, use of black market, stocks, etc-Every game is different-Addicting!Cons:-Multiplayer is currently player hosted (huge amounts of lag mid to end game)-If hosted player leaves, the game ends-Some of the resources are not balanced-AI sucks-Tutorial needs some work. Seems more like a ""figure it out yourself"" game.Even with more cons than pros, I would still strongly recommend this when more patches come out. I wouldn't buy this now due to pricing and lag, but definitely check this out when they fix the multiplayer issues. "

												July 2016 Early Access Review UpdatedThe game is certainly more polished now that it was 1 year ago when I first reviewed it. It feels more like a game now and no longer causes my computer to melt down doing the tutorials. It is still a race to buy out the opponent and games typically last only 20 minutes. This means you are playing the same basic game over and over and over and that gets old fast.You are basically paying £30 for a game that gets boring after 2 hours, in those 2 hours you will typically have finished 6 games.The devs where told this a year ago and have done absolutely nothing to address the problem.Economy fans like their games to be longer than and deeper than this. Also it feels like a £9.99 Facebook game sold on the PC for £30 to me.Good game for £9.99.... bit of a rip off for £30 if you ask me.Below is my review for 1 year ago.... looks like I was right. April 2015 Early Access ReviewThe game needs more things to do, currently it is a pretty dull buy out your competitors before they buy you out affair. Every game is race to that end. Look at my hours in the game 1.8, I played several games and that is how long it took to win in each game. So there is no depth here, its a short sweet economic race game, with the finishing post being he who owns everything wins. It also runs rather hot too even on my well cooled system.I have not seen anything to suggest the game is getting more depth added prior to release. So I think this game will ultimately disappoint users who find them selves paying close to £30 for a game thats barely worth £4. There is going to be backlash over the price, just wait and see.			"

												What is this game about?:This is an economic RTS simulator that takes place on Mars. Matches will take around 15-30 minutes depending on how many people you are playing with. This is not a epic-scale game like Civilization!  So you, the player can choose between 4 different factions. The 4 different factions are: Expansive, Robotic, Scientific and Scavenger. Every factions has there ups and downs and you want to use the best faction that you think is good on set random map.Gameplay:-Ingame you will have a market window on the left for all the market prices and all the rescource units you might have. This is where all the buying and selling will be taken place.-In the middle of the screen is where most of the action takes plays. On the map you build buildings that produce rescources which cost claims where you have limited number of. Because of this you need to plan your way through-On the right top side is where you and other players companies stocks are. The goal to win a game is very simple. Buy every other company out by buying there stock. Each company has 10 stocks. You can buy someone out by having a majority of there stock (6 stocks=60%) or if they bought there own 5 stocks already, you can buy those 5 stocks, double the price, in 1 go.-To combat the company that is leading a match there is something called the blackmarket. The blackmarket is on the right bottom side of the screen and will have a set of different items. Some items are there for to shutdown the production of your opponents or to boost your own production.What has the game to Offer?:-9 Tutorials which are very well done and explain you the game. after every tutorial you pass it will be a bit harder for you which is nice.-Campaign which consist of 9 different leaders which have there own set of different buildings. You play 6 different matches where you buy into the colony and not a Company. After that there is a final match where you need to buyout the remaining 3 companies. Note: prices are going to be crazy in this mode. Campaign takes about 4-5 hours.-Skirmish mode up to 8 Players.-Daily Challenge. Everyone gets the same map and restrictions and you will be competing to get the best time. There is also a leaderboard for that and you can watch replays from other players to see what they did differently.-Ranking System(online). 1vs1 is available on Monday through Thursday and 4 FFA Friday through Sunday.-Custom Lobby games(online). Just skirmish matches with your own rules against real people or with/against AI.-Well balanced AI-Different types of game modes.			"

												So this is a typical Stardock Game.  and for those that love stardock, you may enjoy picking this up.  I got it on boxing day for about $15.  I've played it for about 5 hours and am done with it and feel I got my monies worth at $15.  IMO it is not even remotely worth the $45 they are charging full price for it.   Pro's:  I like the factions.  they are well designed, have cool leaders with interesting personalities and the art is fun.The idea of a planetary city builder with strong economic motivations really appeal to me.  almost like Alpha centari playing the morgan faction for those Sid Mier geeks out there.Interface is easy to use,  turtorials are quick and snappy, you can be playing this game at full speed within an hour of running the tutorial missions.Con's:  ITs way too fast.  Games last about 30 mins start to finish.  (even the ones I win)  I am more into the long game simlations, which is why I opened with ""typical star dock game""  your neighbours will be on your doorstep within minutes of starting the game, and if you don't take an eary lead, you are toast as you only have about 10 minutes to make up the lead or the game will end.The campaign mode was lacklustre, and turtorials for campaign mode were lacking,  it was hard to really understand what campaign was about until you play one campaign game through to completeion . fortunatly they games only last about 20 mins so its faster to just play it through and figure it out than to google it and read about it.Overall I am going to not recomend this game.  not because its not good,  it is, but Its way overpriced. if you are picking this up on sale, you can probably get 10 hours of fun out of it so pay accordingly.  if you have friends that play, you can probably get a little more time out of it, as multiplayer seems to be really the only place a game this fast would be fun time and time again.  Or if you like stardock games in general, go ahead and pick it up.   honestly though, its not as good as the videos make it look.			"

												I first went into the game adoring the feel and wishing for it to be a longer classical tycoon style game.I'm so glad it isn't.This game is an incredibly intelligent and unique strategy game that requires players to manage a company and successfully out-play their competitors in short to intermediate matches, where the objective is to buy out the oppoisition. With limited claims, a♥♥♥♥♥♥of resource types and locations players will have to adapt their strategy to what they can get their hands on, and if a competitor is getting a bit too powerful, players can use a series of corporate espionage actions in order to temporarily cripple parts of their competitors, to get that slight edge.Everything about this gamem requires you to think ahead and plan out what you want to do, while being able to adapt said plan to the ever evolving playing field that competitors provide. Your stocks might suddenly be bought or maybe someone decided to shut down your production, and it's through this that you have to carefully adapt and react to these situations. The interactions between players is done incredibly, with fast-paced gameplay that'll keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time.Accompanying this is of course beautiful and stylized graphics combined with incredible sounds and music to create the perfect mood, depending on where you're at in the game. They successfully managed to make Mars up close beautiful, and after the release of recent DLC, they did the same with Ceres.While the lack of players is definitely a problem, the AI is honestly one of the best I've seen in any game. The devs have spent so much time and money on making an extremely intelligent AI that can adapt and plot just as well as the player, and will create many intense moments where you and the competing AI are racing to buy the other's last stock, with the most satisfying feeling when you finally manage to beat them.Ultimately this game is incredible and definitely deserves a try, though it may not be for most casual strategy players. You'll find hours of entertainment, whether it's through the AI or other players that by some magical chance you manage to find. GG Mohawk, GG.			"

												Offworld Trading Company is easily one of my favourite real-time strategy games, and it picks up right where M.U.L.E. left off back in 1983, even making a few very sweet references along the way.I'm an economics dunce and a total sloth at real-time strategy but Offworld Trading Company grabbed me by the cahonies right from the moment Christopher 'Baba Yetu' Tin's Red Planet Nocturne pattered out of my speakers to the words 'Earth may be dying'. It's a wonderfully evocative set-up and one perfectly scored by Tin.Here's a war game that's fought on a different front: the Martian stock market. It's Corporate Combat. There's no diplomacy, and there are no weapons in the literal sense either; your weapon is cold hard capitalism and your trusty steed supply and demand. Ride it well.It seems some people go into OTC expecting some sort of longform, perhaps story-driven campaign, that plays like a laid back empire builder. It isn't like that. At all. This is a trading game and it's cutthroat. Quick and sharp. Dog eat dog. ""Screw with us, and we'll screw with you.""Single rounds can be over in as little as 15 minutes or drawn out towards an hour depending on how well (or badly) you play, but the game goes to great lengths to ease you in with a fine set of tutorials, a 'full fat' tutorial skirmish, toggle-able auto-pausing when you're doing certain tasks, speed settings, and it also comes bundled with a comprehensive and in-depth almanac. Oh, and the tooltips are superb.There is a campaign mode but it's not a linear single playthrough affair. It's dynamic, replayable, meaty and as such something you can really sink your teeth into. Think Invisible Inc. or Infested Planet's new Planetary Campaign DLC where each skirmish is linked together by a strategic layer, rich with tough but exciting decisions that may have far reaching ramifications as you progress.The Daily Challenges too are worth a pop just to hone your real-time skills with no pausing and see how you fare against other players. The competitive multiplayer is demanding but there's also co-op against the AI which knows how to play and can be a formidable challenge in itself. My friend and I have yet to beat it on the recommended Manager difficulty!All in all, if you like your strategy to be focused and deep then Offworld Trading Company might just be for you. It's such a smart game and one I foresee myself coming back to again and again. I'm yet to pick up the DLC but it sounds fantastic.			"

Early Access Review
								My roommate walked in and asked what I was playing. I told him it was Offworld Trading Company, an RTS about building a corporation on Mars, expanding your base, and specializing in the production of a whole host of materials to earn enough money to buy out your opponents. He told me it looked pretty interesting, but mentioned that I was losing... And I was, BADLY. The match was down to myself and one other company, but that enemy had bought out two other players. They were an unstoppable behemoth with 10x the iron mines, steel mills, glass factories, electronic depots, and every other profitable thing you can imagine. It was this sort of scenerio I might have just given up and quit in any other strategy game. But, I couldn't embaress myself, here. I had an offworld market, capable of launching rockets filled with my most precious materials to the skies and bringing back buckets of cash and my opponent didn't. I coud see the flashing, red percentage next to my enemy's name, noting how close they were to buying me out. I managed to buy a bit of my enemy's stock. But, it was still going to cost 2 million to win. I sold EVERYTHING, making a little bit here, a little bit there. I looked to the right: 70%, 80%, 90%... 99%. That's it! 2 million!!! Buy, buy, buy. I won. What.I've read some reviews where people don't seem to understand why prices go up or down and don't understand some of the core mechanics of the game, so I just wanted to clear a few things up. There are 2-8 companies in each match, with a colony at the center. All goods start at a certain price. If players buy more of one resource, it goes up in price. If they sell a lot, it goes down. The colony also expands as the game goes on and each building they create has specific demands that also affect the market prices.Each player chooses one of four types of headquarters, each with their own abilities. The game is based on isometric tiles and when you start the game, you'll only have a few claims to own the tiles you choose. By leveling up your base from level 1 to level 5, you get more claims to diversify and increase production. At max level, you can build an offworld market that launches rockets into space. This secondary market isn't affected by supply and demand, it just has permanatly high prices. This makes it a very lucridive end game to reach and pile up enough money to buy out your opponents.The game is a tense, corporate competition that has so many ways to play, allowing you to build a vast mining corporation, an electronic manufacturing titan, or a chemical lab empire. You can upgrade everything, specialize or diversify, build quick and unstable, or slow and steady; the game offers a ton of ways to replay. This is a fantastic strategy game that isn't much like any major game out there and is tons of fun with friends. The AI is pretty tough, though.			"

								I want to like this game a lot but it is really hard to, like really really hard.tl;dr = if you like the concept wait (most likely a long time) for a good sale (price of $5 or less)The video of this game above says that no two games are ever the same.  And I will admit, I took that with a grain of salt but holy cow is every game the definition of linear.  Get to HQ5, build 2 rocket pads and sell stuff till you can buy someone out.  After you buy someone out it is literally an easy win if not outright impossible (if the player is good) to lose the game.  Very little room for play/counter-play is basically a big issue.The game is so under developed that there isnt many Pros to the Cons for this game.  I find it annoying that a developer wants to crowdsource their development.One big thing this game is lacking is an actual supply and demand.  I can debt materials out of thin air.  At least they could make all resources actually match the surpluss (or shortage) of stuff in the game.  For example.  If no one built power, stuff should just go unpowered, instead of debting power from some magical source that produces it.  This thought can be carried over into every other resource.  If I want to buy iron, the market better have a surplus of it, such as another play sold 200 iron ""to the market"" so that now any other player can now buy that 200 iron at some market price and if it is gone, welp its gone (till someone else sells some).  THIS IS THE KEY PART OF THE GAME PLAY THAT I EXPECTED WHEN I STARTED PLAYING.  Sadly this game is more about ""get the most money"" from selling♥♥♥♥♥♥to the aether instead of economic warfare.Debt is really meh in the game, especially if you dont have TIGHTER DEBT rule on.  My friend -- when he played with me -- had to get over 300k debt from an auction (that apparently can go onto infinity) before it started to seriously effect his stockprice.Stocks dont do anything other than protect (delay) you from losing or to take control of another player.  There is no reason to really do anything with Stocks till later in the game.  Realistically it should yield dividends (if you owned other people's stock) for example.  It should be a risk/reward factor -- do I keep my stock in this player to yield dividends and I black market this other player to keep them down while I build up or do I sell now from this guy so I can outright buy this other guy.  This thought process never happens the way stocks are used in this game.  It is always ""I will just wait to get more money (from selling stuff) and buy this guy outright"".While the developers have some odd understanding that a minimap and/or player distinction (EVERYONE LOOKS THE SAME) is not imporant, I am left clueless at to this Warcraft 3, Starcraft 2 and Age of Empires ""RTS"" they have played without a minimap or such distinguishing features between players.  Very irritating.Races are pretty much unimportant and do little to change the way one plays the game.  ""Exanpsive"" has the most advantage by default because Claims are so imporant for every aspect of the game but that doesnt mean they automatically win either.I could go on in detail about a lot of other small aspects of the game that are bad but that would be a waste of time for both you and me.

								Positive: - There's a lot of potential for this game.- It's pretty- The concept is something new.- Runs flawlessly.Negative:- At this time, the only down fall I could find was the price. It is definitely not worth $40 at this time.Recommendation:If you absolutely MUST have this game then go ahead and get it. If you're looking for something to try out.. DON'T. You can accomplish more burning your money. After playing a few times you'll already experience most of what is to offer at the moment. It's a game worth watching for in the future but do yourself a favor and save your money for now.			"

												I didn't think I'd like this game since I do not usually like Real Time Strategy games, but after only a couple of months Offworld Trading Company is already one of my most played games on Steam.What makes OTC so special is how different each match is. While other games in the genre require constant study of builds as the meta shifts, here the randomized maps and varied strategies from opponents force players to play each round differently. Whereas one match might see the price of food skyrocket you to victory, the next match might find food barely worth the cost of the building. The player most able to see and take advantage of gaps in the market wins.The result is a game that still makes me sweat after 200 matches played, yet even when I lose I still enjoy myself. What better compliment can you offer a competitive multiplayer game? I highly, highly recommended.edit: This game has only improved over the course of Early Access, and it's still a game I play regularly!			"

												I have never written a review of a game before, but I feel compelled to write one for this game.  I have always loved strategy games, the more in-depth the better.  If you are like me, then I HIGHLY recommend this game.  The tools you have available for manipulating the market, taking advantage of your opponents weaknesses, and exploiting the quirks of each individual map all combine to offer an extremely competitive and variable Multiplayer experience.  I can't speak too much to the Single Player elements of the game, I don't generally play SP stuff, but the MP environment by itself more than justifies the purchase of this game.  The developers are extremely connected and involved in the community, and I couldn't ask for a better product, pick this game up if you haven't already!			"

												An incredibly fun economic RTS with fast matches. It is no way like Civilization or any other 4X strategy. I'd say it look a lot more like Starcraft with cash instead of zerglings.The only thing that dissapoints me is that the online of the game is mostly dead. You can spend good 20 minutes and never find any game. I think the developers can fix it with a good discount and a free content update.			"

												Important:  Each game is a match that takes 20-40min to complete.  There are options that allow for longer games but the design is based on short cutthroat matches over long empire building.That being said the game is fantastic!The single player enviroment is rich is choices.  You can play a campaign at a difficulty of your choosing that goes through 7 matches each with carry over conditions and abilities.  This forces you to mix up your playing style and adjust to different situations.  You will be restricted in building choices as well, so learning to make do with what you have is important.  The game ends after a final showdown where you are allowed to buy out your rivals.  This mode is very fun and less stressfull then the other match types.Skirmish and multiplayer allow you to buy out your rivals from the start (this is how you win the game).  With a dynamic market then the game is all about spotting oppertunities and taking advantage or knee capping your opponents with targeted special abilites on their structures.The game has a setting that allows you to hide the real identity of each player to prevent grudge matches from getting out of hand for a reason!!The game is fast, but very deep, you tend to get time to think about your decisions despite the time pressure.  Production chains are rather simple, but the overall interaction of the market and the 13 resources allows for immense possibilities.  No two matches are ever alike.The game is pretty unique and I really do not have anything else that scratches the same kind of itch (Anno series comes the closest, but the markets are pretty stale in comparision).If you like schemes like shutting down your rivals water production shortly after causing a spike in water prices with the ultimate goal of making their food production too expensive to compete with yours, then well, you have found your dream game.To me this game is a 10/10 for this type of game, but it is not for everyone, expecially people who do not like competitive games.

Early Access Review
								Terrific game built on a purely economic and capitalist set of goals as opposed to a military one. The initial game is relatively simplistic. Build a base on mars with the resource nodes available on the map while trying to make money by selling those same resources for money. You can only hold so many plots of land at a time so you have to build your economy in a narrow frame of what you want to do with the space you have. Resources gain more and more value over time but every time a player, or the ai sells something it lowers the value of the resource. The game is a modicum of a real world stock market and economy but simpler and faster.The game has a lot of interesting depth and complexity to these simple mechanics. There is the push/pull of using your resources more quickly to advance your base vs selling them to have cash on hand. You can prioritize basic resources for your base in the early game that have less value later or prioritize the pricier resources for cash. Playing on maps with restricted resources forces you to change how you approach making money. Off world shipping is worth bank late game when selling basics like foods but requires advance components and resources to make. It requires a good timing on when to have what resources in production in order to maximize profit. One corporation only uses robots which requires no food to operate and less water but it means a higher requirement for advance resources. This means dedicating less land plots to cheaper basic resources but a higher cash cost early game.If aggresively manipulating economies to your benefit, moving resources for money, or aggressively selling your own stock in order to gain quick cash to make deals and then buying it back and throwing cash at your opponents in hostile takeover does not sound interesting then this game is not for you. Otherwise go nuts. Also the game has beautifully simple graphics.			"

												You know it’s a good game when you go to sleep and dream about playing more. How does someone make an economic RTS fun? Play this and you will see exactly how. Also the tutorial is really good and gets you up to speed, haven't touched the campaign yet but it’s on my to-do list. Oh and the soundtrack is just amazing. This game was finished 6 months ago or at least it felt that way (it’s been an amazing experience being part of the early access for it), and it has just been polished and polished to the amazing creation we are presented with. Soren and Mohawk Studios created something that will last a long time in the minds and hearts of gamers, just like Civ4. Highly Recommended, and easily going in my top 10 game list for 2016.			"

And what a fantastic single-player campaign that goes far beyond the usual set of canned skirmishes.  This is one of those rare games that manages to be both unique and indebted to forgotten gems like MULE, ruthless.com, and Transport Tycoon.Full review here:http://www.quartertothree.com/fp/2016/04/28/offworld-trading-company-work-genius-33-years-making/ "

Early Access Review
								Early Access Review (2/12/15)BLUF: #1 - I feel that RTS is a poor term to describe this game and #2 - from the Devs “Feedback! We want to know how players are going to break the game, suss out any degenerate strategies, and make sure we polish every rough edge off of the gameplay. Offworld Trading Company is fully funded; we are not relying on Early Access sales to finish the game.” This statement is key.***For those of you who have been burned by early access games before please take the note from the Devs seriously. This is a very playable and stable game right now and they already have the resources to put the finishing touches on it. So you are not really paying to make the game, you are getting an early shot at the game and a chance to drive further balance into the system. The final quality of this game will depend heavily on balancing the PVP aspects of the game so the more feedback they have now the better.As far as this being a RTS; while it might be the closest term we have to define it, that will give many people the wrong idea. There are no units to move, no combat, and no chokepoints. You establish a base and build buildings to harvest resources (much like the Warhammer:Dawn of War series) and use those resources to develope higher teir commdities to eventually sell for cash and buy out your opponents. It is fast paced and at times will feel like a RTS, but traditional RTS tactics will fail for the most part.The key is that the prices that determine which resource is the 'win' resource will depend on the strat adapted by the players in the game and will change from game to game. There are no Ultimate Resources that win the game each time. The higher teir products will usually have a higher price, but if everyone in that game chases them then the price will plummet and the player sitting on a pile of low teir resources can dominate. Basically the L33T strat that everyone wants to use will neuter itself before it can win.My current concerns:The pace of the game is very aggressive for a strategy game. The pace can be adjusted and I have only played against the AI with their GHz brains, but knowing PVP types this could quickly devolve into a 'who can spam out the first 3 correct buildings' contest.The interface needs to do a better job of letting the player know whats going on. There are some pretty nasty things lurking on the Black Market and all you get is a chat box type readout to announce them and maybe an onscreen animation if you happen to be looking at that part of the map at the time. The trick is to find the balance where we get the info we need without getting our screen spammed out by alerts. Good luck Mohawk!			"

												Do not buy!- Content does not justify the price, I cannot stress that enough.EDIT: 16/12/16, Ive notice theve added DLC that should be free due to sheer lack of content in this thing. Not good at all.Fun game but overpriced, quite complicated at first you have to manage resources to produce products but both can be sold so the economy balance can get hectic. And the UI is obstructive but i guess that is the main element as the map is its just for placing structures, it takes up most of the screen. There is a campaign, sort of, which is round based, messy and confusing in its layout (you have to choose starting locations on a planet that give you bonuses if you 'win' that mission?). Also its really just skirmish after skirmish with a twist (focus on the colony construction rather 'beating down' the opposition) with a strange competitive vain running through, like a business style knockout in the later stages.Overall this is no way worth the full price of £30-£45 (Deluxe) or even the discounted £22-£29. This is like a solid £15 indie title currently, Its just a nice concept that could get boring after maybe 10 hours play at a push,it is fun with some friends which can extend its play value to a point but I'd wait for some content updates, if theyll be any...Pros:Nice art styleFun crashing the marketsFun teaming up with friends to price fixConceptCons:Content (lack of)CampaignVarietyMaps (samey really even with the map pack)UIPriceEDIT: 16/12/16, Ive noticed the've added DLC, that should be free due to sheer lack of content in this thing.

Early Access Review
Ignore the entry ticket price, this is one of the most polished Early Access titles you'll ever see.Offworld Trading Company, possibly the most curious of creatures. A game that dares to break the rules, it's not quite a 4x and it's not quite an RTS, and yet it's got elements of both, as well as a very brutal and brilliant introduction into capitalism in it's most true sense.The creator of this was the lead designer of Civ IV, still widely regarded as the pinnacle of the series and still very much fondly remembered by many to this day (and often still played by many, it's got a dedicated following, mods and glorious goodies, it's still fantastic, if you don't have Civ IV, please get it). He's brought a very unique approach to this game and has effectively talen the spirit of M.U.L.E. and brought it back, shaken it up and presented us with a entirely new set of concepts to learn and re-learn.The game plays out over a martian map, randomly generated from various landscapes made up of craters, dried riverbeds and valleys that do a fairly solid impression of conveying the martian scene, as well as various terrain that can be covered in ice, certain areas will be marked with resource node icons indicating they are of potential exploitative value for various minerals.  Arranged on a hex grid, you'll immediately be put in mind of old strategy games, but the comparison ends there. There are no units to control, at all. You only build things.A non combat 4X, is this even possible? Say whaaaaaaaaaat?Yes. I'll repeat that. You only build things. In this game, your structures are your units in effect. Your mines, your colony buildings, and your economy represents your ""arsenal"" and ""weaponry"". This makes for a frenetic early game as everyone jumps into the map blind, all arriving at the starport with nary but a blank map and the ability to scan in a limited range and for a limited number of times (these recharge over time, but you're effectively capped to a number of 'hops'), you'll see tantalising highlights on the horizon suggesting possible mineral nodes, but you won't KNOW what they are unless you scan right over them. This presents the first risk/reward mechanic, because the very early stages are a gold rush, do you take your time and map out the area, performing a thorough survey and pick the best spot (and risk losing it by accident to a lucky colonist) or do you jump at the first spot that ""looks good"" and risk sacrificing a better opportunity later on?During the early game, you'll be moving fairly quickly to make the optimal use of your initial claims, working out the best places to put down mines, whether you're best off setting up colony infrastructure or buying in the resources you need whilst you export minerals, again, these are all choices you have to balance, and the economics are very fluid. The game operates an exceptionally liquid supply and demand based market that fluctuates very quickly based on what is sold and what is required by the people off planet, so taking advantage of peaks in the market, and stocking up when there's a glut can make for excellent trading strategies on top of the usual manufacturing gigs.As the game progresses you'll be offered auctions on patents, black market goods, pirates will offer their services, and the game settles into a reasonable pace, it's not too brisk that you'll be panicking over keypresses, and you'll usually have more than enough time to plan your moves, but it's juuuust fast enough that you'll not start feeling bored or that there's a lull in the action. The pace even now feels just right, and the game even at this Early Access stage feels amazingly well refined. The AI is also brutal, which makes for some excellent and tense singleplayer matches (and if you're not careful, amazingly short ones, the AI knows when to strike and buy you out, with scary precision).The economy has a solid enough set of gears that you can work through as you expand, moving up through basic goods at first, and then you can decide to diversify, thus preventing your company from becoming exposed to the fluctuations or even possible manipulations of the market, or you can specialise in luxury goods, with the aim of striking it rich when demand is at it's highest. If, and it's a big if, you do this well, the rewards are huge, and in an RTS, would be the equivalent of nuking the base, here you win with money. Earn more than your opponent, buy them out and crush them.This is where the true nature of the game comes to the fore, as a lesson in future capitalism, it's bold, and even at times cruel, but perhaps a very good mirror to hold up and show what can happen if the only guiding force is the market, as a game, this makes it a brilliant and unique concept, and as an Early Access product, well, it's far from ""Early"" in my eyes. This game feels very much close to completion, they're more talking about fleshing out the multiplayer, getting the pacing and balancing just right and layering on the polish (this game needs polish?!?! WHERE?). Truth be told, it feels very polished as it is, there's a few graphical glitches but these are -minor-.Yes, the cost of entry is high, but for once, this is a game that actually justifies the entry fee.Closing thoughtsThis is a rare case where Early Access actually is a literal application of the term, you're paying to get Early Access to the almost complete product, and to provide feedback that helps shape it before it goes to the final version. Balancing, tweaking, and providing strategic insight to the developers, who have been listening and responding, and watching in kind. It's a very good example of how Early Access in a ""shortform"" approach should work (there's plenty of longer form SEA games that have done well such as Prison Architect, but that's a seperate discussion). As a result I really have little hesitation putting the paws up for this one, it's a genuinely brilliant game and it brings something different to the table, which it should be commended for.Current verdict : Highly recommended, and ignore the Early Access sticker, there's nothing Early about this game, it's very much in an end-to-end playable state "

												Really fun game, I was surprised because when I read other reviews I wasn't so sure I would like it. They somehow made a game about stocks, fun! Well, it gets more in-depth than that.. but that was my biggest worry! They have an awesome in-game tutorial system that pretty much walks you through everything (meaning you don't need to google a bunch of stuff for answers). I thought I had a good understanding how corporations worked before but now I REALLY do! (bonus for learning about debt!)  Also, it has lots funny jokes hidden in the game which is a cool bonus! The later practice scenarios are crazy challenging. If you're anything like me and like a challenge that you have to replay over and over again to beat, you will love this part!! (Don't worry, you aren't forced to do them if you don't like that sort of thing!)I think if you were even remotely worried about it being about corporations and stocks, don't let it deter you. This is surprisingly fun, challenging and you will enjoy it more than you think you will! Make sure you are in the mindset to learn stuff, and have fun! I know I have been. :)			"

Early Access Review
								This game needs a lot of work to make it enjoyable. The Black Market items just make the game stressful as, if you're the highest ranked player for the mission, you will inevitably be targeted repeatedly by the other three AI players, making it nearly impossible to manage your resources. Even if you are doing really well and own all the stock in your own company in a skirmish, another player can still somehow buy stock in your company that shouldn't even be for sale and win the game. The claim system is completely hampering the ability to play the game as it is portrayed in the videos. There's just too small of a map and too limited of resources to enjoy the act of building up a company or colony. The missions are over so quickly I feel no satisfaction even if I win.Yes, most RTS's are military games, but there is an econmic angle to them as well. The strongest economies are usually the winners. This game substitutes the lack of tanks and turrets for Black Market items that blow up buildings, temporarily disable them or capture them for other players. THIS IS NO DIFFERENT. There is no difference between this game and a military RTS except that this game is not fun, not realistic in the aspects of building up a company or the ability to focus on a single resource chain / manufacturing process, and it is over so quickly it leaves you wondering why you just spent 30-45 minutes playing a ""week"" mission in a compaign that makes you start all over again the next week with some ""upgraded"" capabilities.I spent one skirmish (because I wanted to play with all available buildings) only to find that by the time that I could start launching items into space for selling offworld (the best way to make money in the game by far) that the other computer player had already bought out the other two companies (which I had bought stock in, but could no longer as they were now 'subsidiaries' of the main company) and proceeded to blow up my only launchpad (because, again, limited building claims) with the black market dynomite option even though it was protected with the Goon Squad (the only defensive measure in the game that you have to continually and immediately purchase after each attack [which is an extremely ridiculous option considering the computer can repeatedly attack you faster than you can click to purchase and place your defense against this).Maybe I haven't given this game enough time to understand it completely, but, as an experienced gamer of RTS's. I found this game difficult to understand, unintuitive in controls and concepts, not fun (for previously mentioned reasons), and regretted buying it immediately.Hopefully this game has a major overhaul by the time it goes into full version, but I will not be playing it again and hope that I get my refund.

								I recommend this game, with a grain of salt!  This is not a game for everyone and the price point isn't for everyone, either.The description reads that the game is complete and only looking to do polish and balancing.  In my eyes, the game is not complete, and shouldn't be deemed complete.  For $40 CAD, Offworld Trading Company will make your chequebook scream.  The sheer lack of content in this game at present doesn't make this feel like a $40 game; however, this may be the ""spoiled adult"" in me talking - It cost more to buy M.U.L.E. for the C64 back in the day, and it has far less.For starters, everyone fights for the same resources, to produce the same few marketable goods.  This is, of course, the entire premise of the game, but I don't feel it's done correctly.  The game really boils down to ""Who clicks faster.""  You have the same relative strategy among all the other players, no matter the race you play: Build necessary starting materials to upgrade your HQ, buy materials that are dirt cheap and sell materials that are pricey.  The lack of materials and race specializations may be the downfall here, because once you fall behind the competition, winning becomes unattainable.  Since everyone is fighting for the same resources, whoever dominated the market first, wins; you may as well just resign.You are given dirty underhanded tricks to try and slow down the competition, with ever increasing cost as they are used.  That, in itself, is another problem.  The profiteer gets to use these features to their hearts content - they're making the money, after all.  As they use these features against you to continue pushing themselves ahead, the underhanded tricks end up costing more - something you obviously cannot afford - putting the balance in the hands of the first place position.You may be wondering, ""Wow, he's whining a lot about losing a game!"" and no, I've won my fair share, both against the A.I. and humans; I write this from both perspectives.  If you get ahead of someone, you literally can continue to open the gap between yourself and second place, just because I landed on that Iron first.  I truly did not find the game enjoyable when I was trouncing my competition; it was far more fun when we were on equal footing, needing to make quick decisions to outwit each other.I still give this game a positive recommendation.  After all is said and done, I very much enjoyed myself playing Offworld Trading Company in its current state.  I cannot say I will ever play it again though, which is why the $40 price tag seems extremely steep.  This is one of those games that you will love to play a lot and never play again.  As much as I would love to launch it in future, after having figured out ""how to win,"" the game has lost all flavour due to its extreme lack of content.Should the developers revisit the economy and add an abundance more resources, giving all players a chance to compete, then I feel this would be an exceptional real-time strategy game.  Until then however, this is a game of it's own genre: Real-time clicking competition.			"

												There is a really strong caveat in recommending this, which is that the tags on the store page are extremely deceptive.  This is not an economic game, this is not a simulation game, this is not a trading game, and this is not a base building game.  This is a very fast paced, micro-intensive RTS.Its an interesting take on the RTS genre, because you don't have any units to control.  But make no mistake, this game plays very similarly to one of the micro practice maps for SC2, and uses essentially the same skillset.  Its just that instead of microing units around a map, you're constantly scanning the map, spamming abilities, and hitting the buy/sell button.  I know it may sound like this is fundamentally different from microing units around, but in practice its not.   If you're someone who likes the micro game in SC2, you'll like this game.  If you're a more casual RTS player then this probably isn't the game for you.  There's nothing wrong with that, and the game itself is quite well done, but the game is definitely targetted towards a relatively small niche and the store page/reviews in no way reflect that.			"

Early Access Review
								As many other reviewers of this game have stated, the price point of this game is simply way too high for what you get, especially considering the game is in early access and I expect them to only raise the price from here. I don't shy away from early access games and I've had more than a few that never really progressed as I hoped/expected, but most I feel I at least get my money's worth out of them, but at $35, this is one of the few I definitely regret picking up.It's not really a bad game and it is an interesting concept, but the sacrifices the developers have made to make matches fit into 20-30 minutes have made the gameplay chaotic and often times inconsistent... not things that are typically appreciated in an economic game, competitive real-time or not. It also lacks any decent mechanisms to defend yourself from sabatoge or simply being bought out once the bulk cash transactions start coming in in the late game, so winning or losing a match can be both frustrating and unsatisfying. You can carefully manuever yourself into an advantageous position to corner a market on a resource or disrupt an opponent's supply chain but then you get 75k from one offworld shipment of a base resource like oxygen, dump all your resources on the market, and hit a + button a couple times and win without any of it mattering.The game definitely lacks depth and each match usually hinges completely on the base materials like glass or power. Regardless of which resources are the focus on any given match, the gameplay is mostly the same every time. It can be fun and it does have potential if the developers are open to some design changes, but it is simply not worth $35 or more right now and I seriously doubt it ever will be.I would love to be wrong and see great things happen for this game as development continues, but right now, I can not recomment it.

								This is a great economic game. The goal is to buy out your opponents by gaining resources and selling them at the highest values you can get. You can do it like a goodly market competitor or you can relish in the lamentations of your enemies by crushing them with some dirty tactics. Oh you took over that resource I wanted? That's okay, I'm just going to nuke it. Oh you're going to sell water til price plummets? Well I'm going to hack the market and triple the value! Now I see why EA likes being EA so much... screwing competitors and customers is just so much fun.

												One of my favorite games of all time.  The game has the best macro aspects of turn-based games like Civilization, with the speed of an RTS and some great personality to it.I'd strongly recommend for anyone who mainly likes the macro aspect of RTS games or likes 4X games like Civilization, but is looking for something more fast paced.I wouldn't recommend for someone who wants combat or who doesn't like games in this genre.

												I have been playing Offworld Trading Company since release in March and have found it to be an excellent game.  The game is easy to learn and play but has a depth that belies it simplicity.  There are 4 HQ types with different traits and advantages, they provide a wide variety of strategies to win the game.  Offworld Trading is best described as an Economic RTS, as you upgrade your HQ you receive more claims to mine resources or refine them via factories/plants, sell your products into the market to gain cold hard cash.  Use your cash buy shares in completing companies eventually taking them over and reigning supreme as the only corporation left standing.  There is no combat system as such, no need to furiously click your way to victory, however there is a Black Market function where you can buy various items to either slow you opponents down, like an EMP to freeze his/her factories for a short time or mutiny their power plant glassworks, taking those tasty profits for yourself.  Other items will give you a boost, increasing your production or a goon squad to catch those stinking saboteurs.  The game is very well balanced and there are many ways to squeeze the most profit out of your tiles.   I play multiplayer exclusively because it's so much fun, the AI is excellent and well programmed, but playing against 6 other people is miles better, this game really shines when you have a good group of human players.  Typical game lasts 20 -40mins which is the perfect length for me.ProsSimple to play and very rewarding for the casual player, but plenty of depth for more serious gamers   Very well polished, stable and balanced for an Early Access game, imo it could be released tomorrow at full price.Gameplay is intense and very fun but not frantic like other RTS games.Devs are very active in the community and actually listen to feedback.ConsDifficult to find higher level players to play with if you live in Europe (unless you want to stay up till 2am)If you like RTS games then this is a must buy, I am very happy with my purchase, great re playability, really shines in multiplayer.  10/10			"

								Offworld Trading Company really stands out in the real-time strategy genre primarily because it focuses on resource management, market supply and demand, sabotage, and trading instead of the micromanagement of units.  Despite being in early access already offers a very fun (and stable) experience.  I can't wait to see what the finished product is like.  Highly recommended as is.

												I bought this on the recent sale, and it is easily worth the full price for any strategy game lover. Where to start? I feel like I have to explain first, and foremost, what this game actually brings to the table. I am a lover of RTS and the turn-based strategy staples. I am also a lover of MOBA type multiplayer. I think it is important to note that the single player and multiplayer are almost two different games. They follow the same mechanics, but the single player feels almost like a career-mode where matches are linked together and unlocking perks for your chosen CEO along the way, while the multiplayer brings the most intense purely competitive gameplay that I have seen in years. Even in the games where I get trounced I am left feeling like I have more grasp on the game than before, and know this is a benefit for future games.The reason this game is amazing to me is that there isn't a ""meta"" strategy to just win. This game requires a fluid strategy with the goal being to acquire competing companies by buying a majority stake. The goal is to develop supply chains that produce goods from basic to higher tier products made out of those base resources. One players actions in the first minute may require a fundamental shift in the strategy of another. This is way more than the generic paper-rock-scissors we see in a lot of strategy games, or simply any competitive game.This brings us to the learning curve. If you have played a strategy game before 2000 then the tutorial is amazingly informative. For those new to the RTS genre (I see this game mostly as such), it will feel unfair to lose repeatedly at first. These losses are the growing process of grasping the mechanics. As you start you will realize you have been handed a toolbox with a dozen tools, and winning only comes when you know the time and place to use each tool. You will lose suddenly and realize that you simply forgot about one aspect, but the oversight is just one more learning opportunity. Players that go into a situation saying I want to always use this specific company faction or believe they have an infallible one-size-fits-all strategy will lose, and quickly at that.I have seen reviews where the reviewers say that the game is about speed and not strategy. The speed simply comes with playing and understanding the resources needed for expansion. Again for RTS players think of the first time you grasped how to expand bases quickly to reach end game in the likes of Warcraft, C&C, AoE. Once you know how to upgrade quickly then it is time for strategy to kick in. The tutorial games are difficult at first, but only because the learning curve of these levels want you to graduate with the knowledge of the mechanics before letting you loose.  The multiplayer wait times can be on the long side for FFA(4-player) matches, but the game allows you to do the 'Daily Challenge' scenario or a skirmish against the AI while you wait. That game will be autosaved before entering the multiplayer match. 1v1 matches have much shorter wait times. I think 1v1 is easier (may be different for each person), but FFA is where the real fun lies.If you like single player more than Patron DLC is a must (adds aspects to campaign mode), and I think the Ceres DLC is definitely worth it as well (adds new resources, new power supply, new map type).TL;DR:Anyone that wants to be in control of their own game strategy on the fly in quick, highly competitive matches with RTS elements must own this game. A lot of gamers lately want their hand held by a cut-and-paste guide that will ensure they win a high amount of the time. Thankfully this is not that game, this game requires one to like facing challenges.Edit: I'm now over 115 hours in, and this review was from about 15 hours in. I had only seen the tip of the iceburg. This game continues to amaze and I am still learning more with every game 100 hours later.			"

								It's a decent game, but the price is a bit high for what you get. They definitely have a lot of work to do before the game releases. I wouldn't term this is an economy game. This is an attack your opponent RTS, but the attacks are different than your standard RTS. I was expecting a laid back economic builder in the sim city fashion that was a real-time game. This is more of a fast paced eliminate your opponent game like your regular combat RTS.Playing on the easiest difficulty and the game on slow speed I feel rushed. If I do not start buying out my opponents quickly they will buy me out. My games typically last 30 minutes to an hour because the AI pushes the game so fast. If I go any slower I will lose.I find it difficult to beat the computer. I feel like I have to use exploits to even have a chance. The way I am able to beat the computer is to find the least populated resource and build my base on it to reduce the amount even more. Then I claim all that I can of the remaining. This slows the computer down a little bit and will allow me to prolong the game. I have never played on anything except the lowest difficulty because of how challenging it is.If you are looking for a casual economic game then this is probably not what you are looking for. If you are looking for a fast paced RTS that the first 5 minutes of game play can make or break you then this might be it for you. There are a lot of much better RTS' out there. As an economic builder I don't think this games is going to appeal to the type of casual player that would be interested in economic builders.Game stability? The game has crashed on me about 5 times while I was playing tonight over the course of about 5 hours.This game is supposedly in Alpha. If it is truly in alpha then they are still planning to add more content to the game. If they are just fine tuning, bug testing, and performance optimizing then this is not in alpha. If it's alpha then I look forward to the complete game. If this is beta then I'm disappointed.If you have $40 to spare and would like something to do for a day or two then I would pick this up. If you have high expectations for this purchase then I would suggest waiting to buy.			"

Early Access Review
Short version:Interesting premise but lacking in execution. As of yet the game is very short in content. One can spend roughly 3 hours in it before one has seen everything and a feeling of ""this needs more time in development"" settles in. The only reason I personally spent more time on this was from coming back for matches between patches to see what they added (and it wasn't much, mostly balance adjustments and bug fixes). The developers consider the game ""feature complete"" and in doing so crush any hope of new game mechanics to broaden gameplay.Would rate the experience 4 out of 10, in particularly in hindsight of the the high price for the small game one gets in return.Long version:Offworld Trading Company has the complexity of a typical smartphone or board game with a tedious buy/sell minigame in the form of juggling various goods around. Player influence on total econonmy or pricing is negligible - you can not corner a market or establish a strategic monopoly as it's always possible to buy resources from the market, even if nobody supplies them. A single match is roughly 30 minutes in duration but can take up to 40 in rare cases. Gameplay is heavily streamlined to remain within tight confines.To illustrate a few mechanics:Upon starting a match one has to scan the map to uncover its limited resource fields, quickly slam down a base building and then build extractors on resource deposits. Automated NPC ships haul the harvested resource back to the HQ once the extractor building is full. Those units can not be interacted with directly (except for a very rare piracy action card one can win in a random auction to steal enemy supplies for a short duration) and merely exist as a visual way to see when the next resource-""tick"" happens. They are the only units on the map, everything else is just buildings.There is a limit over how many tiles of the map you can build on as building on a tile consumes ""claims"" - you start with a handfull of those and only get a handful more for upgrading your HQ, which in return only has 4 steps and stops at level 5. A few screenshots on the Store page show how small the fully upgraded ""base"" will get. As buildings give an output adjaciency bonus one just builds a cluster of similar buildings and spreads out the other clusters of different types to avoid getting targeted by expensive sabotage actions players can buy (with a cooldown), such as EMP strikes.The match itself is won by buying out the competition. This starts by acquiring ""shares"" of the enemy company - the total amount of shares each company has can be adjusted with difficulty settings but is typically 10. The more shares one owns the cheaper will be the final takeover - that option simply becomes unlocked once all shares have been bought by someone (no matter if a company bought its own shares or someone else did) - there is no way to prevent takeover, even if the company is doing well financially, as long as the enemy has enough cash on hand to buy one out. This means one could lose if an enemy simply stops spending cash very early to rush a buyout while one would rather upgrade and then have the stronger income/economy to win in the long run. This sounds more complex than it is but at its core feels unrefined and gets boring rather quickly.In technical regards the game is very simple and seems to be made in the Unity Engine 4 - as such it only supports single threading, has greatly limited scale of maps and environments, medicore visual fidelity and tacked-on UI. At this stage the UI seems extremely clunky - I'd have hoped it's a placeholder but as they are adjusting and updating it while adding new buttons I somehow get the feeling they'll keep it this way.The current voice files are text-to-speech placeholders with awkward pronounciation but are the most memorable feature of the game - sentences like ""Just look at all the money."" from a creepy robot voice are simply hilarious.All in all it feels like the designers behind this project had a nifity idea but no great vision with merely a few simple game systems in spirit of a board game in their heads - the blanks have been filled with convoluted mechanics. I do not believe the developers will give it a complete overhaul between now and release and as such can not recommend a purchase.			"

GenreIts not often I come across a game which is a totally new genre but I think Offworld fits the bill.Offworld is a strange hybrid of 4X and RTS but without the combat, however that description alone does not come close.MatchesMatches are generally short (30 min) and start off with a similar feel to 4X games, you explore expand and start to exploit the landscape, but you need keep moving, resting on your laurels will get you left behind by the AI, time is the unlisted resource in this game.Each game is a struggle for economic dominance with the winner buying out the shares of the opposing companies, now this may sound a little dry, but the fun comes with how you achieve this.  There are many ways of getting the upper hand in Offworld, with strategies ranging from predicting trends, to dominating resources, outpacing others with research and new techs, managing your debt, or using a miriad of black market options.Early access The technical quality of this game is very good, it works better than some ""finished"" games, no crashes, everything works smoothly and looks great.Content wise I may like a few more victory conditions or changes to the current ones, other than that just needs some more tooltips and tutorials.CampaignThe campaign mode offers a small meta game involving highering engineers and expanding colonies, it also has some new victory conditions, and can been played with a variety of different colony ""managers"".ConsMatches end too abruptly for my likeing, and I usually find it disapionting when they do... but this hasn't stopped diving right back in to new matches to try out new strategies.A few tweaks to the victory mechanics should help a lot here, maybe adding multiple victory conditions, and or making current ones more obvious and exciting.My ReviewI've not completed the campiagn or tried multiplayer yet, so I'll update things when I do.This is a different type of RTS, centred around economy rather than battles, but still very satisfying, forethought and timing are a must, a very enjoyable game.

												I waited for the summer sale to buy this since it looked interesting, but not $40 interesting.  Oh how wrong I was.  The campaign mode has significant replayability, since you can change up who you play as and the difficulty levels and what not.Yoshimi and New Meridians seem to be the easiest factions to play as for a new player, since it is easy to exploit their strengths.  But the other factions also have their advantages, and understanding that strategy keeps me coming back to this game when I can.The graphics are really nice, the music and sound effects are gentle and pair nicely with the game, and the interface is pretty intuitive once you know your way around.  The tutorial missions are great and get you up and running with the game quickly; they are some of the best tutorials I have seen in a RTS/4x game.  It also helps that the developers added a lot of amusing commentary in the tutorials to keep the player engaged.Overall I say that the replay value and lack of bugs make $40 completely worth it.Make Mars great again!

								To sum it up...-Not worth 40 dollars-Interface is lackluster at this point: No mini-map, too much clicking, no hot keysAs a result, the Black Market is more difficult to utilize-Supply/Demand of basic resources can be fun, but it needs work-LAG is absolutely terrible 80% of the time. The delay, especially early game, is a huge disadvantage. With all the bank they're making on this early access game, I hope they buy servers.I have faith in the development team, and I'm looking forward to future updates. If they are receptive to reviews like this and forum feedback, it will do great after just a few months I'm sure.			"

												OTC is an excellent game that is a lot deeper than first appears. There are some surprisingly varied strategies available. Playing different scenarios is a good way to experince some of the variety this game has to offer. I like that it plays quickly and you can complete a whole game in a reasonable length of time. It is a pretty unique experience in that it is real time, but it is not about military conflict, but rather economic conflict. There is also an impressive level of polish to this game from the graphic design to the well thought through interface. I'd highly recommend this to someone who is interested in strategy games.			"

												TL;DR - I like the game for attempting a different and solid approach to the stategy genre and I recommend it for the slower-paced buy highly chaotic nature of matches themselves, but it certainly isn't everybody's cup of tea so if you're not into those things, or expect the traditional RTS experience, give this game a pass.There's certainly a divide among the people who've tried this game, I think it stems from a clashing between a misunderstanding of the game's main concept, the expectations from watching a couple of gameplay videos and playing the game itself, which is understandable because this isn't a game that's easily put in a few words.It seems that people are now associating RTS with APM and fast reflexes exclusively, which is another reason why this game is such a departure for most of the users who try it. Out of the gate, this game is nothing like the traditional RTS: you aren't microing units, you aren't building an army, you aren't going for the high APM, you aren't scouting bases or out-blobbing the opponent's blob army. Instead you are making decisions for the most part, decisions that impact the course of the game over time instead of immediately, leading to a slower paced game based around matches of wits and constantly monitoring a wide variety of indicators that are further influenced by the chaos theory that stems from the many other choices that other players are making during a match.This is a game that demands close observation of numbers and the things that affect those numbers so that you make informed decisions that lead to you out-witting the competition over matches that are certainly longer when compared to other multiplayer games, especially those that belong to more recent launches. It's also a game that assumes that you can properly learn its rules, which is why the training wheels come off sooner and there's huge rifts in the handholding in between difficulty settings. The computer doesn't cheat the higher you go (at least, if you don't go higher than manager which is the standard difficulty), it just reacts sooner and expects you to keep up the pace through, again, decisions based on proper vigilance of information and indicators.I admit to having a bias for this kind of game, since I really like strategy games, especially those driven by economic aspects and this one is certainly all about the incredibly unpredictable nature of economics and a caricaturization of the cutthroat corporate environment which all serves to keep me engaged and entertained, making for a good game in my book considering both the beautiful audiovisual design and the solid mechanics. At the same time, I find it easy to empathize with the people who get put off by this game, its rules are certainly different, it demands different things from the player, and matches themselves never tend to play out the same way twice, even on the exact same conditions because there's always something else that you, and the remaining players, can choose to do.I thoroughly recommend the game but only if you like slower paced games with lots of stuff happening at the same time, along with learning new things and experiencing a different kind of strategy games. If you aren't one for patience, expecting the standard fast-paced, high APM, insane reflexes gameplay, I suggest you go for something else.			"

Early Access Review
								So what should I write about this game. I know it is still in Early Access but it doesn't look like it will change much more until the final release. After all it appears pretty much finished so far.First of all, this game is fun. Actually I like the game style. It is reminds pretty much on playing Civ.The problem is, where Civ offers a very wide variety of gameplay elements (from war, over diplomacy, economy, religion etc.) this game only took the economic part of if.This unfortunately offers very little replay value. You basically start every game somewhere on the map, building all type of ""farms"" for resources and hope for the best.My biggest problem however is that the interaction with the other companies (e.g. players) is very limited and comes only to light when they are buying a spot of good resources you were looking after.So then, you end up in a skirmish of selling recources when you can in order to make money and buy the other company shares in order to win.This looks every game more or less the same because all the elements that made Civ so great are missing.The only interaction are a few ""illegal"" actions like sabotage you might do. But even this has limited effect (e.g. the opponent's mines are blocked for a minute). The game offers no diplomacy (not even on an economic way like making a syndicate, negotiation or trading agreements like I offer you electricity in order to get better offers for your steel producion) or corporate espionage (like stealing other players inventions). After all the game goes very quick (a game might take 30 - 90 minutes. So there is no grand strategy like investing in late-game infrastructure / units etc. Just a bit of research can be done which basically leads to improved production (e.g. instead of 10 electricity, the power plant offers 15).This leads after all to the strategy of building your own variety of buildings in order to be best prepared for changing prices (if you sell stuff, the price drops) so you might sell what ever looks best at the moment.To come to a conclusion, this game looks promising. I really like the style, it is easy to start with - no real need for many tutorials but even if you need some, it is done quickly. Still it lacks of gameplay.So for the time being, I can only reccomend the game for fans of economic realtime strategy gamers (even though there are no units to control).For people who are looking for another Civ-like game with grand strategy, long term multiplayer sessions with different victory conditions, this game is unfortunately not what you are looking for.

Granted it's 66% off, and probably not worth the normal $45, this game does however bring scarcity to boredom.It's interesting to see Stardock reach out to more than just Galactic Civilization, yet another economy game they made.One of the biggest issues for me coming from GalCiv was, ""how are players going to take turns"". I knew it wasn't 4X like GalCiv or Civilizations IV or V, but placement of your base or settlement is very important. How do you prevent players from going into a scramble to be the first one to put something down?

There's a very good solution put in place. A ticker for Debt, sock price, and Bond rating. The quicker you are to place, the more debt and thus lower stock price and higher bond rating you will have.What if I keep waiting and waiting? While I haven't seen starting debt go any higher than +$1,100, you can be paid for base placement (note the plus sign). That assumes there is more than 1 player waiting.You can also get additional claim points if you are the last player to place. The whole game is built around tile claims, so these additional claims can outweigh a better starting position.Tricky thing is, as you play the game, you will find that you will just have to play all of the 4 different corporations. Some have different building materials from others, some have certain bonuses, some don't need certain resources to survive.If you find yourself in a bad position, with a gloomy future, you can even the playing field with auctions and the black market.

While it can be silly to pay $56,000 for a land claim not even 5 minutes into the game, other things do come up such as underground nukes, computer viruses, or even diet pills that somehow make your workers faster. It's capitalism, self interest is the center focus of the game.While this game doesn't look graphically intensive, it does however require a graphics card and operating system that can run DirectX 11. Windows 7 with some recent GT/GTX 700 or higher series graphics card would make a good choice if you need to upgrade.One of the issues people seem to be running into is that they play games in english, but they set their operating system in some other language. They discover that the game uses their native language instead of english. This is fixed by simply going into the settings menu, and selecting your desired language. The game uses the OS language by default.I don't normally make a point of this – but I should probably make a note of it somewhere – there are several options for those colour blind. That's correct, the game has options built in to adjust colours to make them more ""readable"" for those who suffer from it. I can't really remember the last time I saw this in a game.While I've only played the daily challenges, learn to play series, and 4-player free for all, I haven't really seen the ""COOP"" aspect of the game yet.Another point I should bring up is that I don't think I will be getting 100's of hours out of this game. The content is lacking, even with DLC.The game UI/HUD might be large, I feel that way, but you do get used to it.			"

												Economy based, fast paced, multiplayer race with a lot of ways to make your friends/family and others rage like only monopoly has done before. Quick to learn, hard to master. The games are quick and hectic and require focus and intelligence to understand the mechanics of the game and to think ahead of your opponents. This is a battle of wits and focus. Younger people that have neather wont like this game. If you are up for a challgenge, I recommend it. Personaly I think the price is too high for what you get and I hope they will add more to it (factions,planets,buildings). There is an option to hide everyones name in the game, so people cant gang up on one another (my god this is fun).			"

												I've always thought that one of the problems with modern games is that they are a bit too obvious in thier attempt to make you feel good by - in essence - letting you win which is why the demanding difficulty of Offworld Trading Company is so very enjoyable.As I pass the twenty five hour mark on Offworld I'm also playing The Witcher 3 which allows me to perform some very heroic slashes that seem far beyond the mashing of left mouse I am doing.  It is very pretty but it seems to remove me from the mix.  The Witcher 3 is great but sometimes I feel like I'm a distraction to it, rather than the other way around.Offworld Trading Company is the opposite.  Go disengaged in a minute of playing Offworld and you lose.  Make bad decision in Offworld and you lose.  Play well but not as well as someone else (including the impressive AI) and you lose.  Every defeat one can imagine a cause for an consider how to fix it.  The moment I realised that not mining a resource because it could be bought dirty cheap was a viable strategy was a revelation made better because it was not hinted at, or revealed in a tutorial, or given to me in any way other than through experience.The result is a game where one feels an authorship over victory (or defeat) that creates a more compelling narrative than many a game that sell themselves on their narratives.  An irony of sorts there.			"

												Okay; but, not worth the £22 (25% off) I spent on it. Played for 11 hours before I completed it. Of which I would say 4 - 5 hours where learning to play (and the tutorials are great); but, then the main story I lost once, and then completed it the second time within 3 hours - I am going to update the difficulty from the default one that it sets as it does have replay value; but, the story is so short I wish I had spent the money on another game that would have had a better long term campaign length - even just double of the current campaign would have been enough.Such as complete the current campaign with say 2 of the 4 races, then you go to another area of mars with the other 2 fraction in with a greater intensitiy and repeat with those 2 races.Would I have brought the game again knowing what I know now - if it was around £15 I would have.Will I try to retrun it - probably not as it does have some replay value, and I did enjoy it.Will I be cautious about spending £22 with this company again - yes.Overal very good concept, just really, really short for the price tag in my opinion.

AbstractOffworld Trading Company (OTC) is a very capitalist and economically oriented game. The game itself is not a one big giant campaign, but a competitive match between various companies vieing for the business of blossoming offworld colonies on Mars. Your goal, buy out your competitors.GameplayOTC has very interesting gameplay, not just in the respect that hey, you're makin' money, but that you are actively participating in the offworld markets. These offworld markets being Earth's satellites like asteroid colonies and Mars colonies. You must set down your company's HQ in a spot close to useful resources, and even those will change based on what company you are playing as. Robots don't require life support, but humans obviously do.In the world of competitive marketing, you must produce and maintain enough resources to play the economy. Various resources will become highly demanded for, you in turn must produce more of these in order to satisfy that market. But be careful. Don't produce resources that no one needs.On top of selling these resources, you must produce some for your own good. Upgrades and new buildings require resources as well. Expanding can't be done without it. Mine silicone, carbon, pump water, electrolize hydrogen and air, and the list goes on.Gameplay of OTC can change based on who you are playing as. Previously I noted life support, robotic companies don't require and humans do, well, if you're a robot, save operating costs and don't build electrolizers. Other companies can build things differently than others. New Meridians are very science based people and have developed technology that can manufacture resources directly on top of a resource deposit versus having a mine yank it out and send it to the HQ.Overall, the game whether on a public stage or offline with the AI can be very competitive.MechanicsThere are multiple systems in OTC. The most important one being the resource market. Selling resources like O2 and Food usually turn a large profit for manufacturing companies. But also, there is debt. Should you worry about it? In my experience, not exactly, as when you start makin' the offworld shipments you can make so much profit that the debt will literally eviscerate.The black market is also very important. Corporations may seem very up tight and concerned about making a profit and caring for their customers, but when it comes down to corporation versus corporation, dirty deeds will be done. EMPs and electrical storms can take out production rates, goon squads will protect your stuff from thieving corporations, and worker strikes can turn manufacturing plants to your favor. But be careful, you aren't the only one that can use the black market.Shares. The game winner. Without shares, you don't win...well, you don't lose either but more importantly you don't win. Shares in your own company will protect you, along with how much one of your shares is worth. invest in your company and increase production and your worth will rise. Buy competitor shares and keep them on their toes. Then, once you buy enough shares, buy out the company, buy out the company and you have one less competitor.ScoreGraphics: 8/10 - Not the greatest in the world and some things will clip if you look at them real hard, but this is easily looked over.Gameplay: 9/10 - Makes me want to play more all the time. It's the reason I played for 2 extra hours when I first bought it.Mechanics: 9/10 - Makes this game what it is. Very well thought through and makes for very interesting gameplay at times.Online Play: 7/10 - Takes a hot minute to find a match but when you do, all the more fun!Overall: 8.9/10Very well designed game, and leave it to a previous Sid Meier's developer to do it! I do recommend this game, but make sure you have the time to finish a match if you go online. "

												Offworld Trading Company is a new genre of game, which is a blend of several styles into its own new style. A fine balance bringing to the table an awesome game.On some sides, it reminds me of the old RTS Monopoly Tycoon, with the multiplayer capitalism management on one hand and the real time business sim on the other hand. (The auction system is by the way fantastic !) While at the same time, the game is grand by its simplicity of the resources manegement and strategy planning, maybe similar to Settlers with the logistics supply chain of raw materials up to the final produces.This game can enter into the History of Gaming, that it is at the same time a smart game, with in depth game anaylyzis without having dozens of parameters, just a few interesting resources with different rules and needs which intricately are depending on each other in a beautiful supply and demand concept. And at the same time, it is a game fun to play, where you don't have to learn dozens of recipes, where you quickly have fun (a few tutorials teach you the basic ropes of the game, same as chess, the game can be learnt in a very short time, but it can require a long time to master :)!). Lots of events occur in game, which can change the whole course of a development, pirates intercepting your cargos, mutiny of your geothermal powerplant at the very wrong time... well you get the picture hehe !You might be thinking that this game sounds like a very long game to play, spending hours of planification, development and implementation ... such as a Heart of Iron, Total War or a Civ game for instance ... well not at all, the games lasts hardly more than 30 minutes ! And this is in the case you are not losing after a few minutes!All in all, this game, is, I believe, refreshing with its new genre, smart with its simple but challenging puzzles mechanics for the colonization of Mars, all this while having a good fun when utilizing the resources of the planet.The question is ... will you challenge yourself ... go play this legendary Offworld Trading company ?

Early Access Review
								Offworld Trading Company , although still in early access, does a great job of defining stages to the flow of a match. Why do I mention this first? Because the best RTSs I've played have loosely defined stages that allow for depth of strategy at each step. Available funds  are precious early in a match and there are several outlets to utilize these funds. You can upgrade early to try and get a lead in resource gathering, you can use the black market to shut down your opponent's income, or you can manipulate the market to make it more costly for other players to catch up to you. As the game progresses, the options available to you also expand, and strategies abound.The mid-game in Offworld Trading Company is where the most important blows start being traded. In order to ensure your company is not bought, you must purchase and hold onto at least 5 of your own stock (which then have to be bought out all at the same time in order for another player to remove you from the game); however, the money available to you to buy your own stock could also be used to take out another player by beating them to 6 of their stock. This makes decisions on who to buy stock in, whether to purchase your own stock, or whether to continue to upgrade to get a lead in the late game potentially deadly. If the wrong choice is made, other players will take advantage of your mistakes.Late game, if the game hasn't already been decided by the mid-game brawl, comes down to endurance. Each remaining player's goal is to get enough money to buy out the others before being bought themselves. There are several advanced buildings in Offworld Trading Company that allow for varying strategies to accomplish this task and, depending on the state of the market, each strategy has a place and can allow for you to outspend your opponents.An economic RTS is a fairly unexplored idea, so be prepared to endure a fairly high learning curve before becoming competent in the gameplay. I'm sure most of what I've mentioned in the paragraphs above means very little to someone who hasn't played Offworld Trading Company , but the point is to show the depth of gameplay Offworld Trading Company allows for.So, let's break this game into its parts:Content: 5/10Multiplayer is where this game shines. There is a campaign mode, but it is currently very limited.Animations: 9/10There is little animation in the game, but what has been done is done well.Graphics/Artwork/Illustrations: 9/10Once again, there are few graphical elements required for this style of game, but the graphics are this gen. and well done.Gameplay: 10/10Loads of depth to multiplayer games, and a good pacing built in to the gameplay.Controls:10/10I would only give less than a 10 in this category if there was no ability to change hotkeys or the controls were unresponsive/glitchy. Although I do not like the layout of the default hotkeys, I don't consider that a reason to downgrade this category.Reliability: 8/10The game is still early access and some bugs are being worked out. There are some issues with making lobbies and changing hosts mid-game that are being worked out, as well as a few smaller glitches.User Interface (UI): 9/10Very well put together to give an overview of how the game is progressing as well as easy access to your options. I took away a point because I think that the notification system could use some work when you are targeted by the black market or a shortage/surplus occurs.Music and Sounds: 10/10Some sounds are still being created, but the recently added new music and the completed sounds are very well done.Originality: 10/10I can only imagine how difficult it must be to enter a new sub-genre into the books. Soren Johnson and his team have done a great job in developing this original idea.Community Vibe: 10/10The developers listen closely to player feedback and are very active on the forums. The game is updated on a regular basis and has improved with each iteration.Total Score: 90/100If you're a fan of RTSs or enjoy market manipulation, I can highly recommend this game to you. If you enjoy a challenge, Offworld Trading Company will provide it to you. This is a Game You Absolutely Must Have :) .Although there is plenty of room for casual players in this game, with its current player base of dedicated fans, I'd recommend people who put themselves in this category to watch some videos of the game before deciding to purchase.Here is a video of some higher level gameplay with good commentary:

												If you were hoping for M.U.L.E. or any other game about forming a business in the crucible of the wonder that is offworld colonization, then this is not that game.  However, if you like to win at games about number accumulation in real time, then you are in luck.  Offworld Trading Company is the epitome of real time number accumulation games!The gameplay is basically day trading as a manic depressive.  Place buildings to make some commodity related numbers go up and others go down over time.  Some tiles are worth more numbers than others, but you have a very limited number of claim numbers to place.  Perform acts of sabotage to lower your opponents' numbers, but be careful: it costs cash numbers!  Whenever you buy something, the cost number of that commodity goes up.  Whenever you sell something, the cost number goes down.  Can you consistantly sell the most commodity numbers when they have the highest value numbers?  Usually you have no idea who is shifting what numbers.  When you play this game, this is your life now.To win the game, you need to earn the biggest amount of numbers to buy your opponents' stocks so your numbers eat them in a ""hostile takeover.""  Lets say both you and your opponent have enough money to buy the other out: first click wins, because numbers!  Mercifully, games of Offworld Trading Company are usually over within a half-hour, but win or lose you will have literally nothing to show for it.  In a story-based game you may have heard a story.  In a building game, you might have built something cool.  In a 4X game, enough might have happened that you ended up building a story.  But there's nothing at all memorable about a match of Offworld Trading Company, just a sense of relief that the frantic shifting of numbers is over.I tried to salvage this by getting good at Offworld Trading Company, but now I don't think it's possible.  I tried playing Skirmish on ""manager"" difficulty (a level playing field) and the AI wins every time.  I tried prioritizing upgrading my base.   I tried prioritizing having the most of the highest value commodity.  I tried cornering the market via tackling a scarce resource.  None of this works, the AI first out-upgrades my base and then buys me out before I catch up.  Maybe the AI is programmed to know something about the game I don't, maybe a computer is just naturally better at shifting numbers than a human player, or maybe it just flat out cheats.  At this point, I honestly don't care anymore, I'm just sad.In summary, Offworld Trading Company is a saddening game that makes me hate numbers.			"

								Offworld trading company is a real time strategy game focussing on simulating economy and free market trade. This is not really a tycoon game because it's not about gradually building your business over time. Instead each game is a short (30 to 60 minute) race against your competitors to see who can buy out each other's companies first, by setting up an effective and efficient organisation.You do this by producing, buying and selling resources in such a way that ensures profits in the short and long term. Everything you do has a benefit and a cost, using resources but producing them at the same time. You need to ensure that you read and predict market trends so that you are producing the right goods at the right time. It's all about supply and demand. If electricity is scarce and you're not producing your own, you'll end up spending a fortune buying it. If the market is flooded with food you might as well buy it rather than waste land and resources to make it yourself. Likewise, if there is a fuel shortage and you are producing a lot of fuel, you can make a lot of money selling it at high prices.Don't let the simple (thought nice) graphics and animations fool you, there is a lot to this game. The depth and complexity makes it both fun and intelectually stimulating. The best part is that no two games are the same, and there are several strategies that you can successfully use to win. Also, what worked for you last time might not work for you in the next game. This is emergent gameplay at it's best.There isn't much to dislike about this game, as an economic simulation it is unique and well balanced. It will take you about an hour or two to really get into the game and to appreciate why it is so good. That said, for the average player the full price (40 USD) is definitely a bit steep. It is still early access though so it might be a different story once the full release is out.			"

Early Access Review
								Think of it as a sort of competitive SimCity.  You build your ""city"" over terrain that offers various resources with the goal of growing your access to valuable ones while also being able to afford the industry.  A nice big patch of Iron, just ripe for mining?  Do you have the water, power, and electricity that you'll need to run that mine?  Can you buy those needs with the profits from that mine?  Up to you to figure it out.  Throw in competitors who will attempt to get there first, or sabotage you if you get there first, and you have a challenging economic game.The interface and general gameplay information is simple enough to use (it is NOT a spreadsheet simulator at all!), very similar to the Civilization series, and you can get into the game very quickly.A couple of things on the downside, however.  There is very, very little explanation for what you'll need to do or why you need to do it.  The first few games had me box myself into a corner because there was no explanation covering what you'll need to start a basic successful colony/company.  I still don't know how to hire specialists (required in order to build certain buildings) because the game tells me I need them, but not how to get them.   It's also very difficult to visually see what your opponents are doing; there's a scrolling bar of text that gives you updates, but it's not particularly useful while you're trying to manage 100 other things just to stay afloat.I haven't tried multiplayer yet, so I cannot speak to that.Overall, definitely recommended if this is your cup of tea.

												This is an interesting economy tycoon game.  The first few games are tough but after a while you get the hang of it.   But, then after a while you see how basic the public stock ownership is, and the game starts to lose its sparkle.  Especially when you can lose the game so easily by it.  And, then you realize how unrealistic it is.  So, then you try to focus on building, and you start to realize the game is really kind of confining,  The maps are small even when you pick huge.  Then you find yourself competing for the same area with 4 or more competitors that in a very short time build up to the limits and try to take over you and each other.  That gets old quick because you want to build and develop Mars, not just fight in a little plot of land on it.  Finally, you say to yourself, well how is multiplayer.  If your lucky enough to find someone in the lobby and play, i imaging it could be fun.  I've been there 3 times and its been empty.  So, up front it looks fun and interesting, and it is for a while, but the replyabillity is limited.  I think it's overpriced for what you get.  Wait until it drops under $15.  Just my opinion.			"

												Seems like a lot people hated the game because they expected it to be like Civ. It is a shame for the game is actually an RTS, closer to Starcraft but with so much more diversity and depth. Unlike starcraft, the strategy is centered around grabbing ressources and messing up with your opponents using black market powers.The game is just always evolving, with 4 different factions who define your playstyle entirely. There are vastly different maps, pushing you to adapt to the new conditions and resources available every time. Finally, the black market adds another layer of complexity entirely as different powers are available every game. A game where you can uncover new ressources will be drastically different from one where you can claim more lands or one where you can steal ressources from each others.Finally, the developers are constantly updating the game with new add-ons that offer new sets of rules and challenges to adapt to.If you want a fun deep RTS with a max duration of 30 minutes, that will challenge you constantly to adapt and judge where the market will go, this is the game for you!

								- PROS -Elements of Stock MarketingElements of Production Mechanics (Supply/Demand) A realistic approach towards coperate financing.Interesting methods of victory. Basic elements of auctioning. Basic elements of share holding. - CONS - Lacking in content. These basic elements should be expanded upon. In game UI could use a rework. Or simply made easier to access certain things. (Buttons to be moved around, to avoid slow computers conflicting with other background interfaces.) Too Pricey for its lack of content. Lacking in a diplomancy system. (Coperates talk to each other/deal with each other.) Lack of freedom in terms of buying from other Companies. - Overall - Very simple, effective and efficient. The developers here have really impressed and hit the mark on this game. However for its Price I just have to disagree with it. Its too expensive for the amount of in game content thats offered. I played this game for about, 30 minutes and I achieved victory far too easily. Not because the game itself is easy, but because it really is just lacking in content. To spice things up and really make the game unique and different. Consider adding more events. Example: Earthquakes. Coperate diplomacy. ( The ability to deal and exchange with selective companies ) Add to the Debt system. Allow for Company to company investment (with return), or unknown shady investment with 5% - 10% or even 30% interest. Those are just some general, throw around ideas. Hope this helps.			"

								Absolutely loving the game. The well designed gameplay eases you in and really feels like a game you can learn very quickly but take an age to master. This video covers the first tutorial & my attempt at my first win: 


YouTube™ Video: Offworld Trading Company - Ep 1 - First TAKEOVER!! (Gameplay & Tutorial 1080p/60FPS) 

			Views: 42,374		

			Offworld Trading Company is a real-time strategy game in which money, not military force, is the player's weapon. Follow me as I explain the game during Tutorial 1 & then attempt my first takeover on...		

Particularly as you move up the levels & start to play online against human opponents rather than against the AI.The pace of the first tutorial is slower, which is needed to wrap your head around the basic game mechanics, but as soon as you start the second tutorial & try to win vs a competitor - the heat & pressure is on! I can only imagine the RTS stress playing against 3 or 4 actual players. Going to find this out now!I heartily recommend this game - great fun, very well designed and has me hooked already within 30 mins! Well done Mohawk & Soren :-)			"

												This is a great, innovative game.When one hears the premise, one doesn't realize how tense, strategic and fun it is. It's exceptionally well made.I've played it for months during Early Access, and even early on, it was playable and fun. Now it looks polished and beautiful. Get it while it's on sale!			"

												Nice Capitalism simulator. Nicely scratches the building itch in fun small chunks of time. Games go for around 30min and you can play quite fast and keep yourself busy. Great if you like building/economy management but dont like to slog through 10+ hours of a full campaign of civilization or whatever.The online multiplayer also gives it much more replayability than city building games too.The presentation is also very well done and its quite satisfying watching your base turn into something akin to a beehive while you watch your money meter keep ticking ever higher.Only downside is the price point. 40USD is a steep asking price for whats on offer.Grab it on sale though and its an innovative and addictive little game.

												Im going to be very honest here, i dont buy a lot of games because i dont have a lot of money, hence i download and play a lot of games illegally. Offworld Trading company was one of those games. However after spending about 25 hours with the game i thought to myself ""this game is amazing, i must buy it!"" mostly so i could experiance the multiplayer portion but to also support a developer willing to try something different. Of course me being on a budget i waited for the sale and im picking it up for $15 (down from 43). But if i did have more expendable cash i would have jumped in at 43.Anyways, If you are a Civ Fan, or a tycoon fan (transport tycoon comes to mind as being very similar to this) its a great mash up of those. if your looking for battles with units and fighting, look elsewhere. its about resources and money. Buy it now!			"

												I should mention first that RTS games are the games I dislike the most. I really don't like the whole idea behind going down a memorized checklist for the best builds as quickly as possible. I just don't have the time or patience for that. That said, this game isn't bad so far. I've only played offline because of the above reasons and I don't think this game will change my mind on RTS as a genre. But, there is something about this game that is keeping me hooked where other major titles haven't (Starcraft, Warcraft, CoH, etc). Maybe it's the complete lack of combat or the unique focus on economics. Or that the skirmishes themselves are very short.  It probably helps to have some background knowledge of economics going in, but it's not required. The tutorials do a good job of explaining the basics. And, while I do find myself pausing a lot (and kinda wish there was a turn-based mode as a result), I haven't felt overwhelmed yet. And I appreciate the developers giving options for turning off the black market. If it does end up turning into the typical RTS “build order checklist”, that will be disappointing and I'll update my review accordingly. But, for now, I'd say it's worth the $13.59 price tag. The AI has been competent and the individual games, and approaches as a player, have been fairly unique.			"

								In Short (from my curator review): ""Excellent game whose novel Economic-Strategy ideas will hopefully spawn a long lasting genre of this quality. Dispels the notion that strategy=violence.""Longer Form: I am an economics student in graduate school and a sci-fi fan, so as far as I'm concerned OTC was designed specifically for me. The economics & finance in the game is not only fun, but educational and facsinating if you have an interest in those subjects. I love the strategy genre, and have for years, but having a genre so closely tied to violence: Total War, Company of Heroes, Starcraft, Age of Empires, etc. has always bugged me a little bit. Not because I'm a pacifist, but because it takes away from strategic depth to have such a simple zero-sum mechanic at the core of gameplay. With OTC there are not such clear and basic decisions. In a war game: produce units, more is almost always better. In contrast, OTC can't be won, even on the easiest difficulties, by spamming one type of production. You'll inevitably over-supply that commodity and shrink your profits on each sale down to next to nothing while paying through the nose on whatever inputs are associated with that commodity. Simply put, there's more strategic depth. The art style is nice, it is simple as of right now and realistically rendered, I wonder whether there is room to convey information more through the art than is currently done. For instance if the ships transporting resources could convey more about their cargo to lessen the emphasis on the ever-present charts. Note on Early Access: As always, monitor reviews and update logs to note that devs are making progress, but as of the time of writing this review, they are very active and seem to be constantly tweaking and making improvements.A few minor gripes: 1.) My computer is not a world-beater, but can handle most any games on medium or high, however OTC gives me a little trouble with frame-rate so I've had to go down to low settings, which is a shame for such a pretty game.2.) In-game UI could use some poish, main menus and what not are gorgeous so I have faith that these will get better.Recommendation: If you like strategy games you should do one of two things: 1.) Buy it 2.) Wait until it comes out of Early Access, then buy it.			"

												As a long time RTS and stragegy fan, as well as an extreme Civilazation fan, I have to say I was a bit disappointed with Offworld TC.  As a whole, this game feels more like a fantastic foundatation for a spectacularly complex trading sim versus what it actually offers.  Do not be fooled, you will devour this game in its entirety in a matter of hours.  It does not hold a candle to the complexity and depth that the Civ titles (and other leading titles) have to offer.  I purchased the deluxe edition of this game (on sale) for 39.59.  Within a matter of 2 days had not only beaten the campaign, but had exhausted (unless I missed something) every aspect of playability and replay value that the game has to offer.  A more reasonable price for what this game actually has to offer, at least in single player mode, is more like $10-15.  I found that I had lost the desire to keep playing after a very small amount of time.  I even stuck with it for a bit longer just to see if there was more that I perhaps had missed...turns out I found no reason to keep playing beyond the couple days I devoted to mastering it.  As a fan of the genre, I had high hopes of progress, strategy, and replay value that the best RTS/stragegy/sim/farming/economic games have to offer.  This review is not meant to ONLY bash the game.  With more content, resources, campaign options, and other things of this nature, this game could be epic.  In reality it's nothing more than a foundation for what could be an absolutely fantastic game of depth and strategy.  I would recommend this game only when the price is reduced to something more befitting of a game that lacks everything that was mentioned above.In summary, this game is great and certainly worth playing, but only if the price is right for what the consumer can get out of it.  As of right now however, it feels incomplete and very limited as far as play choices, resources, strategy, economy, variability, and overall complexity,  Kind of sad that its almost over before it begins... I am recommending this game because of its uniqueness and potential but on a scale of 1-10 this game is a 4, at least for the price.			"

								I really, really, really wanted to like this game. It is right up my alley and I thought it would be a blast. Unfortunately not.  There is no joy in building an economic engine or a profitable company. There is no satisfaction in making good strategies. There is no logic in the buy-out end-game.There will be games in which you are hit three four times a minute by sabotage. Every company will attack you and you can't execute a strategy for the spam. There will be games in which you are the strongest company and suddenly find yourself bought out by a company worth half of your value. And I mean sudden. One moment you are thinking ""wow, I am actually generating a profitable company here and then WHAM! Game over!. It's a total WTF moment because there is no clue it's coming.In Railroad Tycoon you could buy up your shares to keep from getting taken over. Not in this game. It's simply not fun.It could be, and should be. But I think the developers have gone down the path of playing so many games with each other that they see the fun in it, but forgot that the fun they are having is only because they know each other and designed the game themselves. I'm sure if I played several hundred hours I would start to get into the nuances of play. But why spend that much time on something that isn't enjoyable just to get to where it might be enjoyable?This is a real shame and the first time in a long time I really feel my money was wasted on a steam purchase.Maybe they will stop and reassess their design. But at this point, this is a game best avoided. This game will need major rethinking and the designers to ask themselves,  what exactly is supposed to be fun?			"

												I put this game on my wishlist based on the Pedigree of the developers. It seemed an interesting and different take on an RTS and it looked like a harsh business trading simulator. I bought it on sale at 35% off and that came with a free key for a buddy. Called my go to buddy to give it to him and he said ""Oh man, I already have it and you are not going to like it. It's fun for a couple of hours but that's it. It's too simplistic to enjoy much longer"".Sadly, he was dead on. The game is extremely simplistic. So if you are looking for the varied and intersting types of games you could get from Civ, you won't find it here.I literally enjoyed it for about 4 hours and that was pretty much it. You have four factions who are largely identical. They all make a variation of mines and factories which make exactly the same core components. You take those core components and build one or more of 5 different buildings that can give you an edge like help you produce resource X a bit faster, or get a monopoly on a tech like teleportation, which eleminates the need to transport your goods to your home base.You can then begin to sell your goods to try and make money to buy out your competitor faster than they can buy you out.In the meantime there are a handful of repetitive, boring, dirty tricks you can use to slow them down or speed you up in your pursuit of the one goal, which is buy your competitors out.That's it. That's the whole game. Their variety pitch is that there is an infinite number of ways to play each match because you won't always use the same dirty tricks, but there are only a handful of dirty tricks.If you are interested in a repetitive experience of skirmish matches which last 15 - 60 minutes, and you like fine tuning your ability to deliver the same strategy over and over, then this game is for you.If you are looking for a deep, strategic, intereting RTS with a variety of playstyle and paths to victory, then absolutely not.As polished as the game is, one can see that there is very little depth or substance. My go to gaming friend nailed it when he called it ""simplistic"". Wish I had called him before I bought the game. I'm going to have to bust it out once a month or so to get in some skirmishes and still have it feel fresh and get my money's worth out of it.			"

								Gameplay video & thought below based on build of the game on the 15th Feb:http://youtu.be/O3PbotegVNc?aWhile in it's current early state I've had a great time playing OTC. It's a game that appears simple but there's a lot to learn from what I can tell. Scanning at the start of the game you begin to see what resources are available so it's this instant choice on do you find a few good tiles then set down fast and grab whatever you can or do you hold an extra few seconds incase there's a better spot for your HQ. You then need to pick which type of business you want to set up with based on what resources you can see and the way you prefer to play. Begin managing your claims and where you position your production tiles etc for maximum efficency. Controlling debt, being mindful of the market, expanding competitively against your opponents. I've had a great time and I greatly look forward to the future of this game!			"

												After playing for 70+ hours, I still don't understand why anyone is making a negative review on this game, unless it was not what they expected. It's Starcraft meets Civilization with a stock market. Except, that it is neither Starcraft nor Civilization. It's something totally unique. If you don't like how short the skirmishes are, then play some campaigns (personally, I wish the campaigns were longer than 7 matches. Marathon, anyone?). If the AI is predictable and unchallenging, then turn up the difficulty and watch them pound you in the ground - it will improve your strategic capability, if nothing else. If you don't like keeping tabs on your competitors while you're busy advancing your own goals, then you're in the wrong genre entirely.The beauty of this game is there isn't just ONE strategy to win, but dozens or perhaps hundreds. There are many choices that can be made (by you and your competition) that can affect the later part of the match. And then you throw in the variability of the game's stock market based resource pricing. Sure, if everyone is producing and selling iron, then the price of iron will tank, but unforeseen and ultimately random events can change anything. You may need to adapt: if you decide to make your fortune on glass and then the price of glass plummits because of market saturation, you have the option to scrap your facilities and focus on something new. It's not a set-it-and-forget-it type of RTS. You have to adjust and adapt to each unique scenario and you may have to do so several times to achieve victory. It's the kind of strategy game that leaves you wanting more.			"

								I don't care what negative reviews you read about this game. (Multiplayer population will increase as people see the game.) Now I know the price point might be off-putting. But I'd rather pay $39.99 for OFFWORLD TRADING COMPANY, than the $49.99 I payed for GREY GOO.I've played some games in my time. And this one is remarkable. I wish we had more games like it. It's what I wish the newest Sim City had aspired to.Offworld Trading Company is pure genius.If you're into economy games, you'll love it.The goal is to buyout your opponents by amassing resources as one of several differnet types of colonies. Each has there strong and weak points. This premise alone seems pretty minimal, right?Wrong.You're gathering your metals, making steel, etc. You start gathering water, or food. You feel safe. You're doing alright, and your money is going up.Suddenly one of your opponents EMPs your grouping of three water generating facilities.Now you're going into debt.Water is $212 a unit. And you need three units a tick. That's $636 you're going into debt, each tick.Your debt risses, you have no spare cash. The ""duration"" of the EMP is another THIRTY seconds.You sell your stockpile of resources to lower your debt. It seems to be working.But then, a competitor starts buying stock in your company. He already owned 50% and now he's at 80%$22,000 is what it will cost for you to lose the game. Does your competitor have that much?You're still hemoraging money from buying water, like a total noob.The EMP wears off. You pay off your debt. You're back in the black.You buy the last 20% of your own company with all your cash.Then he throws pirates at you, crippling both your food and water shipments.Your water was already low, and you start losing money.But you have food! You'll be fine!And then the last 20% of your stock is bought for the X2 price of $44,000 and your competitor owns you.10/10 Would get bought out again.			"

												Offworld Trading Company is a very refreshing take on the RTS genre. Once ruled by the likes of Starcraft, Warcraft, Age of Empires and Command and Conquer, the genre's popularity has currently taken a turn for the worst. Many attribute its downfall to the success of League of Legends: by distilling the genre to it's very core and simplifying the gameplay, it has become the most played multiplayer game. Offworld Trading Company does this to an even greater level: while League eased the burden on the player by allowing control of just your hero, OTC did away with controlling units entirely.This game innovates in so many aspects that it's difficult for me to list them all. There is no combat, but the multiplayer still feels vicious and fierce. Instead of fighting with guns and swords, your tools of conquer are liquid assets, market manipulation and sometimes Filthy Pirates. No two maps are ever alike: sometimes silicon is lacking, and whoever can secure a monopoly on it will certainly profit later on. Other times, there is little aluminium and by keeping the price high you can prevent your opponents from upgrading. Every game starts with you settling down on Mars as one of four corporations, each as different from each other as Starcraft's factions. The purpose of this is twofold: you are assisting the local colony by producing whatever goods they need, while also looking to become filthy, filthy rich. The early game consists of rushing to upgrade as fast as possible by securing control of your primary resources. Once your HQ reaches level 3, the focus becomes sabotaging your opponents as well as (ab)using the market and other players to make money as fast as possible. Is one of your opponents shipping resources from far away, without producing any fuel? Put down some reactors and make bank on the high fuel price. Does he start producing his own? Sabotage his factories and turn his debt into your money! These kinds of decisions pop up constantly, and you need to be vigilant to seize the opportunity. But when you do, it pays off fast and hard! The game usually ends (after around 20 minutes) in a frantic race to make enough money to buy out your opponents, while preventing them from doing the same. While there may be a clear leader at times, he can be toppled if two or more players gang up on him.This game is fantastic. I wholeheartedly recommend it to fans of the RTS genre, as well as anyone looking for an unique, intelligently designed game. While there is a learning curve, the in-game tutorials do a great job of explaining the interface and the basics of gameplay. I also recommend Zultar's tutorial series to anyone looking for a more in-depth guide. The unofficial official Discord server[discord.gg] is one of the best resources for this game, you can get specific advice and guidance, or just chit-chat, with players that have hundreds, if not thousands of hours played.

								Its a very interresting market simulation/RTS that getting along nicely for an early access game. The basic mechanics revolves arround manipulating prices (through supply and demand, as well as some special events) to make enough money to buy out your opponents, while using the market and special black market effects to gain an advantage and prevent your opponent from doing the same. It takes a few tries getting into to understand the mechanics but after that it starts to get very fun in multiplayer. Gametime is arround 15 to 20 min for a 1v1, sadly the playerbase is not yet big enough to regularily play more than a 1v1 match. On the plus side, Quick match will find you opponents in short time pretty regularly now. Fazit: I enjoy playing it now, and it looks to be moving in a good direction, so i look forward to an even better game at full release. I would definately recommend it.			"

												As a fervent Command and Conquer player back in the day transitioning to Starcraft 2 once the series was discontinued didn't feel right. It failed to scratch the itch of what I felt a true RTS game should feel like. I moved onto MOBA's like Dota 2, League of Legends and Heroes of Newerth, and whilst I sunk many hours into each it still wasn't like what I felt an RTS should feel like. Grey Goo was a complete disapointment and I felt that maybe I had just changed, that I had grown out of my love for RTS. Then I played Offworld Trading Company. Man it felt so good to play a proper RTS again after all these years. Make no mistake this is a fast, cuthroat, and competitive RTS at its core despite not using conventional mechanics such as blowing up your opponentsbase with an army. If your looking for an RTS experience like I was and Starcraft just never cut it for you, give this a try.There's also a   community discord channel [discord.gg] if you want to talk to more players before you make a decision			"

Offworld Trading Company™ – Competitive Market StrategyRating: RecommendedFor young aspiring entrepreneurs, Earth has grown much too crowded to do business. The vast openness of the barren planet Mars calls to explorers and investors alike. Once the colonies have been established, the entrepreneurs see the potential for profit. Businesses start popping up on the Red Planet – this is where you come in.Offworld Trading Company is a fast-paced strategy game all about manipulating the Martian market, producing goods and buying out other businesses. Natural resources are limited and competition is brutal for control of the richest veins. Placement of mines, extractors, and other resource-producing buildings is critical to amassing enough materials to purchase new structures, upgrade your headquarters and get more claims. Each claim allows you to place one structure – use them wisely.Price values of the thirteen types of resources fluctuates with market activity. Is someone selling off their entire aluminum stash? Expect to see prices nosedive. You can also buy stock in your opponents’ companies. If all stock gets purchased and you have enough money, you can buy them out, causing all their buildings to come under your control. The goal of the game is to be the last man standing by buying out all your opponents.The only bad points this game has so far are its high retail price ($40) and the black market feature. The black market in this game makes investing in buildings risky. Found a high (level 3) water deposit? Someone can purchase an Underground Nuke for a paltry $1000 - $3000 to knock that deposit down to low (level 1) permanently. It seems an unnecessary element in an already risky business environment.I haven’t explored deep into this game, still in Early Access at this point, but it’s been both challenging and rewarding. You may ask “Is it really worth $40 in Early Access?” No. Wait for at least 25% off, preferably 50% or more. If you’re a dedicated economy gamer (Railroad Tycoon, Capitalism series), this might trip your trigger. Pick it up if it goes on sale.Not RecommendedRecommended with Caution- RecommendedHighly RecommendedRecommended as Essential			"

												Offworld is a unique RTS game that captures the best and worst parts of capitalism, in space! I've been following this game for some time, and I am not disappointed by the results of the hard work of the development team.The overall objective of the game is to become the most profitable off-world trading company by becoming the most profitable and efficient corporation around. You'll achieve this by building supply chains of goods, selling them to a local colony, shipping them off the planet, and using your gains to buyout your competitors while avoiding being bought out yourself.Positives:+Amazing soundtrack by Christopher Tin (composer of Baba Yetu, of Civ 4 fame)+Quick cutthroat gameplay; the decisions on where to land, and what to start producing are the beginnign of a race to quickly provide goods that meet the demands of a local colony.+The gameplay is unique: there isn't any 'militay' component to this game; instead you will be competing with other corporations in the marketplace to become the most efficient and profitable offworld-trading company.+Interesting hostile actions - while you can play it straight and just compete on the 'free market', there are a variety of options to sabatoge your competitors through illicit means.+Unique factions  - each faction has their own set of strengths, and weaknesses; playing one versus another feels very interesting and different.+Great writing (in the tutorial and opening missions, at any rate).Negatives:-It seems like there's not really a comeback mechanic once you start to fall behind; if you make a few mistakes early, you're probably going to have a bad time. I could be wrong, but once I start to lose, I continue to lose.-The factions aren't visually all that different.-This game is probably overpriced for the content that you're getting; I recommend purchasing this game on at least a 25% sale, probably closer to 50%.-I'm unsure about the replayability of the game; so far, the experience has been novel; outside of multiplayer, I don't think the game will provide more than 20 horus of gameplay.Overall, I highly recommend this game for RTS players who want a different experience - namely one that focuses on competitive supply chains and economic efficiency. The game has a lot of character, and has been very enjoyable to explore.			"

												This is mostly a personal preferences review and it is written after less then 2 hours gametime, then I requested a refund. So this is more of a ""what this game isnt""-Review, so others who look for a complex and ""big"" economic simulation (like I did) save themselves the hassle.For a real economic-simulation the game is way to ""small"". It will take 15-30 mins at max to reach the maximum possible expansion for your buisness on a map.""fighting"" the opponents is either done through just throwing acts of sabotage (bought at a black market) at them or by buying them out.If that now sounds intricate and complex, it really isnt you just click a black market mission, then click the target and it happens, buying the other buisnesses out just means making money faster then they do and buy their stocks before they can buy yours.I didnt play it long and had it refunded pretty quickly, especially after seeing that really trying to muscle the opponent out of a market isnt really working, because there is basically no need to close down factories as soon as you produce enough energy, fuel and necessities of life so you dont need to buy them to keep your company running (and that is EASY).So basically if you like a rather uncomplicated build-up-stuff game that is about just building and clicking faster then your opponents, well it might be a game for you. If you are (like me) looking for a real economic simulation, well not so much.Sidenote: Something that had me kinda baffled was that the game greeted me with a box that told me it was an early access version, despite the fact that the steam-shop site doesnt mention anything about it (no usual big green box, saying ""early access"")			"

Early Access Review
								It makes me sad but i cannot give this a thumbs up...yet. The game is fun and a fantastic idea. I love tycoon and money makinga games so i was really excited when I saw this, but $40 looked a little steep so i waited till it was half off. Wow was I glad. The game is a good challenge but very similar every time. The campaign is just...well...for lack of a better word, lame. And when you win in a regular its a strange feeling of emptiness as the little fireworks start popping and a giant YOU WON floats across the sky, This is because you fighting and fighting and selling and launching rockets n then you realize you can just sell all the products in you inventory, buy all of every competitors stock and then in two seconds the game is over. No continuation no new threats to ever sprout. For lovers of classics like AOE like myself where you have to beat your opponent to a pulp and search for and destroy every last unit and building until you see your foes at their knees making some lame exuse why they lost and you get that triumphant message of victory, you feel like youre fighting tooth and nail and then it kind of landslides n youre like oh look i won. ok i should go get a life now. It is also somewhat lacking in variety and substance. That said it is a good game and is still being worked on. But at the moment the most I would want to pay for this game is $15. 40 is faaar too expensive for what the game currently offers. I will keep playing it though and hope for it to improve. If you're thinking about buying it, wait for a good sale. 20 is ok for this game. I simply can't recommend this game at its full price and current state. If either of those changes for the better i'll be prompt to alter this.			"

												An RTS that's focused on the building part of strategy rather than on the sending armies out part. This game is slickly produced and a lot of fun to play. Even against the AI there's a lot of fun to be had and no game ever palys out quite the same way and it's rare that you can rest on your laurels as the ride can turn quickly if you've botched your strategy. Highly reccomended.			"

								I was interested in this game since it was announced and I can safely say it is everything I wanted it to be. The AI is incredible, constantly buying and destroying buildings to account for changes in the market. I can only imagine what complex algorithms are driving these decisions. If the AI isn't cheating, then the developers must be geniuses. Thanks for this awesome game, I can't wait to see it finished. Too bad it is a bit under-the-radar.The only changes I wish to see made are to the stock market. Currently it is not worth it to sell stocks because the stock is worth more than the sell price. Stock market trading needs to be more strategic rather than just a button you click when you want to beat another player. Players should be encouraged to invest in other players, possibly by removing the penalty for selling a stock and by removing the stock boost when you buy a stock. This way I can invest in a player early on, then sell the stocks and turn a fair profit later.			"

Early Access Review
								Overall, somewhat suprised and pleased with the game. I'm still not terribly happy with the price point (I think for EA something around $20 would be more fair with a possible $30-$35 point when the game is finished) but I don't think I wasted my money.Some of my negative comments first:- The UI can be a bit clunky and laggy at points.- If you leave a campaign game in the middle you seem to automatically lose that round (no way to save it and return later unless I'm being oblivious).- If you start losing rounds in the campaign it becomes extremely difficult to make up the lost ground.- No clear indication of when a campaign is over/ability to have multiple campaigns going at once.My biggest takeaway - no problems with the gameplay. The rounds definetly go by quicker then I thought they would as do the campaigns. I do wish there was an option in the campaign to vary the number of starting opponents (simply because once they are all eliminated you win and they can get eliminated fairly quickly) but thats fairly minor. The AI is extremely robust and even the start of the game takes some thought (eg do you drop your base quickly and move to what nodes you can see, do you spend longer scanning hoping to hit the motherload, etc). It does feel like it's really all just a race to the offworld markets (they are so lucrative that whoever gets their first is more or less going to win the game) but the gameplay itself is great. The game takes some forethought as you are limited in what you can do via a limited number of claims (it would be nice if you yourself could give up or auction off a claim). Graphics overall are simple (but clean) and make it extremely easy to see what is going on in-game.All in all I still do have a bit of an issue recommending it at this price point but if you think you'd happen to like the genre and aren't tight with cash I would pick the game up. Hopefully this turns into a good example of Early Access but even if we never heard another word from the Devs the game is completely playable now.Edit: After playing some more I do have to say there are some annoying balance issues (some of the ""races"" are clearlier to play/win with then others and some of the abilities/techs are way to strong while others are almost useless) but hopefully those will be addressed going forward.

								I've been following this game since before it was on Steam. Such a great concept! And it does not disappoint.The Good* Simple game mechanic that grows to a complex interconnected system* Easy to learn, requiring almost no tutorial, but difficult to master* Fun and addictive gameplay* A lot of the usual grind has been automated, leaving the player almost entirely grind-free to focus on base management (yay). The sole exception is the Saboteur system, which you can find in ""The Bad"" section below.* Challenging AI* Very satisfying victories without long drawn-out endgames* Decent graphics (if a bit blocky)* I am playing this in early-access, and yet the game seems full-featured and stable.* Interesting and current topic (mars colonization)* Well thought-out in terms of resources, resource usage, and gameplay mechanics* Offword mining and its actually about (mostly) peaceful commerce? What an original idea!The bad* The core game mechanic involves getting resources first, and then combining/upgrading to extract them faster. Other than avoiding pirate raids, no thought is given to logistics. I would have liked some road or train building, or having to run power lines or pipelines, rather than everything being delivered via hover selds* The sabotage system is annoying and feels ""taped on"". Its mostly ineffective, and yet pulls the player away from base management. Especially towards the end of the campaign, this can get kind of grindy... with players always having to repair or re-up their goon-squad, and keep track of attacks all over the place* The first colony almost always wins - I suppose that's incentive to drop early, but with a pausable interface, all the level3 resources near the colony are gone by the time the second corporation touches down* The game seems weighted towards Expansionist and Saboteur factions, with little real benefit for the robots or scientists* Synth voices for the characters are annoyingNot sure if these are good or bad...* I feel like there should be more of a sandbox mode, perhaps with some far-future constructions like terraformers?* Game is also quite short. It seems like a perfect length for what this game is. However, its a lot of fun, and I kinda hope it gets more features, which (I think) would need a longer campaign* Its cliche, but I expected at some point to find alien ruins / fossils / alien tech, but didn't. This could go either way. It adds a bit of mystery and alien-ness, and deepens a story.. but it is very typical and overdone too.ConclusionLoved it. I love strategy and simulation games, so this might get a touch of extra appreciation from me that might not be shared by all. Even so, I'd give Offword Trading Company a 9.5 / 10.Thanks for reading!			"

								This is a promising unique type of Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game.  Even on its normal speed, that you could adjust even in multiplayer, things are fast paced enough to finish a match in 30mins but plenty of time to think about your actions.  You begin by scanning the map for a good starting location.  Each player does the same, but here's the catch, if you are one of the last to found you get bonus tiles (called claims) to build buildings on because you are pretty much forced away from the prime locations that the first founders took, unless your lucky and they didnt spot something.  After you found, this is the fastest part of the game, because you want to claim certain tiles first.  Now each game is going to have a different strategy.  Perhaps you want to claim that lone carbon resource so no one else can get it and force them to buy off the market.  Maybe you think that the other players are going to sell water down so the price to purchase it would be $1, so forgo water and go for more prime minerals or power sources.As the game progresses, you can buy items off the black market or on auctions.  Some help yourself but most of the time you are buying them to stop production of your enemies or to steal one of their resources for a short time.  Each time a player buys, say a dynamite stick, the price goes up for all players the next time you want one.  There is a lot of choices in a fast matched game to choose.End game is always the same, trying to constantly protect your Offworld Markets with shields (Goon Squads), trying your best to disrupt the enemies Offworld Markets.  It usually ends with the first one to amass a huge amount of cash to buyout the remaining shares of your competitor.  It really is no different than a military RTS how to end a game, always ends the same way with hordes of marines going time and time again.  However looking at stock prices for the end game and scanning over to your enemy base to disrupt stuff is about all there is in the end game, nothing fancy like seeing buildings get destroyed by your units.All and all, it is a great game to try out.  They havn't really stated what will be coming in the future except for leagues and ladders like any good RTS game would do.  If they do that, they need to limit the observer mode to a delay or something, and I can see free for all getting out of whack with teams trying to join in and gang up on a player.			"

YouTube™ Video: Should you Buy Offworld Trading Company?  A 4X Economy Review 

			Views: 1,048		

			From Soren Johnson comes Offworld Trading Company, a unique mix of an economy simulator with the 4X style. The game is in early access however the promise was made that it was in fact a complete...		

Upon loading up the game I was surprised to find that despite the early access tag, it's actually a full game with polish.The game is sort of similar to Civ in that it is a 4x, but that's where the comparisons will end. It's closer to an economic simulator. You build infrastructure that produces resources. Resources can be used to produce new infrastructure. Infrastructure can take resources and created finished products out of them. And with all that you can sell them out to a dynamic market in which the price will fluxuate based on how much each player is selling of that commodity.The main part of the game is surviving as a company and buying out other ones. If your company value falls low you become vulnerable to losing shares of your company to competitors. Your company value is your debt and your infrastructure value combined. So paying off debt will make it harder for people to buying you, while having a large sum will allow you to buy an opponent.Once you have bought an opponent you gain their stuff in full and gain a significant advantage.The game comes with a tutorial for playing the game and playing each of the four factions. Each faction comes with its own unique set of opening boosts and needs. With a few dozen maps to choose from there is tonnes of gameplay value for your dollar.Fans of games like Port Royale, Rise of Venice, Anno 2070, and C.E.O. should definitely give this game a try. For people who are newer to economic simulators and want to give it a try, this might be the game for you.			"

												Offworld Trading Company is a frustratingly fun game! I have only played vs. the AI and it feels rewarding and fair when you outplay it or when it outright buys you out. Furthermore, I found it interesting that setting up the difficulty level (whether for the AI or you) means that you are setting up a handycap. The AI with the same handycap as the player still beats the player if s/he does not play ""correctly."" This means that you should pay attention to what your HQ needs and what other HQ use as resources. You should use your AI games to figure out which strategy you like (or as in my case keep you alive) best. The random resource allocation and the map designs increase the complexities of this game. Say you want to grab the water, fuel, and food markets. If the map only has 3 water tiles and they are located in a very narrow ridge between craters, you may have a problem. Why? Well, if you are rushing stocking early fuel expecting the prices to go up (because everyone will have to grab resources in weird locations and far from their HQs), you may not want to spend fuel to get fuel transported to your HQ. Furthermore, if you place the HQ near the water tile, you may not have the space to properly place the fuel refineries. You see, how you place buildings affect what bonuses you get from the production of the resource!As you can see, the game is complex enough that I don't dare venture into the multiplayer ladder without having a clue of what I should do under different conditions to maximize my early game profits (also, I have an unreliable connection sometimes). The mechanics feel solid and balanced. You usually lose because you of some badly managed resource or market or because you failed to ship resources offworld before the competition.Overall, I love the game! The animation quality is great! I like the voice over and sounds, although the early access text-to-speech (placeholder?) voice over assets had their own personality. Heck, even the menu surprised me. This is the first game I have seen that differentiates and supports three types of color-blindness.Please, do not ignore this game and grab it as soon as it becomes affordable to you. Then, play it and join the ranked ladder so we can buy each other's companies some day!To the pirates I say, ""Pirates, I hate those filthy bandits!"" :P			"

												As far as RTS / resource management games go, this one is quite the doozy. Most games give you three or four resources to manage and figure out, this one throws about a dozen at you. The tutorials are engaging, the game is visual beautiful, you'll find yourself getting sucked into the old ""just one more match..."" cycle.Having said all that...The AI in single player games is STUPIDLY overpowered. You'll find yourself beat to the punch on literally every single thing you try to do. Some of the various factions (okay, really just the Science HQ) are so oddly configured that it's almost impossible to figure out. This game is unforgiving and has a super steep learning curve, but if you're okay with all of that, I'll give it a solid 8/10 stars.			"

Supply and demand as well as opportunity cost all become very real factors in your decisions. There are also ways to manipulate the markets and undermine your oppononents. PROS:- Gorgeous graphics- Great soundtrack- Engaging gameplay- Many different ways to go about winningCONS:- Steep learning curve- Not much fun against AI (but what game is)- Some people will get frustrated by it's somewhat complex mechanicsOverall, solid 8.5/10.

								High price for an 'early access' game.I enjoy challenges, but mostly play games for their 'enjoyment factor'.    The idea is nice, much of how the game is set up is great.  However, the approach seems to be from the extreme side of 'play the market', and not from the standard view of 'invest in your resources to build your empire'Each 'faction' has certain needs that are emphasized, but you can't invest your extremely limited resource placements based upon those needs. It seems impossible to win on first run, forcing you to play through to see which commodoties pay the highest returns, and build to emphasize those - knowing you're paying out for the commodities to survive, utilizing 'profits' from commodities you probably don't need.Often as you seem on the cusp of winning, one of the  competition will suddenly, and quite rapidly, buy you out.

												What a great game! It's definitely unconventional as RTSes go, but what's wrong with that? We're all looking for something new and exciting to try, right? If you are reading this you probably know basically how this game works, so I'll spare you that.The game is challenging. And to do well even against the non-cheating AI you have to think and react fast. After a while you get to understand the ""personality"" of the AI and you can get to a point of being able to beat the Manger AI (standard) regularly. At 45 hours I'm not there yet. Once you can do that you can bump up the AI so that it cheats (or maybe you're just handicaped...or both...I actually don't know yet). Better yet, hop into multiplayer and play against people who really know what they're doing. There is ranked 1v1, ranked 4-player free-for-all, and custom games up to 8 players, in free-for-all, teams, and comp stomp.I've watched some live multiplayer on the MohawkGames twitch channel where they are essentially game casting as they play. Soren (the creator) is pretty good at this, but Zultar is amazing! I have learned from watching them, but the biggest lesson is that there is a huge skill curve to this game. I cannot say whether that skill curve is steep, shallow, or moderate, but there is so much depth to this game that even though I understand all the mechanics I'm not even close to understanding more than 10% of why the top players do what they do. The game has observer and replays, and is pretty well balanced it seems. I've watched some youtube videos of the OTC Tournaments during beta and release, and I personally think this game could make it into the competitive scene, if other top players pick up on this gem.Now if your major draw to games is graphics, you'll want to pass for now. The graphics don't suck but this game isn't about eye candy. All the factions use the same buildings and ""ships"", except their starting base. They have some good animations and there is some life to the maps, which is pretty nifty given this is taking place on Mars (cloud shadows, flares, dust storms). I don't spend much time looking at the art...I enjoy the gameplay.If your major draw to games is character and story, you'll want to pass for now. The tutorial brings a little bit of life and humor to characters that you'll encounter in the campaign. Incidentally the campaign is designed to be played after you've played through the tutorials and have some experience with skirmishes, not before. The campaign is largely a string of skirmishes where you take the role of one of the characters and try to be the best corporation over the course of seven rounds. ""Only seven"" you ask? The campaign is designed to be more of a single-player mini tournament that is replayable. You play one of the four factions through the rounds, starting with diminished capability but building up toward the final round. Each round you have the chance to gain some new abilities and after each round you ""tech up"". The maps available to play during each round are selected randomly, so each play-through is different. There is also some progression between runs of the campaign where you get to unlock other campaign characters to play. A neat system, but again not for one who relies upon story.If your major draw to games is replayability, both singleplayer and multiplayer, this is your game. Skirmish, the campaign, and I think multiplayer have a really neat system to enhance replayability. While there are some preset maps that have standard terrain, I think most games are played on procedurally generated maps, made fair by allowing players to plop down wherever they want. Not only is the map terrain procedurally generated, the resource locations are too. In the game there are some random events, like dust storms and solar flares, plus a colony that affects the economy through granting random bonuses and creating random (though predictable and exploitable) demand. In short, no two games will ever be the same. UNLESS...you input a random seed, which will produce the exact same map if you happen to want to. That's a great idea, which I can see it being used in tournaments.Lastly there is the ""Daily Challenge"". This appears to be a skirmish seed that everyone can play to compete for top spot on the day's leaderboard. So far it seems the top spot is whoever can win the game the fastest. And right there next to their time is an icon which you can click to watch the replay! A great way to see how the top players play.Does this game have what it takes to catch the RTS world's eye? I think so. I hope so. It's the most fun RTS I've played in years. I can envision a future of DLC with more factions, resources, buildings, and gameplay mechanics that will make this game's replayability and multiplayer even richer. But first, you have to buy and play this game. What are you waiting for?Pro tip: Don't be afraid to bulldoze buildings and put down more profitable ones. The good players are refocusing constantly based upon the market.			"

								This game is amazing, i love playing it skirmishes are definatly the best game mode for me as a play with freinds. If you enjoy games such as Civilisation and endless space/ledgend but dont have the time to dedicate to a game such as that, this game is definatly recommended to you.the game is still in early access, its founded on a basic crafting system so its easy to pick up, yet beacause of the markets both resourse market and black market it gets extremely tactical especially with human players and the way you play the game is inovative an requires you to think on your feet this is what sells this game and i definatly think its worth it.I would love to see new corperation types encorperated into the game as there are only 4 at the moment, i understand bringing more may complcate gameplay for the players but i find that if theres a lot of a certain resourse most players take advantage of that obviously, so you will end up with 3 out of 4 players being the same corperation. Now say there was corperations, for example a different type of robotic corperation that runs with different bonuses but on the same base resources i think it would help having a more varied gameplay as you wont end up playing all the same types.

								This is a great game, a lot like Civilization. Build a HQ, create mines (the type that mine reasources not the type that blow stuff up there is dynamite for that :P) buy stuff from the market, pump water, geez this game has a lot of stuff (hard not to say **** there whoops :P), buy out other players, buy illigal stuff from the black market and make things go boom, play with other people or with AI if you are forever alone (like me :(...) then there is like a thing in campain that I don't understand but great game :)			"

												Ahh, yes. Capitalism. An economic system that produces lots of waste, harms the environment, and promotes terrifying business tactics. Transplant it onto a newly colonized Mars and give it very few laws and restrictions, and watch as the companies destroy each other and buy each other out!In all seriousness though, this game is great. Like, really great. I would go as far to say that it's the best game I've played this year! This game has so many great features, it's gonna be hard covering them all. First, the amount of diversity each company has. They all have their own special abilities, which can make the gameplay very different, depending on who you pick. Second, picking & choosing which product you want to produce and make a profit off of. For me, I always have to switch to another product halfway through the game, because I end up making the price of it too low! Third, the market. Watching the market prices go up and down, all while manipulating them is very fun to do. Fourth, the special buildings can really change the tide of the game. I have won many times due to using them, they really do save you now and then!Finally, the difficulty. I mean, this game is brutal. The AI can get very, very aggressive. I can barely win a skirmish on the fourth lowest setting! (Honorable mentions: the soundtrack, art style, and sound effects.)My only complaint that it does get a little repetitive, but honestly, it doesn't matter if you just put it away for a bit, and come back to it later.If you're looking for a great strategy game that is brutal and shows no mercy, this is a game for you!

								I'll put this out there to start: I picked this game up on sale for $20, which after having played it feels about right. This is a recommendation based on the $20 pricetag, I do not feel it's worth $40 quite yet.Pros:+Interesting concept that is (mostly) executed well.+Four different faction types that are relatively balanced.+Good level of mechanical depth that makes the game more enjoyable as you learn.+Multiplayer is fun, particularly co-op+Winning is satisfying - there's no other way to put it. When you buyout your last competitor, you feel like you've earned your monopoly.Cons:-Tutorials are bare bones at best, useless at worst. On top of not covering very basic but vital mechanics (using claims without building, the usefulness of upgrade buildings such as the offworld market/patent office, etc) the last three tutorials simply throw you into a standard game and tell you to win with a given faction, with barely a blurb about that faction's unique traits as a guide. You will need to suffer through a lot of trial and error before you feel skilled at the game.-The market essentially functions the same way every game. Certain goods (electronics, chemicals, food) are basically always the most expensive on the market, so a strategy of ""spam electronics late game"" is always viable, and ruins the charm somewhat.-The Black Market, as it is currently implemented, is a big drain on the game. It refreshes too fast, and you are constantly being bombarded in all directions by pirates, EMP's, and dynamite. Honestly, for a game that claims to remove the military elements of the RTS to focus on economics, it detracts from your economic game and forces you to focus on what is essentially guerilla military ops.-The difficulty settings are such that you can only functionally choose to apply bonuses/handicaps to yourself. The AI always plays at the same (fairly high) level, which makes it difficult to keep up as a newbie.Overall the game is still very rough around the edges, but what's there can be fun, particularly with some friends to co-op with. However in it's current state it absolutely feels $20 too expensive at it's standard price of $40. If you can get it on sale, it's worth a look.			"

								Love the game and has potential. I do have a few comments and suggestions tho.I'm a fan of the campaign mode and wish it could extend Much longer. There should be an option for more maps than around the 6-8 currently. That aside there is a steeper learning curve than people realise and certain information isn't readily available for those who just jump into playing.The tutorial doen't explain certain mechanics, like the fledgling colony you're there to support. When it fails (loses all population) some people fail to realize this and think they've been bought out with no notification. This is not the case as they are your local consumers. The larger the independent colony is the more resources they suck off of the market.Having a resource monopoly can be your best friend. Just know when to hold, and when to flood the market. The ability to precisely time buy/sell actions is paramount.The least powerful faction so far in my opinion is the scientific. Especially in the campaign mode, as they have no indipendent water production to start with. Geothermal in campaign is near useless so are the ice and dry ice condensors. Half of the time you don't have 2 of the 3 mentioned if not none at all. My suggestion to improve scientific is give their buildings slant drilling (except mines and quarries and water pumps) by default instead of the reduced sabatoge innate perk.Another thing that should change would be if your debt is higher than some % of  your asset value, any cash made should automatically go to pay off debt, including the automatic selling of stocks that you may have. I know there is an option to have all cash towards debt; however, at a certain point I think lenders would hire collections on your goods. This would allow some negative operational budgets but prevent abuse. As is your stock could be worthless, however maintaing stock in other companies gives a high value well beyond what should be viable.I was attempting to see how high of a population i could get the independent colony to grow and I managed to get an AI opponent into -10,000,000 in debt with an asset value around 1.5 million.  What was interesting is that he still held high cash reserves , and decent stock value because of an earlier purchase of some of my stock. I got it to almost 70 population when my game crashed due to me spamming up around 30+ offworld trades.For the love of God give us a save/load option in Campaign! Also please fix the game lag from opening up any specialized building menus (engineering upgrade, hack net, etc).One final thing I'd love added is a ""Sell at 'X' value"" option similar to the auto sale of electricity but have an option to start/stop selling at a certain value. This would further increase the potential of market manipulations, beyond just start/stop of the power only. An example of this feature would be  locking it to automatically sell water once the price has increased to $30 a unit, and have it auto selling to keep it at that value and no higher.Offworld trading is very OP, it's pretty much game over when someone builds one. I have managed to survive once by spamming mutiny on an opponents and using the funds to buy them out.  This may lead to a game bug, where a person can have more than 2 markets if one of their two is under mutiny and placing another. I can not remember if the opponent had more than one base, as this is a viable option as to how they ended up with 3.All in all a pretty good foundation with just some fleshing out to do with tutorial/help hints, balancing and optimizations. I think an open mod community could really make this a longstanding foundational game. Turn the campaing into a galaxy of planets to work your way through coquering a planetary network would be amazing. Just using similar bonus system for conqured planets. IE: Upon starting a new planet the first map only carries over your Planet wide bonuses from previous planets. This would allow alternate upgrade/tech advancement strategies for different planets.Well that's enough for now, I'm going back to play some more.			"

								If you want to play an RTS that makes you think and keeps you on the edge of your seat as three other players all have one buyout left before you've been bought out, you're waiting for your offworld trading rocket to finally launch and get you that 61k that you're dying for. *Boooom Zzzzttttt* all of a sudden you've been smashed by an EMP blast at the heavy cost of 250k, the black market has been abused and bled. seeing your money hanging around half of what you need to buyout your main competitor, seeing an open opportunity, you cast mutiny (pre-purchased and dying to be used) on their geothermal plant, EMP blast on their headquarters, just a little off the side on an empty tile (to ensure a goon squad hasn't been used)... Now you've done it. Sell everything.. SELL IT ALL. ""WHHHAT I'M like 20k off"", *BOOOOOOMMMM SHHHEEEEZZZTTTTTTTT* you've been blasted by an electrical storm (can't remember the name, lay off okay!?).. twice and now you've lost your main resources.. this is intense, I know right, I'm not going to tell you the end, buy the game.The game is sweet, Stardock have a massive reputation and quite frankly are the only decent RTS & 4X game design company out there (except C&C, CoH).Just buy the game, quite literally there are hundreds of ways that you can play this game, look up a dude called Blitzkreigsler (or something like that) on youtube and watch his gameplay videos of this game, it made me want to get it. I haven't played much time on this game, cause I don't have any friends that have purchased this. But I play Stardocks games and they are excellent.If you want a different style of RTS and you like a polished looking game with plently of great features, plus it's an early access game that actually tells you what has happened since the last patch and they even provide you notes when you open the game.You don't judge a game by it's pricetag, you judge it by who produces the game, if it's a no-name, would-be game design company, steer clear. But you will see for 16 years they have produced some amazing games and if you haven't checked out Galactic Civilizations III you need to! They have a good reputation, sure, sure... I understand, it's been in early access for ages. Well some companies need money to continue, will they finish it? Yes they will, they don't half-do anything. See all your questions answered :) DERRRIIIIICCCCKKKK DDEEEERRRRIIIISSSSSSOOONNN (say that with a nice ol' matt damon voice)			"

												Been playing for a little bit, have to admit I'm loving this game. Reminds me a little bit of the old Industry Giant games, and is definitely an interesting spin on the RTS genre.Pros:- Great soundtrack- Fluid and simple yet flexible gameplay - Different factions, while the same on the surface, will force you to think your strategies through because they all run on different resources- AI is clever. They will target your research buildings with sabotages mid game, and tank resource prices if it figures out what your strategy isCons:- RNG can bite you in the♥♥♥♥♥from time to timeOverall, pretty solid 7.5/10 from me.

												If you love M.U.L.E. buy this game. If you don't know what M.U.L.E. is play it free on planetmule or alternatively buy this game. If you hate M.U.L.E. I respect your bizarre life choices, but do examine this game to see if your complaints were addressed.   Offworld trading company is in my opinion the best non-combat RTS on the market. It's not M.U.L.E. but it takes that core concept and give it's a fresh modern spin. It is a well balanced blend of risk vs reward which is simple to learn but challenging to master. A lot of attention and love has been poured into the game and it shows.  Considerations:  * Game is fast paced.  It's a not a case who ever issues orders the fastest wins like most RTS but the game is about balancing you income and the market environment which influences that income is in constant flux and you must be constantly on your game to adjust your strategy and make choices as the climate shifts if you wish to stay on top of your competitors. It eases you into it buy things get more frantic as things go on as you are juggling more and more avenues open up for players to sabotage each other. Point being there isn't time to relax in a match like their would be in a turn based strategy. Most people think a quick game is a good but this is a preference you have to weigh up for yourself.  * The extra campaign features are just for single player. It is a constant gripe of mine that competitive games that offer mechanics for campaign map don't accommodate multiplayer. Sometimes you want spend to an afternoon with a couple of friends competing for a long game of back and forth struggle. As usual that's not an option. The campaign mode offer a fun and in depth expansion to gameplay experience by incentivising you to continue playing successive matches and thus is makes a good introductory experience to the game and augments your single player experience so it's more then just death match skirmishes with AI bots. Just a shame death match skirmishes is the only experience you can share with your friends.  * Competitive play will take practice. The downside of simple to learn difficult to master means that without putting the time in you simply will not be able to compete with experienced players. The AI is very well developed at this point as a training tool but you are still going to take a beating before you can compete with regular players.  * Replayability. The game has a solid core mechanic with a good deal of depth but that's the extent of it. The different factions all follow the same core rules they just each get to break specific rules, meaning learning to play one means you can play them all, you just have different ways to apply their advantages to different strategies. There isn't a lengthy/branching tech tree and if you've played one 30 minute match you've seen all the game has to offer. It's not that it lacks content (it's packed with it) it's just that the content is focused on a specific experience. It's fair to equate it to a game of speed chess. How many matches can you play before you get bored? For some people it depends on the opponents, others just love and can't get enough of the game while other just enjoy a single match every now and then. When you buy the game you a buying a quality board to play with. It's up to you to assess how much playtime you'll get out of the board.  If these considerations do not concern you then I can heartily recommend this title. It is solidly built, well polished and has benefited from rigorous balance testing. Also it's fun, which is what matters most. If you are unsure if it's a fit for you or not remember you can always buy the game, play a few matches to see what it's like and then refund it. 2 hours playtime is plenty of time to get a feel for the core mechanics. For many of us it's exactly the revival of this niche genre we have been waiting for.			"

								Offword Trading Company is a fun, challenging, economic trading sim. It's the only early access game I've played that I would actually recommend buying in its current state. It already feels like a complete game, and a fun one at that. To start a match, you and your competitors search mars for a place to start your business ventures. The map is randomly comprised of different resources, used to either support your colony, or turn a profit. There are a couple of different colonies, all of which use the available resources differently, providing a slight variety on play-styles.The matches last around 30 minutes or so, which I think is a nice change from the time-investment of the Civ games.There is also a blackmarket, where you can purchase goods to sabotage your competitors, or even manipulate the market in your favor. Be aware: the AI are very well programmed -- don't expect any mercy!""Is it worth the price?"" Yes! Stop asking and start playing.			"

												I simply cannot recommend this game. I was in the mood for some trading and had been eyeing this game since prior to launch.But now that I bought it, I deeply regret it. This game is incredibly simple. It's dumbed down and gets repetitive easily. There is no real market, you buy and sell to the game with some simulated market prices, and that's what your competition does too. If a colony says it requires food, you won't be selling food to them, the game will simulate it and make the price go up a bit. But you just won't trade with anyone specifically. There is only a ""sell"" button for each good and that's it.You can hack Mars information systems (somehow) to simulate a shortage and make the price of your goods go up, but in late game each time, all the goods prices will be going up and becoming hella expensive. Right, real market right there. You can also make prices go down but that doesn't have much impact late game against AIs.The game is just too simple. I am greatly disappointed and sad and missing my money.I haven't tried multiplayer and won't review it.			"

								If Starcraft and Settlers of Catan had a baby (visited by the mailman Capitalism 2), you'd have Offworld Trading Company.Early Access, schmearly shmaccess, this game is good enough now. Art assets are a bit wonky (placeholder computer voices in lieu of actual actors, some weird asset error messages while playing), but whatever.It plays like a... Real Time Board Game. You get the clicky clicky fast decisions of an RTS, but the complex game mechanics / card shuffling of something like Settlers of Catan (or a similar German-style board game where there are multiple ways to win).My only complaint after a few hours is some interface tweaks (such as highlighting existing buildings of the same type you're building so you can more quickly snag the adjacency bonus) and maybe more visible notifications for the ""cards"" played (stocks being bought, EMPs being detonated, etc.)Basically though, if you like RTS games, and you also like economic games, totally get this. I suck at Starcraft - I can't click fast enough to matter, and I freakin' grew up on a computer. But I'm also not a dummy. This game was designed for me.See you on Mars, suckas. I'm gonna buy and sell your butt. For like, a dollar.			"

Product received for free
Offworld Trading Company is a space strategy game with many great attributes and with constant support from the developers.If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.What is happening in the game:You are in control of a colony, based on Mars, and you have to get as rich as possible. You can build mines, factories and farms and then sell them when the price is right. Defend yourself from other companies and try to take them over.Pros: Trading Aspect | There are a lot of similar strategy games, but this game has something other games rarely have: trading. It adds something new to the game and it makes it different from other games of the similar genre, which is definitely a huge advantage. Trading has a lot of different options since you can have different strategies for higher profits and you can even influence the prices, just as you can in real life (if you're wealthy enough). Appearance | This game looks great and it doesn't use a lot of system resources, which is great. Even if there are a lot of things happening on your screen, it is still very easy to track everything. This is sometimes a problem, especially when you get so wealthy that you can afford anything, but your screen gets littered as well. Anyway, this game doesn't have this problem. Tutorials | This game offers an amazing tutorial which covers all the basics well and prepares you for your journey. There are five tutorial levels and each one covers a few connected topics. When you complete the tutorials, you're mostly good to go as the game itself is not extremely complicated, but I will also mention this later on.  Learning Curve | You don't need any prior experience with similar games as this game teaches you game mechanics very gently with some funny dialogs, easy-to-understand instructions and helpful explanations. I've never seen something like that and it's really something every game should have. I sometimes feel frustrated when I don't understand what the game wants from me, but no such thing happened with Offworld Trading Company. Game Modes | Game modes are definitely another great thing about this game as there are many of them, which means more hours of interesting gameplay. After completing the tutorial, you can play some prepared practice games. Then, you can play the Campaign, Skirmish, Daily Challenge levels and even multiplayer ones! Atmosphere | The music in this game is really great and game events also have some influence on what kind of music is played. The sound effects are also pretty great (such as explosions and other things). This is one of rare such games where you don't need to turn on your own music if you don't want to get bored! Achievements and Rewarding | When you do something good in this game, it really lets you know that you did something good and that you learned something. There are quite a few achievements, some harder than others, and they are one of the rewards for making progress. This really makes the player to play the game more since it's like getting a cookie each time you do something of value. This developer really knows how to keep its players! Almanac DLC | These kind of things are usually available as paid DLCs, but this DLC comes with the game for free when you purchase it. You get access to many things, such as a 91-page (!!) strategy guide by professional players and designer notes from the developer.Cons: Pricing | 40€ for a game is really too much, even though it's a very good game. Games of the same genre are usually priced at least 10€ lower. If you manage to find someone who wants the game as well, you can buy the Deluxe Edition which gives you an extra copy of this game. Otherwise, I just don't find this game to be worth so much. Hopefully, the developer will drop the price at some point or at least put a nice discount on it on every major sale. No SteamOS Support | Linux lovers are sadly excluded from this game's player base as well.  I wonder when developers are going to realize that there are some hardcore Linux fans that only buy games when they support their operating system ...The final verdict:Offworld Trading Company is most certainly an amazing game. Apart from its trading mechanics, there are also great graphics, many game mode, a very helpful tutorial and many other great things. Overall, there is nothing particularly bad about this game apart from its pricing. I still think that 40€ is way too much for such a game. When you do buy it, you should have no problems liking it, but I do recommend waiting for a sale before deciding to buy this game. Hopefully, there will also be a price drop in near future.With love,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review. "

Early Access Review
								This is a great game, lots of fun. The first round will be very overwhelming, however the learning curve is easy. It is still in beta, I hope they add a minimap and some hot key functions. navigating is a little odd. An issue I find with all steam games is the hot corners on mac, if you have it enabled, mess up the game. The task bar pops up over the game interface as well as the header bar. It can be irritating when scrolling to the edges is the only way to navigate.It's super fun, but fast paced. You'll be done with each round in 30-45 mins each.  It does leave you wanting something more enduring sometimes. I want to play longer, do more, expand. I don't want to own Mars in an hour or less every time.Again I know it's a beta but the game seems unbalanced, for example my second time through I had bought out all my competitors but one and owned all the resources. I had lots of money and resources, but I was just sitting and messing around. Unfortunately the AI generated enough over a long period of time and bought me out. I lost even tho I owned 90% of the map. Seemed odd.Overall, lots of fun, not time consuming. Leaves you wanting more strategy space RTS tho. Great beta! I hope to see some more features in the full release. 100% worth it.			"

												This game would’ve been great if gameplay and economy had a greater impact on one another. In the beginning it feels as if you’ve got some control of the market but after a while you realize that the market is basically just random for each skirmish and after that AI and players can temporarily manipulate prices with abilities rather than planning ahead and being smart about investments. I am not saying that the abilities such as sabotage should not be in the game but when you realize that that’s basically what the game revolves around it gets boring very fast. It doesn’t really matter what you invest in as long as you are fast enough to screw up your opponents with abilities first, buy their stocks and GG. Anybody looking for an interesting story/campaign should give up on this game right away. There basically is no campaign. It’s just a bunch of skirmish matches against AI with some limitations on each mission. It’s a great looking game with a nice concept but it failed to deliver.			"

												Reminds me of old C&C gameplay without the troop movement. Great balance of having to manage purchases to profits. Really addictive and fun with lots of extra gameplay elements added so it doesn't bore the player. I would suggest this for any player who wants a relatively relaxing RTS experience and like base building games.			"

								I am reviewing this game far earlier than I usually do.  Generally I try to get 10 or 12 hours in on a game so that, even if I haven't finished it yet, I have a solid feel for all the merits and flaws of a game.  However, I am having so much fun with this one that I decided to review it already.Now, the game has flaws.  It does have a tendency to lag out a bit, especially when engaged in the daily challenges.  The graphics are pleasant, but nothing particularly special... of which I approve, since my graphics setup is more for work than gaming, so I have trouble with graphically intensive games.  And you can further turn the graphics down to save on your computer's resources, which is nice, also.There is a minimum of combat (although you can do several different kinds of sabotage, including detonate an opponent's property), since the game is primarily market based warfare, and you win by buying out the competition.  Managing to balance your debt, so that your stock price stays up, while still generating the liquid assets to buy out an opponent makes for some interesting and fun strategizing.There are points where this game lacks, but it's still in Early Access, so that's no big surprise.  Because of this, further reviews will be coming as the game develops.Initial Scoring: 8 out of 10			"

								Pros: -Fast paced for those who like that sorta thing-Easy to pickup-Great soundtrack and mapsCons:-Fast paced for those who hate that sorta thing-Steeply pricedMy strategy gaming experience was exclusively turn based before I tried this game. Because of that I was a little skeptical that I'd enjoy it, but after playing a few matches against ruthless friends and the almost as ruthless AI, I gotta say... it's great fun! As an RTS noob, I found it fairly easy to pickup the basics. The fast pace takes some getting used to but I really like the economy-focused concept. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a fun little title to play when you don't have a whole lot of time to spare but need to get your game on.  I think the only thing wrong with it is the (at present) 40 dollar price tag. I personally believe it is a bit steep. However if you disagree or can catch it on sale, definitely do.			"

												So, I have been wanting to give OTC a thumbs-up since I got it; I think it is really one of the great games of the last few years. Such a unique concept, well-executed, simple to learn, hard to master. If you want thoughtful strategy with competitive multiplayer, and don't care for a long-form story campaign, try this! The AI is also pretty good; quite challenging. There is a short randomized single-player campaign mode to provide variety over plain skirmishes.Anyway, I held off on reviewing this for a long while because after 85 hours clocked I still don't know if I *really* get it. To elaborate...The game takes place around a fictional colony on Mars (placed in the center of each map). Multiple companies set up shop around it and compete for the market driven by the demands of this colony. You are granted a very limited number of land plots to choose and build factories on. Then you have to be ready to strategically replace buildings lest they become unprofitable. Everything you do consumes resources, influencing market prices. You and your competitors may also play the market by buying up and selling down large quantities of goods. Entire matches can be won/lost on market gambles. Lastly, there is a black market of sabotage actions to give an extra edge over the competition. These must be utilized ruthlessly against a skilled opponent (who will be using them ruthlessly).Conflict in this game is highly indirect, through the market. This means that when you are losing (or winning) it can be hard to tell why! Do not be fooled by the immediacy of black market actions; they are powerful, but the main force behind a win is always economic. There is an interactive replay function that allows every match to be reviewed from any player's point of view. Make good use of it!It seems that for the above reason, some reviewers are put off by a game that appears simplistic to some (too easy) and impossibly unfair to others (too hard). It is important to know how the difficulty setting works in this game: Difficulty levels are given fanciful names from ""Applicant"" and ""Intern"" to ""CEO"" and ""Guru"". These do not change how the AI plays (it always works to its best ability), but give some starting bonuses or handicaps to the player. There is a setting in the middle called ""Manager (AI)"" which gives the standard amounts (that the AI always gets) and is actually quite hard for a beginner. There is a set of practice scenarios that ramp up in difficulty and you can see in the achievement stats how many have beaten the last one which plays on ""Manager"" - scroll down to ""Managing Expectations"":http://steamcommunity.com/stats/271240/achievements/So, have fun, and don't jack up the food price too much!

												Okay, so I'm going to put the important bit first. If you're a fan of the RTS genre, but you dislike the intensity of the micro required to perform in the genre at a high level competitively, this is the game for you. Don't even read the rest of the reviews; just buy it and prepare for a fantastic experience. Offworld Trading Company is a deep game. A very deep game. What you need to succeed is an ability to accurately assess a given situation, and make good decisions based on other players' actions. That's pretty much it. The difficulty comes with how many variables there are: buildings, resources, money, debt, the black market, and other players. These variables interact in many ways, but never through direct conflict. It's pretty clear that the inspiration behind OTC was board gaming, and there are ways in which it feels like a board game at times. But computers are capable of more calculations than humans which, coupled with the fact that so much thought has gone into the intricacies of the economic system, makes building an economic empire both very rewarding and enormously fun.Multiplayer is balanced extremely well. All of the game-breaking exploits have been quashed by this point, and watching streams of the very best players makes it apparent that it's careful consideration of options, and not raw APM, that's rewarded in this game. This fact alone makes it almost unique within the genre, and as a result I can't recommend this game highly enough. There are enough active players in the ranked queues at the time of writing that you'll pretty much always get a game, and that will be improved further when you (yes, you!) buy it and start playing. So off you go.Oh, and the guy who made it is the guy who made Civilization IV, which is the best Civ game to date by a long way. He knows how to make games.			"

												I really enjoy this game. Ultimately the game ends when all other corporations (your opponents) have been bought. You buy and sell ressources to satisfy your needs and make money. Market prices vary in real time with supply and demand. You can even buy shares in others and reap on their profit. It's a nice combination of strategy, building and economics. The tutorials are thorough and you can play skirmishes, campaigns, daily challenges, multiplayer, etc. The game is smooth and polished. Highly recommend it!			"

												Fun  game, not as much depth as I was hoping for. The tutorial is great and gives you a solid over view of the different factions, but after that and a normal play through of the campaign Im not really chomping at the bit to go back in for more. It starts to feel a little grindy after the first few missions and has a basic arcady feel to it that makes it fun to pick up and play and easy to master, but doesnt lend itself to extended game play. Worth a play if you like colony/space/economic sims but just dont go looking for much in the way of dynamic game play.			"

												Highest recommendation.  The last games I played more than 50 hours were (not coincidentally) Civ IV and Starcraft 2.  This game is completely different and yet reminds me of Civ IV in some way I can't identify.  Basically, the implication in the game's blurb is dead on:  if you loved Civ IV, you'll probably love this.I believe you will also love this game if you are a more macro-oriented RTS player.There are 3 changes which would further improve it.  These are serious, but their specificity should signal to anyone on the fence about buying it how damn good and deep the game is to begin with :(1) Precise ""colony"" demand function.  If for instance you pause the game, buy a block of 100 of a resource, then sell them back one at a time, you'll wind up with less money than you started with (was previously more but seems to have been changed).  There's some kind of error with the demand function, likely due to rounding/approximation of price, quantities or both.  It's a bit frustrating to know that you've lost some money if you buy something and change your mind or are on autosell for a good and decide to buy back.(2) AI behavior.  Generally, the AI is too aggressive against the player (or perhaps only to the player most ""ahead""), cutting off its nose to spite its face.     (a) Hacks.  An AI player will create a surplus in something you are producing/mining very profitably even when            the AI is also heavily producing/mining this as well.  This may even be their most profitable or most commonly produced good.     (b) Blackmarket.  In the campaign, near the end of the last day, the AI will still spend an exorbitant amount of money to slow down your production, well exceeding their direct benefit from lowering your stock price a small amount.     (c) The AI seems to always know you've attacked them when you do despite anonymity.  Further, if you retaliate to an initial attack of theirs they will re-retailiate, leading to a kind of ""arm's race.""      In short, each AI should be maximizing their own individual benefit instead of minimizing yours.  These are identical if it is 1v1, but I'm often ""ganged up on"" to an excessive extent when ahead in a game playing with several AI players.  It is an excessive extent not because I dislike it or feel it is ""unfair,"" but because it is to our mutual detriment.(3) The UI.  I generally play against the AI primarily and very slowly, with pausing, an efficient UI is a lower priority for me.  However, in the few multiplayer games I've played, I've been overwhelmed by the amount of mouse movement/clicking necessary (unlike, say, the macro components of Starcraft or better yet Supreme Commander).     Ideally, I should be able to create one set of hotkeys to select construction, patents, optimizations, hacks, launches, and blackmarket (e.g., numbers 1-6), and then, conditional on one having been selected, hotkeys for each option (e.g., research teleportation = ""T"", so researching teleportation could be done by pressing ""2"" then ""T"").  The fact that such a complicated system of hotkeys is necessary is actually a good thing, as it's due to the vast number of decisions the player can and must make at any time.     Lastly, a mini-map roughly indicating resources and opponent claim ownership (not simply completed structures you can see by tabbing) would make acquiring the information necessary for your decisions far, far more efficient.Let me reiterate that this is one of the best games I've ever played.  If you even suspect you may be the type of person who would enjoy it, invest the $40 or less for what may be hundreds of hours of rewarding gameplay. "

								I've played about 15 hours to get a good ""feel"" of the game.  It allows a lot of unique challenges and online play... you never know what you will see or different styles.  It took me a while to get through the tutorials but it was very helpful to have some success online.  The game is still being developed and should get better.  If you play the computer the AI is very hard to beat.  I wish the stock market was a little harder to ""buy you out"" but I think that may be to make the game not last a whole day.  Overall it's enjoyable if you like a business strategy.  I think if you like critical thinking this game would be something you would enjoy.			"

												Its a weird game to love. An RTS with units. A heavy economics board game played in real time. That said, this has to be one of the most enjoyably complex/simple games I've ever played. That is to say, the fundamentals of the game -harvest good- and then -sell good- or -convert good into a refined good for which to sell- are super easy, just that the ground moves under you so often you have to question if turning your water into food is worth it, as the price of water increases, whereas the price of food decreases as you sell it.Its a weird game to get someone into. I had the distinct pleasure of climbing up skill levels with fairly evenly matched friends, but its hard to learn when what works right now is almost assuredly going to be a terrible idea next time. All in all, most games end up with me spending the next day or so occasionally going ""OH. I totally should have just scrapped my iron production, bought a bunch of it off the market while it was cheap, and instead put down steel plants to convert that material, rather than fight for the flailing iron economy""A++ Would try to make all the space bucks again.

								This may be early access, but it's pretty much shippable now. That's saying a lot. It's fun. It doesn't sound like it would be. But this is one of the most addictive games I've played in a long time.It's RTS-like, but there's no direct combat. This is a purely economic game. Take a look at what resources are on the map, collect the rarer ones, sell them. Buy the ones that are more common.You win via hostile takeover (buying your opponent's stock up). When you lose, you get a $3 mil severance paycheck.The economy is awesome. Twelve resources is a lot to keep track of, and all of the prices fluctuate based on availability and how much people are buying/selling. Every game plays differently because of this. Steel tends to be fairly valuable, but the last game I played, it was the cheapest resource the whole game. Another game, the map had only 3 waters on it, and I camped on all of them. Monopoly!Player stock price fluctuates based on your assets, your income, and your debt. When you buy out another player, you get all of their assets. Which means that once someone buys out multiple competitors, the game is basically over, because there's no way to compete. While steamrolling someone usually is an annoying quality in games, it works well here, since once you reach that point, the game ends swiftly.I don't know what they're going to do before they ship the game. It's worth buying now. If it gets even better, this might be the first game I am hooked on since the early 2000s. "

								While limited in content (only a 406 MB download on windows atm), this is a promising little trading game with a hopefully bright future. You get to choose from 4 different classes of corporation to play from. Standard capitalists, Robots, Scavengers and Scientists. They each have a very different play style that works for them, for example Robots don't require food or water to survive, meaning they can focus right away on resource gathering. You can't just throw down a load of buildings to gather what you need right away, you have to 'claim' ground and resources to gather them, and you can bid against other corporations or upgrade your head-quarters to get more 'claims'. To win a game you have to buyout your opponents corporation, this gets harder as the game goes on, and the surviving corporations get bigger and more effective, but a single campaign could last maybe a couple of hours.  rapid expansion, careful selling and buying of goods, and sometimes abit of espionage can soon become formulaic. For example I've only spent about 4 hours, and I've manage to figure out how to win every time with the Robot faction (haven't won much with the other 3 yet)IF the dev's add more to the game then I could see a lot of re-playability in this game, but at the moment its limited, and you may wish to wait while the price tag drops a bit, I kinda regret getting this at £26 (that was with a 10% discount). Wait a few months, see what the price is like, see how much its changed, and I'll come back and do a second review of the updated version.			"

The game was still very good when it only offered it's core mechanics, now with a fresh coat of paint it feels and looks even better now. All there is left is to leave it in the community's hands now.I'm a little impatient with the PvP, but it's starts slow for a reason.If you like Civilizations, you'll probably like this game as well... but for completely different reasons.

Coming from classics like Age of Empires and Civilization, I find this is a nice blend of everything I love about strategy games. Quick SummaryPros:- Deep economic simulation and strategy- Ever changing and dynamic games- Stellar soundtrack, to be expected of Tin- Quicker matches makes multiplayer actually feasibleCons:- Could use a bit more content (better total stats, unique scenarios other than campaign, better multiplayer functionality)- Price is a bit steep, especially when comparing to games with unbelievable amount of content and quality such as the Civ seriesOverall I recommend this game for its price point though and that mostly has to do with the fact that there is no game quite like it.

												[Intro] Had a bit of difficulty deciding between yay or nay, gave it a bit of consideration. The idea is interesting and not explored enough, so I felt very tempted to recommend solely on the premise of having a more diverse RTS scene. The decision rested on how they delivered on what they tried to achieve and promised. [Justification] It's not an interesting RTS (though i might be proven wrong if in a couple of years we see this game played competively, which I doubt). The way it is now, you'll have a difficult time playing on the higher levels until you find exploits that break the game. You won't become good at gaming an interesting rulset against an interesting opponent, you'll try to become good at beating the way the game was designed. Is not well balanced out and doesn't have an interesting AI, though people who might like '90s ""challenging"" (punishing) AI might want to give this a go for all times sake. The difficulty levels are simple starting penalties, which shows how little good gameplay is ""rewarded"" the player who makes the least mistakes wins, it should be more than that and I can't see it. There are 4 factions you can play as, they're not symetrical, but not well balanced out for asymetrical gameplay either (and they're not all that different). The robotic faction seems to be the obvious choice at the moment, the rest that are introduced later to the player will make your own playthrough more and more difficult, not different. Why would one not choose the faction that offers the easiest win when playing a skirmish match? Disclaimer: I caped at medium difficulty. I don't feel motivated to continue learning the game to beat the game. The economics. Aah, this should have been what made the game. Does the game make some interesting commentary about economics in RL, in video games or gives us an interesting mechanic through which the player might learn something useful about how economy works? No, none of these. The game uses very basic supply/demand system to set dynamic prices, which is cool as an idea. But there's no background simulation of why these resources are really needed, the demand is neither believable and allows for fluctuations which are actually based on supply alone and RNG demand. Boooooring. This is one of the objective reasons why one may argue that the game has no depth. [Others] Many talked about the price. I agree, it's too expensive for what it has to offer. I played the game and don't plan on purchasing content for the game. However, I wanted to avoid this and focus on how well the game delivers what it set out to accomplish. I'm also annoyed with the low res textures, gimmickey animation, almost like in a facebook game (though many liked the style for some reason). The campaign doesn't offer any compelling backstory, it just allows you to experience what the game has to offer a little bit more gradually. [TL;DR] The game has an interesting idea, but it's not very well delivered. It's worth trying out, but then you have to consider if it has enough value to offer to you.			"

												Game seemed interesting from initial look into it, but grew old after a very short period of play. One of few games of the Space/Sim/Strategy Genre that I can hardly even get through an hour of play. Ended up quite disapointed partially due to the fact that I generally enjoy games published by StarDock, but this one just feels lacking.In short the game falls short of what I expect from a strategy or sim, largely due the fact that each ""match"" is more like a 10minute skirmish. I tend to enjoy a bit more of a build up to my strategy/sim and see how things play out. Rather then just rush to buy out the competitors in a 10min rush to the finish.Overall give it a 3/10Pro -- Seems polished, encountered no bugs.Cons -- Lack of overall content, not much to do and strategy is quite simple. Feels more like a flash game. (Maybe worth trying if the game was alot cheaper, at time of review it was 25% off for $29.99, but this just feels expensive for what it includes)			"

								Economy game without combat, umm thats not exactly true, there is still certain type of combat in the game, the rivals will still attack you in certain ways so if you want a economy game without combat this is not it.The game is fun though, but sadly can be short lived, there simply isnt much depth here and for 35? no way.The updates are agonizingly slow and does shows signs of perhaps being abandoned.I am going to give this a down vote for the following:Lies about the game not having combatThe games are too arcadeyThe price, man the price for this is steep, really steepThe lack of work on this title, i have seen little updates since it hit EA.I have 6 hours of play and i have done it all, there is just nothing here for this insane price, the game needs so much more content and work to justify even half of this price,			"

								It's a very nice trading game, having played it quite a bit I can see the potential. The only thing that needs a bit polishing is the endgame, stock prices and buyout options doesn't seem to accurately reflect the actual value of the company. But to be honest, this is an early access game so this will probably get improved :)Edit: after playing a bit more I must say the endgame needs a lot of work, personally I would like to see it become more of a challenge.... but now it's just sell as many resources at the best possible price and buyout your competitor before they do that to you. I would hold off purchasing this game until they have fixed these problems and make the game more interesting in the later stages.			"

								Great concept, awesome potential.Still some rough edges but it is very much playable with full single and multiplayer. It plays like a semi fast paced RTS game without the heavy micromanagement. But not as slow as games like Anno 2070 for example.Very good for an early access title.			"

								Offworld was a great game in early access and it's still a good game but the price tag needs to come down as the playerbase is next to nothing. I still play it every now and then but it's nothing so exciting to justify the price. I hope the developers listen to their playerbase and put greed aside. If you have money to spend it's worth checking out, however if not wait for a sale...or it to die out.			"

								It's an early access game and by that it means it's no where finished. Hopefully they will make the game good as the price tag feels ""little"" to high. It should have been between $15 and $20 (max) for what you get (not much). Let me bring up some things I feel about the game:1. It's to few resources in many games which do so it's highly frustrating when you can not build new stations as most are already taken, you can not build more because you need to upgrade your main base and the only thing you do is more or less waiting, waiting and waiting some more. Huh!2. It feels really frustrating very often because in the beginning it's very stressful game as you need to take good spots asap before the quick AI who can instantly do it. In the end game it feels the reverse... boring as the only thing you do is more or less are waiting until you have enough cash even when you have sold most of your resources to be able to buy something new. It's a waiting game in the end.3. It feels also the AI has full control (100% of the time) over your economy. As soon as you get enough money to buy AI out he increases his buyout price. So it feels really frustating and you start to ask yourself if AI is sheating which is not so enjoyable.4. It looked fun when the devs played it but sadly it wasn't. However I think the game can have potential if they make it more fun in all areas. Was bored of it already after some hours, but forced me to play it just to see if I have missed something which can be fun. The campaign could have been much more fun than it was. But it's hard to see what they can improve to make it more fun. It felt like I bought a shell with no fun content. It felt like a work to play the game. "

Fun as defined by repetitive actionSo why recommend with a title like that? Cause the game can still be fun, if not a constant repeative action at end game.  The methods on how you overly strategize towards the end can vary, mostly in how the map generates, how quickly your enemy deploys/expands and the various methods they use against you and vs versa.  But the end becomes nearly the same; sell resources at high prices before the other player/AI - so you have enough dosh to buyout the other player, because they certainly are about to do it to you! (You see an ever increasing % sign next to their name, telling you of your impending doom).A hair raisingly good timeWhile the game does raise the stakes and cause you to panic, the game is short lived. You may think ""Fast paced gameplay that has relatively quick matches Amora? That's good!"" but granted, that isn't a good thing... unless you like that sort of thing.  I'm more of a stock that enjoys the time it takes to get somewhere, and admiring my crushing blow towards my opponents or their epic schoolin' they lay down teaching.  I could  list a plethora of games that follow this suit, but you may already get the idea.So, purchase this game if:Enjoy StrategyLove live action cat and mouse; chess stylized market manipulationsFast paced, hair raising gameplayDo so ever love repetitive end game experiencesRemember, Bunny loves you <3 "

Posted: May 9, 2016
												Overall, this RTS game is a refreshing take on a familiar concept: Corporate Warfare as Alien Colonization RTS.  I've been playing it now for three days, and overall - I really like this game.  My only issue is that it seems the devs really took a few shortcuts that seem to show, the sort that you might not see in a release from one of the more established publishers. First, typos - you'll see them in the game and referred to in discussions.  Seriously, guys - if you can develop a game you can spell check.  Just lazy IMO.Second, balance - the game does not seem balanced between the difffering factions nor with the AI.  So far it seems to be either very easy to win, or impossible to win.  There are a lot of ""moving parts"" in this game - i.e. a lot of resources, upgrades, and attack options via the ""black market"" and hacker array to contend with, and no matter what you do the AI will make all the necessary calculations much faster than a human to determine the best strategy to win.  Devs have said this isn't true in discussion, but with respect they understand the game differently than a new user and they should listen to the criticisms.Third, font/resource icon size - there are many instances when the fonts are honestly nearly too small to read.  Anyone who might need reading glasses (not just middle-aged gamers like me) will find it hard to read numbers, which is pretty important given this is a game of corporate warfare and espionage.  Seriously, make the fonts/resource icons like 10-15% bigger and it's much more playable.Fourth - there seem to be issues with multi-player, but I cannot speak to that specific complaint because I've not yet attempted to get into a MP game, but read the discussions if you want to learn more on MP bugs.That said, I'm confident that future relases and patches will address these issues, and one of the best features in my opinion is the lean and effective use of code.  I was THRILLED to see that it only took up a little over 2G on my MacBook AIR.  I'd strongly consider this title if you're a fan of any of the Civ games, as well as C&C or other RTS titles. "

												One of the most complex resource management games I've ever played.What I found charming about the game is how it simulated not just the basics of economics but it had elements of consumers, terrain (including weather effects), sourcing and patents. Players are also able to manipulate some of these factors through the 'black market' basically debuffs or buffs you can buy on a periodic basis.Not counting for daily challenge or multiplayer, there are essentially 2 game modes. Skirmishes are 1 off rounds where all buildings are available and your goal is to buy off the shares of your competitors to win.If you like progression then campaign mode is pretty nice. Instead of buying your oponents, you buy buildings for the settlers on the colony to win which would also help you tamper with supply and demand (Personally I built more houses so I could drive the price of food and oxygen up lulz). it adds a little more depth to the game as you do not own every building and would have to choose which buildings you'd like to acquire or upgrade though the downside is that this mode lasts for only 7 rounds.TL:DRFairly complex with a variety of strategies to win and ♥♥♥♥ over your oponent that doesn't make you rage quit. Realistic resource manager cause it adheres to a lot of basic business and economics principles. "

												8 out of 5 starsI watched several Let's Play videos before making this purchase. I was skeptical because I am not a mathmatically inclined individual. I am among the 5 out of 4 Americans who struggle with basic fractions. In the end, I took a chance and have not been disappointed. I played a skirmish and then went through the tutorial to get a better grasp on the mechanics of the game. Both experiences were fantastic. The humor and thoroughness of the tutorial made it one of the best I've ever played. I have yet to dive into the campaign, but am eager to master OTC. What I've experienced already is enough for me to recommend it without hesitation.Now, off to Mars. There's silicon in them there hills![UPDATE]With more time spent in game, I have only further applause for the title. Great buy.			"

								The game is a lot of fun, there's a learning curve for this type of game until you get the basic hang of it (31 hours of play until my first win). The UI is fine to me, could be refined or polished up later on. The graphics are decent in that they're not childish looking, but colorful and well done without being too detailed and distracting from the real content. Another great added feature is the customization of gameplay options.  Map size, location, resource amounts, black markets and many more options available to pick from.The factions are great and seem well balanced on the surface, until technology and research are conducted with some factions  gaining a very strong edge. Some technology can compliment a faction weakness very well or enhance upon current factional strengths.Gameplay can be quick and brutal, once you've mastered the learning curve you can be just as brutal. After 31 hours of gameplay trying different factions, and tactical approaches I won. OTC will eventually unleash your inner mastermind when you learn which Black Market sabotage to use on the leader of the pack to keep them in check and in debt. Low on power? Go steal some. Combination tech and sabotage can render great net returns with the correct amount of timing.---My only negatives are not knowing what the sound effects mean and the exact location of my affected colony. I feel like Factional structures should have an easily identified signature look rather than a colored border. It seems there's only one way to win and that's... Offworld Trading. Every game feels like a race to Offworld shipment rockets where other rts have multiple methods for obtaining victory.If you're looking for something fun and different with 30 minutes to kill, this game will please. I bought the game even after reading the negative reviews and was able to overlook the smaller details.			"

												A unique game which invovles resource gathering and quick decisions about numbers. I enjoy economic simulators, so this was pretty high on my list of games to get. I don't like how formulaic it can be though. It's similar to RTS games like Starcraft in that there is a certain build at the beginning of the game, as well as midgame and endgame strategies. (which is kind of a turnoff for me). But a round is relatively short, which is a plus in my eyes, because nothing is worse than playing an hour into a game just to lose. I was hoping more along the lines of a space-themed Capitalism II, but it's much more like Starcraft minus the fighting. (Sorry, I haven't played multi-player; this review is strictly for the single-player experience).+ Not many number crunching games, so this was a welcome entry.+ Plays very quickly, if you're spending more than a few seconds looking at the screen without clicking, you're probably going to lose.+ Good replay value.+ Good production value.- AI can be pretty difficult.- Even if you're well positioned, you can lose instantly if you don't pay attention to your stocks.- At the time of writing, the game is still going for about $40 which is a pretty steep price.8/10 Won't appeal to everybody, but a much needed entry in economic gaming~			"

But the performance is not so good, I'm getting a decent frames on high settings well that's not a big issue yet, the game just got out and it's in early access so hopefully the developers will come up with that.

								Well,  in it current state the game is rather easy and broing after a few hours of play.  I was excpecting a little bit more even from the alpha release. Winning is not winning as it is a mass scramble to buy up more claims, expand your base and build up your tradebale items.  For the price point I was expecting more options of trading, pipe lines and more detailed process to extract your resources from the ground. everything in between is automatic(bring in and return of resources). Maybe adding ship building may help to add a little more flavour and to add more depth to collection of resources.  To me it seems you need more stuff to do, and less about the capitalist pig system we live in today. Buying out your competion is fun but it should be a little less predictable and more random events.  Sabotage and goons are a nice addition but I find it very lack luster and overall not that interesting.   I was expecting this game to have more options, pipelines, trains, space stations to deliver your items to and be able to ship out from to earth or other planets. over al I cant really reccomend this game in its current state, Especially at $40.00 price point, feels like 10-20 at most would have been sutiable.  And this is a small game, not a grand strategy I was hoping for. I enjoy no armies in it just, need more things to do to keep my brain in the game.    Pros-- Great concept - Graphics ok   cons- lackluster overall gaming experience - lacks in depth realistic  resouce gathering, mining, and processing. - Very basic layout and buiuldings. Overall roll the dice if you want, I waited for a few months to get this game - I have been following it on the internet - and now what it has been released - slightly dissappointed more then I was happy. But hopefully this game will have new features added and the game will get more in depth - I will update later after a few more hours. ( I WISH THEY HAD A NEUTRAL BUTTON)  not no or yes - But i will go with no !			"

												I played through the tutorials, which took me over 2 hours to finish, so I was past the refund time. Game modes unlock as you finish the tutorials. Since I knew I had to keep the game, I made sure to play it for what it was worth. Turns out that was about a week of fun before the charm ran out.I expected the game to have some of the dynamism of Civ 4, with more economics, since Soren Johnson was the lead on the game. It turns out to be a fast, pausable real-time game where you mine, buy, sell and turn into about 3 products. Matches run about 15-30 minutes depending on game type (campaign, skirmish, multiplayer), or end more quickly if you make an oversight in your production. Your AI opponents are trying to get the upper hand on the market and drive you out of business. Both the player and AI can corner the market on resources and production, and play dirity tricks to steal from or knock the competition's production offline. You can also upgrade production techniques and patent methods to give you an edge in making your products. The winner buys out all of the competition, forcing them to become subsidiaries.Graphics wise the game uses sharp, simple graphics with a bright, almost neon palette. It is easy enough to see what is going on once you get used to watching ships shoot across the map carrying cargo. Outliners for sales, resources, and production are visible and easy to use. There are a number of voiceovers to events in the game, such as a company losing stock, a disaster, or industrial accident. Most of them use a pretentious tone, and they sound off regularly to inform you of the happenings of the map. The voices do not seem consistent to the AI personalities, and I got tired of hearing ""Screw with us, and we'll screw with you"" and its ilk after about the 20th time I heard it in a match.Since I didn't like the game enough, I never tried multiplayer. If you were hoping for a deep simulation and a wide sprawling market where you plan and plot over time, this isn't your game. Its a short, well-designed game that plays at the pace of a casual title. Campaign mode can be fun, because it lets you acquire and keep upgrades between matches. Skirmish mode is a place to practice and find out how not to lose. It took me about 8 hours to understand the flow of the game and how to win. Just remember the tutorials take a lot of time, so if you don't like it in the first hour, you may want to seek a refund. I may get bored enough to return to the game one day, but the frenetic pace and short playtime just does satisfy as much as winning or losing in another game of thoughtful planning.Pros:The AI is smart and know how to play the game well on standard difficultySharp, if cartoonish graphicsRobber-barons on MarsCons:Short playtimeAnnoying, inconsistent voiceoversLots of critical thinking, QUICKLY!

												Ahead: I personally do not find this game to my taste. It's just not the genre i like.On the surface it looks like a base building sim. However, as the legendary Diablo review by ActionButton showed eloquently, sometimes what looks like a game of chess can actually be a round of Street Fighter.OTC is like that. It may look like a base building sim, but it only looks like that insomuch Street Fighter looks like a Jump'n Run.Important things that differentiate it from classical base building sims: The amount of buildings you can build is highly limited. I think somewhere around 20 total. You're not expected to build a huge base and never remove any of it, in fact, you're supposed to keep changing and modifying your base to meet the market's needs for the 13 resources. Just like in combat, standing still means death. There's also very little to do on the base level other than building/bulldozing producers and upgrading your HQ. All the interaction between the bits of your base are automated.In short: The base is only your gamepad with which you engage on the actual battleground, which is one that is extremely high speed.The actual battleground consists of selling resources when prices are high, producing or buying when they are low, managing whatever debt you have, in order to make enough money to use super abilities to disrupt enemy activities to drive them into ruin, or straight-up buy them out on the stock market.The speed of all of the above is increased by prices (resources/stock) reacting immediately to any action taken by any player in a match. If you react a split second too late, your huge pile of electronic chips may be worthless because your opponent dumped theirs first.This is not a game of base building.This is a game of high frequency trading simplified to human scales.

												If you like economic games with elements of building factories and buying stock, this game is for you. SP is well done, although for awesome campaign I would recommend buy also DLC. MP is bread and butter of this game for me. It’s very fast, cruel and unforgiving, just like in the real-world. Learning curve is pretty high but once you manage to identify basic rules, you will be just fine. Definitely not game for everyone and I would like to see more people playing it but those players who fall in love with this game, as me, will agree with me that this game is masterpiece. Check forums for Discord link, almost entire community is there, creating friendly tournaments and casted games between each other.			"

												Capitalism in space! I have been putting off buying Offworld Trading Company, OTC, for a while. It was on  sale so I thought I would buy it at half price. Why did I wait so long? What a great game!I don't think it would be possible to win the game by playing fair. That is not the offworld capitalist way.I will update this review as I play more but so far I have to say how good it looks with loads of replayability.			"

												I purchased this game back when it was in early Alpha, and did a majority of my playing then.  I played some more late into the Alpha and was happy to see that while changes had been made, it was still a fairly fun non-violent game.  I recently noticed that it had reached ""completed"" status and decided it was time to give it another try.Graphics wise - the game is in a much better place then it was during Alpha.  It eats noticably more system resources than before but with good reason, the buildings and terrain is much more detailed and pleasing, and turning down the graphic settings is always an option.Gameplay wise - After only a few minutes of playing again I already felt fatigued.  It felt like gameplay hadn't changed at all since the Alpha, so I was just doing what I remembered doing then: play your factions strengths/advantages and try to buyout companies.  I did notice in the one Skirmish that I played that some rules had been changed around.  I now had to complete a Skirmish to access the Campaign despite almost all of my Alpha play being in the campaign's different iterations.  But hey, a skirmish to learn is better than a hand-holding tutorial so why not.  During the skirmish I bought out one of the competing companies, but that companies assets didn't become mine (as they previously did in the Alpha), so I spent over 1/4 of a million to buy a company that was floundering thinking I'd get to add it to my conglomerate and improve it.  WRONG.  Five minutes later I notice red numbers next to my biggest competator - he's getting closer and closer to buying me out, though I cannot help but notice he and the other still-standing competator both have over 200k in debt - I figure they must have to pay this off before doing anything major.  WRONG.  Considering that I was actually two companies worth over 4 million at that point, the opposing company that bought me seems to have gotten a great deal having only paid 3/4 of a million (on top of a few hundred thousand for some of my shares over the 30 minutes of play) to buy me out.Personally, I liked the Alpha better.  I probably won't bother trying to beat a skirmish to access the campaign (even though it's what I really want to play) largely because I'm not sure I agree with a lot of the game's rules.  Watching AI companies stockpile massive debt like it's a good thing and having no access to boughtout company assets is a real turn off for me.  Or maybe, like a lot of people say, I've just already played enough in Alpha to use up all the replayability of the game.A fun game, but not worth it unless it's on sale.			"

												Okay, so I'm far from the best to write a review on this game and that is because:1: I only have about 8.6 hours in game at the time of writting the review2: I'm not a big RTS playerSo with that in mind, I can give out my opininion about the gameThe concept of the game is great, the fact that you have to focus on trading more than fighting to claim victory is interesting. It brings a new kind of experience to the genre wich is a good thing. The whole mechanic of the game is based arround collecting and selling ressources to turn a profit and stack up capital, wich is then used to build more or buy stocks in opposing companies in order to buy them out. Great concept in general.So the concept is great, but what about the gameplay? Well that too is pretty good, now if I could I would make some interactions less troublesome but since I haven't taken the time to go bind my keys I can't blame the game for not having something it might have. Other than a few annoying things the gameplay is all you could ask for, it is slow paced but that is normal from the very nature of the game.So concept and gameplay are good, but is it worth the price? I personnaly bought it when it was in early access so I got ~16 CDN$ worth of DLC for free, now that includes the Soundtrack DLC and the Real Mars Map Pack DLC, but with that aside i'm only reviewing the game itself, not the DLC. I can say I'll have enough fun to make it worth the 39.99 USD$ I payed for it when steam didn't have the CDN$ shop. Current retail price in CDN$ is 43.99 and I can say I would gladly have payed this price aswell. Now, the campaign has it's own share of goodies but it isn't a story based campaign like Star Craft and War Craft had, it's more like a few skirmish rounds on different maps with different objectives. I am in the middle of my first one so i can't tell you all about it but it gives you different ways to play the game wich in the end adds to the value. The standard skirmish is great and is the most fun for me. I can already assure you that it was worth my money in those almost nine hours.[EDIT] I just finished the campaing and it was incredibly satisfying. Definitely doing a few others soon!So my final verdict, if you already play RTS games and love them then go give it a try! The whole economic twist will make you play something you never played before. If you are new to RTS games in general this isn't a bad palce to start. You'll find the more military based ones just as good when you get to them, plus if you are having trouble starting there is a 91 pages almanac to help you get the hang of the game.My rating? 9/10, 90/100, 18/20, 4.5/5Hope this review was useful to you! If so, please let me and steam know right below in the: Was this review helpful corner.If you are looking for a good match jsut add me up and I'll buy you out anytime!With all of this said I'll end it here and let you all go: save humanity, turn a profit, preferably both.CmD0_ out			"

												This game can be both intense and boring at the same time. The boring part is that after you play couple of skirmishes you see repetition in the experience. It reduces the boring factor with an interesting variety in single player campaign, but it feels like it is lacking a ""game"". Knowing this, I still recommend this game since the potential of customized variety is good one.			"

												I have given this game a recommendation, but I wouldn't call it a complete or total recommendation as there are some parts of the experience that didn't really meet my expectations.The good:  The game tutorials are humorous and the gameplay is interesting enough. I would call it a resource management game or 'an RTS without troops' if that makes any sense.  I like it overall.The bad:  I bought this game to play as a co-op experience and that's why I thought it came with a free 2nd copy - to play with a friend!  Turns out that there is no co-op campaign and it's basically just multiplayer skirmishing against AIs or other humans that can be considered cooperative.  I wish games would stop being labeled as co-op if they only have it in the multiplayer mode - that should be called multiplayer co-op or something to differentiate the two.The ugly:  The single player mode is well designed and has some very interesting mechanics but it's damn short.  It hardly feels like the mechanics of planning your company and investing your personnel while managing your cash flows have a chance to amount to anything over the few chances you get to make choices.  It feels like they cut the single player down to the shortest allowable length, which is too bad as it has potential.I recommend this game but be aware of the above.			"

												A deep RTS that requires more skill and strategy than a high ATM.Offworld Trading Company had been on my wishlist for a while before I decided to buy it but I am so pleased I bought the game.Some reviews stated the game was to simple or shallow and this were the ones that made me think twice before pulling the trigger but this is one of the deepest games I have ever played and whilst it is very simple to pick up (thanks to a very good tutorial) its a very hard game to master.You have a few options when it cames to playing pick from the single player skrimish mode or campaign both of which provide a very hard to beat and smart A.I. and the campaign is endlessy replayable, a test your score against others daily challange and of course multiplayer.As the title states this is not a game where a high action per minute rate is the be all and end all but a game that requires a plan (a plan that you also might need to abandon ) and some forward thinking.All in all a great game that appeals to someone like myself who does not enjoy the more classic RTS games.

												I can really recommend this game.  First, I would like to say something about the negative criticism about the ""simple rules""  of this game. Indeed, the rules of the game are clear and not that difficult to learn. However, ""simple rules""  do not imply a simple game. I think this is not a simple game at all. You really have to think strategically about each choice you make, because you only have a certain amount of money to spent, a certain amount of building locations, a certain amount of resources... etc. You all have to balance that out and watch your opponent carefully. Besides playing a skirmish game against AI or playing a game in multiplayer, there is also a single player campaign. This campaign is not really story driven, but gives a twist on the standard skirmish game. After 11 hours of play, I barely touched it, because I am still trying to beat the AI  in skirmish on a higher difficulty level.This brings me to the next positive side and that is that there is a wide range of AI difficulty levels. On the lowest level, I find the game pretty easy. On ""standard"" AI (in which you and the AI do not get any bonuses, and so is the most fair game) I am still not able to win. The variety between the different skirmish matches comes from different resource availability, different resource locations, and also different factions. There are four different factions in the game, each play a bit differently.Even if you only want to play singleplayer I think this game has a lot variety and replayability to offer. I did not play in multiplayer at all yet. People that like strategy games will probably like this great game. So buy it!			"

												Offworld Trading Company is an excellent and unique rts. Every game play descion is narrowed down to things that really matter, and the game play is very interesting and dynamic. The soundtrack is amazing and the graphics are very descriptive.The single player campaign is an excellent difference of style from the skirmish and multi-player game. It's just as good single player as multi-player, and the ai is actually very good and definitely hard to beat. This is one game that really deserves more attention for such innovative and interesting game play. Absolutely reccomended.			"

												It takes a very classic RTS blueprint, collect resources destroy enemy, and removes military. So building a efficent resource gathering layout allows you to use the ""free market"" to vanquish your foes. Specialize and build high margins and quanity production. Or midigate risk though diversity, be self sufficent and use your profits of selling goods to buy other companies. The layout in game is star craft age of empires esque, but disimlar without the need for worker drones. This game is a wonderful game that plays fast and allows you to use caplitalism to destory other players..... it has great life lessons for business ;-) Buy this game just because it's so creatvie and groundbreaking.

Early Access Review
								Plays a bit like a real-time board game. Has a very futuristic-styled Monopoly feel to it. Once you play a few games, it becomes a little repetitive - there doesn't seem to be a lot of depth yet, but it is alpha.Games are very fast. Would be better if you could have longer games that aren't ended so quickly by buying out companies. Instead of this system, players/AI should self-elect to sell their shares, or be forced to when they're in debt because of another player's monopoly. This way, there will eventually be an end, but at least it won't be 5 minutes into the game where another computer player suddenly owns 5 companies, leaving it pretty pointless to continue playing.

												When i first played this game it was only for a few hours but I didn't quite get the hang of it. I saw one of the developers streaming  sometime later so I gave it another crack... next minute I am up at 4 in the morning still trying to beat the medium AI. Basically once you get into it, you realise the game has many different subtleties you can use to get the upper hand. Even the basic strategy of buy low sell high won't get you past the medium AI, thats both a testament to the skill of the AI but also the depth of strategy required to excel at the game. If you are a fan of RTS's I would definetly recommend checking this game out even if its just for a change of flavour.			"

The gameplay is interesting, and trying to figure out the right strategy for the map is fun. The learning curve seems to be a little steep though, so it might not be the right game for people looking for something quick to pick up and just try out. I have a little over 9 hours played, but still having trouble with the manager level tutorial, which is the default AI difficulty.			"

												This is quite a special game that does not fit into any conventional category. It's an RTS-like game but there are no combat units to manage. You win by out thinking your opponents (AI, in my case) by outplaying them in the commodity market. The game's premise is that you and a few other AIs are setting up shop in Mars. You race against each other to see who make the most money out of mining minerals in the planet. The more of certain minerals you sell, the price of the minerals will go down in the stock market. This manipulation of the stock market will enable you to influence the net worth of your company as well as your opponent's. You win buy buying the company shares, having a corporate take over. The action is pretty intense and yet, you can always auto pause to take a breather and think of your next strategy. Having high reflex and able to execute many actions per minutes does not matter here, this is not your usual RTS. And yet, the amount of excitement from creating espionage to influece the stock markets, causing the shares of your competitors to drop is very real. Each game is short, maybe an hour for each sitting, very useful for a quick fix before bed. Highly recommended!			"

												The tutorials made the game seem fairly straight forward and enjoyable. Then the skirmishes and campaign mode are an exercise in futility and frustration on even the default difficulty, removing any fun element to the game. AI instantaneously snag resources and then bombard you with a seemingly infinite number of overpowered black market tools to keep you under their heel. You can't even get a foothold in the campaign mode to make it a 'campaign'. There is a lot of information that needs to be conveyed in the game and it's done in a very clumsy and uninformative matter combined with a poor user interface.At least the art and music are great.

												Soren Johnson does it again.This is an excellent game. Keeping with the spectacularly high standards previously set by Johnson's earlier games (i.e. Civilization IV), he takes a genre- RTS- and completely reinvents it in a new, engaging and fun way- the economic RTS! Gameplay is addictive and systems are compelling to interact with. I love the art style and the game is both fun to play in single player and multiplayer in their own unique ways.

If not the best?...I decided to wait until it was released so I didn't burn myself out and could focus entirely on the core concept without being bored. Gladly I was right to do so, this game is awesome! Can not wait to put more hours into this game and become a master of trade!			"

								Great strategy game. Although it is early Alpha I found myself putting in almost 12 hours in the first day of owning it. After a while I got the hang of it and was organizing hostile takeovers in no time. What is there is pretty solid for the current game state and is sure to get deeper. I have found a few bugs here and there but the game only was release two days ago. So far I am very impressed and will update my review as content arises.			"

								This game is borderline complete honestly. Other than some balance issues and a better multiplayer lobby the game is rock solid. Buying out a company feels great when you finally get enough money, you have to constantly be watching the market and making moves to ensure the resources you have cost more and the ones you want are cheap or accessible.My only complaint would be I'd like to see clearer notifications for when sabotage is being done to my colony and it's facilities. Other than small icons and a single line of text in the bottom right, which is very small, you have no way of knowing. The audio queues are quite loud for many things in the game but not for sabotage, which seems odd.Other than that, having a ball so far. Looking forward to seeing how it plays out online.			"

								When I first saw this it looked promising, nice new RTS to play.I've been playing it for awhile now and all I can think is how I got fooled into dropping 35 bucks for this. The balance is practically non-existent, the AI seems to make horrifyingly bad choices and at times it seems like the game is straight up cheating as ridiculous as that may sound. A particular example of this happened in one game when the bot, finding itself roughly $80,000 in debt, suddenly and inexplicably, had it's stock-price nearly quadruple while it's debt only increased.It then proceeded to use it's newfound debt to buy me out in all of twenty seconds.Deciding that perhaps operating so far in the red that you're in the black must be how you do things on Mars, I tried a similar strategy only to be met with the bot making the same miraculous turn-around only a few days in.Setting aside the questionable balance for a moment, I'd also like to point out that the audio is almost impossible to understand at times. But I guess that's kind of a moot point considering the probables you're going to have to go through to play this miserable game.All in all? Save your money for a better game. Wishing I'd stuck to the ""avoid early access at all costs"" lesson I keep learning and ignoring...			"

												I would recommend this game with a caveat.I really liked the look of this game and I generally like tycoon style games so I thought I'd love this, but sadly I don't that much. I enjoyed the tutorial because it felt like a story, but once I got into the campaign it lost the story feel for me and felt a bit dry.It's a very well crafted game and they have tried to give it some character with the different corporations you can play as, but ultimately you have to enjoy business style resource management with a tight time pressure. For me I prefer something with a slower pace so I can sit back and watch my little ships flying back and forth, and consider my next move.			"

								Read the game description and take them at their word. This game is not like Anno xxxx or Planetbase. This game plays like Starcraft or Command and Conquer. This is fast paced strategy, and when it comes right down to it, there's not much difference between matching your attack type to an enemy's defence type and sabotaging your enemy's chemical production right when you notice a lot of players building labs all at once. But the latter for me feels more grounded in plausibility and ends up more fun. The only criticism I could have for an economic version of this type of rts gameplay is that when you are defeated, it is with an instant cash buyout. There are many interesting routes to that situation being possible, but when it happens there isn't much warning and then bam- you're out of the game. I don't even really mind that so much, though. When you're about to lose Starcraft you have to preside of the death of all your soldiers. This game rips the bandage off quickly, and your company becomes a subsidiary. I presume most of your workers even get to keep their jobs. I play the crap out of the daily maps. I haven't won one yet. 9.6/10			"

Early Access Review
								Cannot recommend the game at this time.  This game is brutally difficult, even on the lowest difficulty settings.  CPU players are far too aggressive (Think Civ 5 Ghandi meets the Red Skull) and do not seem to compete with one another.  There is a bug currently in the game that allows CPU players to purchase stock in your company even when they do not have the funds to do so.  The game also, apparently, gives stipends of cash to the AI player, resulting in an early game juggernaut.  Every game is a zerg rush - there is no long term strategic play in this game whatsoever.  Sabottage corporations in particular are incredibly frustrating to play against and their playstyle is one dimensional: to deny others the ability to play.  This is not a very good design for an RTS game, as there is no effective counter to this playstyle that is accessible at all during the early game.The CPU text-to-speech announcements get annoying very fast, especially the one voice that is barely understandable - I thought I had selected the wrong localization.  Overall, this is a great concept and the game could be fun, but for now the game is balanced such that it is just a mad rush with no real strategic depth or fun factor.  It needs more Sid Meier.Could this game be worth the money?  Eventually, maybe.  It isn't right now.  Hold off on this one.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is very enjoyable to play. The graphics and animations of the buildings are really great, it has a good playability experience in general. The game is exensive, as I don´t really feel there is that much to do just yet in Early Access, but having spoken to one of the developers it is obvious that they really care about the game, so I am looking forwards to see what they add to it in the future.I found the game either very easy, or very slow on the extreme ends of the difficulty spectrum, so I would suggest you start off on a mid range setting. Also don´t expect the AI´s to all gang up on you, they work on an every man for himself basis,which is more realistic.I would perhaps wait for the game to be on discount if you are tight on money, but if you are working and have cash go for it at full price.The game is very accomplished graphically, and with some more voice over work in the future I feel the sound would be equally good.I don´t like the tutorial system in the game, I find the teacher characters annoying, but then who really likes tutorials in any game anyway.All in all I would give the game a 7 out of 10 in its current form, needing more content to make the game longer and bigger to score higher, but overall worth a look even if just for the cool animated buildings and atmosphere of the game.For the developers, here is what I would hope to see with this game in the future:- More buildings. It would be cool if you could have 12 or so more buildings. My recommendations would be: A Biodome (food), Shield Generator (black market defence, e.g. emp), Casino (pleasuredome clone), Landing Station (for importing materials or tourists), Gold/Diamond/Valuables mine (profit generation), variants of the existing buildings.- Larger maps, I feel the current map, even the large one is too small.- A sandbox mode without claims, where you can spread accross the map.

If the black market isn't available it's becase you have too much debt. I like the ballance and the fact no two games are the same. However they can be the same if you want. The AI is a challange to beat. Real players even more so. After finishing the tutorial I would suggest playing single player skirmish games starting with the weakest AI and boosting the AI up each time until you lose a game. I can see this game becoming a time sink. Be sure to get your stuff done BEFORE booting this one.			"

High replayability as every game will be different depending on the availability of resources and price movements driven by the actions of other players.

The game forces you to go online.Cons:The music will get repetitive on score and menu screens.Sometimes you can't get a quick match late at night.You'll want to convince your friends to buy it.			"

												not your usual RTS, dont buy this with the idea of fighting a conventional war for resources, this baby right here is strictly pure economic warfare with a little help from less than reputable characters. It's definitely worth a play, I haven't tried the DLCs yet so i have no idea if its actually worth it but it does strike me as a bit early for this game to have so much dlc. The writing and art style are similar to Red Alert 3 in terms of cartoony heavy inked rendering, the writing is good though and makes the game feel way less serious than it can become in a skirmish. For the sale price of 14 bucks definitely a decent game but i feel its got a bit ways to go in terms of content before the full price matches the gameplay.			"

Playing in skirmish mode allows you to hit the reset button for the same exact map seed as many times as you need to win. Another great thing is the four factions in which to choose from. They add a plethora of playing styles and ways to win. Lastly the A.I. is tough, tough enough to kick my♥♥♥♥♥on medium diffuclty with my 32 hours of play time. To some it up, this game is deep in strategy, complex in difficulty, and incredbly fun in succes.			"

If you're looking for a narrative or something closer to Civ, go elsewhere--but keep this in your library when you're ready to stretch your brain a bit.			"

												Delightful, nice soundtrack, pleasant graphics. Gameplay boils down to trying to get an edge over your competitors in the marketplace of buying/selling/producing goods. You win by out-maneuvering your opponents using sound financial judgements and/or sabotaging the competition with dirty tricks.Great casual speed, also - you can complete a game in about an hour if you don't pause the game much. Makes for nice sessions.			"

												This game is fun, challenging, and rewarding, even when you lose. Its kinda fun to see how much you're worth to someone else after you lose a close match. Most matches run about half an hour, sometimes more, sometimes less. The whole game is about market manipulation until you can buy out your competitors, hostile-take-over style. Which makes agressive actions almost a necessity. I once bought a guy out because he was relentlesly attacking me. I had to liquidate EVERYTHING to do it. I was saving to go after the bigger fish because he was already moving on my expensive stock. But once I secured my safety, and no longer losing my money makers, I was able to restock while the market recovered from my stockpile dump, Which allowed me completely dominate the market the rest of the match. But that moment of indecisiveness almost cost me, and Ive lost to that same move before. The action is there, and this game rewards you for clever thinking, but sometimes you gotta earn that win, they wont always hand it to you.			"

Early Access Review
								A deceptively fast-paced economic, base-building strategy game with no military units.Offworld plays very well in a FFA environment, and I enjoy 6- and 8-player games regularly. It keeps you on your toes as players react to changing prices, trying to make profits. You need to be constantly asking yourself, ""what resources are the other players neglecting?"" It can become quite frenzied in the end game as you buy up a couple other players and suddenly you need to manage ~60 structures, trying to gain cash faster than your rivals, who are trying to buy out your company. Trash those Glass Furnaces, drop down Reactors, research Oxygen production because it's selling for 60k offworld. Your rival has more Offworld Markets; better sabotage his shipments or oxygen production...Every game is different with randomized maps and resource distributions. Black Market (aggressive abilities and other utilities) is also switched up. There isn't really a build order; need to look at the map and the other colonies to figure out the best overall plan, which will definitely change several times during the 20 min game.It's fun.			"

												Offworld Trading Company is an excellent game.  Simply put, it strikes the perfect balance between heavily detailed strategy and intuitive gameplay.  This allows you to begin enjoying the game from the off, but also to continue honing your skills for hours afterward.  Some negative reviews indicate that OTC gets repetitive quickly.  I disagree.  Although the main idea of the game remains the same, there are numerous factors that make every match entertaining in its own way.  Personally, I find it no more monotonous than turn-based strategy games like Age of Wonders or Civilization.In summation, Offworld Trading Company is a wonderful multiplayer or singleplayer game that I reccomend to anyone who enjoys RTS games.Overall: 9.2/10			"

												A unique, and endlessly replayable game. The skirmishes last 20-30 minutes, and play out differently every single game. The different companies are balanced, but it really makes a difference who you found an HQ with. The campaign is also good, though it lacks the adrenaline rush of buying out a competitor in the skirmishes. Overall, a great game. The interconnected nature of every decision really works.			"

								4x strategy without combat and Stephen Hawking doing the voice-over!Graphics serve their purpose, the interface is sharp and controls in general feel very polished. This looks and feels like Civilization 5. Just do yourself one favour: turn off both the music and the sound effects.It's a business game that offers a lot of macro economic goodness. Supply and demand at its core, resource shortage, bottlenecks, dirty tactics.This game offers the best a.i. I've ever seen and it's still far from finished. The a.i. doesn't cheat on low to medium difficulty settings and it still gives me a tough fight for my money.I'll give you an example what the a.i. did to me:I was totally reliant on my next two steel shipments. The a.i. evaluated my situation, hired pirates and intercepted those vital steel shipments. I went bankrupt because I was used to games offering poor a.i.. I was aware of the bottleneck in my supply chain. Hell, I'm even writing a paper on supply chain management RIGHT NOW! And the a.i. was set on the 3rd of 8 difficulty levels! This should have been a walk in the park.Well, I learned from it. After 3 hours of playing I'm pistol-whipping this little ******. I own the a.i. (on level 3 of 8). Now it's time to be a man and face it at 50% of its might. :DThe price:I got it on 50% summer sale. For 19 quid it offers fantastic value. I would go as high as 30. Wouldn't pay 40 though just yet. It's too steep for an early access game. Wait for a decent sale and get it if you enjoy economic games.The con:There's only one problem with the game and unfortunately it's a major one: the performance is sub par. The game is rather cpu-heavy. I got a decent system (i5-4660, gtx 960, 8 gb ram) which is way above min reqs. The cpu seems to be the bottleneck and it shouldn't be really. It's just a matter of poor programming (no multi-core support maybe?).-----------------------------------------Update: As of beta 4 the performance has improved significantly and is actually pretty good now.Update: The game is in beta 5 by now. Many improvements again. Farther zoom level, balance, more campaign features etc.Having played it for 45 hours now in total, I can easily recommend it. Still not burned out on it in any way.rating: 9/10			"

												If Command and Conquer impregnated Port Royal and they gave the genius child to Richard Branson to raise, this would be the result.NOTE: If your looking for another CIv or Anno, this aint'nt it. it is not casual, it is not friendly. this game means buisness. and.youll.need.to.think.(thank god)Ever Managed a company?If the answer is yes, then this will seem familiar.Dont get me wrong, its cartoonified and simplified, but its every bit as involved, with the management systems impeccably balanced between your own needs, your competitors needs and your balance sheet (as in real life).This is not particularly easy, and the game means what it says for its difficulty levels. Most games I see recently have it set so that easy means brain-dead, medium means easy peesy, hard means youll need to think etc, not so OTC. Of the 5 levels to choose from the 3rd (Apprentice, i think)  is recommended for anyone who wants to graduate to online, and the game will truly try to win and challenge you. I lost my first 2-3 games on apprentice, but after you have picked up all the tricks (underground nuking their minable resources is my personal favourite) youll always have a fighting chance if you stay focused and flexible. Ive seen several reviews claiming the game is too hard; it is challenging, and it definitely is not pick-up-and-play, but its not impossible (also go for an easier setting....) With that said it is a strategy game...think strategically and youll have a shot, go forward without a plan and the AI will punish you every time.My only worry is longevity, once you can reliably beat the computer time and again (even though its fun every time) the game does start to pall a little, and with the online systems untried for major usage, it worries me a tad.I wholeheartedly enjoyed this game, and if you enjoy strategy and games that force you to TRY then Im confident you will too. Its that beautiful balance...not quite like anything ive played before, but familiar enough to still feel like home.			"

												A tight, engaging game.  The AI is very challenging without having to cheat, which is a big plus for me.  Manipulating the market and trying to anticipate how each resource price will vary over the course of the game keeps me engaged.  Yes, this isn't like Civ where you're building an empire, which is good because it strips out a lot of the tedious ""build a library and granary in every city"" stuff.  In 30 minutes I can complete a memorable game.The campaign is also excellent.  Changing the rules in each scenario just enough to force you to try new strategies to win.  Highly recommended!			"

								i recommend this game. it is different from every other rts game right now. there is a learning curve,  as once the game starts it's pretty fast and furious. the plus is that on single player, you can pause it and slow down the game play and learn it. for instance when you need a resource that is not easily available or obtainable, you can develop a plan to obtain more, then resume play.This game is meant to be multiplayer! Solo is ok against the AI, but play it multiplayer and you will be hookedit's nice as the games aren't civilization length and the gameplay is pretty straightfoward and bug free. it is pricy at 35.00 + but when you figure games like dayz that are in the same cost neighborhood and are bug ridden and have horrible game play. this is a slam dunk. it shows that they did the right thing and developed it to a good point before releasing it on EA. I expect to put alot of hours on this.thanks Mohawksmooth gameplay, fun and highly recommended			"

								First Impressions:The art style is amazing, and very professionally executed, and the UI is intuitive and well designed for the most part. The tutorial series could explain how to manipulate prices/research etc a little better, but I figured it out in my first couple of games. One thing that I felt early on is that something was lacking, the game seemed a little shallow, but I believe that was because I hadn't been introduced to the rest of the game's features.Pros:- Beautiful graphics- Great performance- Extremely varied gameplay- Great learning/skill curve- You can turn on/off sabotage and other features and pick an appropriate skill level very easilyCons:- A little hard to get up to speed on- Several menus and UI elements are incomplete/hard to read- Gameplay seems somewhat shallow at this point (as of 5hrs of gameplay ;)- At $40 it is definitely overpriced, however I think $20 is reasonable			"

								Early Access ReviewIn his current state it´s hard to write an effective review but the game has true potential.The concept is easy and at the same time complex, you have two different modes of game, Quick Play and Campgain, and until now I managed to fully understand the standart game. You start with an unrevealed mapand you have X scans(you will receive more over the time) to use and scan for resources, after you´re first scans you will definetly find some resources and the call is yoursShould I place my HQ here or do I keep scannig for(maybe) a better place? Of course that these depends on the type of HQ you will play with. The 4 HQ´s are Expansionists, Robotics, Scavengers and Scientifics and each one of these have a distinct way of operating. Once you place your HQ it´s time to put down your buildings, but chose carefully because you have a limit and you have to place them in a way where you won´t be in a HUGE debt right at the begining of the game. After you spend all the claims you willprobably want more and you need to upgrade you HQ. It takes some resources so be careful! After all these steps it´s time to make the ""big ones"" and try to ""buy"" your opponents, and make sure that you are not bought otherwise its Game Over for you.You can always use some dirty tricks to slow down your opponents or really just wreck them,it´s called Black Market and you want to use it for sure!The multiplayer is amazing(no problems until now) and for those who like ""tension"" this is the perfect game. Always be careful and never try to be the owner of every resourceor you´re gonna get: (nuke/EMP/dynamite/many others)ed and believe me you do not want to be that guy on the match.And thats pretty much the concept, of course that it´s not fully explored or working perfectly and that´s why it is an Early Access game.General:Now:7/10When released:8.5/10 or (hopefully) 9/10			"

While this game is pretty fun in single player it really shines in multiplayer. As someone who plays a lot of 4x and strategy games with friends, this game is a blast. It's something completely different which I'm always on the hunt for.The game is you play a company on mars and you are trying to snag the resources you can and make money, all while buying out the other players. But it goes deeper than that. You only have so many claims for resources, and distance from your base makes a serious difference. Sabatoge adds a whole other layer to the game as well and is probably my favorite part! Nothing like completely shutting down another players supply chain and listening to them curse. It still needs some balancing, for example, the off world trade center seems almost too powerful, and a save function and maybe a minimap would be nice.  But the game honestly feels finished and if someone didn't know it was EA, I don't think they'd guess.			"

Sabatoge adds a whole other layer to the game as well and is probably my favorite part! Nothing like completely shutting down another players supply chain and listening to them curse. It still needs some balancing, for example, the off world trade center seems almost too powerful, and a save function and maybe a minimap would be nice.  But the game honestly feels finished and if someone didn't know it was EA, I don't think they'd guess.			"

								Its an alright looking game but it's not ready as the early access title describes. There is potential for a space based trading game but I feel that they limit themselves too much; Pirates are scarce, there are no ""aliens"" or life forms to disrupt resource mining, only one planet and the difficulty levels are too extreme for casual players. If you want a nice and relaxing game then this is not for you as rapid expansion and seizing of choice mining plots are essential to win with no room for error on the ""minimal"" difficulty setting. Oh and the other corps are constantly sabotaging you, kind of looses its novelty after the 40th time in a mission. This game is near impossible to win a single match which will turn casual players away. On the other hand if you like your @$$ handed to you multiple times and squeezing out a win then you are a sadist and this is the game for you!			"

								Not sure why I bought this. So you know how some RTS games with an economy focus let you sell off spare resources to get other stuff you need? It's basically that game, except you win by selling enough resources to buy out your opponents. There isn't any reason to build an economy beyond that goal. As a free-market capitalism tutorial I guess it's educational, but it probably would have made a better board game than a videogame.As for the state of the alpha right now, balance is pretty wonky, such as lower-valued companies can easily and unpreventably buy out more valuable competitors off the back of a single off-world shipment plus a little commodity selling, and the framerate is both unlocked and badly optimized enough that my computer tries to melt a hole in the floor just on the main menu. The game has ran stably for me but I don't know how they're going to bulk out the gameplay to make this an interesting thing to play. It is tuned so the commodity production and everything else can be done very quickly, so twitch plays a factor and you can't play this with anything but undivided attention, which is unfortunate since I find it quite boring. If it were slower paced and less hectic I could at least listen to a podcast or something while I played.			"

												Pretty disappointing.  The games are pretty short and there isn't a ton of variety in the gameplay, so I found myself getting bored pretty quickly.  There's not a lot in the way of direct conflict; most of the strategy involves trying to get a monopoly on certain goods so the pirce goes up and you're the only one selling.....  And that's how pretty much every game goes.			"

												The graphics are excellent and the gameplay is great (so long as you like frantic and short), and replayability is the whole point. The soundtrack is neither bad nor inspiring. So why the ""Not Recommended""?What there is of this game is good, but I can't help but to think that other developers must be looking at it and thinking, ""Wait, people will review a game this well even though it's basically one scenario, without a campaign, over and over again, as long as that one scenario is *really* well polished?"" There just isn't enough game here to warrant a recommendation, especially not for $40. I think I paid $20 for it. It would be a good game a $9.99. The game is not even very deep, contrary to what others have said. You get whatever your specific group needs to grow, and then you get whatever is rare, and you win. That's every single playthrough, each of which takes maybe 20 minutes. There is no story, no campaign, no reason to play any more than a few matches as each faction, which I have already done in a whopping 17 hours (according to Steam). This is technically a strategy game, but, since each playthrough starts from nothing, plays frantically, and ends quickly, it plays almost more like a board game with good graphics. It feels more like a mini-game from a AAA title than a game in and of itself. On the plus side, I swear that's Jeffrey Combs (Weyoun from Star Trek Deep Space Nine, among other things) doing the various announcements, so there is that.			"

								This is an interesting game. The fact that it is non violent is a clear plus. The economic twist to it is a plus too. But considering its current state it is overpriced and the 10% discount is a joke. I would recomment buying at 15-20€ even for an early access (shouldn't early access games be cheaper than finished ones ?)The main con I find to it that the graphics are really slow (or it requires a graphic card too powerful) especialy when one considers the quality of the graphics of the buildings.Oh, sorry, the first con is actually the fact that you cannot scroll on the map and there is no minimap. You use the keyboard to move. Or maybe I missed something which could be included in the absent documentation.The second/third con is the lack of diversity for the decor. The maps are diverse with regards to the resources, but the red mars tend to be a bit boring on the long run.If you can overcome these issues, the game actually turns out to be... ok (I din't say great or anything similar). It really is about trading so you can afford to loose money on cheap resources that you don't produce as long as you earn more on expensive resources that you produce.The number of tiles (aka buildings) that you can build is very limited so you should be careful about how you use them and how you place them. You can scrap a building to build another but only at the same place.Finally, once you've built the offworld market you've more or less won. This is how I won the scientific scenario that some others claim to be unfeasible. By the way, I won all the tutorials without using the engineering. I still don't know what it does but it does not seem very useful so far.One should also note that this a rather fast paced game especially at the beginning (or maybe it is just the game lagging that prevents you from playing fast enough).I haven't done the multiplayer part yet. Hopefully, this will be intersting.			"

								I have never played anything like it before. Someone wrote, it compares best to the classic M.U.L.E. The basic idea is, that you found a venture on mars to grab ressources, manufacture goods, and sell them for a profit.There is a dynamic price mechanism based on supply and demand. This is nothing new. But it plays out in real time and feels like an RTS. (Sidenote: One of the designers mentioned Company of Heroes when talking about OTC! The game is totally different, but it ""feels"" as action packed as CoH while being all about economics).So you have to make decisions all the time - and since it is real time, there is a cost for not deciding: Do I claim a nice tile of land on mars to put a new factory there? Or do I make my existing stuff more efficient? Do I buy up someone elses stock? Or do I pay back my debt to prevent someone else from buying me out? Do I want to produce something that will guarantee small profits, or do I take a risk and switch to a potentially more profitable strategy? And .... WHO THE HELL has sabotaged my power supply again?!? The content and scope of this game is limited, but beautiful. Thats why I think, this game should set for a price of about 25 USD. The mechanic is fresh, the presentation is nice and the playstyle is rather unique.And I love the music. It will probably change a lot of times... I hope they include most of it in the final soundtrack.My impression:- Single Player: Skirmish and Daily challenge are nice play modes. The campaign mode feels like an addon - but it will need a lot of polish if it wants to compete with games like Anno 1401. - Multiplayer: Intense! Currently you might have to wait a few minutes to get a game going. This will get much more popular the closer OTC gets to release date.Good points:- Fresh playstyle and interesting scenario.- Nice and fluent visual presentation and music.- Cutthroat multiplayer robberbaron capitalism.- Music and sound.Not so good points (yet!):- Statistics will need more work. (I assume it gets it)- Almost no storytelling. (I don't expect too much changes here)- You win by clicking a button. This isn't the most exciting way of a finale (yet!)I would not expect a huge package that offers anything near the variety of a Civ V. If you are ok with the limited but exciting scenario, then you should grab this game now!			"

												I had seen this game advertised on an early release and I felt that it had good potential. I did not buy it then and I waited for the price to drop. I do not regret my purchase. The game is fantastic fun, very addictive and you always end up saying ""just one more go"". The AI is very well written and it does not seem possible to play the computer to your advantage. I woild recocmend this game to anyone and it makes a fantastic change to have a game where the biggest guns do make you win. I do not miss having to make a million clicks on things to progress either. I will say the game's Black Market is fantastic and adds a very interesting twist to all levels			"

												It looks like an RTS but plays closer to a real-time version of a board game, specifically, a worker placement game. Whereas worker placement games tend to fall under the Eurogame umbrella (i.e. boring abstract pieces of uninteractive garbage) Offworld Trading Company thankfully doesn't fall into that trap.You're on Mars to make mad dosh and prevent your fellow corporations from doing the same. The black market exists for you to fry their steel industry at key points with EMPs, to hire pirates to prey upon their shipping lines, and to cause energy blackouts.Every decision has heavy weight, especially the decision to spend claims, which is the game's territory system. You can't endlessly expand your borders like Civilization. Every time you upgrade your HQ you gain 4-5 tiles' worth of claims which you can then spend to create facilities on land. The level of long-term strategy is high here because you can't refund those claims; the most you can do is destroy the building, which may not even help you if you need a building with a different resource.I would recommend this to any strategy gamer who has grown bored of traditional manifestations of the genre. Don't forget to make lodse money!

												If the idea of an almost purely economical RTS ""battle"" appeals to you, then this is a game you definitely should own. However I feel like the 40 dollar price tag is too steep for what it is.First off, where this game really shines is multiplayer. Small battles, even just 1v1 with a friend, are really fun. Everything is about speed. The game is different from most traditional city builders. There's not a whole lot of ""city building"" going on. That is to say, the way that you decide to lay out your ""town"" is not overly important to the game. You can get certain bonuses for having some buildings next to others. For instance, placing any building next to another of the same type gives you a production bonus that is stackable, and buildings touching your HQ don't need fuel for transporting goods. Other than that, city design isn't a prominent aspect. Instead, the gameplay is all about speed. Claim territory, make money, and claim more territory as fast as possible.More often than not, the person who manages to claim the best territory the fastest will end up winning. Because of this, games can often be decided in the first 5-10 minutes. They also usually don't last more than 20-30 minutes. That is part of what makes the game so cool. If you're looking for a quick multiplayer session with a friend, it can become a natural choice if you're both good at it. Skirmishes are very fast paced and don't last long so you can squeeze games in whenever you feel like it. However it's also one of the game's hindrances.I think it could do with a good deal more content. Games almost feel too fast. You rush to figure out what the key resources on the map are and acquire them, rush to build some factories, rush to research some technology to give you advantages, always keeping an eye on the fluctuating prices of various commodities and having to deal with your opponents sabotaging your production through various ""black market"" means. There's so much to keep track of that games can flip around on you in an instant. One second you can be on top, well ahead of the game, next thing you know WHAM game over you just got bought. It can often leave you going ""what the hell just happened?""This is part of what makes it so fun and deadly, but at times it can feel somewhat lacking. So much of the game is just looking at numbers on the sidebar, constantly guaging prices, resources, buying, and selling. The actual graphics are very nice, but the funny thing is you don't actually spend a lot of time looking at the graphics, because winning is all about crunching numbers quickly. In my opinion the game would be better if there were some more layers of strategy that involved the actual graphical, planet of mars, city building related stuff. That would make this game a 9/10 for me at least. Alas, it does not, but if the devs keep developing it as they are it will get better.If you get it on sale, it's definitely worth it.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a very fun multiplayer economic strategy game.  It feels like a spiritual successor to MULE, though with quite a bit of added complexity that I welcome; in MULE you had just three (technically four) resources:- Food, which gives you time to work during your turn- Energy, which is required to operate your MULEs so they can produce resources- Smithore, which is required to build your MULEs in the first place- There was also a fourth (rare) resource, Crystite, which was purely valuable as a commodity to sell when the price randomly fluctuated to a high level.Despite being very simple system, the three main resources worked well together and a shrewd player could, at great risk to themselves, potentially corner the market in one resource and leave all the other players out to dry.  Offworld Trading Company allows similar risky maneuvers, such as cornering the silicon market and preventing other players from producing glass and electronics, or cornering the water market and preventing other players from producing food, fuel, and oxygen.  While MULE was a local multiplayer game (it was the 1980s, online wasn't a thing), Offworld Trading Company is online, which allows for large player counts and real-time play instead of turn-based.  There are a lot of other differences, many of them positive, a few of them negative.There are still a few things I think need to be worked on; the ability to collude with other players to cooperate against another player by directly trading resources instead of putting them on the stock market would make a tremendous improvement and is one of the few vital game mechanics I really miss from MULE.  I'd suggest adding a new building which gives the ability for players to directly trade resources with each other with the caveat that like in the original MULE, the other players in the game should be made aware that these players are colluding.  It wouldn't necessarily say what specific transations took place, just that they made a transaction.  Transactions could range from a constant pooling of a certain resource or transferring resources in specific amounts, to temporarly lending ownership of a structure to another player.  Another thing I'd like to see is the ability to license patents to another player in exchange for a lump sum of money or a percentage of their profits.			"

												This game surprised me. It is very polished, the mechanics are well thought and the single player experience includes tons of variables to keep if fresh for a long time. When I got this game I was expecting something akin to Civilization, but it is much more closely related to Starcraft. Although I dislike RTS games like Starcraft, this game still captivated me, and I believe the best explanation as to why comes from the Designer Notes that comes bundled with the game: Originally posted by Soren Johnson: However, just because unit selection is so frustrating doesn’t mean that RTS games should die. RTS games are the best place in video games for players who want to think. They require difficult choices between short-term gains and long-term goals. They require reading an opponent’s mind and predicting her moves. They encourage formulating a plan and then learning when to deviate from it. They are endlessly replayable as every dominant strategy has a counter-strategy waiting to topple it. They are the only way to make multiplayer truly work in a strategic game, avoiding the intractable problem of having to wait for one’s turn. Most importantly, real-time games must be played intuitively, by feel and experience instead of the painfully slow analysis possible in turn-based games. Thus, RTS games should live. Unit selection, however, should die. An RTS game is, at its core, about making strategic choices in a real-time environment, about not just making interesting decisions but also about when and when not to make them. Unit selection is just not a necessary part of that formula and often keeps the player from engaging with the game’s actual design.I just loved that I don’t need to manage units and become a clicking machine. For that alone this game would already deserve much praise.  "

												So far I am enjoying the game.  If you are of the analytical mindset like me and into economics/the markets, you will enjoy it alot.  I also have always really enjoyed strategy games.  That said I would imagine such people is only a small subset of most gamers so I wonder how the player count will hold up over time.I like how the typical match does not feel too short or long.  Maybe a half hour or so.  There is not too many APM but at the same time there is plenty to think about and manage.My biggest issue with this game is that the graphics to performance ratio is in my view lacking.  Meaning, even with an overclocked Geforce 1070 and 6600 process and 16 gb DDR4 ram I am seeing my frame per second dip sometimes below 30.  Now granted for an overhead strategy game based more on numbers and thinking this is not as critical as say a first person shooter or racing game.  Nonetheless, the optimization should be better, especially considering the graphics are nothing to write home about.  Honestly the graphics are no better then starcraft 2 which is how old now?  Considering this game came out in 2016, they should of optimized it better, I get better frames per second on witcher 3 at ultra!  To further expand on the graphics, for example all deposits whether it be water or silicon have the same exact symbol!  The only difference is the color.  Couldn't the developers of thought of something a bit more creative to represent the deposits?  The ""landscape"" is so bland you barely recognize it outside vaugely referencing it to what may produce better power or where you can't build.To sum it up.  I think the actual gameplay mechanics are pretty well thought out and pretty fun to play.  But i think the graphic innovation and optimization seems to have gotten the lazy end of the stick especially for the price this goes for (though I got it on a steam sale for half off).  I would give it a 8.5 out of 10 but that is only because I am into stock markets and economics personally, for most people it probably would be around a 6.5.			"

								Offworld Trading Company is a great RTS economy game, where the challenge is to find/sell/make resources and out-buy your enemie by getting their stocks.The game is hard, but the torturial gives a good understanding about what is moste important and gives the relevant information about Robotic HQ, Scientific HQ, Scavenger HQ, Expansive HQ and the black markedet etc.The game offers a challenging gameplay with resources you can either invest in or sell, while you can manipulate the markedet or slow down your enemies. The gameplay is smooth and is a interesting game that makes you wonder why you are better than this than you'r own economy.Overall graphics and interface gives a no-brainer overview of what you have to deal with, even you need to be fast looking for resoucres. The game can be fun to make your friends turn their brain around a couple times.If you like economy games, where you have to invest, sell, take care of the black markedet and slowing down your enemie while thinking of OC2 and fuel for your transportation of resources cross the map, then this game is for you.Here is a demo:

												For those potential buyers trying to make sense of this game: What this game is: a business game. What this game is not: 4X Sim City cloneMilitary RTSIf you're still with me, then know this is a fantastic business sim set in a near-future Mars colonization setting.  The premise is that Humans are colonizing Mars (Yay!) but the overwhelmed colonies have privatized their resourcing operations to Earth coprorations (Oh no!).  That's where you come in - You're basically the Mars regional manager for a corporation trying to get a foothold on the planet, before the competition can woo the colonies away from you. PROSThis is fast-paced day trading coupled with supply chain management.  On Mars.  The sheer amount of stuff you can customize for each run (patents, optimization, contracting/hiring staff, etc.) allows for a myriad of strategies you can try against the different competition and conditions in each colony.  With campaigns, you have to plan and budget ahead of time for the future, because the competition gets starts to get fierce after you win several colonies.CONSA little pricy for what the gameplay actually is, which is basically a ledger and a map of resources to manage.  The graphics and sound are only a few rungs higher than what you'd expect on a mobile app.  Would recommend getting it on sale.SIMILAR GAMESI can't really think of any.  Factorio is more about the tactics and design of supply chain management and there isn't a market. "

												Not worth over $30 considering all the content that's only accessible by buying the DLC. The options to select the content are built into the game menus but can only be picked if you pay an extra $30. I recently paid $20 for DLC for a free-to-play game with as much value and playability as OTC and felt like every dollar was worth it. These guys should include all that ""DLC"" for the price they charge for the game. OTC is a fun game for all skill levels. It has polished graphics and a dynamic economy. As mentioned elsewhere though, the games end far too quickly because opponents can buy each other out early. All of the game modes feel like this in some way. Whoever gets the early lead is likely to win while everyone else continues to play without a chance. That kills the fun a bit...Also the game uses long lessons instead of in-game prompts to teach you to play, so don't expect to turn it on an start playing right away.Now that the workshop is open, I'm sure a lot of cool mods are going to come out!

												TLDR: a must-try for people interested in strategy games, unless they absolutely hate rtsA very ingenious RTS design. Instead of watching and micro units and  unit-production , you watch prices and resource flows, trying to stay ahead of the competition  in building your economic engine. You spend your time racing for patents (usually a gamechanger in one of the supply chains), prime resource nodes, managing  stock purchases and of course sabotaging your enemy with different black market actions. This may sound boring to non-economically minded people, but it exceeds the usual rock-paper-scissors complexity many strategy games feature and does get hectic. There are four ""factions"" with different strengths, the puzzle is finding a good setup for a given map/resource distribution and anticipate price/supply shifts to profit from them before conditions change. Or maybe you find a way to force them to change in a beneficial manner? 96 hours in i dont have the sense of having mastered the mechanics  yet. There is a good variety of gamemodes: skirmish with different rules and maps, a daily challenge with a leaderboard, a campaign mode with lots of different options and factions and of course multiplayer. The later was clearly the design focus and i think works best. I think the campaign mode is weakest part of the game. After a  series of different scenarios and chances to build up your economic faction, you arrive at a climatic skirmishbattle to buy out your competition. In practice you often end up with  an overwhelming advantage or occasionally as if theres no chance to keep up.  Overall: people who enjoy strategy games, should check this out for many interesting and different ideas. Dont be put off by the economic theme!			"

								Offworld Trading Company is a strategy, space economy management game where there goal is to mine and refine resources to turn a profit and buy out you competitors in the stock market. But they can buy you out so you must be strategic in raising your stock and NET value. No 2 games are truly alike as resources are abundant or sparse in different random map games or dependent on what is more commonly manufactured by you competitors. I recommend this game fully other than the price it was a great addition to my collection of games. "

												It's fun with literally any number of players except 3.It's in the same vein as other economic hostile-takeover games like TTD but it's much faster-paced, so instead of a game taking days to complete, it's over in 20-30 minutes. This is a good thing. The time between ""It's obvious who the winner is"" and ""The winner is declared"" is very short. Games don't last very long after the first buyout, so if you're playing multiple rounds with friends, you won't have to sit out long.The basic premise is to acquire resources and sell them to get money to repeat the process. Resource prices change accordingly every time something is bought or sold, and there are various market manipulations that can be done. There's plenty of ways to mess with your opponent there, and you can buy usable-once-only sabotages for further shenanigans.It has its problems - the first buyout practically doubles your stock price, so in a 3-player game the first buyout determines the winner; the remaining player has a 0% chance of catching up and should just concede immediately. The Offworld Market is a necessary evil on Mars (as otherwise all resource prices drop to 1, but whoever has them is basically guaranteed to win) and utterly useless on Ceres (as all resource prices eventually become 1000). The AI is WAY too good at the game, as it makes no attempts to hide that it can and will react instantly to situations, inputting commands faster than any human possibly could.Overall though, it's an excellent strategy game that doesn't take nearly as long to play a round of compared to others in the genre. A good game to grab if you like economic games or quick strategies.			"

												Not for everyone, but good frantic RTS fun.Off the bat, one thing needs to be made clear, this is an RTS, not a 4X game. Matches are fast paced, hectic affairs, rarely lasting more than 30 minutes, even with a bunch of players. This isn't Sins of a Solar Empire, where games can stretch 4 hours, but Starcraft, with rapid strategy shifts in response to opponent actions culminating in a chaotic every man for himself finish. From the very first second of the game, when you're choosing where to found your HQ (and which HQ to choose, you don't have to make that selection before the game starts), you're shoved into direct competion with other players. I've purposefully built my HQ over some High Carbon deposits when playing against a couple Scavengers. It's a♥♥♥♥♥♥move, but it drives up the price of Carbon, and the market is an unforgiving battlefield. You need to be prepared to seize advantages and exploit weaknesses. Even playing on Slow speed, there's not a lot of time to think things through. You make decisions on the fly, relying on intuition as much as anything. There is no optimal strategy in OTC, as what works in one game might backfire in another. There are certainly things to learn, strategies to master, but there's no top to bottom plan that will lead to victory. You'll learn when it's worth expanding your HQ, what buildings synergize well, when to research and how to exploit the various Patents, etc. Most importantly, though, is learning how to ""feel"" the market. That Water surplus, is one of your opponents attempting to stockpile before researching Water Engines or Cold Fusion? Are they attempting to reduce their life support bill? Are they trying to reduce the value of another player who has a large stockpile of Water so they can buy them out? Or was it really just a random event? Whatever it is, react fast, and you might just be able to take advantage of it.There are people who play online in the Ranked Multiplayer, and OTC certainly has what it takes to be considered a competitive game. However, personally I have had the most fun playing with people I know, so, if you can, find some friends to get this game with. The Deluxe edition comes with some DLC and an extra copy, if you split the cost with someone it's cheaper than buying it outright. Unfortunately, the cost is a major sticking point with this game. As much as I like it, it's not worth $40, or even the $30/copy with the Deluxe edition. I picked it up for a little over half off, and I'm happy with that.TL;DR: Wait for a sale, but definitely pick this up if you enjoy fast paced RTS games.			"

												An interesting game that removes the classical detail of RTS--combat. The game is all about numbers, and the principles of economics are your weapon. It'll require you to use your knowledge, to make critical decisions in managing supply, capital, your assets, and the market demands. The game is crafted beautifully. Everything from the music, graphics, and the artwork they've put in. Learning the ropes is a little intimidating, so I strongly suggest you go through the tutorial Stardock put together in the game. Speaking of Stardock, these people have tons of experience in the RTS industry. They're an actual studio, and not some group of amigos writing up an indie game for some quick cash.			"

												Offworld Shipping Company can best be described as a child of Sim City, Civilization and Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri. The premise is simple enough - you have to build a Mars-based resource exploitation and trading company, grow it faster than your competitors, and eventually buy them out in a hostile takeover via the stock market. Anyone who has ever played Civ and tried to go for non-military victories is going to appreciate what this game has to offer.I would say that the only downside is that the game is quite cognitively straining because it requires the player to to juggle a lot of numbers and economic variables, so this is not something you want to play if your goal is to blow off some steam after a hard day at work.Caveat emptor: the game is very addictive!

												Economic strategy game? More like Business Wars!!Offworld Trading Company does a good job capturing the essence of managing a corporation and trying to push out your competition by buying them out.  Simplistic yet detailed.  Though there is a lot going on, everything can easily be learned.  For example: Iron needs to be mined for your refineries to create steel.  Steel is then required for a lot of other buildings and reduces the overall cost to build more if you have a bunch in stock.  Or you can sell it on the market and make a tidy profit.  Smooth gameplay. Short on supplies?  The game automatically purchases what you need and increases your debt thus making the gameplay flow smooth.  Indicators also let you know when your facilities are not working and also lets you know what materials you do not have.  Corporate espionage.  Though you cannot directly attack the other corporations, you can cackle to yourself twisting your long mustache as you sabatoge your opponent's greatest money maker.Ranked Multiplayer.  The AI is more than enough challenge, however there is a ranked multiplayer you can jump in challenge other individuals to see who is the master of economic warfare.There really isn't much negative things to say about this game.  Except that maybe this game may not appeal to those who wants to bring out their troops and order them to attack.

												I've been staring at this game since early alpha debating whether to buy it and finally bit the bullet.  I should have done this when it was first offered.  If you like the idea of a super fast paced game of domination that is different every time, buy this.  Every thing you do can be countered by your opponent, and likewise you can counter everything your opponent does.  actions per minute helps but isn't necessary; playing smart is infinitely more important.  Every action your opponents take will have direct consequences on your products and prices, can you figure out what the demand is going to be?  will you be caught in a competitive market with your profits steadily dropping?  Will you just dominate through overproduction of your opponents?  Will you lock down technology that lets you skip their profit margins and go directly back into your product?  Will you find a niche that no one is competing in and exploit it?  There are so many paths to victory or defeat in this game and its so simple yet complex at the same time.  If you are still on the fence watch a few lets play videos until you get the gist of it, then figure out how the patent lab, off world market, blackmarket etc. make it infinitely more intricate.  Minutes to learn, lifetime to master.  Excellent game design.			"

Early Access Review
								In short:A slightly weak 7/10 for now, but overall worth the money if you believe in future improvements (given the Early Access as well as overall game design).--------First off, this is NOT my kind of game. I'm the kind of player who prefers to spend time investing in one persistent game (as in Cities:Skylines, Dark Souls or an MMO), rather than a match-based game like this one.That said and given the premise of the match RTS subgenre, I have to say it's a very refreshing IP. No combat whatsoever, but instead an all-out trading system where you manipulate the market and make sure you produce, buy and sell the right kinds of resources for maximum profit and the detriment of your opponents (who share your market).As for resources, they do feel a bit few and ""slapped onto"" the game. There's no explicit tree structure or overall design that makes me feel like I should care (possibly because of the said match-based gameplay, which makes everything feel rushed).I guess I just wish that this kind of trade-focused game would be more fleshed out, with greater array of goods, upgrades, services, alternatives and just general depth. The game feels like a one-man indie game project.Overall, I have to say that the idea is pretty good and, for its premise and its price, the game plays decently (but not excellently). I can recommend this game, although just barely (I wish there was a third choice haha). The game does have major potential, and I do think the devs may deliver on some of that. I also haven't seen any major bugs with this game yet, but I haven't played it too much either so idk. But I do wish the game was just a few notches better than it is.			"

												For those potential buyers trying to make sense of this game: What this game is: a business game. What this game is not: 4X Sim City cloneMilitary RTSIf you're still with me, then know this is a fantastic business sim set in a near-future Mars colonization setting.  The premise is that Humans are colonizing Mars (Yay!) but the overwhelmed colonies have privatized their resourcing operations to Earth coprorations (Oh no!).  That's where you come in - You're basically the Mars regional manager for a corporation trying to get a foothold on the planet, before the competition can woo the colonies away from you. PROSThis is fast-paced day trading coupled with supply chain management.  On Mars.  The sheer amount of stuff you can customize for each run (patents, optimization, contracting/hiring staff, etc.) allows for a myriad of strategies you can try against the different competition and conditions in each colony.  With campaigns, you have to plan and budget ahead of time for the future, because the competition gets starts to get fierce after you win several colonies.CONSA little pricy for what the gameplay actually is, which is basically a ledger and a map of resources to manage.  The graphics and sound are only a few rungs higher than what you'd expect on a mobile app.  Would recommend getting it on sale.SIMILAR GAMESI can't really think of any.  Factorio is more about the tactics and design of supply chain management and there isn't a market. "

												Not worth over $30 considering all the content that's only accessible by buying the DLC. The options to select the content are built into the game menus but can only be picked if you pay an extra $30. I recently paid $20 for DLC for a free-to-play game with as much value and playability as OTC and felt like every dollar was worth it. These guys should include all that ""DLC"" for the price they charge for the game. OTC is a fun game for all skill levels. It has polished graphics and a dynamic economy. As mentioned elsewhere though, the games end far too quickly because opponents can buy each other out early. All of the game modes feel like this in some way. Whoever gets the early lead is likely to win while everyone else continues to play without a chance. That kills the fun a bit...Also the game uses long lessons instead of in-game prompts to teach you to play, so don't expect to turn it on an start playing right away.Now that the workshop is open, I'm sure a lot of cool mods are going to come out!

												It's fun with literally any number of players except 3.It's in the same vein as other economic hostile-takeover games like TTD but it's much faster-paced, so instead of a game taking days to complete, it's over in 20-30 minutes. This is a good thing. The time between ""It's obvious who the winner is"" and ""The winner is declared"" is very short. Games don't last very long after the first buyout, so if you're playing multiple rounds with friends, you won't have to sit out long.The basic premise is to acquire resources and sell them to get money to repeat the process. Resource prices change accordingly every time something is bought or sold, and there are various market manipulations that can be done. There's plenty of ways to mess with your opponent there, and you can buy usable-once-only sabotages for further shenanigans.It has its problems - the first buyout practically doubles your stock price, so in a 3-player game the first buyout determines the winner; the remaining player has a 0% chance of catching up and should just concede immediately. The Offworld Market is a necessary evil on Mars (as otherwise all resource prices drop to 1, but whoever has them is basically guaranteed to win) and utterly useless on Ceres (as all resource prices eventually become 1000). The AI is WAY too good at the game, as it makes no attempts to hide that it can and will react instantly to situations, inputting commands faster than any human possibly could.Overall though, it's an excellent strategy game that doesn't take nearly as long to play a round of compared to others in the genre. A good game to grab if you like economic games or quick strategies.			"

												Bought the deluxe, it's a fun distraction that emphasises on speed. There is really no long term strategy you can implement which is rather a shame because anyone who rushed income early on can buy you out and get an imminant advantage. Having said that the game is fairly unbalanced. Control Silicone (rarely spawns on random for some reason), Go robotics, grab 3 core patents and you're set.The game is okay, but there is no long term replayability. You can't even buy back your own shares to keep you in the game longer if you want to implement a longer term strategy. Sigh, but i do recommend trying it when it goes on sale.EDIT: Multiplayer is terrible. I can't get a single game that doesn't bug out. Lobby or Ranked. I'm not if this is because of the host the game chooses or their servers or what.EDIT: Multiplayer now works but it's rather stupidly setup. 4FFS is a lot of fun but you can ONLY play it on the weekends. There there aren't any 8 player games. *sigh*EDIT: May 23rd, Lobby is still broken. 1v1 aren't fun. 4FFA is still gated as a weekend event. It's really sad because this is a great game but i'm only able to play on the weekend.			"

												I am absolutely horrible at this game. I don't think I've won anything outside of the tuturial missions, but while I don't play it much because of that, I can definitely recognise the amount of quality there is in this game.OTC is a RTS game, but instead of combat being the focus, it's economics. There is no military in this game, the game is built entirely around buying, producing and selling resources in order to become the best trading company on Mars. The economics, from my understanding, is easy to learn, hard to master. Essentially buying increases value, and selling decreases value, so the main layer of strategy in this game is balancing income, making sure you're not in too much debt, and keeping the economy stable. There's also the more questionable side of business, involving buying extra land off the black market, sabotaging competitors, and hacking the market to directly increase or decrease the value of goods.It's pretty hard, and I don't think I'll ever get how to play it well, but it's interesting and I would definitely recommend it to people who like RTS games, but want something with a unique twist.

Early Access Review
								Ever since I was taken in by Race to Mars (you know what I'm talking about), I have been ultra-leary of Early Access Games.  I am glad that I broke my own rule and took the plunge with Offworld Trading Company.  For a game that isn't even touted as a Final Release version, it is amazingly well along.  I have played many games so far and have enjoyed them, even when I lost to the AI.  I have yet to try the multi-player, but this game has given me faith.  I tried to make a list of Pros & Cons but found it difficult.  The only Con I can really give this game is that it isn't done yet!  :P  Big thumbs up to the team behind this game.  I can't wait for the finished version and to the DLC I know is coming!  (hint hint, DLC in the future please!)I would advise investing in this game despite the Early Access tag.  Even if they stopped right now, its still WAY better than Race to Mars ever will be I fear.As a side note...I did wait until it was going for $20 USD instead of $40. As another side note:  I read some of the negative reviews (about 10% of them) and found that alot of people complained about 'shallowness', the Black Market and the AI's tendency to pile up money and buy you out.  I was perplexed by all of that.  The supposed shallowness allows for games that don't take an entire day of my life while allowing for a pace that kept me busy until the end.  If I want on 'in-depth' experience, I'll play Civ or something like that.The Black Market...nope, no problems with that either.  I like the fact that not only can I sabotage the competition, they can also do the same to me.  The costs increase not only when you use it, but when the AI uses it.  So if you can catch it, you can get an idea of the general plans of the competition.  Couple that with keeping an eye on Share Prices, it's not hard to figure out who just bought what.  And as for the AI buying you out...that's what it's supposed to do.  And if you have played correctly, you have made it hard for them to do so...which drives the tactic of storing up the $1 Million+ it will take.  The best business deals are the ones that surprise everyone else.  Why would that be any different here.			"

												Plenty of other reviewers have shared their two cents. I'll keep my review on the leaner side.If you enjoy fluid, real time, dynamic strategy games you should consider Offworld Trading Company. There are no invading forces, no armies, no tanks. It's a about cunning and guile. Trying to read the market, trying to manage your company while discerning your opponents strategy. Skirmish games can be over relatively quickly (under an hour) and usually leave you wanting more. This is a nice change of pace from a game like Civilization where even on the shorter end of the spectrum games will last 2-3 hours. That said, I do love the Civilization series, which is part of the reason why I purchased this game.In terms of learning curve - the game is easy to pick up, difficult to master. I say give it a go.			"

Luckily I got it on sale for ~13 dollars. When you may or may not buy this game, you'll most likely have played one of the civilization games, expecting it to be like that, but in SPACE! You would be wrong. It boasts the lead designer of Civ 4, but it never really comes close to a civ game. My main problem with it is that it's too short. It's got almost no replay value because it's mostly the same game, unless you add more options like advanced sabotage, no sabotage, etc. The games never last because you'll either get wiped out or wipe everyone else out. Never have I experienced a round where I was neck and neck with ANY of the other companies I competed against. Get it when it's on sale or when they decide to make a game that lasts			"

								Offworld Trading Company is an intense economic macro-oreiented RTS. But don't be fooled by the lack of military units, the game won't be easy. There's a lot to manage, other players to worry about and futures to predict (or create). Those of you who've played M.U.L.E. will find this extremely familiar, but in real-time rather than the turn-based style of the original.The game itself is relatively simple to pick up, but there's a lot of depth and interacting complexity to master. You'll be deciding which resources to focus on, which buildings are cost inefficient, picking between the two research options, deciding whether to double short the or just to rush into Off World Markets, not to mention who to wreck with blackmarket tech and when.Of course, it's not perfect being that it's in Early Access, the UI needs polish, and I find the game can be sluggish at times, especially in the end game (though, that's likely my fault for running it at 1440p), but overall the game is ridiculously fun, and the core mechanics are extremely solid, and the multiplayer community is really strong and friendly (though, they may still wreck you at first, no hard feelings, of course). Absolutely worth picking up.			"

								Ok,  as a disclaimer strategy games of any variety  I typically enjoy in some ways; that said I'm really fond of the angle they've taken here but... I'm not sure its remotely worth 40$. In todays day and age I understand inflation and general quality of life insists we pay more for our games but I simply don't understand why we pay 40$ for what should be, in its current state, a 20$ game.  I am all for early access even being burnt by df9 like others, I'm very inpatient but why not pay 20$ to have access to the alpha and a buy in of 10$ for the full game when your done and 35 for the person who didn't try it before release? games like planetary anhilation that set that alpha price to rediculous ammounts really dont want your feedback just your money.-rant over- The gameplay at this point is really unique , I liked it alot. I, like always, jumped right into the game campaign without doing the tutorial and got obliterated. repeatedly, something about the reasource grab in the begining can be very unforgiving. its definately more of an rts than those turnbased lovers of civ. That said I'd like to point out all 'popular' rts's tend to have a decent chunk of campaign to play through. I lowered the difficulty after a few losses and found myself beating it too easily but I was really intrigued by the sofar bare bone campaign so I figured I'd see what it was all about. Much to my disappointment that was it. after a few missions with no real plot or explanation of your conquests on mars you easily finish the campaign ina couple hours... praise the lord they arnt done developing. after a few missions you generaly get the idea of how to take the reigns, you quickly learn all the buildings and how to place them well; there doesnt seem to be quiet enough... even with 16 resources or w.e there was specialization was never really an option even on rare resource missions supply always exceeded demand  far to easily and demand never rose fast enough... I think there are some resource balancing tweeks to be done and alot to desire game wise but in its current state its VERY playable with only a few little bugs.  I want more; I will be watching this one.			"

If you enjoy RTS and don't mind not being able to zerg attack your opponent with an army of soldiers but enjoy using a planned and precise economical attack or long term choke hold on the market for a thrilling buyout win then this the game for you.

												Honestly, it's a good game. I played it a few times, and the mechanics are good, among other things. My problem with the game is that it isn't worth $40. At ALL. Luckily I got it on sale for ~13 dollars. When you may or may not buy this game, you'll most likely have played one of the civilization games, expecting it to be like that, but in SPACE! You would be wrong. It boasts the lead designer of Civ 4, but it never really comes close to a civ game. My main problem with it is that it's too short. It's got almost no replay value because it's mostly the same game, unless you add more options like advanced sabotage, no sabotage, etc. The games never last because you'll either get wiped out or wipe everyone else out. Never have I experienced a round where I was neck and neck with ANY of the other companies I competed against. Get it when it's on sale or when they decide to make a game that lasts			"

												Great game. Id say its a cross between the Anno series (trading & management) and ticket-to-ride (short-round boardgames where you can manipulate opponents).The game revolves around being the last man standing.Build a few mines/farms/other structures and supply the local colony with goodsIf a rival is getting a bit too far ahead, sabotage them.Build various special buildings to manipulate prices or conduct research for patents or efficiency upgradesStart aquiring other company's shares and then buy them out (While ensuring you are not bought out!)The base game only has this single goal though, so the winner can seem obvious near the endEach round is reasonably quick though (maybe around 20-30 mins) so its not too badIf you get the deluxe edition from some sites (Not available directly via steam), you can get two steam keys!

												Offworld Trading Company plays like a bizarre cross between an RTS and a board game.  If you were to take the core mechanics and fashion them into a board game, you'd have a pretty good game.  But this?  It's not very good at all in my opinion.  The fact that the game plays out in real time doesn't mesh well with the game mechanics, and the UI is dreadful.  The tutorials are kind of odd, definitely too long, and they don't really teach you how to play the game.  It isn't difficult to understand how to play, but since there is no manual and this is a strategy game, it would have been nice to have tutorials that didn't suck.Though the time I spent playing this game was brief, it was unpleasant and I cannot recommend the game.

								This is a fast paced and energetic RTS set in some not so distant future on the Mars.  Tha main thing I like is that ""Offworld Trading Company"" is the only modern competitive game I know which is not about killing people or other stuff. It's purely economical: one develops the company base, sells resourses and fight for the shares in other companies — buying out competition is the only way to the victory! Grafics are cute, performance is OK even on my 2013 Macbook Air, Early Access status is recognizable but makes only a little impact on overall gameplay.AI is fucused and unforgiving and while it's easy to jump in the game concepts then there are quite a few challenges on the way to perfection. All in all, if you like Civ's economics and ready to the demanding chess blitz tempo, please give this game a try!			"

								It's an RTS like Warcraft or Dune was, not a 4x like Civilization.  (This was a surprise, but I like it for what it is.)Pros:NovelBest strategy does depend on what other players doJust the right number of resources and colony typesCons:Coporate takeovers are sudden.  I look at their money and the value of their resources, not nearly sufficient, and Boom! they take the company over.  Even mine.  Debt is a meaningless red number.  Maybe it figures into your stock price?  Perhaps this shouldn't be listed as a Con, I just don't understand it yet.Campaign mode has a very different method of acheiving victory, and there is a complete lack of instructions.  Even after reading the forums I can't find the buttons to push to do the (new and different) things you need to do to win.			"

												Greetings!  This game is an odd one, a mix of strategy and business sense I definitely found some moments of glee as I trapped my opponent into bankruptcy and quickly bought all their shares. There was some enjoyment and ‘ah-ha’ moments, but is there longevity?  No, at least not for me.Those Bloody Robots:  In my two hours of play I encountered a few crashes, an odd bug that prevented me from playing (a red x appeared as my cursor and I couldn’t get it to go away and it wouldn’t let me exit the game) and disastrous frame rate (going as low as 5 fps).  I’m not sure if optimization is the problem or something else I didn’t see but this did not help my lack of enjoyment of the title.Class of its own:  This game is unique, no doubt about it, an odd mesh of verses with more traditional management style game and a dash of RTS.  Someone had a very specific idea for this game and I think they achieved it here.  There is something beautiful and unique here, you build a base like that of an RTS until you realize you have no tanks, no soldier.  Money and resources are your soldiers, they are used to slowly buy out your opponent or bury them in debt.  To be honest, I loved the notion, the execution isn’t bad either.  But it unfortunately didn’t take me long to get bored.Masterpiece of Engineering:  This game is well built (aside from the mentioned bug), from the factions to the environment and immersion.  Even the mechanics are well designed and developed, there really was a vision here but just like some abstract painting that some don’t get it I am left with the question:  Where is the fun?  I’m not saying this game isn’t fun, but it isn’t fun for me.  I get the concept, the pathing and the process.  I follow along and make the correct decisions but to me it feels more robotic, meticulous, almost like a job or a project to complete.  One of my friends watched me play for a bit and he said it was a ‘beautiful spreadsheet simulator’ and I feel that is kind of the point.  There is a game here and I’m sure it is fun.  I’d probably dump a few more hours into if it would stop crashing and bugging out on me but long term, no, I think even if the game worked perfectly I’d rather use my time for a more enjoyable game or something productive.  I hope I’m wrong for all of you out there and I hope you enjoy it! "

								I really like this game. I got off to a slow start, but after about 30 minutes i really started to get into it. The tutorial took me about 2 hours, but they were actually really fuin once i caught on to the premise of the game and the controls. The game has potential.One problem I ran into was that once i was bought out for $3B, my game must have crashed or something because there was no button to take me to the main menu or anything. It showed me my buyout certificate and there was no way to end the game properly so i just had to quit the game through task manager. Not that big of a deal, just sayin'.Overall great game that i could see myself getting very addicted to. Hvaen't played multiplayer yet, but have a feeling that will keep me coming back to play.EDIT: After the latest update, i cannot enter a single or multiplayer game. Says there's an error right when I try and enter a game			"

								It's important to say when playing this game that we are talking the earliest days of early access so much isn't polished and there are a lot of niggles to iron out. But... this a truly original game with a lot of potential. Soren Johnsen is a great game designer and this could be a major new gameplay franchise. It has loads of potential to develop into a really great multiplayer experience for those of us who want deep and interesting strategy but only have an hour to play a game.If you loved the early iterations of Railroad Tycoon and want a much more brutal and competitive version of the Anno series then this is right up your street. This game has the real potential to be next on the list of great Early Access games following from Kerbal and Prison Architect.			"

Early Access Review
								I'd say this game is quite good. So far as I can see from the negative reviews, they're mostly there because they expected a long strategy game like Civ, which it is not. This is quite a fast game comparitively and it notes in the trailer that most games are expected to be 30 minutes. I have mixed thoughts on the AI, as sometimes they make very stupid decisions, but to be fair most of the time they get it right. A lot of people are complaining that they quickly get bought out by the AI, but this is merely a strategy that is available in the game due to it's fast pace, and if you cannot deal with it then you should not be playing 30-40 minute RTS games, but rather something like Civ (Which is personally one of my favorite game series). The tutorials in this game are quite lacking, and they are basically just throwing you into the deep end, so some people may find it hard to pick up. Overall, I'd say that before you buy this game, realise it is fast and you can't get comfortable before you start taking action against other players.			"

								Even in alpha, this game is already excellent and challenging. Plus, there's so much more the develpers (and modders) could do with it. It has that rush RTS feel the entire game, with a great blend of strategy (choosing which resources to focus on, which research to do, which kind of ecomony to focus on, considering which faction you are) and tactics (black market sabotage, market manipulations, and selling/buying strategies). It may not look like it from the screenshots, but you feel like you're in constant combat with your opponents.Economic and market considtions are constantly changing based on the given map's resources and player/AI behavior; however, it doesn't change so fast that you can't find trends and predict how resource demand will change and make decisive, bold moves to crush opponents.I see a near-limitless potential for deep strategy, counter-strategy and evolving meta-strategies for this game. Extremely excited to see where this game goes!			"

								I understand how this game could be fun to people, but the AI in the game needs A LOT of work. Main problem, they know everything! Yes, you could argue that they have difficulty settings for that reason but the problem is, any way you slice it, the AI knows how to win the game and it knows every last feature, loop hole and method to winning in the game. Unfortunatly for me and anyone else who plays, WE ARE NOT FINANCIAL PLANNERS! If the AI can COMPLETELY overshaddow me in funds when I put it on INTERN difficulty! I have no clue how! Maybe I need more work, but in the little time I've played, I beat the tutorials like a normal game should be beaten. when I clicked quick match, I was annhialated. Maybe I suck with money? I don't know. Long story short, I don't think that this game is worth $40 at the moment. Hey, early access games aren't normally good anyway- with the exception of Starbound -but my advice to anyone thinking about buying, wait a bit.			"

												Offworld Trading Company is a rather interesting take on Real time strategy games. Instead of blowing up enemies with machine guns or explosives #Offworldtradingcompany takes a new look at things by using Economics!The game actually has a lot of content as well. My video is based on all of the DLC and honestly Im not sure where one DLC starts and another stops so Ill be talking as if you have all the DLC.The tutorial for offworld trading company shows you the basics then walks you through a set of scenarios with increasingly challenging computers. By the time you complete these challenges you should easily be able to jumpy right into the multiplayer side of things if thats your cup of tea.If not there is plenty to do vs the AI which is NO slouch! Skirmishes like any other RTS allow you to just jump in vs a certain number of opponents where your job is to out perform them financially with the end goal of buying out their business.There are a variety of resource gathering options, factorys that produce different luxury goods, devious blackmarket sabotage moves, and if all else fails access to an offworld market that you can launch missiles to exploit.Campaigns bring an interesting twist to the game. You get the core game with a twist in the rules the restricts who can do what. This forced specialization completely changes your focus. Also instead of straight buying out your opponents you must support a colony. The person who does the best on any given week gets a bonus for the following week. Make a few mistakes and your opponents can snowball. Once a certain week has passed you again have the ability to buy out your opponents like normal.There is also Daily scenarios very similar to binding of isaacs dailies. You are given a set scenario blindly, forced to adapt, and you are scored with eveyone else for that day. Quite a bit of blind competition the person who adapts quickly gets a better score and the leader board ensures bragging rights vs your friends or the world.Finally if playing against an AI bores you there is a rnaked multiplayer option.I ran out of time in my review but ranked and custom matches were both available. If you'd like a more indepth review here is my first impressions video!

												I really thought I was going to love this game, and I did, during the first couple of tutorial missions. I thought to myself ""wow, this is amazing! I can't wait to colonize Mars! I'm going to spend hours and hours spreading across the planet!""Sadly, after the first couple of tutorials they start introducing mechanics that make the game less fun. Once you really get into the game, you're no longer focused on colonizing, because you get an extremely limited amount of buildings. Once they're built, you need to watch a little stock ticker and sell off your spare resources. You can't do it all at once though, because selling dips the price, so you need to pause the game every 30 seconds or so to do it. It gets really tedious.There's a goofy stock mechanic where you dump all of your extra money into your own stock (which doesn't seem to do much because people can and will still buy you out) and other people's stock, where you buy them out. If you get bought out (which can happen with no warning if you're not paying attention) it's instant game over.This is a well made game and I'm sure lots of people will find it's what they're interested in playing, but a 30 minute game of micromanaging silicon prices isn't what I want to play. Maybe that's my fault for not looking into what this was more thoroughly, but I can't think of anyone I would recommend this to.Weak thumbs down. Sorry game.			"

After playing 5 games, I will say that when it starts getting into the late game and everyone is trying to buy each other out, the game starts lagging and becomes very sluggish. Is about the only problem with the game.Other than that though it is a fun game and interesting take on the Stra genre. This is the frist Stra game i have played that is focused more on Eco than war and its nice turn of pace for me. I do recommend this game, but is what i said about it becoming sluggish is a turn off i understand, lag sucks but it really sucks the most in a RTS game.			"

												Offworld Trading Company is an economic warfare based real time strategy game. That makes it quite an interesting take on the RTS genre. How does the 'warfare' work? Well, you and your competitors mine raw materials and produce goods - and sell it on the shared market. And if someone else has a building you don't want them to have, it may accidentally explode.. or you 'borrow' it for some time to win the race to one of the juicy patents (buffs only one player can have). In the end, you want to make money more quickly than the other people (and avoid debt!), in order to buyout their companies. And .. sometimes you may have to manipulate the market prices a tiny bit..So how does the strategy layer of OTC look it? Well, one important aspect is that space is limited. Every time you upgrade your HQ, you can claim some more (4-5) tiles on the map. These normally are tiles either next to your HQ or tiles with resources on it. Since (good) resources tiles are limited, you can create the situation where you nearly have a monopoly on a raw resource. And if everyone has to buy from you (via the market), you can make quite a profit by actively generating this situation. Doing so is tricky though, since at the start of the match, the map is covered with fog of war - and only when your HQ position is selected, the whole map is revealed. Might turn out that whole map is covered with silicon.. but there barely is any carbon! Time to change long term plans!Once you own a tile, its yours for the rest of the match. This is where good positioning and foresight comes into play, because whatever buildings you are going to use, those have to be on these limited tiles. Got those now-useless mines on the other end of the map? Well, just put factories there instead. However, transporting goods costs fuel, which requires water to make, which drives up prices and reduces profit. All producing buildings get adjacency bonuses (each +50% for 2 buildings, +75% for 3). So your first idea might be ""well, get some mines in the middle of nowhere and a big cluster of tiles at my HQ to maximize adjacency"". However, this leaves your production very vulnerable to area of effect sabotage by that dude that doesn't like you. Ouch. The market prices rise and drop depending on what all players do. This requires you to switch up production on the fly. You produced food? Well, turns out over the last minutes prices for the required water skyrocketed, so you don't make a profit anymore. Better replace those farms with something better. A classic example is that no one cares to produce energy in the early game (not profitable; not helping to upgrade HQ). This causes the energy prices to rise in the midgame, which you can actively abuse by then dumping energy on the market (while sabotaging everyone else who tries that). The game has four factions, each with a spin on how they work. -Expansionists get more claims and cheaper buildings, allowing them to be more flexible-Robots don't need life support supplies - and get adjacency not only for same type of buildings, but also if a supplier is next to a factory.-By the power of science, factories can use the resource tiles below them!-Real Scavengers don't use steel like everyone else, but use carbon - which allows them to pull off above play with energy production very effectively. Also they love sabotaging.So would I recommend the game? Like I said, I think it's a very interesting take on the RTS genre. It has a lovely soundtrack (Christopher Tin, aka Baba Yetu/Civ 4 Main Theme). I'm personally not sure about the 40 Eur price tag though.. ouch.. When it's on sale for 20, I would say pick it up. Since I can't comment on the multiplayer and its longevity and dynamic yet, I'm not sure whether I personally would give 30 for it. Then again, I'm a very conservative buyer.I honestly fear that the maximum strategic depth may be much shallower than say Starcraft (1!) or the Wargame series - but I think that can be expected, since market mechanics and its potential generally probably aren't fully explored yet. SC and WG are in their 4th+ iteration, in the more classic multiplayer RTS style and thus strategically much more refined. I'm very curious how they'll expand on this mechanic, though.			"

Early Access Review
								I've been a RTS fan since the first warcraft game. Generally I favor the more military focused games like warcraft, starcraft, red alert, age of empires; so I was a little wary of giving this game a try. So glad I did.I really enjoy the pacing of this game. Yes, it can move quickly, but for the most part it doesn't require the twitch reflexes that starcraft 2 and other modern RTS games demand. For those who say this game is too shallow, I couldn't disagree any more. Yes, it's true there are less building options and tech trees to work with, but Offworld has more than enough to keep the game engaging. When dealing  with an ever-changing economy you don't need tiers of tech to have content that is hard to master.Mastery in this game is learning to predict your opponents' market schemes, adapting to the chaning economy, and knowing when to take risks in certain investments such as a new patent, claim or black market. While predicting, adapting and risk taking aren't new skills to the RTS genre, having to master them in a passive setting rather than an active go-attack-em setting makes for some new challenges that I've really enjoyed trying to learn.More Thoughts:It is true the tutorial could be a little more thorough, but after a couple of hours, you should be able to figure out the gist. This is just me, but I think the Black Market takes the fun out of the game. I'm sure with more experience I could make better use of the black market, but for now the cost/benefit ratio doesn't seem to justify any purchase except for the new claims.  My biggest beef with the black market is that it takes away from the game's best feature, a rts focused primarily on economy. With the black market enabled it can get really annoying when your production is stopped, especially because it doesn't really hurt you, it just slows the game down. Thankfully there is an option to disable the black market, which i've found myself doing on every game now.8/10  "

												Biggest surprise of the year so far. It is *almost* relaxing yet at the same time very tense when the market heats up! The soundtrack is fantastic. The tutorials are some of the best I have ever seen. It really isn't a spreadsheet, the game has character, and scrounging Mars for hot spots is fun. It is very satisfying to build a nice economic engine and there is just enough spite between players that you can't just do your own thing and ignore the other competitors... unless you build a real powerhouse that you can shrug off mutinies, saboatge.. erm.. incidents I mean, etc.  Nicely done, Mohawk.

												Ok this game would be AMAZING except for one really giant multiplayer flaw............ ITS♥♥♥♥♥♥♥BROKEN.  In multiplayer, thereis a ranked system which by itself would be fine.  However, if you get on a osing streak you'll drop down alot of ranks.  Still fine.  But then you realize that there are 21 people looking for a match and you can't play any of them because they aren't your rank.  That's b@llsh!t!  the ranked system should be optional because it utterly breaks the multiplayer system.  IDK how there even were 21 people were all looking for a match at the same time........ it is impossile for all fo them to be different ranks because there are only 10.  If you do not care about multiplayer download this game but otherwise stay away.  The ranked system should be optional for competitive players.  There needs to be a nonranked multiplayer system similar to quickplay.  that would push this game well into the thumbs up range for me.			"

								Offworld Trading Company is exactly the kind of game I want to see more of. It reminds me a bit of a resource based board game (Power Grid, etc.) but done in real time. A really nice blend of chin stroking strategy and frantic moment to moment tactics, all without guns and combat! There is dynamite though..There are some problems. The biggest issue by far is the abruptness that games end, at least in the default game mode. It's very possible to be humming along, building your successful empire, and then all of the sudden an opponent completely buys you out and bam, you lose. Uhh, ok.. gg?This comes down partially to the stock purchasing mechanic and partially to the UI being somewhat rudimentary. If the fact an opponent was about to buy you out was somehow *much* more visible maybe everything would be fine. As it stands there is no late game tension unless you know where to look for it. Compare this to combat based RTS games where its obvious your base is under attack and you are about to lose.This game /is/ in early access so I do have hope that the above problem can be addressed in some fashion. Until then, you do get used to if after a while.			"

												Review for mac users:Offworld Trading Company (OTC) barely runs on my Macbook Pro Retina, despite my rigs' specs being well above the recommended. It runs so poorly that by the later tutorials (that's right, tutorials!), it turns into a slideshow, at low settings and 1440 resolution. We're talking isometric graphics here! The developers have ackowledged performance issues on Macs in the past, but the latest patch from June 2016 has not sorted that out, so I would strongly advise Mac owners to wait before purchasing this game until they see some clear indication these issues have been addressed. On the plus side, the little I have seen from the tutorials I have played looks indeed very interesting, with traditional resource-grabbing mechanics being nicely updated by the new trading setting (no direct confrontation besides sabotage and a bit of piracy), a nice variety of factions, and serviceable graphics. Obviously, I would need to be able to play at much more length before being able to talk about long-term playability...			"

The mechanics are great, the UI is great, everything is great except for the part where you have to make real time decisions very quickly. I guess it's good if you want to play to develop your real time skills, but it's not a relaxing game and it isn't fun if you don't like being under pressure every second. You can slow time down. It's a well made game with great mechanics and a fun premise, but there's zero chance I will play this game competitively.			"

								Music:There was one thing I really didn't like much before the last update. It was the music theme which was really annoying. But with the last update there came new main music theme as there also came a smoother UI. ReplayabilityGreat replayability, until now I played more or less only with one faction or cooporation type out of four just to get used to one playstyle and discover different strategies about it. So there is so much more to discover with the other three coorporation and I've already over 20 hours on my steam clock on playing.Frustration:On of the games where you even after loosing had a lot of fun instead of being frustrated. I tried the multiplayer not once as I had enough fun with the single player campaign, so there is much more to find out with MP.Time friendly:Was really worth the money and is one of the games that you come back and play once in a while without need of playing it hour for hours each day.One match goes around 20-40min which is very nice.

												Fun strategy game - you can play clean or dirty if you choose.  I am a big fan of the old game MULE from Ozark Sofware.  This game is not really like it, but you can see the inspiration.  (Not too mention - I bought a MULE from the black market and saw a reference to Dr. Bunten in the game - nice!)There is a market for goods, a black market, and different playable factions with different bonuses (and negatives I suppose).  The commodity market is fun - my favorite was when the computer hacked a water shortage when I had a huge surplus.  Oops :)If you like strategy games, give it a try.  The games seem to last about 30-45 minutes each.  I have only played the computer opponent.  I will work my way up to humans (and probably get destroyed).			"

												I can tell this game was well-designed. The gameplay is tight, controls work as expected, the dialogue suits the theme of the game.That being said, the game wasn't that fun to play. It's challenging no doubt, but beyond that it is ultimately a stressful game. Also unfortunately the online community is dead.			"

												Fun game, well-polished and balanced. A fair bit of depth to the gameplay and systems once you understand what is going on.A bit multiplayer-focused for my taste, but the campaign has enough replayability with the different factions to get quite a few hours of enjoyment from this title, if you think you'll like the concept.

												A very interesting economy-based strategy game. It takes a unique approach to the genre, with combat options non existant which allows you to focus entirely on base-building and economic growth. Multiple difficulties and daily challenges as well as a tiered multiplayer system allows plenty of continual growth.			"

								This game started on the right track. The graphics are great, except the cheesy robot characters or cartoony elements of people. I think the game would be much more concrete if it was a bit more serious. I like the sound effects and robot talk, sounds like AI talking when you're trading, sending off rockets or sabotage. Nice touch.It's a bit hard to start, and to get the system. Limit of placements is making it prety hard to adjust mid-game as reource buying/selling shifts fast.Overall this is a game that I've never seen before. It combines nice elements or building, trading, attacking and excellent system of value and resource gathering. I cannot wait to see it fully developed.			"

								In this game you are the CEO of a company that is trying to establish a foothold on Mars. You balance managing resources and growing your company with nuking your opponents mines, tampering with their water supply, and buying shares in their company with the ultimate goal of acquiring all of your competitors businesses. You buy and sell resources on the open market, and the price of goods is reflected by the supply from you and your competitors, their demand, the distribution of resources on the map, and the demands of the Martian colony.It's a very tense ""economic RTS"" from the designer of Civ IV. This is an RTS more about timings, resource management, and awareness than micromanagement. If you love the city building, economic portion of strategy games like Civilization, but you also like the cut-throat, edge of your seat action of games like Starcraft or Warcraft (but weren't always the best at managing hudndreds of units) then this game is amazing.There is a very distinct feel to every game, and I don't think I've ever played another game quite like this. I think it's a blast, and I can't wait to see where this game goes in the future.			"

								Although this game is still in Early Access at the time of writing, it is clear there has been a lot of work put in and the current form is very polished (apart form the game seems to think my screen is bigger than it is?)There is a lot of hidden depth and subtlety to the game that belies it's otherwise simple UI. If you like the economy side of games like Civ or the Anno series then I whole-heartedly encourage you to check out this game. I think charging full price during early access may be a bit cheeky but upon release i can see this being worth the price tag.			"

												Great game ! I really enjoy it. It's like a RTS without units, new concept ! Lot of fun.You need to buy the opponents.The economic system is really interesting. If you are a lot to sell a ressource the price highly go down.If lot of people need a ressource the price goes up fast.Build your factory and launch your offworld ships.-----Excellent jeu. J'aime vraiment ce jeu.C'est comme un RTS sans unités, nouveau concept. Vraiment top.But du jeu : racheter les entreprises de vos concurrents.Le système économique est très bien foutu. Si vous êtes nombreux à vendre une ressource le prix finira par chuter. Si de nombreuses personnes ont besoin d'une ressource, son prix risque de monter vite.Construisez vos usines et lancez vos fusées de ravitaillement !			"

												With a unique and highly addictive concept the lead designer of Civ 4 (Soren Johnson) has made his own mark on the strategy & resource management genre. This Sci-fi base builder replaces the copy and paste idea of armies and units with varying buildings like hacker arrays (which artificially deflate and inflate price). Additionally units are replaced by an increasingly expensive black market to destroy, steal, and decrease production on competing companies.Offworld is a game that I love winning and still enjoy losing with a campaign and multiplayer ranked system the game overdelivers in game modes, and I HIGHLY recommend this to ANYONE that plays RTS and fast pased competetive games!

The thing that really makes this game interesting is that it's an RTS with out direct control of units and combat. You can use force against other players but its more like subversion.  "

												Fun strategy game - you can play clean or dirty if you choose.  I am a big fan of the old game MULE from Ozark Sofware.  This game is not really like it, but you can see the inspiration.  (Not too mention - I bought a MULE from the black market and saw a reference to Dr. Bunten in the game - nice!)There is a market for goods, a black market, and different playable factions with different bonuses (and negatives I suppose).  The commodity market is fun - my favorite was when the computer hacked a water shortage when I had a huge surplus.  Oops :)If you like strategy games, give it a try.  The games seem to last about 30-45 minutes each.  I have only played the computer opponent.  I will work my way up to humans (and probably get destroyed).			"

								Offworld Trading Company is exactly the kind of game I want to see more of. It reminds me a bit of a resource based board game (Power Grid, etc.) but done in real time. A really nice blend of chin stroking strategy and frantic moment to moment tactics, all without guns and combat! There is dynamite though..There are some problems. The biggest issue by far is the abruptness that games end, at least in the default game mode. It's very possible to be humming along, building your successful empire, and then all of the sudden an opponent completely buys you out and bam, you lose. Uhh, ok.. gg?This comes down partially to the stock purchasing mechanic and partially to the UI being somewhat rudimentary. If the fact an opponent was about to buy you out was somehow *much* more visible maybe everything would be fine. As it stands there is no late game tension unless you know where to look for it. Compare this to combat based RTS games where its obvious your base is under attack and you are about to lose.This game /is/ in early access so I do have hope that the above problem can be addressed in some fashion. Until then, you do get used to if after a while.			"

												Ok this game would be AMAZING except for one really giant multiplayer flaw............ ITS♥♥♥♥♥♥♥BROKEN.  In multiplayer, thereis a ranked system which by itself would be fine.  However, if you get on a osing streak you'll drop down alot of ranks.  Still fine.  But then you realize that there are 21 people looking for a match and you can't play any of them because they aren't your rank.  That's b@llsh!t!  the ranked system should be optional because it utterly breaks the multiplayer system.  IDK how there even were 21 people were all looking for a match at the same time........ it is impossile for all fo them to be different ranks because there are only 10.  If you do not care about multiplayer download this game but otherwise stay away.  The ranked system should be optional for competitive players.  There needs to be a nonranked multiplayer system similar to quickplay.  that would push this game well into the thumbs up range for me.			"

												The real time aspects of it make this game very stressful. I don't think it's OK to compare this game to Civ 5 at all as Civ 5 is turn based. The mechanics are great, the UI is great, everything is great except for the part where you have to make real time decisions very quickly. I guess it's good if you want to play to develop your real time skills, but it's not a relaxing game and it isn't fun if you don't like being under pressure every second. You can slow time down. It's a well made game with great mechanics and a fun premise, but there's zero chance I will play this game competitively.			"

								I played the tutorials and I felt that this game is a masterpiece.You played as a trade company on Mars, the system is quite simple and you would feel relax first time play it. But other compines, which is one of a great settings in this game, could ""kill"" you slowly like cancer - by buying your stock. You can purchase other players or AI's stock, they can also purchase yours. Who own the stock, who own the company. Better company, higher stock price. If your stock price is very high; it will be nearly impossible for others to ""slay"" you. To increase the stock price by trading and annex other companies.The market system is pretty simple. Players sell iron, the iron price falls, Players buy steel, steel price goes up. Supply and demand. You mine the materials and build factories to process them into higher price product.There are also some speical buildings in the game. Cash maker make stable income, Lab enhance technology, hacker control the market price etc.The black market is an amazing setting. It allows players to do illegal activities to damage, interfere or even bribe others' industry. I played aganist AI and I used EMP stopped his manufacturing. He got no money and I started to purchase his stock. Then I annexed him and I won the game.-ProsGreat graphic, not realistic, but beautifulMarvelous music and soundBalanced system and challenges Terrific theme, a landmark of RTSFour totally different factionsDifferent ways to win a gameComfortable Control -ConsCannot play offline-AdviceAdd Workshop and Map Editor pleaseMore planets in sequel, interstellar trade will be cool			"

You can suddenly, and randomly lose the game, and there is no foolproof way to prevent it, nor a warning that it will happen, and once you have lost, you half to start over -- there is no save.  This anti-feature completely saps my enjoyment of the game because its no fun to suddenly lose as your are building your empire and waiting for your plans to come to fruition.If the developer really wants this anti-feature in the game, he should provide a way to disable it when you set up the scenario; that way I can play in peace!

It is definitely different than other RTS games that I have played and I think that is a good thing.  There are some things that I still don't understand about the game (like how to beat an AI that is keeping up with me) though I suspect the black market will help.  I really don't have anything negative to say.  I would like the upgrade for your outpost to have the details of what you need right on the screen so you don't need to keep looking or hovering over it.

The interface is intuitive and very easy to figure out. I haven't encountered any bugs yet, But I've ony been at it 20 minutes or so. It's really nice to find a ER game that isn't total CRAP. All of the comments below refer to the Quick play mode.2/16/151.) The speed of the game doesn't really seem to change. Snail, slow and  Normal are indistinguishable from one another as far as the animations are concerned. Haven't tried the faster speeds yet. 2.) Strongly recommend the SNAIL speed until you are familiar with the needs of your colony in early game play.3.) The detail of the graphics elements could be a better. 4.) I really don't care for the robotic voices at all. All in all this game works really well for an early release.			"

								If you're looking for a long drawn out ""saga"" then forget it as this is ""wham-bam thank-you ma'am"" stuff in comparison to Eve Online (mentioned in a Community thread) OK there's no attacking/ destroying apart from sabotage etc.Point and Click building style game and a ""stock market"" screen to buy sell on and that's the bones of the game.For me, there's no satisfaction playing this game at present, even when you do win, it's devoid, and lacking that certain something that gives you satisfaction when playing a game especially this one given its current state.Go read the Community threads and see for yourself. it has some good feedback and some real negative ones too.This game, for me, has potential and hopefully it will be vastly improved on over the coming months.Hopefully there will be a full planetary map available with a more sites to choose from as ice is only at the polar caps on Mars and so it seems daft to stick to the small maps you are given to play on at present, given the size of Mars.One major gripe is the on-screen text size with regards to game info, it would be nice if the text was more legible, as you could miss some relevant info about the game. I'll give it a 6-10 for now. Given that this game is being worked on and updated and improved on I can see this could be a good game and getting, hopefully, a good following but for now I'd give it a miss and wait. So I won't recommend it to people. For now that is.			"

Early Access Review
								I played the tutorials and I felt that this game is a masterpiece.You played as a trade company on Mars, the system is quite simple and you would feel relax first time play it. But other compines, which is one of a great settings in this game, could ""kill"" you slowly like cancer - by buying your stock. You can purchase other players or AI's stock, they can also purchase yours. Who own the stock, who own the company. Better company, higher stock price. If your stock price is very high; it will be nearly impossible for others to ""slay"" you. To increase the stock price by trading and annex other companies.The market system is pretty simple. Players sell iron, the iron price falls, Players buy steel, steel price goes up. Supply and demand. You mine the materials and build factories to process them into higher price product.There are also some speical buildings in the game. Cash maker make stable income, Lab enhance technology, hacker control the market price etc.The black market is an amazing setting. It allows players to do illegal activities to damage, interfere or even bribe others' industry. I played aganist AI and I used EMP stopped his manufacturing. He got no money and I started to purchase his stock. Then I annexed him and I won the game.-ProsGreat graphic, not realistic, but beautifulMarvelous music and soundBalanced system and challenges Terrific theme, a landmark of RTSFour totally different factionsDifferent ways to win a gameComfortable Control -ConsCannot play offline-AdviceAdd Workshop and Map Editor pleaseMore planets in sequel, interstellar trade will be cool			"

								Just picked this game up on the EA and I must say it is indeed a lot of fun. The game if pretty simple to learn but hard to master, yes cliche I know, but true!If you enjoy resource management games with a slight twist, go for it...Its a blast and the adrenaline rush to outwit and out produce your opponents in real time is pretty sweet!

								This game i think has a lot of potential. that being said i think there are some issues that need some work.the concept that your whole company can just be bought out by one person regardless of who actually owns the shares is just annoying. even if you own shares it won't matter. not exactly how shares of a real company work. so i would like to see that structured/ geared a little more realistically. basically as soon as someone gets the launch pad the game is over. that person instantly makes all the money they need and can just buy out all other companies.next the buildings and utilites that you plop down to give you resources can't be upgraded or anything. i'm guessing that's just an early access issue, so i hope that doesn't stay that way.all in all i think this game has some great potential, but i don't think it's worth it's current price at all. should be more like 10$ until it's been polished a bit. keep it on your watch list though.

								Good game but needs a little polishI’m on my 10th hour of playing and so far I like it. It still needs work but great so far. I love the economic RTS so far my complaints are that the tutorials isn’t all that good and doesn’t touch at all on the black market or the special buildings witch is a very key factor in the game. I also wish there would be a tutorial on how to set up the colonies. After the trial and error when first playing the game and figure out the game and how it works it is great and I love it. The first hours is frustrating trying to figure out what’s going on in the game but after a few YouTube tutorials it’s worth it and is my new favorite RTS. I would say a 6/10 7 or 8 if the tutorials made the game make a little more sense when starting.			"

Early Access Review
								So, you came here most likely wondering: ""Should i buy this early access game? Is worth it?"" Well, the short answer to this is: ""YES"". I'll review some of the game features here and, if you're in a hurry, there is a tl;dr section at the end. What's the game?You're in charge of a trading colony on Mars and you compete with other companies to gain monopoly on the planet. It fits really nice with all the talks going on about an actual manned expedition to Mars. How to win?You have to buy stocks of the other players and gain control of their company. You win the game when you have bought all the other companies. If your own company gets bought, you instantly loose the game.What's the gameplay?You start off with a little cash and ressources (or none, there are options to set it before starting a game). You'll then have to build some buildings (like a mine or a steel mill) to harvest some ressources, be it iron or steel, etc. You can then transform these ressources into building materials or goods which you use or sell on a global market. All the players affect that market; if someone sells a lot of a product, its price is going to go down and, on the contrary, if someone buys a lot of a ressource, its price is going up for everybody.With the money and the ressources, you can expand your colony, buy some stocks or use the black market (i'll get back to it later). In order to build more, you'll need to spend some claims. Claims that allow you, and only you, to use a tile in the game. So, especially at the beggining of a game, the fastest to find and lay claims on ressources is most likely to have the better spots. Those claims are obtained by expending your HQ or bought on the black market. So, the twist of the game is, you'll be struggling with few claims and you'll have to prioritise what building you need. Are you going to try and be self-sufficient? Or maybe invest in a pricey ressource gathering infrastructure? That's the kind of questions you'll be dealing with most of the game.You HQ and your ressource transforming building will need some base ressources that you can mine yourself, or buy on the market (thus making it pricier). When you're lacking a ressource it increases your debt, which affect the value of your stocks. If your stocks are cheap, it's easier for other players to buy and you might loose the game. So watch that debt carefully.Is that it? A ressource harvesting/transforming game?Mostly, yes. There are some researches and upgrading you can do in the game, but you'll spend those hard-earned claims mostly on harvest/producing more. What's the blackmarket?You can't directly attack other players, at least in a classic RTS way. There are no soldiers and you can't steal a nice spot claimed, but you can affect their production with the help of some saboteurs available on the blackmarket. For some money, you can dynamite one of their building or launch an EMP that will freeze their buildings for sometime. Of course, you can also be the target of such attacks and, if you're not defended (with goons also from the blackmarket), you won't know who hit you.Of course, as it is the goal of the game, you can buy other players stocks and then win the game.Is it a good early access?Yes. I haven't add issues with the game crashing. It's working really well on my end and all the features are there. Of course, some elements are still to be updated. As an exemple, there are no dedicated servers provided for multiplayer games, making the game quit if the host leaves the game. Like in the good old days. But, for the rest, everything is there and you'll be able to enjoy all the mechanics.Any other notable feautres?A few. This game has a lot replayability, every map is random generated so no game is going to be like the previous one. A complete game lasts around 30-45 minutes, providing that you're the winner. A few options available before starting the game like a tighter debt or masquerade can add a little something to a game.There must be some downsides, no?Sure, but I would insist that they do not compromise the quality of the game mechanics. Except for the dedicated servers I spoke about earlier, the voiceover is actually horrible. You can't understand half and there is no clear logic in them (like, one faction gets a robotic male voice, then there is a female voice that speaks for them, no apparent reason why). Also, th UI might get a little more responsive, the buttons especially. Events are shown in a small text log on the right, but they should appear bigger since they can greatly affect your game (a shortage or surplus on a ressource can be a random event that will influence the price of said ressources, for exemple).And the price, for about 500mo of game, not that nice graphics and all, is a bit high. But, in my opinion, it is worth it. TL;DRPros: Great gameplay mechanics Actual subject Excellent replayability Fun multiplayer Indirect attacks with blackmarket Out of the box strategy gameCons: Voiceover No dedicated servers PriceIn the end: really great game that will get you an alternative RTS we don't see much these days. If you like strategy games, wargames and ressource management games: this is for you. I recommend it without any doubt. 9,5/10			"

								OTC is an interesting concept. Right now I do find it enjoyable and I look forward to the addition of leagues and ladders. Gameplay is already quite polished and it looks nice. It's an interesting take on the RTS genre and I would love to see more games like this.If I could select one change off the bat, it would be more market information and more dynamic markets. Right now the only truly dynamic resources is energy. Global prices are, it seems, driven by either player stockpile purchases or running deficits, which someone else could capitalize on. I'd like to see the markets function by net contribution and less stockpile driven, so rather than attempting to accumulate valuable goods and selling them off in bulk to buyout opponents have running market contribution. There seems to be a bit too much ""random invisible supply and demand we dont know"" driving market function. Giving us some idea of ambient demand and supply balance or even ""global stockpile"" that determines pricing would be nice, and then introducing exogenous price shocks to randomly shift market prices would be cool too. Something to give the pricing a bit more depth. Similarly, the share ownership function could also gain more depth, giving extra utility to ownership would be quite interesting. Defensive ownership blocks provide no real benefit if you're behind, and spending that cash on buying yourself only means you can't spend it on further expansion which I could see leading to increasingly snowbally gameplay. It seems like it would always be better to build ownership blocks in other companies. Finally adding more depth to the debt system would be quite cool. Right now debt seems like it works primarily as a death spiral - if you don't get your basic resources up and running you just enter a fixed debt growth and unless market prices (which we dont know enough about) swing your way you won't be able to get yourself out of it. Allowing players to manually take on debt in order to boost their economy would be a nice idea. None-the-less its an interesting and enjoyable game on to play on early access release which is a rare find, and with additional work it could become a genuinely deep and interesting competitive game.

								3 hours of gameplay so far.There is a lot of potential here.  I will warn that this game (as of 2/16/2015) is obviously in the very early stages of production.  The most obviously undeveloped part to me is that the tutorials are either buggy or not yet created, so the learning is mostly self-tought it seems like.  I anticipate these components will be added in due time.For the first week on early access, this game is in really great condition.  It reminds me very much of the board game, Power Grid, where the prices of commodities are determined by in-game supply and demand.  If you are waiting around for a strong economy-based RTS, this game is worth taking a serious look at.I look forward to future developments.			"

												While I was expecting to pay attention to numbers, buying & selling stuff, I feel like I've been doing nothing but staring at a spreadsheet for the last 8 hours. Once I understood the mechanics, I found it boring. UI presentation is clunky, many of the voices are obviously text-to-voice. I'd be willing to pay $10 for that, but not the price of a AAA game.The campaign mode has an overly complex presentation, in a way that doesn't seem to really add much to the game.			"

												I bought this on a bit of a whim and was very pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it. A clever strategy game where you compete against rival companies to extract resources, produce commodities and generally make money. It has a simple concept but I think it's executed very well, different maps force you to adopt different strategies and there are lots of different approaches you can take. There are different 'factions' that offer different strengths and weaknesses: these can also make for some really quite interesting and varied tactics. "

												Offworld Trading Company is easily the most exciting new real time stategy game I've played in years. I haven’t had as much fun as this playing a new game since the original version of Starcraft came out over 15 years agoIt's seems to combine the fast-paced gameplay style of Starcraft, with the strategic ups and downs of a game of settlers of Catan (including hexagonal tile grid!), all set on a futuristic Martian landscape with cool background music and sound effects. In Offworld you aren't directly attacking other players, rather you are competing with them to make the most money. Therefore you aren't susceptible to the plethora of cheap rushing strategies that seem to plague military-based RTS games. (such as zergling rushes in Starcraft)The single player campaign is pretty basic, although with the developers allowing the ability to mod the game there is a huge scope for different game modes and challenges to be worked on. Daily challenge mode is currently available for those too nervous to test themselves head-head to online.However it is the multiplayer of Offworld that is one of the most intense, engaging and challenging of any RTS I've played.The action in a multiplayer game starts immediately with an initial frantic rush to grab what you think is the best spot for your base. This is analagous to the start of a game of settlers (the board game version) on steroids, where you literally have about 15 seconds to weigh everything up as the debt counter plummets, before placing your building and getting started. If you are too finicky in deciding the absolute perfect spot, you will often be punished by an opponent taking that spot just as you go to click on it. This puts you on the backfoot immediately, unless you've already planned a back-up spot to land. There are so many variables to weight up simultaneously, in so little time, that even top players can get caught out at this early stage. Is there one large deposit of carbon that would be ideal for a scavenger base? If so, do you think your opponent has spotted it and how long do you think you can afford to wait for the initial debt level to come down before you grab it (hopefully before your opponent). Is there only one small area of silicon on the map that if you can monopolise you will effectively win the mid to endgame by hacking the prices of silicon, glass or electronics up and your opponents will be powerless as they watch you rake in the cash and buy them out. Or maybe the map has barely any water, in which case you plunk your robotic headquarters over that one little oasis, destroying most of it in the process, and slowly sell the remaining water to your opponents at an exhorbidant price. The gameplay is fast-paced, engaging and always full of surprises. It appears to be extremely well-balanced between the 4 factions, with very few strategies that are obviously nerfed. In the midgame you have the choice between 5 advanced buildings which can have a dramatic effect on gameplay depending on which you choose to invest in. I'd recommend this game to pretty much anyone. Go Offworld! "

												This game can be a serious challenge. But unlike other difficult games, this one will not turn you off.PROS: You got to place structures. That's fun, right? I'm not being sarcastic. I mean this. You can choose where to place them (with certain rules of course). Whether it's a combat RTS or an economic one like this, doesn't matter; how often do you get to do that these days? There's a very subtle Sim City feel beneath the surface, which someone of my age appreciates.Smart play is rewarded.It requires you to think. Yes, this is a PRO.It was developed by a man who was an important piece of the Civ III and Civ IV team (say what you will about IV, but I'm one of the IV lovers, and III was fantastic).CONS:While billed as an economic simulator (and it is, that's not a fib) the Black Market mechanic I feel is a bit overused, and makes it seem like a low-key combat type RTS as a secondary. I wouldn't mind doing without it.Learning curve. But don't let that scare you away. If you like to use the Steam discussions forum, there's very little response going on from players, and the few who are regulars can get a little... bothersome sometimes. (But as a PRO, the man behind the game itself responds in the forums!)In general, I am very pleased with this game. It might seem boring and too casual on the surface, but believe me, once you play it, you will see how exciting and tense things can get. Watch as you lose shares in your business! That's a big deal! Better secure your shares! Buy in to the competitors! But how? What can you produce for a profit? What can you ship? What can you take the hit on for having to purchase? You better decide what you can produce and what you have to buy, because if you try to do it all, you WILL FAIL. I give it a 7/10. 8s with me are rare, 9s rarer still and the day I give a game a 10 that's been produced after the golden age of PC gaming is the day Hell freezes over, so my 7 means a lot more than you think.My number 1 tip: Do not give up. Do not get frustrated. Accept when you screw up. There's always something to learn.			"

												Refunded...A cool premise destroyed by a plethora of bad design decisions.  (this all mostly about MP, it fairs slightly better in SP)1) there is NO need for this to be RTS instead of turn-based... in any way, shape or form.  it has ALL the problems every other RTS game has... as far as MP is concerned, it just comes down to who clicks a little faster...2) repetitive - you can not enjoy the mechanics of the game or take them in, AGAIN, because it is an RTS instead of turn-based.  You spend the entire game furiously putting down buildings withut being able to take a step back and make strategic decisions or view your opponents moves... this is ALL you do...3) a horrific tutorial that tells you all of nothing...4) MP games last like 30 minutes... dont know ONE gamer who wants their strategy game, whether it be RTS or TB, to be that short.... not one.5) Feature-wise, it is a $14.99 - $19.99 games, tops.For me, a massive let down.  What bothers me the most, is that all of this could have been avoided with intelligent design decisions.

								Frankly, a really disappointing game (and this is the BETA, not the ALPHA stage of developing...).Also, is REALLY overpriced, for what it give.It's not a simulation game and it's too poor (simple game mechanics and a small quantity of contents) to be a good strategy game.The graphics compartment is still nice, however.And also could be funny to play on multyplayer.But this is also the main problem with this game!It's way too simple, and overpriced, to be worth of buying only for the single player, also at 50% of the current price! (as today 12 €).I requested for a refund, because I think the game itself could be okay, but not at this current price.Sadly, another Stardock product that shows potential but cannot achieve nothing worthy.Give it a try, if you really like multyplayer/strategy game, but avoid it if you like more deep and complex games and simulation style game.

												had this game on my wishlist for 6+ months as was a bit hesitant with the high $$$.  So when there was a slight 15% discount I bought it - regret my purchase now!  I'm an avid strategy time player.. MOO2 is my FAV game of all time, quite enjoyed CIV5 type games as well.  Trusted this was a similar experience... disappointed.Found the user interface really good, easy to use.. though the gameplay got boring pretty quickly.  All about making money to buy out other players.. yawn.  Even without using cheats I managed to win games pretty quickly and the goals got tiring.If this game was about US$15 think would be ok for this spend.. but think for US$30 is too much.			"

												Basic RTS game except you can only build buildings. After dropping an HQ building down you can then put down resource collection and/or processing buildings. Once you build something you're stuck with that tile, so if you later decide you want to build something else you can't move to construct to another tile. Like simcity the game features random events, most of the time they are beneficial like a solar flare increases the power production of solar panels. Other times resource shortages or excesses cause price fluctuations. some events don't make sense like the random auction for a tile no one has built on. Game play basically boils down to finding the rarest resource on the map before anyone else, while tring to not get screwed by the overpowered almost infinite blackmarket attacks from the AI.			"

												It is a Simulation game trying to be an RTS. Matches are short with little variety to any of them since most of the interaction between players is through a third-party (aka the Market). Therefore, you're only competing with players by trying to affect them indirectly. There are some on-use abilities that target players, but nothing that can't be quickly overcome. I did enjoy single player though, but similarly, each game is a cookie-cutter copy of the previous one. Build the same starting buildings and adjust for surpluses/shortages to get the best prices.

The game changes so many things around on you  -- suddenly buildings are locked, and there isnt a way to unlock more than one in the first mission, so you're starving for resources but you dont have enough money to buy through them; the tutorial doesnt prepare you to play the campaign. Meanwhile, early game is hugely affected by starting position, and endgames are 100% snowball.			"

The most powerful competitive edge given players in this game are special attacks you purchase from the black market. With these you can freeze their structures, blow them up, take them over, etc. That's where the most manipulation comes in. The game is really about breaking even then using sabotage to get the advantage. I wanted to like this game but now I despise it. There also should be a turn based mode to remove the ""i can micro better than you"" element that so many RTS games have. There's no reason why this couldn't be a fun turn based game it's set up perfectly for it.			"

With these you can freeze their structures, blow them up, take them over, etc. That's where the most manipulation comes in. The game is really about breaking even then using sabotage to get the advantage. I wanted to like this game but now I despise it. There also should be a turn based mode to remove the ""i can micro better than you"" element that so many RTS games have. There's no reason why this couldn't be a fun turn based game it's set up perfectly for it.			"

								An interesting business realtime-strategy game that demands fast thinking and acting. I like to think that this game is one of those, easy-to-learn, but hard-to-master titles, and when you succeed after a relentless economic war, it is a great feeling. On the other hand it can really♥♥♥♥♥♥you off when you realize that you have made bad desicions and can just wait for someone to buy you out!I recommend this game for anyone who is into realtime-strategy games and economics!

								As a fan of RTS game, Offworld Trading Company has definitely been a refresher for me. It feels very different from the conventional RTS (examples: StarCraft, CnC), but it still plays very solidly as a game in the genre. While it may feel bland at first to know that there is no martial combat aspect in the game, it compensates for that empty space very quickly by bringing pressures in macro decisions. As the name of the game suggests, this game puts you in the position of a decision maker for a trading company on Mars, with range of actions from claiming different plots of land on Mars and trading the goods, to tampering the markets to your advantage (or your opponent's disadvantage). Your goal is to buy out all of your opponents and become the monopoly on Mars's resources.The game is fully focused on macromanagement, which may make the game feel a bit slow. However, that does not mean that it is not exciting. Game gives you a lot of options with very limited number that you can actually choose, so you have to really plan a bit ahead on how you are going to work things out. As time progresses, your choices grow, but you will see that you will constantly be hassled by your opponents and may start facing the danger of being bought out. Your only friends will be your wits and your guts, as you make your own moves to press down your opponents and take control of what they own once and for all.While the game is enjoyable in many aspect, I feel that the snowballing effect may become an issue as people become more familiar to the game mechanics. I guess that will be another thing that will be countered, either by evolution of player strategy or developer intervention. I am just bringing out the possibility.Overall, I would give this game a 9.5/10. Half point off for not enough music. =D			"

								This is a very nice RTS. The only RTS I'm playing now (so I finally abandon AoE and Rise of Nation). So i think the idea worth the price (I've bought it on sale, though). The realisation as well is expensive (good AI, stable code). So I was surprised to see just ""mostly positive"" as a summary of user reviews. I really want this game to be fully published.Point by point:1. No blood. You do not have to rise and command an army. Still, you are able to be offensive and there are plenty of things you do have to command.2. True fast-paced RTS - you can limit your gaming time to one round - to 30-50 minutes. You do not have to do low-level micromanagment, you have to be fast as well as smart. However, there are meditating moments as well.3. Very original. I had to spend an hour just to learn what are the rules. And these are very interesting rules. There are simularities with Civilization (and Catan as well). Still, this is something new for me. Basically, you have to buy opponents' companies. There are different strategic decisions you have to do - which type of base to build, whether to invest or not into intellectual property (patents), wich materials you have to mine, which you are able to buy in the market, which type of energy to choose, do you want to use lending or not. There is a lot of tactics here as well. So.. The rules are balanced and there is a lot to master here. However, they still tune the balance so you might find one day that the game had changed and you have to adopt.4. The rules are tunebale. So you can turn off some of the things people are complaining about in other comments and make the game more balanced and make the ""rush"" stratagy more hard to implement.5. The AI is strong. So offline is challenging as well. Looks like there is online option - never tried that.6. Nice GUI, music and animations. No crashes - high level of coding for early access.So if you enjoy economic part in RTS games or if you enjoy both RTS and Civilization-like games, you defenitely should try this one. This is a new kind of experience.			"

If you are are intrested in this game watch the video that goes along with the screen shots, it really does a good job of showing what the game is about and Soren Johnson doesn't really lie about what its not.  Yes the price is high but its being made a small developer and Stardock, which in my opinion releases quality games.  In the end this is a fun game especially if you can get your friends involved.

												This is a fairly different game, and good.There are a lot of considerations with what the impacts of where things are and what pressures that places on supply/demands.Being close to resources means you will consume less fuel and get the production up faster, for example. If you're collecting resources from far away, you might be paying a lot for fuel. Maybe you decide to make your own fuel, which takes up water and power, but then you'd end up paying for power or have to make power. If you decide to make the power too, is there room left for a profit? Maybe you were better off paying the price and taking on debt. There are similar scenarios to this with building resources, but it's not immediately apparent what the impact of what you're doing on the market actually is. It's easy to look at the $ price of net in/out and say ""okay this farm will cost me $1500"" but it's also putting upwards pressure on construction resources, so if you decided not to go into construction resources, those prices go up. You get production boni for having the same resource production adjacent to each other, so you want to concentrate on a few resources initially, and diversify a little later.There's also the impact of patents (technologies that only one player can get, whoever makes it there first) which can change the game a lot, auctions (where you can take on debt to get a quick bonus), and the black market (the only direct player-player interaction is here). There's also hacking and optimizations, which are straightforward and another player-controlled element that places pressures on market prices (if you produce more of something, the price goes down, and is that really something you want? But if it's something you consume and don't create, maybe it is - but that might encourage others to buy the raw resources and compete in the refined goods you're creating).Patents have the potential to completely change the market (if that person shipping all the resources across the map gets teleportation, the fuel market might crash, and if that's a primary moneymaker for you, then maybe you better take off the market)Black market effects are various things, which usually have something that negatively (or positively) impacts production in an area - which directly goes back to that clustering that the adjacency production bonuses impact - do you hedge a little and spread production a bit so that shutting down all your stuff is less damaging? An interesting one - if you use adrenaline boost, which doubles production of your buildings in an area, also doubles consumption, so you might want to stock up on inputs before using it because your rivals might cut off your supply of the input when you use it.The game has more subtleties than most basically anything else played in realtime, and is a very interesting take on RTS as opposed to the smash armies at each other approach that every other game in the genre does.I haven't bothered with the multiplayer, but I can see it being a very good multiplayer game.

								The best market based RTS I've every played. Of course it's the only market RTS I've every played, but that just makes it unique. The best I can describe it is a mix between Civilization and Starcraft. The current state of the single player is okay. However the multiplayer is superb. The extreme competition of trying to buyout the other players has all the thrills of a Star Craft match, without the need for twitch reflexes. This provides a very different experience from other games. Scratching an itch I didn't know I had. I would suggest getting it for the multiplayer alone. In particularly, it makes  a good LAN/group party game. There's nothing quite like gaining a monopoly on a resource and price gauging your friends.			"

												I love this game, the gameplay is compelling and the whole aesthetic around it is amazing. However, it has constantly frozen up on me, and when the game finally catches up it puts everyone to AI and I’m out of the game making it literally unplayable. It was fine for the first couple weeks, but it has just been awful lately, which is such a shame. I’m begrudgingly going to have to give this game a thumbs down until its fixed, but I’m more than happy to change it once it works again.Specs:Nvidia GTX 1080I5-4690K16 GB Ram			"

												I usually prefer the pace and deep strategy of games like Civilzation but this has more than enough depth to keep it interesting combined with a far faster paced game that will punish you for taking your eye off the prize for a moment.  Really good fun and a good control system which means you dont spend forever simply learning how to do things.  Easy to pick up but hard to master.  Pretty original, refreshing and well put together.			"

												This game is so brilliant I am dumbfounded. If you like to read your enemies this is for you. I would with out qualm recommend this game. It can take a few tries to understand how it works, but by mars. It will leave you crying and raging, laughing and dancing or maybe cooly calculating. The game is based around the ideal that you will be able to turn a profit in a highly intense and tightly planned situation. I have played in the November Tournament and it was great fun! The real show begins when you start to use the multiplayer potion of the game. Please do not get me wrong, the AI is pretty good but the Player on Player engament is very well done! Without reservation this is a 5 of 5 kinda game!			"

								This game was a huge surprise in 2 ways...1. It plays different than i thought. (even after watching videos)2. It's ALOT of fun if you dig into it.It doesnt play like i ""thought"" it would play after watching the videos... yes you have to stare at numbers and if you're not into trading games maybe you should just keep walking and give this one a pass. But the game is just so much fun nevertheless, i had teethgrinding moments against the CPU in the very original campaign (which isn't really a campaign, it's more a series of skirmish maps to see who's coming out on top). Which is everytime different so the replay value is already immense.I also thought it's going to be a bit on the dull side since it's a peacefull game. But the oposite is true, you can sabotage your enemy in many ways that you only start to understand a couple of hours into the game and you're constantly on the verge of an economic breakdown. If you understand what's going on on the market and understand the enemies base you can cripple him where it hurts the most.Your enemy just bought patents so all his energy comes from waterpower ? Let's have pirates camping his watersupplyroutes, or even better nuke away his shiny Waterdepot...There's alot to do constantly and the game revolves in a very fun way. If you play aggressive as in sabotaging your enemy constantly you will be on the map alot to find out what your enemy is planning to do before you can do it to him.I have not found any bugs yet and it's hardly noticable that this is an early access title at all.The game is obviously in early access but it works already really good, so if you like economic games with a little twist you should give this one a go and stick to it. It's surprisingly good.			"

								1-Hour, First Impressions, Early Access, ReviewA good, fast-pased but relativley relaxing economy game.In it's current state, this game litterally throws you into the deep(ish) end. Non-intuitive game mechanics and lack of any true and thorough tutorial makes searching up a guide on build orders and tips almost essential. To give you an idea of the situation; I failed the first tutorial twice because it's not clear, nor does it explain that you have a ""claim"" limit. (more on this later)Once the surface is scratched, and mechanics are better understood, the game becomes much better. Many things in the game will appeal to fans of mass, streaming-economy RTSs. Real-time indirect agression against the enemy player is very remeniscent of other games such a Sid Mier's ""Trains"".The game can be very punishing towards mistakes made, a single wrong move in the early-mid game can spell disaster for your company. One such example is the ""claims"" mechanic, which gives you a limit on the number of tiles you can take before progressing. Take the wrong tile, and even if you remove the building there, you cannot unclaim it, leaving you with an incorrect, useless tile for the rest of the game.Despite it's unforgiving nature, Offworld Trading Company is already (despite being early access) an excellent game with great potential for hours of fun.

It is very well thought out, and there's an easy difficulty for people like me. =)If you like the idea of buying out your competitors and creating a monopoly more than blowing them up, you will probably like this game.

								This game is very challenging to play and currently has a pretty steep learning curve, but it is a really engaging experience. It is interesting how it deals with financial takeover of your opponents (through buying out their stock) as the win condition. I'm not sure I've played another game that used a mechanic quite like that. As I've learned how to play, I've slowly been increasing the AI difficulty and the game has remained fun and addicting. I haven't tried online multiplayer yet, but will probably play against some friends once I've got the strategies down a little better.At the time of my review, the game was early access, and it feels like a finished experience. I'd say the most work could still be needed in the tutorials as they were not the most friendly to learn what to do. I had to checkout some developer video tutorials online to really get the hang of the later (and harder) tutorial levels.I definitely recommend this game though if you are looking for an interesting twist on the old real time strategy / resource management game type. They are doing a lot of cool things with this!			"

								I waited for a good discount before I bought OTC. That's what the reading the market is all about, right? Now I'm a very satisfied customer. I like the idea of economic domination of Mars. Of course the big money comes from shipping resources  back to the earth. It took me many days to get into the league where the big boys are playing. Or maybe I'm not there yet, but I've certainly gained more insight in the past few days from playing and taking notes how the good players are playing.Even though the game is still in beta, it feels like a finished product. Some people say that Mohawk hasn't added enough content, but I think that's what this game is all about. Finding the best stratety with the tools you've been given. And yeah, Soren Johnson, the brain behind this game was heavily involved with Civ IV, so you can't go wrong with getting this game.			"

								It's a RTS. And it's about economics. It's fast. So it's not quite high frequency trading yet, but close. This is about actions per seconds. Not round based empire building. I bought it during the sale for 18 EUR and refunded it after playing for 1½h (a 2h run time limit is just too short in that case, should be also 2 weeks in my opinion).It's okay for what it is, it's just not what I expected to be. For a RTS there are just too many things happening at once in different places other than the map, the most deceiving part that the screen space would be better used for fullscreen info overload and stock charts for each resource. The map itself turns out to be not that important since besides adjacent boosts, the location on the map seems to have little importance. Also would have liked it more, if prospecting played a bigger role.The whole claim and HQ upgrade process just kinds of breaks the flow for me. I really would have liked to like it, but I don't see this evolving into fun for me any time soon.			"

Early Access Review
								A solid game that breaks away from the normal RTS collect 1-2 resources and then send your army over to the enemy to kill their workers because that hurts them the most. In this game you're tasked with laying out a plan to develop your resources in a solid production line. Against the AI you don't have to deal with many hiccups, but unlike what the negative reviews have said about 0 depth, when you get in to multiplayer skirmishes you've now got to build efficiently, and take in to account what they might do to you.For instance, there are 4 factions, each different than the other, if you can keep in mind the resources that each needs, you can punish your opponents my stealing them, or stealing their building, but this may leave you open to similar attacks. Then further from that you have to manage your debt, you might have a short term victory, but if they cripple you at the right time, they can send you spiraling in to debt which will stop you from further attacks or defense tactics.So, to those who wrote ""0 depth"", try winning some multiplayer matches.The pros:- One of the most intelligent queueing systems I've seen, you can practice against the AI while waiting for a 1v1 skirmish, and it saves your game, so next time you're in queue, you can pick up against the AI where you left off.!!- Varied gameplay because resources change and other players playstyles and decisions change per match.- A unique (afaik) game style that focuses more on the resource management side of RTS rather than militaristic side.The cons:- Fewer than I'd like number of players online at any given time, this can make finding matches a headache, and yes playing against the AI becomes less and less satisfying.- If you want to play a match unveiled like a normal multiplayer 1v1 against the AI, you have to start it outside the queueing system, but  from the tooltip it looks like this will change, so it could be an Early Access temporary con.- No queues other than 1v1, (Missing 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, or FFA queues)Compared to many early access games this game is quite polished, I feel like this is how early access SHOULD work, you've got the solid core game, but the blemishes are showing.Neutral things I attribute to early access:-- Lack of player base (Steam Early Access has burned a lot of people)- Voices are mostly Google reader sounding things, except the director who says ""Uhhh, your stock is being sold"" :)- Other mapsTL:DRIt's a solid game, great gameplay, replayability if you're in to multiplayer. It's early access, and behaves like one. Implemented the gameplay first, now it puts on the polish.			"

Early Access Review
								A virtual economy where you create things; sell things; and buy out your competitors. So heres the crazy thing: Its shockingly complexFirst; the AI.the AI knows what its doing but it doesn't seem to want to over-saturate the economy as I'm so keen on doing. Dunno if that was intentional but if you can make a product not at all worth the actual product; it makes it harder for them to earn the money needed to buy your stocks. Second; the black marketIt would be hilarious to blow up someone's mine on a skype call; but otherwise you can basically shake it off. They never really get you to a choking point. Pirates kept stealing really pathetic amounts of water from me, for example (about 30-50 water a minute or so) and it didn't even matter because my production supported beyond that. The worst ones are the magnet storm and emp. The rest (save for nukes which I always buy just to get it out of the game if its being auctioned) doesn't even matter. If you are producing and you're staying afloat; go ahead and laugh. Otherwise its a minor inconvenince.Third; the economy itselfIt's a simple Supply/Demand type thing and is constantly checking itself and I love that. Things feel as if they have value despite being totally meaningless just like in real life.Forth; gameplayThe game is smoothish on my laptop and is graphically pleasing. Its in early access but that's not going to excuse anything. A mine looks a mine and a transport looks like a transport. Each faction looks very different from each other.Fifth; the 'realisim'Each faction has its own voice; but is as well quite robotic. Think Hal 9000 but just slightly less human sounding. Its a bit hard to put into words. the Robotic faction sounds like a male GPS voice, the scavenger faction sounds like a british robot, expansive sounds like a female GPS voice, and so on. Each mine reproduces whatever item its tile says and each tiles material stacks (0-3 but 0 is just a blank tile) and the amount of stuff that exists keeps it interestingMy biggest issue is the games one limiting factor; claim titles. all tiles on the game are fair game but you can only grab x amount of until you level up your hq (up to level 5 and that comes quickly; trust me) And, if you place something down by mistkae; and so you go to destroy whatever you placed on it; well you just wasted material. That tile is yours son. Congrats. Didn't need that carbon? Too bad.  The only way to get rid of a tile is to auction it and the game never actually tells you how to auction things. It just introduces it maybe 10 mins into one of the tutorial missions. Never tells you how; just lets you particpate.My other issue is how the game handles debt. You got two big numbers; the current money you have, and a possible accurued debt. The idea, of course, is to not need to buy things, and if you need to, rather than subtracting it from your current cash; it just created debt that you can pay off whenever you feel like. While that's nice it doesn't feel like a negative. Its not pressing.The game doesn't remind you of the hole you're digging for yourself; it just points it out with a red number and that's it. Each new day it'll go up by x percentage but what does it matter? The only real negative is you don't make any profits (all profits made through like, selling power is funneled to your debt rather than your cash pool) but you can still make money by selling materials; and you can then pay the debt back 1k per click.But why when I don't feel the need to because nothing bad happens.I don't feel punished by the growing red number and I feel that might be an issue.7/10			"

Early Access Review
								Great game! I managed to get 3 hrs of gameplay out of just the tutorials, without doing any multiplayer or campaign mode. So that to me is a great start. The graphics are pretty and the interface is really easy to use. For an Early Access game its suprisingly complete and polished. Unfortunately I did encounter some graphical issues, but I feel that is more because my computer is at the low end of the (mac) system requirements, and not because of the game. The whole game just slowed to a lag fest by the end of tutorial 4 and 5 (so much is going on, onscreen), and the text was fairly unreadable in some areas from the start. Changing the settings didn't help much and made it worse at one point. So if you are reading this for opinions on tech specs, note that game is pretty resource intensive (pun not intended) so you might want to check your system requirements are closer to the recommended than the minimum.That said, I still recommend the game! Its a great resource management game, and if you like that kind of game you will love this.			"

								I enjoyed this game. The UI was a little puzzling at first, but eventually with the help of the tutorials I figured it out and went on to play campaign games. The game sessions themselves last 20-25 minutes, and 8 of them strung together make a campaign, so you can finish a campaign in a couple of hours.If there's a downside to the game, it's that once you're done with Mars, you're done. The game model cries out for an asteroid campaign, a europa campaign, and so on. I also think a longer campaign model with more objectives would make good use of the persistant personnel you can buy in campaign mode and help you make a more custom faction.I'd say this game is worth $10-15 US dollars.

												Well I am very much a newbie as I only have 14 hours of game time so far but it is thoroughly. It's a real time trading game. So it was the RTS feel without unit micro. I've watched several videos of Soren and the top level players and if you want to do well you have to micro the resources you are collecting and making but unlike a traditional RTS these don't move around. Makes it a more enjoyable game to me. Anyway, I would recommend this game to others. I have been enjoying it.			"

												This game is so brilliant I am dumbfounded. If you like to read your enemies this is for you. I would with out qualm recommend this game. It can take a few tries to understand how it works, but by mars. It will leave you crying and raging, laughing and dancing or maybe cooly calculating. The game is based around the ideal that you will be able to turn a profit in a highly intense and tightly planned situation. I have played in the November Tournament and it was great fun! The real show begins when you start to use the multiplayer potion of the game. Please do not get me wrong, the AI is pretty good but the Player on Player engament is very well done! Without reservation this is a 5 of 5 kinda game!			"

Early Access Review
								A solid game that breaks away from the normal RTS collect 1-2 resources and then send your army over to the enemy to kill their workers because that hurts them the most. In this game you're tasked with laying out a plan to develop your resources in a solid production line. Against the AI you don't have to deal with many hiccups, but unlike what the negative reviews have said about 0 depth, when you get in to multiplayer skirmishes you've now got to build efficiently, and take in to account what they might do to you.For instance, there are 4 factions, each different than the other, if you can keep in mind the resources that each needs, you can punish your opponents my stealing them, or stealing their building, but this may leave you open to similar attacks. Then further from that you have to manage your debt, you might have a short term victory, but if they cripple you at the right time, they can send you spiraling in to debt which will stop you from further attacks or defense tactics.So, to those who wrote ""0 depth"", try winning some multiplayer matches.The pros:- One of the most intelligent queueing systems I've seen, you can practice against the AI while waiting for a 1v1 skirmish, and it saves your game, so next time you're in queue, you can pick up against the AI where you left off.!!- Varied gameplay because resources change and other players playstyles and decisions change per match.- A unique (afaik) game style that focuses more on the resource management side of RTS rather than militaristic side.The cons:- Fewer than I'd like number of players online at any given time, this can make finding matches a headache, and yes playing against the AI becomes less and less satisfying.- If you want to play a match unveiled like a normal multiplayer 1v1 against the AI, you have to start it outside the queueing system, but  from the tooltip it looks like this will change, so it could be an Early Access temporary con.- No queues other than 1v1, (Missing 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, or FFA queues)Compared to many early access games this game is quite polished, I feel like this is how early access SHOULD work, you've got the solid core game, but the blemishes are showing.Neutral things I attribute to early access:-- Lack of player base (Steam Early Access has burned a lot of people)- Voices are mostly Google reader sounding things, except the director who says ""Uhhh, your stock is being sold"" :)- Other mapsTL:DRIt's a solid game, great gameplay, replayability if you're in to multiplayer. It's early access, and behaves like one. Implemented the gameplay first, now it puts on the polish.			"

Early Access Review
								A virtual economy where you create things; sell things; and buy out your competitors. So heres the crazy thing: Its shockingly complexFirst; the AI.the AI knows what its doing but it doesn't seem to want to over-saturate the economy as I'm so keen on doing. Dunno if that was intentional but if you can make a product not at all worth the actual product; it makes it harder for them to earn the money needed to buy your stocks. Second; the black marketIt would be hilarious to blow up someone's mine on a skype call; but otherwise you can basically shake it off. They never really get you to a choking point. Pirates kept stealing really pathetic amounts of water from me, for example (about 30-50 water a minute or so) and it didn't even matter because my production supported beyond that. The worst ones are the magnet storm and emp. The rest (save for nukes which I always buy just to get it out of the game if its being auctioned) doesn't even matter. If you are producing and you're staying afloat; go ahead and laugh. Otherwise its a minor inconvenince.Third; the economy itselfIt's a simple Supply/Demand type thing and is constantly checking itself and I love that. Things feel as if they have value despite being totally meaningless just like in real life.Forth; gameplayThe game is smoothish on my laptop and is graphically pleasing. Its in early access but that's not going to excuse anything. A mine looks a mine and a transport looks like a transport. Each faction looks very different from each other.Fifth; the 'realisim'Each faction has its own voice; but is as well quite robotic. Think Hal 9000 but just slightly less human sounding. Its a bit hard to put into words. the Robotic faction sounds like a male GPS voice, the scavenger faction sounds like a british robot, expansive sounds like a female GPS voice, and so on.

Early Access Review
								Neat game!Intersting approach to RTS. There definitely is combat, in a indirect way through the Black Market. The meat of the game is analyzing and exploiting market trends in real time. There are a lot of elements from Sid Meier's Railroads, which is much more visually friendly than this game.This game's AI is quite difficult. I was not able to beat the later tutorial missions. There is a LOT going on, and a lot of it seems hidden from the player.The game definitely feels like it needs polish, but that is what Early Access is really all about, so I am not too concerned there. Currently the UI is extremly laggy and the game itself feels very sluggish, unoptmized on a technical level.I will probably update this review after I play more.UPDATE:After just a couple of days ther ehave already been two patches that address balance and performance issues! Pretty good show from Mohawk games, in my opinion.			"

												I only played like 3 hours of this game and beat it, the only reason I didn't finish it sooner is because I skipped the tutorial. I guess you could replay it over and over again but once you buy out everyone once it's not as fun the second time. If you have lots of friends that want to play this than  it could be pretty fun. Small maps, even with such small maps it bogs my computer down and I can run The Witcher 3 and The Divisions no prob. I bought this game once for 44$ refunded it and got it later fo 15$ on sale.

								It's a RTS. And it's about economics. It's fast. So it's not quite high frequency trading yet, but close. This is about actions per seconds. Not round based empire building. I bought it during the sale for 18 EUR and refunded it after playing for 1½h (a 2h run time limit is just too short in that case, should be also 2 weeks in my opinion).It's okay for what it is, it's just not what I expected to be. For a RTS there are just too many things happening at once in different places other than the map, the most deceiving part that the screen space would be better used for fullscreen info overload and stock charts for each resource. The map itself turns out to be not that important since besides adjacent boosts, the location on the map seems to have little importance. Also would have liked it more, if prospecting played a bigger role.The whole claim and HQ upgrade process just kinds of breaks the flow for me. I really would have liked to like it, but I don't see this evolving into fun for me any time soon.			"

												Still learning the game, here is what I think could be cool to add though. 4 new sectors:1) Merchant Banks. Provide 3 services to the economy.I.	Market makers. That is they buy and sell commodities from the Mines and try to be first in line in competition with other merchant banks, speculating on the price of the commodities’. II.	Bond Speculators. That is they buy corporate bonds from the corporations looking to secure more finance in exchange for an annuity / interest payment, then sell the bonds to investors at a retail volume with a small margin. If the price of the bond looks like good value in comparison to the yield and maturity value investors buy, but if the corporation hits difficult times the high risk (junk bond) falls in price but the interest rate goes up. III.	Venture Capital. That is investing seed capital into startups and IPOing them after they are established.2) Insurance Firms. Provide 2 services to the economy. I.	Collects premiums in exchange for a lump sum payment in the event of damage of PP&E. II.	Sells Corporate Bond Default insurance to banks. a.k.a. Collects premiums from Merchant Banks in exchange for a lump sum payment in the event the debtor forfeits on his/her obligations. 3) Logistics Corporation. Provides 1 service to the economy. ( I know this is not a Mars version of Port Royal 2… but why not? It could be the best space version of a Shipping company game). I.	We see the little cargo ships appearing from the mine and going to the factory but who do they belong to??? Could you own and operate a fleet of cargo ships.4) Wholesaler Retailer. (Still on the Port Royal 2 theme)I.	In some ways similar to Market Maker but with a Wholesale Retail + Inventory management + competitive pricing + Marketing and Advertising Budget to win market share at the colony spin added. 5) Private Security Contractors. (What’s a shipping game without privateers and pirates?)I.	Secure Tender contracts to patrol corporations propertyII.	Escort Cargo shipsIII.	Join the dark side, be hired to raid competitor corporations and sell anything you can salvage on the black market.IV.	Intercept competitors cargo ships, throwing their supply chain out of whack (if they are operating on a JIT system of inventory management) and sell the commodities on the black market.Just a few ideas.

												Offworld Trading Company is a fast speed game where every little action and timing counts and will decide if you get owned or not. The matches are quite short and adrenaline powered compared to Civilization. If you like games like Starcraft, Capitalism and Civilization you will love this one. If you are looking for a Sim City or a Civilization pass your way, this is a completely different game play. The positive side is that the way the game is conceived (A single HQ and 5 levels maximum) allow to play great online multiplayer games, an aspect completely boring or unexistant on more slow pace games.Knowing that, I think Offworld is a great addition to your library !

								The way the campaign mode is currently structured is incredibly frustrating to play, as far as i'm aware the barrier that is put up in front of the player from building structures (mostly those that generate energy) that make the difference being running a surplus and a 200$ deficit can break a game, what is the problem? the engineers you buy before the game are randomly generated, and this does not make for a happy experience.  This may be just a rage sort of thing, but i'm not recommending this game, i was lucky to buy it during a sale. Buying it at the sales price is absolutely not worth it and a very bad idea.

												If you're looking for a game with a developing story or long term strategies, this game is not for you. The skirmishes are short, simplistic, and without much nuance. For me, the feel is too cartoonish and the characters are more characitrues. If that's something you want, then go for it. However, I definitely did not enjoy this game.			"

												The game looks neat... but that's about it. Don't get me wrong it has a unique game style, and it is pretty fun for a few to a couple of hours, but not more than that.GAME INFO- Unlike other RTS games, where the player builds and gather resources to buy armies. Offworld Trading Company is mostly about economic RTS. The player has to claim certain lands, which consist of natural resources, and manage those resources by buying and selling on the market. Each player has a share in the stock market and the prices for the stocks will range on how well the players are doing (The better income the higher the stock price will be). There are special abilities that the players can buy from the Black Market and interfere the progress of other players (I will not give the details but players need to buy this abilities to help win the game). Whoever buys all the stocks wins the game.. and that's, that is how to win the game. It Sounds complicated but it is not. You get the hang of it when playing the game for a couple of hour, but that's the problem. When you start to understand the mechanics of the game it gets boring because the game itself feels very... linear unlike other RTS games. Most RTS you have to strategize your moves and attacks to win the game, and there are so many ways and routes to plan and play which makes you hooked to it for days, months, even years. However, Offworld trading company has limited strategic gameplay... you just manage your resources in the best way to make you profit.MY OPINION-+Fun game :D for couple of hours. -After that not fun :(+If you are into this type of game go for it.-If you are not into this game don't buy it because you will regret it when the game is sitting in your library for years and realize that you had only 20 hrs+ or less of in-game.+Why did I buy the game? Because of Quill18.+Why did I thumbs up? I had fun even though it was for a couple of hours, and I recommend this game for those who are into Economic RTS. -But it is too expensive... So +I recommend this game when the price is low and those who are into this game:p			"

												Pretty good production and market focused RTS. It can be played as a fast paced RTS, or it can also be played as a slow-paced game in singleplayer via slower game speeds and auto-pause features.The ""campaign mode"" is an interesting addition for a series overarching games instead of singular skirmishes. It's a dynamic, replayable campaign, instead of a story-driven scripted one.			"

								It's a compelling concept, really fun while it lasts, but needs a lot more depth if the game is to have solid replay value. That said, it's early access and that additional depth could certainly come through between now and when the game goes 1.0. And in the meantime, unlike many other Early Access games, this one is fun right now. Once you get through the campaign and play a few rounds of multiplayer though, you've probably seen everything the game has to offer. Probably good for 15-20 hours of gameplay today. Could easily be a 100+ hour game if the developers keep going.			"

												So far, I like the game concept and the strategic element.  However, I can't even get past the tutorials due to the fact that the game keeps crashing at random times for no apparent reason.  Yes, in the tutorials.  My rig exceeds all minimum requirements, and most of the recommended ones.  I've played the game for less than 90 minutes, and in that time it has crashed 9 times, sometimes being ok for 25 minutes at a time, other times crashing within 2 minutes.I really do think the game has potential, and if you can get it to run without experiencing this bewildering instability (one of my friends has no problems at all), I'd recommend it for sure, especially if it's on sale.  As for me, I have no choice but to wait and see if the devs can patch the stability problems.  If not, I'll have to get a refund -- who can play a game that crashes every few minutes, especially one that has obvious multiplayer intentions?			"

												Short version, I liked this game.Longer version;At 5 hours of play I loved this game.At 10 hours of play I thought this game rocked all out.At 15 hours of play I was wanting more.At 20 hours of play I probably wont play this game very much anymore.Offworld Trading Company is an excellently balanced economic/base building/strategy game.  But in some ways it is too well balanced in that while there are 4 different styles of play based on the base you choose, those 4 different styles of play have very little opportunity for variation within themselves.Even on the mid-range difficulty levels I found that you had to play a particular way determined by your base type and too much variation was usually a quick way to lose.On the upper difficulty levels forget about trying something new, either you play a flawless game with a very specific and particular build order (and hope you don't get disproportionally screwed over by the black market) or you might as well not have bothered starting the level.Now none of the above makes it a bad game, but unless you are the sort who has a hard-on for the multiplayer experience or grinding out every ""Do X 100 times"" achievements OTC has limited replayability.   I enjoyed my 20 hours of play and have no regrets on the purchase but probably will never reach 25 hours of play.			"

The transitions in building an economy are awkward, the game can get brutally unbalanced for most players of the map, and yet the game will stall out for a really long period of time.The are lots of elements that feel out of your control, and even achieving a monopole will not place you in a good spot.Needs a lot more polish, but the game looks promising enough.

								I like this game and I think it uses a market system beautifully. However, I think allowing the player to set a starting price for their own sale of goods might lead to a more competitive edge in terms of pricing, because the value of goods are not worth exactly what the seller says they are, its up to the buyer. So in a way the market in the game is not a truly free market where the price mechanism reflects the condition of the market because often times you are encouraged to instead sell things that might lend a good profit instead of selling things that ARE returning a good profit. The price of a good refects the entirey of its condition meaning the availability of the materials and the ease of production, and of course, its demand.Other than that minor thing I think the game is solid, however I dont think its worth $35.99. Maybe $29.99.			"

								I was skeptical because this was early access, I liked the developers other works and I figured I'd give it a try.  The Economic RTS is really a big change as♥♥♥♥♥♥moves and market forces can really change a game around.   I really like how maps start unexplored and it is slowly releaved.  You can choose and deploy your colony at any time but waiting till later also has its advantages, if you deploy too early and spend a lot of resources trying to corner the aluminum market you might miss the massive deposit on the edge of the map.  OTC is really about picking the best tradeoffs to get you where you want to go, which is fitting as it's an economic game.   Each colony type has different advantages and needs. expansionists are good at the early game land grab, Scavengers don't need steel and get early warning for random events.  Robots don't need food, but take power instead; and scientists can skip some of the early steps of the production chain by putting factories right over resources.  The early access parts show in that some units don't have detailed textures yet, and they use text to speech instead of voice acting.  There were also a few minor issues I had like not getting an opponents patents after buying out his company.  Overall the game is stable and looks better than most early acess games on steam.			"

								An economic RTS sounds boring, doesn't it?This game, however, is not at all boring. Strangely enough, I feel more engaged as each buy and sell is incredibly significant. Every action you do will have impacts for the entire game, from where you place your initial base, to every limited parcel of land you buy, to what resources you will produce. Each decision impacts your viability against the other companies. Having to decide quickly which resource to forgo as you try to ensure the quickest and most efficient rise to glory is tense. Deciding when to pour your money into other companies to eventually buy them out or buff up your own stock to shore up your financial defenses is tough.If you've played MULE a long time ago, or played Meyer's Railroads! not that long ago, or any of the Anno series more recently and enjoyed those types, this game is definitely the next successful iteration of this very small economic game market. Fast paced and replayable thanks to different factions, tech avenues, and resource availabilities, it comes highly recommended!			"

								So far, I have under 2 hours in the game. However, I've found it to be quite entertaining and deep enough for me. It would be nice to have some more resources to manage and different supply/demand chains, but there is still a full year to go. It isn't a game like Anno 2070 where you build and try to survive, but a faster, leaner RTS where the market is king. I've read a lot of reviews about the game where the AI gets ridiculous at a certain point which should be worked out at some point (it is early access). Watch some of the developer in-house games and tutorials and see if you like what they say. I know I did. "

Check out Youtube Letsplays before you buy to be sure.Next features needed:Please add multiplayer, where everyone is technically host - Right now an mutiplayer session ends for eveyone if the game creator,1 host, leaves.Also please improve mp code, right now it just takes one slow connection to mess up the mp for everyone.MP code requires lots of optimization.For his very high price also please add lots of more content and this new content to be well balanced for multiplayer, please.Thank you.

								My kind of game, it differs from other RTS by using business perspective. It's more like a business war, so don't expect any missile or laser beam. I love the concept, but there still a lot of work to do. Well, it's an early access game so i think it will improve a lot. pros :- new concept- trading- nice gameplay- graphic is goodcons :- i hate the advisor voice. - I think UI need some works- somehow it's kinda laggy in my macbook, but works great in my pc (altough my mbp have a mcuh better specs) "

								RTS that focuses on building your economy and strategicly screwing over the competition. It's still a little rough around the edges but the devolpers want to improve it based on early access feedback. This game is complete but still needs a little bit of balancing. Matches are 20-40 minutes so you won't be stuck playing 5 hour marathons like Civ.			"

								Very enjoyable Economic RTS.To me it feels like a fast paced German Board Game,It combines elements of Agricola, Catan, Power Grid, Puerto Rico, and other well designed Board Games.So far the Developers seem engaged and responsive which is cool.I agree $35.00 seems high, but I am happy paying that price for this Niche of gaming concept which I feel is currently underdeveloped.I have played about 40 multiplayer games so far, and it is a blast !

								This game is great.I'm not sure why people are hung up on the game being in Early Access/beta.  How polished the game is in beta has more to do with the company you're dealing with rather than a universally-accepted standard of development.  For example, Blizzard games in beta are already polished to the level of release.  EA, on the other hand, had no problem with Battlefield 4 being unplayable for several months after release; BF4 would crash constantly on both new and old computers alike.Offworld Trading Company has all the graphics and core gameplay complete.  At the moment, the developers are finalizing the balance among the types of companies and completing alternative modes/winning conditions.  The only main feature that is missing is central hosting by dedicated servers, which is scheduled to be completed by release.			"

								Okay, my first experience of this game is very similar to board games like Settlers of Catan. I try to find nice places to harvest resources, I expand and try my best to gather the most points. Unlike Settlers, there is more to this game that only resource gathering and expansion, aspects I haven't understood or learnt yet. So I lose... But losing doesn't feel like failure, it feels like learning. And that I think is because of the game. It beats you but only to make you learn. Me, I like that. It is a mechanical game, it's mostly about making the right decisions long term vs short term. When I link my only two sources of power I get bonuses but become vulnerable to sabotage. I gamble that I can make it. Afterwards, I get sabotaged and lose some time later, I'm bought out and lose. I play on ""employee"" level (low difficulty) and still I get my♥♥♥♥♥wooped. What I'm trying to say is that this is a challenging game with no easy path to victory, even on a low difficulty and after three playthroughs. Hopefully multiplayer will be equally enjoyable or more. So far I'm very satisfied with my purchase! =)			"

I have not notice any bugs yet, nor is my pc running hot like a few others have mentioned in their reviews.  Thumbs up so far....			"

								If you like Anno, Civ, Starcraft, and construction/citybuilding games, you will like this game. I've never played a more pure economic RTS, and it does its job exceedingly well. There is a small and manageable set of well-defined mechanics which can be combined in endless combinations. It's hard though. You need to be able to predict the future, act on your predictions, and react to competitors at the same time. Try and corner the market. Watch what happens when you have the only good silicon resource and use the hacker array to drive up the price of glass. Suddenly everyone takes our your ability to make power and you go into huge debt. But now you can boost yourself up to the next HQ level and seize those last good carbon resources so you will have an advantage in electronics production and win the game.Unless someone destroys the only good silicon mine on the map. Your entire strategy depends on that one tile. Better hire some goons to protect it.Don't forget...The AI won't.			"

								OK! This game is from its feeling and from the handling more like C&C than Civ. But it still has Civ components. It is, from a gameplay perspective a revolution. Taking the RTS genre into an area that is normally occupied by build up strategy like the ANNO Series or an 4X Game like Civ 5, Offworld Trade Company brings a unique and fun gameplay that is, in itself, quite a revolution. What is it aboutYou play one of 4 factions with small changes to gameplay but no great differences like in Star Craft and land on the face of Mars. Your job is to gather resources, turn them into products and sell them to your competitors or to the Offworld market. The market on the ground changes. If Iron is rare, the price goes up. You win against your opponents by outsmarting them, sabotage them and, in the end, buying their stocks from them. It's quite challenging in the higher difficult levels and provides loads of fun. Even for early access, the gameplay is solid, only few bugs are there at them moment. Due to a lack of single player gameplay I would recommend this game for Multiplayer Use only a the moment. A good campaign can change that, however.			"

								Decent game needs some AI adjustments....The economic concept is awesome however the AI will always gang up on the player even if it is a free for all. One match i got power distrupted 10 times in a row playing against 4 AI...It always seems like the AI has unlimited money. My company was worth over 5 mill yet I got bought out by an AI with no share price and huge debt....Needs more maps differences, I always select the hige map option but half the time map is uninhabitable or the same map with diff resource, so the AI just puts their beses right next to you anyway.... Other wise its a pretty good time spender. Nice concept, decent graphics. Needs more content.			"

								To be honest, I was a skeptical when I first saw this game and read some of the reviews here, though I've wanted a developer to pick up this very concept for years. Thank God Mohawk Games has taken on this title! The price felt a little steep at first, but it's actually reasonable given its replayability, how unique each game is, and the fact that it's not yet a finished project. If you love economic simulation, this game is absolutely for you! The AI is challenging and each win feels earned. While games don't last that long, they're usually intense and full of action. I have literally spent 1/3 of the past day playing this game, and I regret nothing!(Notes to developers: I have found only one glitch in the game- when Goon Squad icons are placed next to eachother they sometimes overlap as though they are projected on a thumbnail and cover up parts of icons in the background. Also, the scrolling mechaning was somewhat difficult to get used to, and though I am used to it now, I think you should consider edge-scrolling would be greatly appreciated by new players.)All and all, really great game. I give it a 9/10, even as is. I am sure that by final product it will be truly great.			"

								This is a true strategy game, where macros and preplaning make little difference. Quick thinking and good knowledge of what is effecting the prices are the keys to winning each round.You can produce aluminium and steel to upgrade for free or take advantage of cheap prices from other players selling off their excesses, however you won't know which is the better move until the game has started and you see what resources are available.Resources are on a first claim basis meaning that you can miss out quickly or shoot yourself in the foot by claiming them too early.The only thing I hated was that you could be bought out too unexpectantly. If you have 5 shares in your own company you start to feel safe, however someone can buy you out all at once and you wouldn't see it coming.This is already being addressed by means of a warning when an oponent is close to having the funds to finish you off however it's not implemented flawlessly at the time of my writing this.It shows its signs of being an early access but for the most part playes like a full release.

								I love economy games. I still play Railroad Tycoon 3. I played all the patrician games and the latest versions (Rise of Venice). This game is an awesome tactical economic game. Several different scenarios string together to make your company better (or worse) over time. I absolutely recommend this game for anyone who likes being a ruthless tycoon where the goal is to wipe out your competition.The only issue is that it can get a little repetitive. As more DLC comes out, I'm sure it will get better and better.			"

								8/10The best, bar none, economic stratgy game I have ever played. Pluses: Detailed economy, Impressive AI, Detailed world to play in.Minuses: Umpolished- base unfolding animations and construction drones (if there are any) animations are not present. Recomendations for players:Do not play late at night- you will keep playing until it's time for work.Recomendations for the devs: A bit more variaty would be nice with the terrain. Also, the deep raveines that nothing can be built in- the random landscape generator needs to use it less.Also, I have found that I can EASILY win using a combination of the robotic base, locating tons of iron, then investing in the teleportation tech. It's worth it.			"

								I have put quite a few hours into the the game on this account and others and can accurate review to some degree. Overall it is a really nice and well polished game already, especially when considering it is early access. It does crash on occasion, and the sound can bug out a bit, but overall I would say that you should pick it up. It still needs quite a bit of balance, as I can pretty much do one strategy and win repeatedly. If you are interested in a more resource RTS, with business elements, give this game a try. Maybe wait a few months for them to add more features and better balance things.			"

Early Access Review
								I would recommend the game. My best friend also owns it so we have spent plenty of time buying out computer players at this point. I see high replay value with both single and multiplayer. The games I've played were played at snail pace with my friend and I against 6 computer players. Each game lasts about an hour or so with either one or both of us claiming victory (I guess it's time to try a higher difficulty). If you are on the fence about buying the game and looking for a close relative to compare it to, try Sid Meier's Railroads. You take raw resources, convert them into something else and prepare to flood the market. Offworld adds price fluxuation, espionage, and rockets to melt down into a pretty kick♥♥♥♥♥game. As with most games, there are things I would like to see done differently. They are:     Being able to move claims. Once you claim a spot it is your forever. So you put out an iron mine, iron will carry us forever- right?? WRONG! Iron tanks and you are left with a claim in the middle of nowhere. So now you are stuck with an iron spot and torn between adding to your already robust power production and bring in an extra $1.00/hour or have a randon electronics factory making peanuts becuase it is all alone.     When buying a computer player out, it would be nice to be able to adopt or use their building principles. For expample. If playing as an expansive player and you buy a scientific player, you should be able to build a scientific steel mill directly on top of an iron resource. Other than that, the game is very good and I would recommend buying it if you are interested in economic type games.  "

								For an early access game it is pretty good.  Most early access games I have tried are usually not without issues, but so far not this one.  At least none that I have found.  It is quite challenging and I have had my share of butt whippings, but yet I still go back for more.  I have not notice any bugs yet, nor is my pc running hot like a few others have mentioned in their reviews.  Thumbs up so far....			"

								Needs a bit more depth, but I am thoroughly enjoying this game so far.  Plays faster than I thought it would as well.  I do worry about that OTC will end up having only 1 or 2 ""perfect"" build orders for each faction.  Hopefully adding more depth to the resources, patents & engineering can prevent this.			"

								OK! This game is from its feeling and from the handling more like C&C than Civ. But it still has Civ components. It is, from a gameplay perspective a revolution. Taking the RTS genre into an area that is normally occupied by build up strategy like the ANNO Series or an 4X Game like Civ 5, Offworld Trade Company brings a unique and fun gameplay that is, in itself, quite a revolution. What is it aboutYou play one of 4 factions with small changes to gameplay but no great differences like in Star Craft and land on the face of Mars. Your job is to gather resources, turn them into products and sell them to your competitors or to the Offworld market. The market on the ground changes. If Iron is rare, the price goes up. You win against your opponents by outsmarting them, sabotage them and, in the end, buying their stocks from them. It's quite challenging in the higher difficult levels and provides loads of fun. Even for early access, the gameplay is solid, only few bugs are there at them moment. Due to a lack of single player gameplay I would recommend this game for Multiplayer Use only a the moment. A good campaign can change that, however.			"

								I've been playing non-stop all night. If you're a fan of RTS you MUST have this game. I haven't played an RTS like this since starcraft 2, (which I still play) 39.99$ made me hesitant but this game is addicting. I haven't even gotten to multiplayer yet. There is so much depth already and with the game still in the beginning process I can't wait to see what the future holds for this game. My suggestion however is to watch the how to tutorials on youtube to get a hang of this game. The tutorials that are built into this game aren't really that great. 4.5/5 stars in my book. It will be 5/5 when the game is finished i guarantee it. I definitly feel like my money was well spent.			"

								hi all, i played the hell out of this game to see how the programing ai works.if you dont know what im on about my review for you is that its fun you should try itnow for the veterans who kick the ai buttgeek hat on here peeps:ai flaws are 1: they wont pay back debt very well. i had an ai with 3 million in its account and due to good sabotage i got them in 1 million of debt and the share value was 0.10 a share, but it didnt care to deffend itself which was odd to me, i spent 18 million on dynomite lol, i was just toying with it to see if i could kill it eco wise but it just keeps going.its too easy to buy your own company and once you done that and taken over all but one ai you cannot increase your company value no matter what although massive off world trade ports seem to de value your share. if you line up loads of shipments. owning lots of stock dont increase your share nore does selling all stock. it would be good if you can increase your share more in the stock you hold and value of stock price. then i would buy the world lol which would also help other players as the value would also rocket up. seems a good point, id like to see that in the game.overall. fun			"

								I've always enjoyed the economic side of Real Time Strategy games. Offworld Trading Company scratches my itch, gets me addicted, and then all of a sudden it's 1am and I have work in the morning.THE GOODThis is very polished for an early access game. Very polished.Games last between 30-45 minutes, which is perfect.The UI is very intuitive and I was able to figure it out quickly.A game with market, economic, and game theory. Yum.Frequent updates from the devs.THE BADThere are still a couple of bugs and balancing issues floating around. The devs are tackling these through the aforementioned frequent updates so it's really not a dealbreaker. And, after all, it IS early access.The AI can be very frustrating sometimes, buying you out in the space of 20 seconds and leaving you scratching your head as to where you went wrong. As with the previous point, this is something that the devs are aware of and they've already taken steps to resolve the problem.THE UGLYThis list is empty, because the game really is very pretty.Would wholeheartedly recommend. In fact, I've already bought this game as a gift for someone else!			"

								This game is fun, though very unstable at this point.  Good graphics, good models and sounds, really enjoyable gameplay, they just need a few more months of beta testing to make it stop frequently crashing.I would recommend waiting a few months for them to get it more stable (maybe April or June).Also, it currently does not support offline mode.  A developer comment on the forums says that offline support for single play is coming, so yea, it's a work in progress.A side note, I find the concept for the game really interesting.  They've also implemented quite a few factor to help level the playfield for all the players involved.  Fun, unique idea, I really like it.			"

								It's a ""like"" from me, but a *very* weak like.  TL;DR - it's fun, but has some definite flaws, and is probably overpriced.  Giving it a 'like' because I still enjoy it, warts and all, but it's definitely not for everyone, particularly at the current price point.This is not a grand strategy game; this is a short and simple ""economic RTS"" that's probably closer to M.U.L.E. than anything else (but not nearly as fun).  Games are played on a small, randomized map, and finish in anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour or so.  The core gameplay is simple: claiming a limited number of resources, game the market and hobble your competition enough to buy out their stock before they buy out yours.  Some resources get consumed as upkeep, many of the rest are required for upgrades or advanced buldings, but at some point you reach a point of self-sufficiency, at which point everything surplus is for sale.What makes it interesting is the various ways in which you can try to kneecap them by limiting resources, either by throwing one of a very small set of 'black market' attacks at them to disable buildings or resources, or by manipulating the market somehow.  Cut off their oxygen supply; don't sell surplus power; sabotage their mines; flood the market with the commodity that they rely on as a cash source.  The supply chains are long enough that there's usually a weak point in everyone's, and finding and attacking your opponents' while adapting to attacks on your own is the main challenge of the game.What makes it not interesting is that there's a strong self-reinforcing going on; if you start out ahead, you have the resources to keep your competitors under your heel.  If you start out behind, it can be almost impossible to get ahead.  By the time you've hit the mid-game (base upgrade level 3-4 where you start becoming self-sufficient) you usually know who the winner is going to be.  The bulk of the interaction between players happens in the market at one remove, so it's sometimes hard to tell that you're competing against other players rather than an arbitrary resource cost.  It feels like more of a race than a fight.There's also some interface issues; it's very sluggish, particularly towards the end of a game, the text is too small, and the graphics are perhaps best described as 'functional'.  So all that said, it's entertaining, but perhaps not at the price point.			"

For example i lost a water pump to an underground nuke but didn't notice for a long amount of time. The notification did pop up at the top of the screen but it is too far out of the way of everything else you're doing managing resources and messing with the black market.			"

Even though it's an awesome concept, the price tag is the biggest disappointment. Would recommend, but might be worth waiting til the price drops. Of course, if more content is added, $40 could be a very reasonable price.			"

								Love this game. Each game is similar in duration to something like Settlers of Catan (except real time). As other have said, it's not a Civ type game where you spend weeks developing a civilization across the world. These matches were made to take about 45 min, and meant to be played comptetively online. That said, the AI is very good if you don't want to play others.Essentially, it plays out something like a Catan match would. You mine resources and then fight for the exclusive production of them. You also buy/sell from/to the 'bank'. Prices of resources are determined automatically by how much people are buying and selling. This means you can take strategies that short a resource you have a surplus of, and when the prices goes up you can sell your stash for a profit (the other players would hike the price up, because they must buy from the bank if they can't produce).You win by purchasing all of the stock of other players. Stock price is calculated by your total value (debt, cash on hand, production rate, HQ level, stock assets, etc.).The gameplay is great. God, I hope the voices get a makeover...			"

								Let me start off by saying that I pretty much hate most of the RTS genre, I don't care for them at all most strategy games I prefer are turn based like Heros of Might and Magic, Fire Emblem, etc.With that said I find this game fantastic from what I have played of it so far. It still is very much an RTS but with the only three real ways to be dicked over being someone sending pirates your way for a short time to steal your resources, flood the market with a resource right before you sell yours driving the price way down, and someone building a building right next to your stuff to prevent you from being able to get an adjaciency bounus. It has all the elements of strategy games I like without the annoyance of people being able to destroy your buildings or units.If you don't like RTS games but like other types of strategy games, you may very well still like this game.  If you do like RTS games then you may or may not like this game since it is heavier on the self strategy side and lighter on the being able to screw your opponent strategy side, so depending on why you like RTS will effect if you like this.For being atleast 10 more months away from being not in early access (currently Feb 2015) since its not schedualed for release till sometime 2016, it feel really well polished with a fairly enjoyable single player campaign and a good multiplayer game as well.  Is it worth $40 in it's current state? Umm probably, I mean if development where to stop today and there be no more updates I think I would get $40 worth out of it, but it's still one that you may want to wait a bit to see how the updates go or see if it goes on sale (I picled it up on sale), but its definitly worth atleast keeping an eye on even if $40 is a bit high for you for something that is not a finished product, it's not like a lot of early access where it feels like a tech demo and then never progresses, it feels like a full game even in its unfinished state. (Though I have not completed the single player campaign yet and so it may need more to it but still).			"

Early Access Review
								This game is a unique RTS game where instead of crushing your opponents with armies you crush them with boat loads of money! You might be sceptical at this and think this will make the gameplay lack complexity and make it numb and boring, and this was a sentiment I held until I've played for a few hours and started understanding the complexity of the game.While the resource amasing in most RTS games is secondary to the warfare aspect and hence simple and mostly automated, this game revovles around its resource system and it works better than I first thought. The reason for this is that there's a dynamic resource market that's central in the game; simply put, if all players harvest iron and aluminum and other metals, the prices of these will drop and further harvesting becomes pointless. If that's the case you want to be the guy that's harvesting the precious food, oxygen and water, and making big $$ while buying the cheap resources the other players conveniently has overproduced. You're a daytrader, buy what's cheap and produce and sell what's expensive. This also means that adapting quickly is the key, and given that's it's played in real time it reminds me more of a high-octane game like starcraft than say the relaxing civilization series.In essence there's an ever ongoing interaction with the other players that you don't see as clearly in war based RTS, where it's all about big clashes between the armies and each player does their own thing in the rest of the time. This interaction makes the multiplayer games super fun, while the play vs the A.I. (""quick play"" and there's some sort of simplified campaign at the moment) is not quite as entertaining but still works well. A comparison with board games like Risk is fitting, and it is perfectly suited for LAN's.There's some additional strategical elements to the game that adds depth; there are ways to sabotage an opponent and there's four different ""classes"" to choose from, a you should make depending on your strategy and the map.It is, however, what I consider to be on the expensive side for a game of this dimension. With some more work done on the campaign, and a proper tutorial (the one in place now doesn't teach you very much), it would be reasonable though, and given that it's in early access maybe that's what will happen.

								I reccommend the game with the following caveats:- The price is high for an early access game (I paid $44 because of the weak Canadian dollar)- The gameplay is stripped down to include only economic forces. This is not Civilization or Anno 2070.- The tutorials are weak, with merely a popup explaining each faction at the start of each game.- I have not completed the campaign, so no comment there yet.- The interface is currently dominated by a lot of fast-changing numbers. You will spend more time looking at the numbers than you will at the playing field- The useful charts (stock price over time, resource price over time) are hidden in another menu that you have to switch out of the game view to get to.- Learderboards and leagues are not implemented yet- The game menus and buttons are not totally polished yet- Fonts were sometimes difficult to read on my laptop screen (1366x780)- Games tend to be one-sided as soon as a player begins to dominate. Last minute upsets are possible, but require skill and timing.-Late-game becomes entirely unnecessary once you get the hang of the mechanics (after playing a few skirmishes), this game desperately needs balancing.The overall game is very fun and fast-paced, much like Monopoly. This game essentially purifies the economic victory modes (domination) common to other RTSs, elevating resource gethering and market tactics to its own strategy genre.			"

								This game is great.I'm not sure why people are hung up on the game being in Early Access/beta.  How polished the game is in beta has more to do with the company you're dealing with rather than a universally-accepted standard of development.  For example, Blizzard games in beta are already polished to the level of release.  EA, on the other hand, had no problem with Battlefield 4 being unplayable for several months after release; BF4 would crash constantly on both new and old computers alike.Offworld Trading Company has all the graphics and core gameplay complete.  At the moment, the developers are finalizing the balance among the types of companies and completing alternative modes/winning conditions.  The only main feature that is missing is central hosting by dedicated servers, which is scheduled to be completed by release.			"

								I like this game and I think it uses a market system beautifully. However, I think allowing the player to set a starting price for their own sale of goods might lead to a more competitive edge in terms of pricing, because the value of goods are not worth exactly what the seller says they are, its up to the buyer. So in a way the market in the game is not a truly free market where the price mechanism reflects the condition of the market because often times you are encouraged to instead sell things that might lend a good profit instead of selling things that ARE returning a good profit. The price of a good refects the entirey of its condition meaning the availability of the materials and the ease of production, and of course, its demand.Other than that minor thing I think the game is solid, however I dont think its worth $35.99. Maybe $29.99.			"

												So far, I like the game concept and the strategic element.  However, I can't even get past the tutorials due to the fact that the game keeps crashing at random times for no apparent reason.  Yes, in the tutorials.  My rig exceeds all minimum requirements, and most of the recommended ones.  I've played the game for less than 90 minutes, and in that time it has crashed 9 times, sometimes being ok for 25 minutes at a time, other times crashing within 2 minutes.I really do think the game has potential, and if you can get it to run without experiencing this bewildering instability (one of my friends has no problems at all), I'd recommend it for sure, especially if it's on sale.  As for me, I have no choice but to wait and see if the devs can patch the stability problems.  If not, I'll have to get a refund -- who can play a game that crashes every few minutes, especially one that has obvious multiplayer intentions?			"

												I was very disappointed in this game. It looks great, sounds great and seems to have great potential. But there is no subtlety in it. It seems to be simply working out the best 'tree' of upgrades and structures and repeating these steps for whatever game (faction) you are playing. Then, when you might just be getting into it, the game is over - either you've bought everyone else out, or they bought you out - there is no tussle.I had very high hopes for this game and maybe that is part of the problem.I've asked for a refund.

												Honestly i am disappointed with this game. I bought it when it was on sale for half price, and i still regret it.It have nice graphics and easy UI, but thats it... After running tutorial you quickly realise there is actually nothing new waiting for you. No actual progression. Each mission is terribly short, lasting 30min at most, and looks exactly like the previous one, just a bunch of random skirmishes. The few first games are actually fun... but after few more it is just plainly boring and unrewarding experience.For me it just feels unfinished, or demo version.			"

The tutorial is too long.Waste of time and money			"

												Other reviews have noted the steep learning curve.  This is true, but I find this to be an acceptable hurdle to overcome.  More dissappointing is the fact that there appears to be a very linear (step-by-step) path for victory that quickly become monotonous.  The single player game mode is also wanting.  If you have a 4 player game with 3 AI players, they will naturally target you significantly moreso than each other, which essentially makes it a 2 player experience against a signifcantly bonus-strewn opponent.Though I bought this game well below the sticker price, I'm dissappointed with my overall purchase.

I do wish there were a few big events or some kind of things that might add more variety from game to game.  But still excellent.  "

It's clear to me that just like in the game, the developer's goal is to rake in the profits.Game is not worth it's asking price, especially when things like difficulty is a DLC. Even the map editor is a DLC. But let's forget about that for a second, after all, the quality of a game isn't defined by it's studio's greedy practices.So is OTC a good game? Well, it's average. You play as a CEO of a company, and your job is to setup a production pipeline on Mars. Along the way you'll have to compete with rival companies, and should you win, you basically monopolize Mars. Sounds pretty cool on paper, but in reality it's underwhelming.Some people might say there's a deep tactical aspect, but that is a lie. The company mechanics will dictate your playstyle, and it won't be long untill you figure out that there is only ONE playstyle, and that's the intended one. Robots pump out power, Scavangers can build with ductape and gum, Expansive can, well, expand faster, and Science are nerds that think they can do things better by skipping resource mining, when in reality they are gimped.The way this works is that every ""race"" has their strengths in different stages of the game, scavengers take the early, bots take the mid, expansive take late, and science take endgame. Obviously depending on the map and resource availability, this changes depending on the player. Unfortunately that's as far as the depth of this game can take you.At the end of the day, every game plays, and ends, the same way. Even after buying some DLC's (things that should be features of the base game) that added some variety to the game, it was hardly engaging. A lack of units hurts the gameplay, at times forcing you to sit and wait, even if you max out the play speed. The endgame is another thing that never changes, eventually the local market gets saturated by all the companies producing pretty much everything, requiring you to build some rockets and export your stuff offworld.Whoever buys the most shares at a colony/oposing company, be it by building modules, fullfilling wholesale orders, or by burying your competition in debt, wins the game. Along the way you can utilize some special ""skills"" which will cost you depending on how often it's used. The price of these skills is shared between players, so if everybody decides to nuke each other's resources pools, the price will skyrocket pretty fast. This is probably the first game that made a NUKE, boring. Like everything, these skills are mostly underwhelming, so don't expect to be blasting things to bits, or building an army. Your one and only weapon is the market, and while certainly a capable and formidable weapon, it's not enough to hold this game against other, more fairly priced and more feature packed products.So ultimately, is the game FUN? That's after all, what counts. Assuming you don't buy any DLC's, you'll have it all figured out in about 4-5 hours of gameplay. It'll take you about 6-7 with the DLCs. After that, it's rinse and repeat. The rest depends on how much endurance you have for the same thing over and over again.I really gave this game a chance, went as far as looking up some of the more intricate mechanics, trying out all the races, in all 3 campaign modes. Unfortunately, as unique this game is, it's also as uniquely boring, at least for me. If you get suckered into buying it based on the thousands of positive reviews, you'll only have yourself to blame when you get disappointed.People are having difficulty distinguishing between unique that is new, and unique that is entertaining.

								I feel that this game had some missed potetntial. I love the idea of running a business, but it isn't worth $40. The gameplay is rather boring and hard, but not hard in a good way. The AIs are flat out better than you if your a starter like me, no matter what mode you pick. I found the mechanics difficult, and there is so much in the game. It is a reasonably good game, and definately has potential, but it isn't worth $40 to play what is basically the same gamemode over and over again, with a really confusing campaign mode. If it is 90% off, get it, but it just isn't work any price above that.			"

												I don't get the hype about this game at all. It's NUTS hard but with no payoff, no big ""Ah-ha!"" moment where the big picture or mechanics click into place in your mind. It's mostly an RNG machine of doom with wild fluctuations in market prices and vengeful players lobbing extremely frustrating hurdles at you until you get bought out after almost half an hour of ""how the ♥♥♥♥ did he upgrade that fast?"". I'm an SC2 and MOBA player and really, really wanted this game to be a moderately peaceful ""macro"" style of game with some kind of rhyme or reason to it but there's so much going on under the hood that is ill-explained or just completely out of reach. The A.I. will kick your♥♥♥♥♥and you won't understand how to counter or even continue. I tried to brush up by reading wikis and the like but it's always a shrug of the shoulders and much touting of the game's intricate market management, which can be read here to mean a flying strategy monster instead of a FSM; a mythical beast pretending to offer some form of planning but instead giving out nothing but frustration.

								It is extremely interesting....for the first few minutes to hours. Its tutorial is...not the best. Very very simplified, and doesn't even explain the mechanics. You buy the game, and it throws it at you and says ""here, understand it. Now play."" The economy market is one of the only good things in this game. It's not resource management. It's not even management. It's just dumb luck. No skill is involved. Not much variety is shown between rounds. This thing happens. Next round, this thing happens. The AI is not hard to beat, on any type of difficulty. As I've said, this game is just full of dumb luck. You can find a good spot to start, or someone else can find a good spot and you will be left with nothing. You don't know where everything is. The game just starts off, putting you in a place where you know nothing. The actual gameplay is also a bit quirky. I find it that half the time I'm just waiting for the prices to change. Now, I'm not the best of gamers, so don't take my opinion as too serious. I just find that this game is not exactly worth $40. Maybe it's worth $15, or even $20, but not $40. So, that's my opinion.Overall ratings:Graphics: 9/10Gameplay: 7/10No Lag: 10/10The game runs very well even for a well designed game like this. I'm no proffesional reviewer, so again, don't take this as a serious opinion.			"

Early Access Review
								An old Civ gamer here and Civfanatics follower. I have played one game so far, and decided to refund it. To be honest, this game has some very good ideas and also it's very nice to see something not combat related in the market. But during the gameplay, I cant shake the feeling that this is more like a visual representation of a spread sheet mechanic. At this stage, it needs to get a longer gameplay (too short at the moment) to be fun and a less simplistic approach (main stream will never play these type of games, you do not need to dumb down your ideas or the mechanics.). Also the end game is mostly decided by what you do at the very early, almost impossible to overcome the mistakes done at the beginning. Regarding depth, the game needs more strategic elements, less mobile-game like mechanics, more things to manage in both macro and micro, and the espionage/sobatage needs to have better visual representations, including some strategic ways to counter.  Environment being mars or somewhere else would have no effect in this game at all.  At this stage, this game is just like an iOS/Android game to have some quick fun but nothing more. It has a lot of potential, but seeing that it has been released on February and mechanics not chaning so far, I am not much optimistic about its future. More or less, in the core, this looks like what you will be getting when the early access ends.			"

								This game is rubbish, waste of money. Even if it's improved for final release it will still be bad.Currently the tutorials are completely inadequate, the UI is very confusing and unintuative and the pace of the game is way too fast. The black market feature totally spoils everything because it causes dozens of events to take places at the same time, impossible to keep up unless you have OCD!			"

								It needs work. I mean, you basically rush to buy each other out each game. There's almost no point. You get all the way to the end, finally pay off your debt, and finally start making profit, and then the AI buys you out - even though you own majority share of the company. Because the game is fairly retawddeed. I mean, you can't just outright buy a company if you don't own enough shares. So why does that happen man? Frustrating? You're damn right it is. It's not even fair warned, it's just out of nowhere a popup window that says you we're bought, and gained 3 trillion dollars that you'll never spend because the game is over, the end, period.And on that note, why is it that we have to buy shares of our own company. I own it right? Or am I just leasing the property... Thought I was the CEO.I like the fun of it, it has potential, it really does. But right now I can barely sit and play more than 2 matches. The buy out feature really kills it.And it needs combat, direly. Lawsuits and disgrunteled employees with guns, at the least. Because by the end of the match you wish you could just run through their company office with a tank and smoke a cigarette afterwards. Virtually, and literally.The ""underground nukes"" are only as rewarding as the sound effect, and that fades, quickly.I'm only upvoting/recommending the game, because I think one day it will be better.And the first 10 matches are really invigorating, until you realize the above mentioned things.Also, be aware that the UI lags. I have a core i7 3930k and a gtx 670, all overclocked, running on an SSD, and it still lags pretty hard - still in beta, to be expected. Just an fyi.It's a bit funny, as a programmer, because they just need to run the UI in a separate thread. It's a simple fix, they just haven't figured out how do it right yet. I personally would never, ever, put UI loops in the frame or frame buffer loop, it's just bad design. If one lags, both lag. Man I wish I had my degree already, so I could get hired by companies like this to fix their games for them. I'm not arrogant, but damn like how hard is it to make a game like this correctly. It's barely 3d, no combat, just numbers and sprites.The AI is probably one massive set of If..Else statements, IN A LOOP. gawd.Great concept, terrible deployment. So far. I will wait for the final release.			"

												If I had to describe what Offworld Trading Company is like, the closest games to it in terms of feel and gameplay are those from the Starcraft franchise, minus all the combat units. That sounded like a good sales pitch to me- I've played a bunch of Starcraft and Starcraft 2 and enjoyed them thoroughly.The problem with this is that if you analyze a Starcraft game, the first few minutes are always the most boring ones- you (usually) just execute some well-rehearsed build order before you get to the more interesting and exciting parts where your units interact with your opponents'- and Offworld Trading Company never gets to that part, by design. There are no units, no army compositions, no micro-management. The entire game is like those boring first few minutes of every Starcraft match, but there's no payoff afterwards.The Free-for-All nature of the game's standard game mode is problematic. The optimal move is to invest in raising your income and buying as much stock for your own company as possible and not waste any money buying your opponents' stock until endgame where the Offworld Market gives you (or your opponents) enough money to win the game. The extremely passive gameplay that the game rewards makes getting to the lategame feel like a chore, and victory does not feel very exciting. You can mess with your foes via industrial sabotage, but it doesn't feel very satisfying when you use it (whereas it does feel annoying when it gets used against you).There is a frustrating lack of clarity as to the game's systems. Last game I played, I had bought out 2 of my 3 opponents, had the most improvements to my production buildings and the most patents, plus the most total land claims... and yet my remaining opponent's stock value was somehow 50% higher than mine. Why was it higher? I have no idea. But his higher stock value meant that he managed to buy me out first, so I lost- and I have no idea what it was that I did wrong, or how to do better next game.I'll end my review by saying that Offworld Trading Company is a very innovative game. I haven't seen another game quite like it and I'm glad to see new concepts like this one take form. That said, for all its innovation, Offworld Trading Company is not a good game. I never really enjoyed any of it, and I would not recommend it to anyone.			"

								Not really so much what I had in mind from the title Offworld Trading Company. Although I do enjoy the game for the most part, the whole stock element of the game makes it not so fun to play. Maybe with proper balancing it could be a nice mechanic, but I'd rather do what the title entailes, be a trading company for offworld shipments and rise to the top. Let the competition go bankrupt, what other purpose does the debt gauge serve? All and all great game, but I just want to have something like an endless mode. Something similar to Adventure Capitalist for when I am bored.			"

In a 4 Players - Free for All game, if you are in the top of the market, instantly the other players will target you, and without defeses (very stupid ideia) all your capitalist empire get Rekt. The map is very big, BUT the limitated resources and the buildings that you can make is very ANNOYING, seriously ? a limitation of constructions that you can make ? It's not like a limit of a determinated building is of ALL the buildings that you have.And 40,00 Bucks for THIS game ? That's the worst part, paying a lot of money that you can use it to buy another game and get a game like THIS.			"

								From lead designer of one of the highest-rated games of all time (Soren Johnson, Civilization IV) comes an entirely new kind of ♥♥♥♥ UP!I was really looking forward to getting this game and when i did i was surprised to find at first it did not dissapoint.  I played through the training missions which had their own learning curve and difficulty and was beaten several times but its all part of the learning to play this game.  However after i finished the training and went into the campaign the problems started.Firstly you choose your team and any purchases you would like to make before the mission begins, things like extra engineers and stuff and then its all go you and up to 3 NPC players battle it out.  You can imagine my complete surprise and shock when i was 10 seconds into the first mission and i get a heads up telling me that the enemy HQ has been upgraded to stage 2 already, ALREADY, they have the exact same buildings i have built so far yet they have aqquired the neccesary 80 aliminium, 80 steel and 40 glass in a matter of seconds, but it does not stop there.The NPC has an unlimited supply of money on hand always buying up stuff from the black market that costs thousands of credits and giving the starting conditions they could never amass in such a short time, as i am writing this the game is minimised in the background still going and all i can hear is scientific colony expanded, and all this banging and crashing as their launching emp after emp after dynamite attack after pirate attack on me again and again and these are again thosands of credits and the cost goes up with each use.Everything you build puts you in debt you buld one thing to cover one debt and another starts draining your resources so you build to cover that and another will start so you build to cover that and the first ♥♥♥♥ing thing you were trying to control is drainging you again, its just a viscious circle of shear repition and failings but your opponents are buying this and that and upgrading at a blinding rate and then like i mentioned earlier attack after attack after attack, your left with not much enjoyment at all.Then theres the heads up you have lost this amount of whatever to piracy.... piracy? when in the hell did the game mention piracy? Oh thats right it didnt, you sit there and watch these messages appear every second one after the other in the HUD you have lost this to piracy, you have lost that to piracy again and again and all your resource rates are firmly in the negative forcing you into this bottleneck of no recovery.  This game could be fun but when your being steam rolled every match due to an overwhelming NPC and its never ending trust fund, fun is then a very hard thing to find and the game becomes stressful and a complete horror to play. I want to like this game i really do but its broken, very badly broken and unoptomised i feel as if im just hosting an arena everytime i play so that a group of NPC's can battle it out and im just observing, hopefully future patching will sort things out but thats the problem with early access games you end up getting such a bad taste in your mouth from the game in question and alot of the time like myself, you never play it again.

Oh thats right it didnt, you sit there and watch these messages appear every second one after the other in the HUD you have lost this to piracy, you have lost that to piracy again and again and all your resource rates are firmly in the negative forcing you into this bottleneck of no recovery.  This game could be fun but when your being steam rolled every match due to an overwhelming NPC and its never ending trust fund, fun is then a very hard thing to find and the game becomes stressful and a complete horror to play. I want to like this game i really do but its broken, very badly broken and unoptomised i feel as if im just hosting an arena everytime i play so that a group of NPC's can battle it out and im just observing, hopefully future patching will sort things out but thats the problem with early access games you end up getting such a bad taste in your mouth from the game in question and alot of the time like myself, you never play it again.

The map is very big, BUT the limitated resources and the buildings that you can make is very ANNOYING, seriously ? a limitation of constructions that you can make ? It's not like a limit of a determinated building is of ALL the buildings that you have.And 40,00 Bucks for THIS game ? That's the worst part, paying a lot of money that you can use it to buy another game and get a game like THIS.			"

								I do not write reviews for games.  I will also say that I quit preordering PC games due to the fact that a lot are released with many bugs (SimCity) and/or are stripped of many dynamic features of its predecessor, such as recent Civilization games.  However, I took a chance with this game as it is the first early access game that I have ever purchased.  I am shocked at the stability of the game and how much fun this game is given the fact that it is early access and within two days of release.  This game is worth the cash, especially with more on the way in regards to content.  I have only crashed once in my 14+ hours of gameplay.  Yes, there are things that could be balanced or added to increase the length of each map.  Also, I believe that the maps could be bigger, but they are nearly the perfect size for the current content.  The tutorials could use some work with directing you, but I learned quickly outside of the tutorials in the actual single-player after the AI beat me a couple of times.  Regardless, this game is extremely enjoyable, especially the single-player campaign.The single-player campaign adds a new dynamic that I find intriguing.  You are against a number of AI opponents going for different locations on a planet.  You do not face the same combination of AI opponents, usually, on the different locations.  If you win the map, then you (or the winning AI) own the map and the perks/income associated with the map are the winners to use for the next location.  Also, the remaining AI battle for some of the other locations while you are playing your map, but never more than the remaining opponents can fill up.  For instance, if there are 8 players including you, then you choose the location that you want to play.  The location can have one-three AI players (2-4, including you, of the 8 total).  This leaves 4-6 AI to battle for 2-3 of the other locations.  After every match, new locations open up.  Depending on the victory conditions (how well you win), you increase in the leaderboard of that campaign.  As you move through the campaign, you use your income to buy new engineers to enhance or unlock buildings, same for the AI winners of other maps.  Each map is different in size, terrain, rules, and some have events such as “dust storm,” which lowers the efficiency of any solar plants built on the map.This game is definitely worth buying as is and even more so knowing that the game will have more content added due to how early in the ""early access"" we are.  I highly recommend this.For those interested, I am running on:i7-4790kGTX 780 Ti16 Gigs RamWindows 8.1 Pro			"

								We're on Mars. Resources are limited, and trade is king. Who needs large armies or airforces? Not us. If we want to destroy an opponent, we can nuke their resources, buy up all their stock, or even EMP their bases. The more you play, the more you upgrade. The more you upgrade, the  more claims you have on Mars. Be warned, just because you have more claims, doesn't mean you will win. You still need to make use of those claims to the best effect. If you've gone and claimed a bunch of resource nodes, it doesn't mean you're king, without the ability to smelt things. Got that under control? But what about air, water, power, fuel? Miss out on those limited Geothermal Vents? Well instead of awesome power production, you'll be stuck with solar, which doesn't work at night, or wind, which is less than 25% as effective as the vents, when you first start out. This strategy game requires actual strategy. You can't zerg rush the enemy base and win.Conquer Mars using brains, not brawn.			"

There isn't much grinding in this game in single/multiplayer. More so in campaign on a low resource map.Single/Multiplayer is enjoyable but may get boring after sometime due to rush.Campaign seems to be more thought out and enjoyable. It has a lot more strategic game play.There are some small bugs but that is expected for a Early Access Game.All in all this game has a lot of potential, especially when single/multi becomes more balanced/finished.

Keeping in mind, I've only run through the tutorials at this point, and I do seem to be having some issues with graphics lag (this is likely due to my rig being slightly underpowered, can't be helped). But the simulation, particularly (for myself) with having to balance getting the resources you need to keep yourself afloat opposed to selling off resources to crush your opponents... most exhilarating mental exercise I've had in some time.

								This review is written during Beta.OTC is an expansion/economics game which combines a procedurally generated map (replete with varying forms and quantity of resources) and a 'market' feature in which you trade the resources with other in-game players. The enjoyment of this game comes from using your awareness of the overall availability of resources on the map to predict which will become more valuable as the game progresses. Do well and your personal stock price raises; buy out 100% of the stock in competing players to win the game in the default play mode. Matches take anywhere from 10 to 25 minutes in my experience and are usually enjoyable all the way through.			"

								OTC is an interesting, if frustrating sort of economic RTS game.  Despite the fact that I have yet to actually win a skirmish vs cpu game (though, I think this is largely to do with finding my footing) it continues to draw me back in.  It feels a lot like a cross between Sid Meier's Railroads competition with a dash of Settlers of Caitan thrown in.  I found it enjoyable.There is no combat, so hostile actions are all indirect.  It's all about managing economy.This kind of game may appeal to you if you happen to like games like Banished, or any of the economy based Tycoon games.			"

								OVERALL REVIEW:8/10ABOUT:Offworld Trading Company reminds me a lot of a business simulation I played in college called MARKSTRAT. In Offworld trading company your objective is to buy out all of your opponents. There can be only one man left standing. You start and scan a planet for resources, and then select one of 4 factions: Expansive, Robotic, Scavanger, or Scientific. Each of these factions has several unique traits. Expansive has extra claims so they can build more, Robotic only needs power and electonics, scavanger gets early access to black market items and uses carbon instead of steel, and Scientific can put buildings that need resources on hexes that have that resource thus reducing the amount of claims they need to use: EX you can put a steel mill on iron without any iron mines and produce steel. My oppinions of the 4 factions are below. The game also has a black market where you can buy things to better your faction like extra claims/protection from enemies or undermine other factions with things like underground nukes. It also adds random auctions that go to your debt, which can really help if you need to save a geothermal vent for later in the game or are in desperate need of another claim. -Expansive: (Best)(1) This is in my oppinion the best faction. The extra claims they recieve make it much easier to be the first to get a HQ lv5. This faction will generally be the easiest to get the offworld trading export rocket, which is almost always a sure win. -Robotic: (Good)(2 Tie) No need for water, fuel, food or oxygen. Rush for electronics early and have some power and your society will almost never be in debt. -Scavanger: (Worst)(4) Inless the map has high carbon contents and low iron, this faction is a no-go. See what I said in cons about the black market issues. -Scientific: (Good)(2 Tie) Great faction for maps with a large amount of water or low iron. You can keep costs way down if you build your food supply and fuel/oxygen supply on this water. A great strategy is to build two steel mills at the beginning of the game on iron since you dont need an iron mine.PROS:-This is the most original game I have early access played since Minecraft. I think it has a ton of potential. -The game is pretty fun, and I think it will be much more fun when multiplayer isn't just player hosted.-To play a round takes generally around 30-40 minutes, meaning it won't take all day.CONS:-$35-$40 is just flat out too expensive for an early access game like this. This game should be in the $20 dollar range. I mean you could buy Skyrim for $40!-Big issues with the black market: No matter what faction you choose or how early you settle, the AI will always get the first action in the black market, meaning that by the time you get to it, additional land claims will be more expensive. This in my oppinion, defeats the point of going with the scavanger faction.-Random events are too extreme. In the real world an oversupply of a resource will not have it go from $100 to $1. I would like to see these events toned down. Perhaps a oversupply would lead a $100 dollar resource to become $40. -Offworld Export Rockets are ABSURDLY overpowered. The first person to build one will generally win the game. Generally this will be the expansive faction. -The game ends too suddenly. All of a sudden someone will get rich from the offworld exports and in litterally 2 minutes after this is built the game is over. "

												The game can be fun in single player (after the ~10 hour breaking in period where you lose every match), but the AI has such an advantage in multiplayer games (just through being able to react instantly to anything that's happening, anywhere on the map) that it just winds up being incredibly frustrating when you can't pause/slow down the game to compete. I enjoyed playing the single player once I got the hang of it, but bought it because it's advertised as having a ""dedicated co-op mode"", and regret buying it - for what it is it's not worth the price at the moment, and the co-op is basically non existent.The multiplayer also lags like a ♥♥♥♥♥, which just adds to the frustration.

												Min-maxing, the game.Really dull, looks amazing and like a base building game but what you are actually doing is selling and rebuilding said base over and over again, so you can play a game of chase with a bunch of numbers down the side of the screen. There is no grand strategy to this game, just a perpetual micromanegemnt battle to min-max harder than your opponent and shift what you make and sell as the prices shift; a real one trick pony.The learning curve is also very steep for very little reward. Having payed for this game i've forced myself to play it and try to get to grips with it but it's been a miserable experience; the worst part is you pretty much always never know why they did better than you, their off screen min-maxing of the market was just better than yours.It's a strategy game where the enemies strategy is mostly hidden from you, no chance for counter attack, no chance for a change in strategy and the black market is just a win more tool for the best min-maxer.

								Imagine the gameplay as being a sexy girl you hook up with in a bar.  You bring her home, and while getting laid youre thinking ""this is great, im almost there!""  And then just before the climax, she pulls out, put her clothes on and leave while saying ""you lost""This is how this game feels like.  Its a great game, its got a great recipe, but the core mechanics coupled with the victory condition (you buy all your opponent shares to win) makes it so the game stops really abruptly and you never feel like you could really achieve what you were meant to do. I still recommend this game as im pretty sure the developers are going to adress this issue since probably 572 out of the 573 reviewers are complaining about this issue, but as of now if id be you i would hold on until they get their♥♥♥♥♥♥straight or else, especially with the rather high price tag, it WILL feel like a luxury escort taking off with your money before finishing you off!

												It seemed great at first, a economy / builder game. But then you see what it really is. A weak RTS that you play in twenty minutes flat. And a boring one at that. Pick a resource, hog it and hope others need it more than you need other resources.The only difference is some basic mechanics between the factions, and the black market.The black market gets more expensive the more you use it, and the only thing it does is delay or destroy things, or stop other from doing the same. A simple binary PVP system with exponential cost. BORING.The AI? Boring, the moment you look anywhere close to winning, the AI will nuke you into orbit with the black market, something you can hardly do anything against, and it just delays the inevitable. If you're not winning you still get annoyed by those black market shennanigans but it means that the AI will beat you anyway. Simply put, flat, boring gameplay, the only spikes are annoyance. Might be mildly fun VS human players, but then I'd go for a real RTS instead of this binary system where the richest wins ANYWAY.			"

												First Impressions say this is not a $40 game. I would pay $10-15 for it. As such, I got it in the Humble Bundle deal, so I am satisfied with how much I paid. Also, my first impressions say that it kills a bunch of the fun (for me) to be unable to make a bunch of land claims and build a lot of factories. With that in mind, if you are looking for factories and owning the map and stuff like that, I would say this is not for you. You might want Transport Tycoon Deluxe, Industry Giant 2, or Sim Country.			"

												This game is near unplayable. I question the need for the core game mechanic Black market which give you the option of using underhanded means of targeting your enemies. The Black market makes the game near unplayable in certain circumstances like when enemy players or AI can work together or alone to disable large portions of your facilities. You won't be able to almost anything about it due the only sole defense option, Goon Squad, only works for about half or less of the black market attacks. This is under the assumption that you even got to use the Goon squad because sometimes it is unavailable for example during the campaign some missions don't include the Goon Squad. Even in the case where you have a Goon Squad on a facility that facility can still be attacked unless the facility is targeted directly instead of as a consequence of another building being attacked in the vicinity it will not be triggered. Even worse is that in most circumstances you have to put buildings of the same type close together to get adjacency bonuses. Otherwise the buildings effectiveness doesn't provide enough resources you need in enough quantities with some exceptions depending on what resources you are using the most. In the end considering that this game is not an early access game but a full release you can't count on these issues being fixed so I can't recommend that anyone buy this game.			"

								UPDATE: Again the old saved campaign are gone ... stay away form the game--UPDATE: The game improved a lot since May, still I am not sure if now the campaign will be saved across version, but I should say huge improvements. I would way few more months to buy eyes closed, on May I said: ""maybe if you can find it on sale at 3.99 or so it worth a try, but not it is not a 20+ quid game."" right now I would pay up to 8/9£ for the game------The game was ok, funny and fast,  challenging and quite addictive. With the last update it is now not possible to play. To slow to react, everything is slow, a huge step back on performances  none of the major issue are solved, I still cannot play the campaign as at the end of any level I need to reboot as no menu comes up and I cannot go back to the osx as all the special keys are disabled by the game, I tried to not at full screen but the edges of the window are so not precise that I cannot scroll or click the top icons.I also realised that you cannot resume a campaign if it is form a previous version of the game.Maybe if you can find it on sale at 3.99 or so it worth a try, but not it is not a 20+ quid game.-----			"

More reports such in demand or supply curve graph for player to learn the trend of the specific productions.2. More reports such in transaction log to check specific player previous transactions. Espionage tech is required to read others reports.3. Show live demand and supply value of specific products.4. More description are required for the colony, hardly find out what is it when first time playing the game.5. Check on specific productions that who is selling it while who is buying it.6. Maybe more informations on the share of the company, like it Price Trend Graph.			"

												The game is not very deep in the sense that its pace and variety of game elements are designed to be more of a board game nature. On the positive side, that makes matches not as long drawn out and the mechanics easy to learn. The campaign is more a set of challenges the game generates, e.g. you can't build this building or that particular resource is very expensive.Fair enough. Brownie points for originality.But what really turns me off this game is the lack of traceability of why you lose a match.. Suddenly the AI just buys you out and that's it for you, while you stare at your ever growing debt, and wonder how the hell the AI keeps spamming out buildings and upgrades so fast even at the medium difficulty levels. It's very hard to recover from a bad start, no real gradient of improvement because once you optimised your base, the match is already overIt really feels like ""Super Meat Boy"" became a tycoon game. It's made for masochists, who want to start over and over again.			"

												Nope.  Single player / against AI is pretty bad.This game has no excitement to it.  Instead of attacking you can harass and annoy, but its just a boring resource management game.  Limited construction since you get a certain number of tiles you can build on.  Try predicting and riding the waves of commodity prices.The only resource economic game that I enjoy is Settlers of Catan.  I don't get the point of this game, this would be better as a board game maybe 10 years ago.  Since you progress at an exponentional function, if you get too far behind, well there's no coming back.  I feel like this game is a ""pick your strategy"" and hope you luck out. "

								NOT MAKING A RECOMMENDATION ISN'T A NEGATIVE REVIEW.With that out of the way, I like this new trend of using the RTS format to create a game of economic superiority. I enjoy the prospect of colonizing Mars, but I do have to admit that there only being four factions does somewhat seem like a limiting factor. Perhaps some other colony types along with a wider array of black market trickery and an expanded array of structure types?Overall, I like the concept and would definitely like to see more updates for the idea. Unfortunately, at the present I can't recommend purchasing the game for $40 until it leaves early access. I do enjoy the idea, and don't regret that this is the first early access game I've bought, but I suggest to everyone else that you standby until they finish polishing things up.			"

												After playing this game for a few hours I think a better name for OTC would be ""Mars - the spreadsheet"".Lots of numbers, lots of tweaking numbers. I love playing strategy games but I don't OTC to be much fun. The references to the classic Dan/Dani Bunten game MULE had me fooled. I was hoping for an elegantly designed game with deep strategy, a modern take on MULE. There is nothing elegant about the design of OTC. If your idea of fun is trying to figure out whether paying a couple of thousand dollars to increase the price of a resource by five dollars for 20 seconds is the optimal strategy, OTC may be the game for you. So many choices to make but none of them are particularly interesting.If you want to get a feel for the level of mind numbing detail in OTC, read the free Almanac before buying the game. This poorly written document is chock full of formulas - this game must have been designed by a programmer. I'm a programmer myself, but I don't want to tinker with formulas for fun.I've heard of other Stardock games being referred to as spreadsheet games. I thought OTC might be different but it seems that Stardock lacks the creative energy that is essential for creating compelling games.			"

Example, One of the factrion starts with only solar panels and no way to store energy. This is seriously criplling.The dificulty levels are also way too unbalanced (from too easy, to playable, to you loose, to Ef you puny human)The DLC are also insulting. One allow you to lenghten or shorten the campaing... there is no content just tweaks.This makes the game frustrating. I would ask for my money back if I hadn't bought this on Humble. "

The big problem is that there is very little mechanics, and while they work, they get boring very very fast.If you are lookig for this kind of game but more single player focused and more polished go buys Big Pharma.For multiplayer thou, this has a lot of posibilities. Simple mechanics allow for new player to compeet easier as there is not too much depth that needs to be learned.			"

												I really like the business aspect of the game, but the overly simplified game design ruined it for me.I think the designers aproach was to simplify the game until nothing else left, but only the elements that make the game mechanics work. I do not like this approach in PC games, the lack of freedom is very disappointing, when I want an experience like this, I play chess.			"

												I wanted to like this game.  It's very easy to learn and four different factions that each play differently is a nice idea for an economy game.  The problem is that it's just not fun.  You can max out all your buildings in about ten minutes and after that it's a game of fine tuning what you are producing and manipulating the market to drive prices up.  It's almost impossible to lose money so there's never any worry about that.  The only real point is to make money faster then your competitors so you can buy them out.  Offworld Trading Company is a good idea that just didn't work out.			"

The tropes of greedy industrialists debasing resources is over played. I came back to the game with the intention of recommending it to an economics class for the market based resource management mechanisms, but unless the class is also linked to a Marxist characature of capitalism or induistrialism I wouldn't bother.Is it too much to ask for a game about economics, resource management and business to reflect those things in a positive light? It's like building a game about evolution and building in anti-science tropes. Still not recommended.			"

												An interesting-enough game, but you hit the ceiling pretty quickly. Got about 5 hours worth of learning before the basic build orders clicked and after that it just became staring and spreadsheets and ""solving for X"". Was convinced to buy this in early access by someone who ""couldn't put this game down"". I haven't played more than 3 hours in the last year - just enough to check in and see what's improved. The answer: not nearly enough to justify the AAA price tag. Would be recommended at about a 3rd the price, but I guess Soren Johnson can't conceive that a game he worked on wasn't worth the big price tag.			"

Early Access Review
								This is the first game that I had to request a refund for - so that right there should set the tone for this review.For an economy RTS the game is very lacking in ingenuity and gameplay. It takes the consept of 4X gameplay and strip it to the absolute bare bones of the consept. You search for resourses, you claim the land, wait, repeat. The honestly is not a great deal more than that. Yes there are ""upgrade"" options and ""special ability"" options but the actions feel quite hollow. What also makes for a very big drawback for the game is that its tempo is very high and rounds could easily go by very quickly. I really do not see much hope for players in a multiplay enviroment who fall behind early (this part I did not experience, this is merely my impression). Essentially, from my perspective in any case, a player who falls behind by a step or two, they will be on a perminant treadmill until their demise with little hope of recovery unless the opponent makes a mistake or a♥♥♥♥♥♥break.Again to book-end a previous comment I made, this game is very hollow and a waste of money.

												Good visuals and an easy enough to learn game mechanic, but it very quickly becomes about using black market elements rather than actually leveraging the (actually functional) economy and taking advantage of resource availability/price fluctuations.In forcing the user to use the blackmarket options just to survive the narrative seemed to be desparately trying to present a particularily negative view of Capitalism too, which for a £30 game with little substance past the first 30 minutes was a bit rich of the developers.

												The game could be so much more than it is.Building is not really enjoyable because you are limited to a small number of buildings. Plus there is no in-game advantage to building sensible supply routes, all route capacities are unlimited, local storage is unlimited.Trading is not really enjoyable because there is no real market, sold resources simply disappear you can sell more than the others are willing to buy. Buying shares is a joke and does not work like real shares at all.Combat is not really absent in that a key element of the game is destroying eachothers buildings. This makes the game unenjoyable to me. There is also (unrealistically) no advantage to being friendly to your neighbours, there is no AI dynamic in that view at all making your opponents feel like a bunch of 5-year-olds.All in all another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ time-busting game like candy crush.

I can't see any patterns to the movement of the market and cannot successfully complete all of the Tutorial game missions (I've completed the tutorial).I'm disappointed with this game.

So when this game was announced, I watched and followed it like a hawk. Except I kept and maintained my distance. OTC was like a woman I'd see in a bar every week, it seemed love at first sight. She was beautiful, intriguing, like no-one I'd ever seen before.. But alas I was always drunk when I saw her and I had no courage to approach her, buy her a drink, get her number, maybe take her home.It was like this for months. The more I found out about her, the more character that she seemed to divulge, the more personality she put on display, the more I wanted her. Moving up the ranks in my little black book known as a wishlist. The more I came to the bar, the more she'd flash (sale), the more of her clothing (Price tag) she'd remove. It was at this point, I knew she was flirting with me, and it became apparent she's was now bundled in gold. So a weekend in mid-October she returned to the bar wearing 65% off... This time I was not drunk, I was no longer on the fence... I saw her for what she was, so after flashing my credit card, I finally took her home.After a 6 hour session with her... I have to say, she's rather intense. She showed me the ropes, showed me the many facets of her personality and showed me step by step what made her tick. Then she untied me and let me get to work on her...At first she was easy. I kept winning her charms, satisfying her needs... Things were going smoothly, she allowed me to tackle a single element of her, and then she ramped things up, adding more and more, asking for more and more. Things began to get more and more intense... Then she showed her true colours. The more you play her, the more she dares to push you. She becomes a shady, manipulative, dirty scheming devil woman who will push you into a corner, pin you there, and drain you economically for all you're worth.The thing is. You will not learn to back down. She leaves you wanting more, she wants to be dominated. Taken control of, but she isn't going to let you have it without a fight. In my case on a couple of occassions, she's kept up with me with everything I throw at her, and just when I'm about to get the upper hand, she will kick me down and laugh in my face... I should be humiliated. But I cannot get enough of her. I will keep going for the long-term until our relationship is exhausted. Until she has no more to give and finally submits to my own superior evil ways.. Just like she taught me...Offworld Trading Company... The game is indeed like a woman who wears the trousers, makes all the rules, is controlling of you... But wow, what a woman she is... My only regret is that I didn't take her home sooner.			"

												Definately not worth $40.  I found it to be repetitive after a short while, which means boring.  I guess the DLCs make the game more fun, but maybe if some of the DLC had been in the actual game to make it, you know, fun, I  would not be leaving a bad review.			"

Early Access Review
								Has Nothing to do with Saving Humanity. Or turning a profit.     More like a debt Simulator 2015. No Content Updates since i have got it. Buggy, crashes, Desync/lag issues and on top of that WAY too simplistic for anyones liking. Just because it has a well known developer behind it doesn't mean that they know what they are doing. Such as this case. Absurdly Expensive for a game with Close to nothing for content.  Great game to test out the refund feature on.			"

												Game is bright and shiny and new, then after the tutorial you've seen everything game has to offer. they also kept place holder voices in the main game from EA, and speaking of EA.The EA peeps got all dlc for free but get screwd over for a free key for friend, and there isnt a discounted price to upgrade to deluxe for EA peeps (i understand that we should be thankful for free dlc) but if there would have been a heads up people would have bought deluxe instead of standard. especially since the price during EA was 40 usd and the deluxe is 39.59 usd which is less but not by much for the EA version. That in itself promotes hatred and discrimination to people who supported the developemnt when the game was utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ those who shelled out 40 bucks get jipped out of a key for friend due to there was never any mention of a deluxe edition containing dlc and key.Since it came out of EA the game hasnt changed much since, outside of a few graphic tweaks and asset changes for claims, and the new campaign UI it's still pretty slow paced unless you fast forward. MP got a wealth of maps today during release from the ""Real Mars Map Pack DLC"" which you have to pay (unless you were EA or bought deluxe) $4.99 USD ontop of the $29.99 sale going on till May 16th 2016 then it will be $39.99 + $4.99. But, it does add 30+ maps which can only be used during skirmish and MP. So the campaign wont be given a boost anytime soon(if ever).There really isnt much of a story unless you make one up in your own head pretty much I.E: ""I just got promoted to CEO and the Investors want to see positive returns on their investments"". or some nonesence. All you do is start small become big buy out everyone during rounds of mashed up skirmishes against the AI. A.I... well that is a joke actually the A.I. would rather fight itself till theres only 2 left plus your company dring each of the ""campaign"" missions then tries to buy you out but, cant because since you were left alone you accumalated the funds to buy out the other CPU's and bought stock in your own as a defensive measure.So, if you were looking for a Tactical rts or an RTT with combat and what not, well you wont get it here Off World Trade Co. takes the RTS genre and flips it over to peaceful times. Where you must expand your company on different parts of mars and take over your competitors one at a time till you own their claims on the map. There isnt a big difference between how the game is played from skirmish or MP or campaign (with campaign being a tiny bit different with upgrades you can buy before each round in the campaign) then end goal is still the same make money buy people out. Think of it as a futuristic version of the Family Board Game Monopoly on Mars. With the added benefit of a Black Market. This is where you can very very loosely say is the combat mechanic (if you want to call it that, i don't) you can buy extra claims to blowing up a mine of an enemy or just cause a riot and gain all the materials for yourself for a period of time. There are others, like pirates, and so forth but there really isnt anything there to keep you wanting to come back and play more. I got severely bored with OWTC around 5 hours thats me playing campaign skirm and MP. It feels as if they gave you an appetizer, burnt the dinner portion and was out of desert, which makes you unsure if you should even keep it installed onto your computer. As for myself i will because i got during EA. Also, if you dont care about the free key for a friend Don't buy the deluxe just buy standard and dlc and save yourself 5 bucks.As for a recommend or not i don't the game shows all of its cards too quickly and becomes rather dull after the ooos and ahhs pf shinynes, and there isnt much complexity once you complete the tutorials, you do exactly the same as tuts, just a little bit faster and you win everytime. MP just feels like a sped up version of tutorials make as much as you can, black market people, buy them out without being bought out yourself and boom thats it. "

												Way too restrictive to the player.  The limitations of what you can build on a planet is just plain stupid.  Let them build where they want and when.  But oh no, you have to build close or stuff takes too long and you end up behind.  Then all your AI opponents gang up on the Player and shut down his economy with no way for the player to get out of it.  remove the ability to attack others or put a lock on it so gang banging can't happen.  Just make it so yopu can affect yourself only and not affect others.  That way you have to outwit them on a one to one basis and ganging up is never an option.  Losing because the other businesses use better tactics is fair and equitable.  Losing because they all bum rushed you early game makes this game one for the scrap heap.It's not that they punish you for mistakes, the AI can and will gang up on you at every chance and shut down your production and earning potential.  Then they get away ahead of you and there is not a damn thing you can do to catch up.  Get some cash ahead?  They come along and blast all your money makers into ZERO production and your back up funds disappear in seconds.  And when that attack ends, one of his buddies hits you again.  being constantly gang♥♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over just amde this another lazy♥♥♥♥♥crappy AI game that will spend it's life in the ""Do not play this $&*&#* pile."" After the attacks end, your back waiting till the AI gets far enough ahead to focus on something else.  By this time your so far behind, the only way to catch up is to cheat.  Since the AI seems to be programmed to do exactly that, it just makes this game terribly frustrating and no fun at all.Definetly not worth the $45 bucks.			"

								If you think Railroad Tycoon would be a better game with these game features, then Offworld Trading Company (OTC) would be for you:1. You can bomb your competitors' train stations, railroads and related structures;2. You can hire bandits to rob the opponents' train cargoes;3. You can use EMP to shut down the competitors' train systems; and4, You can sabotage the power supply of your opponents.I'm a fan of business / economic simulators and I don't think the above military / criminal / terrorist means of competing should be the gaming mechanics in a business sim. When I play a business sim, I want to use business / economic strategies to outsmart my competitors. I have no interest at all in using any military or criminal ways to win. Honestly, no matter how much AMD dislikes Intel and Nvidia, AMD wouldn't hire criminals to bomb or sabotage the opponents' fabrication plants, right? When I played Railroad Tycoon, I had the feeling of being the CEO of a growing railroad company. However, when I played Offworld Trading Company, I just felt like being the boss of a mafia business using criminal and military means to hurt my competitors. I don't like this feeling at all. The game description says there's ""no military"" in OTC but I think this's completely wrong and misleading. The in-game black market offers all the ""dirty tricks"" mentioned above to sabotage your competitors' businesses. I'm not sure whether this black market will change later, but, for now, I don't recommend this game to fans of business / economic sims.			"

												Immediate complaint: Binary gender options wholly enforced. No 'they?'Overall complaint: Tries to be funny and interesting but feels like its trying too hard and thus falls into the uncanny valley of comedic intent-looks like the real thing but one can't shake the feeling of unease that something isn't quite right.Gameplay complaint: Too basic - once you have a general understanding, you succeed easily until the game begins to cheat. If you have to make a game where the tactic is cheating from the computer-driven players, then you've designed a system that doesn't have enough layers of complexity to bretain interest, or build effective skill to compete.

								I've had my eye on this game for quite a while, and it's been developing into a very competitive strategy game:Randomized maps force you to improvise and play every game very differently, and slow and relaxing phases with time to think about your strategy intertwine with phases of extremely fast-paced deciding and hectic stock market action. The futuristic setting on Mars rounds the game off into an entertaining sci-fi strategy title.If you enjoy ruthlessly exploiting your players by hogging the rare resources and buying them out one-by-one, this game is definitely for you.

								This game has promise.I have only played it for 2 hours but after two losses against the AI I won.It takes a while to figure out the UI but once you get to know it it's easy.The game needs some tweaking on the graphics part as the mouse pointer must be offset somewhat above the +/- buttons in order to work. Also when playing with seven AI's it get's a bit slow from time to time. So far I think the game has potential and if you like not having to kill your opponents and fokus on trading it's a nice game.The prize feels a bit high and I'm expecting more from this game in the future to feel comfortable with the prize.

								A definite change of pace from your typical RTS game, and actually quite relaxing on easy settings.There's a lot of interplay between the resources you scout for early and the market values.  Depending on how you start alone could change the entire challenge.  Right now, a game session is a relatively short experience, even on 'snail' pace.  But you're never too long waiting on anything to do, just that it ends quickly once you start steamrolling.  Personally, I do think there need to be some additions to make for a longer, more drawn out game.  Perhaps additions to the 'game market' as it were, such as land taxes, worker pay, and maintenance costs that scale with how much you expand in order to make that money you make more than just something you dump into a bank. (And we mustn't forget making those values something you manipulate that alters production and profit.) And of course, random events that further aggro those values.But overall, if you're the type that play an RTS in that way where you like to watch your forces build up into a mighty base rather than actually attack and crush the enemy as soon as you can.  Try this game out.  Its current brevity can even be useful if you want to kill time, but not a lot of it.Give it a shot.Also, someone needs to get on the dev team and get some better quality audio for the vocal parts...  Decent quality graphics and gentle music, and then literally the microsoft 'sam' and female equivilent for audio cues.			"

								There are few games in my opinion that warrant a good review beyoned a few simple words. This is one of them. RTS fans will love this game. Strategy and long term planning is a must. There are no tanks, no soldiers and no real weapons in this game. Everyone plays right on top of eachother in a mad battle for resources and stock. The objective is to Buy Out the other companies stocks. You will first chose a class, there aare 4. Each one is unique in what resources they require the most. You will build buildings and mine resources and sell them and balance your money. You will set yourself up to buy out all of the other players stock. While this may not sound like much fun, the game is extremely fun in my opinion. It is a different type of RTS that you will come to love. The first day I got it I played for 6 hours straight. Addictive personality aside, it is that much fun. Please buy this game and support the growing community as well as the dev's. They have released a bug free polished game which is a huge task for any dev. The game is easy at its core to learn, but deep enough to keep you wondering for a while. There is MP, SP & Skirmish. They have thought of everything. Give it a go and you will not be sorry. Hit me up for a game too!Peace!			"

												This game is like a market war with some buildings coated with some nice scifi.The matches are around 30 mins up to an hour, that is surprisingly short for a ""CiV"" game.So short matches but intenseI will be sincere: in single player I would have gotten bored after 2 games, because thisis the kind of game that any AI can beat an human just optimizing the number. Butplaying with a friend is very different. I have loved each match! Since the first one(me and a friend had not play any tutorial before) where we learnt together. Laterwas all the time trying to guess what is your friend thinking and play the market in consequence.So play it with friends!			"

								For a game that looks like simple buying and selling this is surprisingly fast paced. You can't simply build a load of factories and sit on them, you have to keep an eye on other players and react to what they and the market in general are doing. There's that horrible moment where the buyout percentage starts appearing next to other player's names (showing that they're more than 50% of the way to buying you) and the scramble for as much cash as you can scrape together in a hurry. That being said if you're more of a casual and methodical player you can freely pause games with the AI to analyse your next move, which has helped me out quite a bit!			"

								Even though it says ""Early Access"" - this game is by no means an early access game. It is better than a lot of retail released games that I have bought in the past.There are three main reasons for this:1) Replayability - you play on a randomly generated map every time, so it never gets boring, you always have to be on your feet because you need to adapt your strategy based on the map.2) Fun - It is a fun game. It´s created by a top notch game designer with a great team behind creating the game. They organize community events and communicate with the players.3) Jack-of-all-Trades: No bugs, very informative UI, very nice graphics, fluid gameplay. The game has it all.Oh there is one more thing. The game features a brilliant campaign mode. I am usually not a Singleplayer gamer, I like to play against people. The only exception to this being Offworld Trading Company, and Paradox´s line of grand strategy games. The campaign is fun and challenging at the same time, putting a different spin on the game.---A word of caution though. The game is by no means dead, but it can be hard to find players at certain times. This may be due to the early access status and due to the niche category this title sits in, it isn´t a mass market game, as it does require a deal of intellectual capacity to succeed at the game.

Early Access Review
								A decent RTS game with some novel elements. 5/10 (6/10 considering early access).Very close to the CIV, tile like RTS, with limited tile ""claimability"" which means the strategic element of tile selection very important. Resource system works very well - it does play a lot like C&C in that regard and may lend itself too much to systematic builds (i.e. there is an optimum build order, stick to it or loose). There isn't a huge level of replayability there which is why I chose to write the review early - essentially the resources available adjust the location of HQ and thats it, every game plays out very similarly. A bit more depth in the building system and more to the takeover mechanism would make the game more worthy.Currently a good game to give a go if interested in RTS/builders. Consider waiting for it to be on special - not worth the current price.PROS:*Novel importance of the resource system, buying and selling is what this game is about.*Limit to the number of tiles makes claim selection very important* Resource system works very well, straight forward to use.* AI seems to work fairly wellCONS:* The Black Market system is opaque and seems redundant. The features become very expensive very quickly, and it is difficult to see how they really assist the player.*Resource tiles are largely irrelevant for most building types - find proximate resources then clump buildings together (doesn't quite come across as worthy)* Some of the controls are difficult to use (for example selecting a building to bring up context menu for deletion it - it keeps exiting the interface!)*Takeover system needs more depth and more response posibilities once the count down starts.

								So far so good. The economy still feels like it could use some tweaking here and there, but nothing seems to really stand out. At least not until the endgame.    I'm not too sure if the endgame should be changed or not. On one hand, you definitely don't want a game to drag on and someone should end up being a clear winner. On the other, there does seem to be a snowball effect where when one player managed to buy out another the guy's finances start to snowball and soon just starts thowing all that money around, making it darn near impossible to reverse.    Of course, that seems to be the way of most economic games, so maybe it's just me. Only played against the computer a bit, so can't say for sure that it's a 100% great game, but I'd say so far it's been worth the money. If you like the building/improving aspects from the 4X games *coughCivilizationcough* then this will probably be up your alley.    Summery: Not bad, seems a bit unbalanced in the endgame, hope things get better. Definitely looking forward to seeing how it goes, though. Not sure it's worth full price of the Early Access. I bought this when it was on sale for $20 and frankly, that feels about right for where the game is currently. Maybe $25 or so. Once it's finished should be worth a good full price, though.			"

								Crunchy economic simulation.  I haven't noticed any bugs in the game thus far.  Modest learning curve might turn off people who don't enjoy number-crunching.  Economic model isn't hugely sophisticated (try the board game Arkwright if you want a real brain burner) but timing really is everything --- in construction, auctions, using the black market --- you name it.  The AI is pretty aggressive, and will keep you on your toes.  I hope to see a bit more nuance added to this as development continues, but it remains challenging.			"

								It's a pretty engaging game, and runs ~okay~ on my backup laptop with HD 3000 graphics (~15fps on low settings, but hey, it's not like reaction time counts in this game). I agree with a youtube reviewer though: there needs to be a mode where price of stocks is modified so that the end-game takes a lot longer to reach. You can just be enjoying yourself and, all of the sudden, the game's over. I'd also say $40 is a bit steep to ask for, given what's available now. It is only early access, so maybe they're adding more later, but $20-30 feels like a more fair price as-is.			"

												This game is like a market war with some buildings coated with some nice scifi.The matches are around 30 mins up to an hour, that is surprisingly short for a ""CiV"" game.So short matches but intenseI will be sincere: in single player I would have gotten bored after 2 games, because thisis the kind of game that any AI can beat an human just optimizing the number. Butplaying with a friend is very different. I have loved each match! Since the first one(me and a friend had not play any tutorial before) where we learnt together. Laterwas all the time trying to guess what is your friend thinking and play the market in consequence.So play it with friends!			"

								For a game that looks like simple buying and selling this is surprisingly fast paced. You can't simply build a load of factories and sit on them, you have to keep an eye on other players and react to what they and the market in general are doing. There's that horrible moment where the buyout percentage starts appearing next to other player's names (showing that they're more than 50% of the way to buying you) and the scramble for as much cash as you can scrape together in a hurry. That being said if you're more of a casual and methodical player you can freely pause games with the AI to analyse your next move, which has helped me out quite a bit!			"

								This is a great game that actually uses strategy instead of clicks per minute to determine who wins. There are many different ways to win. It's tense and fun. There is an element of fighting because you can sabotage the buildings of other players. Multiplayer games are quite fun. I recommend the game. It's fun and different.			"

								I agree with the other reviews, its a good game, which is as far as you could stretch, but certainly not worth its price tag. £35 can buy you a decent game from a top publisher, where did they come up with that price? Its campaign is repetitive and somewhat boring. Skirmish is repetitive and doesn’t bring any new challenges. Nothing like the popular RTS games your used to, which it aims for, unfortunately this leaves it disappointing and you end up selling huge chunks of resources at the end, regardless of cost and buy out your last opponent. Over and over, its too repetitive and lacks any flare. "

								This review is an early access one and even within days of me buying the game some significant changes were made, so I expect lots more changes to come.This is one really good concept and whilst there are issues with it (especially in teaching a new player how to play and how the systems and concepts work), there is soooo much to like here. The game does away with military conflict and the necessity to be able to hotkey or mouse-click quickly to win. Instead, it requires forethought, palnning, deception and a little luck to do well. I'll admit, it took me ages to get my head around some concepts and I'm not sure I'm there yet. I have yet to play a multiplayer game (this is my major criticism at this stage - no-one online at this point but hopefully numbers will grow) and have only just started a campaign, but I've already put in 14 hours at the point of writing this in skirmishe and doing the tutorial a couple of times. There are some really interesting game features too, such as being able to play a single player skirmish while you wait for a multiplayer lobby to fill (which helps avoid the hwole thing where people log on, check for ten seconds and then leave), a team based multiplayer option and a single player mode that works differently to the multi and skirmish modes.Pros:- Great amount of tension within the game- Replayablility Every game is different- Accomodates various playing styles (with 4 different bases/classes that are reasonably balanced at this point)- shrewed tactical gameplay- Various gameplay options across all game modes- Games last for between 15 minutes and half hour. Not a Civ styled game at all.Cons:- Tough to learn. The turoial is pretty much non-existant and many finer points that will have you scratching your head will not be answered without visiting the internets and YouTube- No-one on multiplayer yetOverall: I feel like I am only at the beginning of this journey with this game and  with updates that make the game a little more unique on each play, the game will go from strength to strength. It is fair enough to say that I am a fan!			"

								OTC offers a very unqiue approach to Real Time Strategy games. No armies that need to decimate your opponents base, but trying to out-trade your opponent so you can buy out their stock.There are some sabotage/offensive actions (known as the black market) where players can buy some one time actions that can destroy or freeze buildings, steal resources or protect you from such attacks. There is however a cooldown of one minute until you can buy the next such action, so while the Black Market definitely has a good influence on how to play out each game, it's not the only thing to focus on if you want to win.In a way the game works a bit like Settlers, where you build production chains for resources you need (you need Lifesupport for your colony (Food, Oxygen, Water), Electricity for your buildings and Fuel for transporting resources around. )What makes this game unique is that you can also simply buy these resources with money (that you make by selling other resources). So at any point and depending on the price, you might simply not get into these production chains and just buy the water cheaply, while producing expensive electronics or something.Of course prices change, depending on how much players buy and sell a certain resource which means you can't simply sit back and wait, assuming everything stays the same as when you first established a production chain.Then there's also dept, which means, if you need a resource but don't have the money you will accumulate dept, which you're gonna have to pay interest on every now and then. The reason this has an impact is twofold. One is that it makes your stockprice cheaper (and thus you're easier to buy out), the other is that there is a bond-rating that will fall further and further and make you pay more and more interest each time. And if your bond rating goes to ""D"" you can no longer use black markets, making you both an easy target, as you can't defend yourself anymore and you can't fight back. So on the one hand, dept is good for you, cause it saves you money, but let it go out of hand and it might singlehandedly lose you the game, which I find a very interesting mechanic.Prices are also one of the most intersting ways to ""attack"" and opponent. Did they skimp on input materials cause they were so cheap when they established production? Why not buy up a bunch and see how their production turns unprofitable?See that they try to monopolozie a market? Build a hacker array and make prices go down.What makes the planning so crucial is that you have a limited amount of claims (i.e. you can only build a certain amount of new things each hq level). So if you make a mistake planning it will come back to haunt you later.The last thing I want to mention is that multiplayer maps are procedurally generated, making each one a different experience as the last. On top of that, since you have 4 factions to chose from, each game starts with players having to analyze both the environment, resource distribution and black market to make the decision which faction to make and where to land. All of which have a huge impact on how you will play that particular game & map.All in all, there is already a lot of depth in the game that makes it worth playing (imo). However, I bought the game when it was 50% off and I'm not sure I would've bought it for the current 40€ price tag either. So maybe wait until release and see if the price comes down a bit (or if they add enough content to make it worth the pricetag).			"

								I'm recommending this game.  I do so with a bit of reluctance.  I purchased it on sale, and for the price I paid, I think I got a good deal.  I personally believe every game is priced at what people are willing to pay, and those who whine about ""not a top tier game"" or ""the devs should lower the price"" are idiots.  Still, I think it is fair to say a game should be recommended if it gives value for the buck, and at the price I paid it did.  At the nominal price, I would be so happy.Pros:* It takes a bit to learn, and the tutorials are not that great at teaching.  But I could figure it out at the easiest setting, and then I read a user guide to understand the underlying strategy.  With just 8 hours of play, I can handle a moderate level of difficulty and have a decent challenge while using nearly all the available game strategies.* A single round can be played in 20 minutes.* The pace is interesting.  It is kinda of slow at fast, and then at some point you'll get the clear upper hand (or not) and the end game comes fast.* The pace means you can think about strategy, which is what I wanted from the game, but then you don't need to wait long to learn if you made the right decisions.* The graphics are decent.* The game has a good amount of complexity.Cons:* For such a complex strategy game, the pace is almost too fast.* Some aspects seem important, but I have yet to find them critical.  Without providing spoilers, I'll just say the transport of goods, the offworld market, and the patent system don't seem balanced correctly.* It is a work in progress, this is both good and bad, but for the price,  think it needs more progress.  I don't think it is as close as the devs suggest, but if they clean up the degenerate strategies, then this will become a pro.* The stock concept is a bit too simplified, and other than its role in the endgame, it is rather pointless.  This could be resolved if the parameters for the price were explained thus opening up strategies to manipulate shares.  One guide gives some suggestions of strategies, but if that's all it is, then stock system is a con.* What's the point of the town?  Is it only for the pleasure dome?  Because I can make nearly as much money putting the pleasure dome near my own base.  Is the town what is buying the goods?  If so, why only have transports to go to my base?   I have rockets to get goods to market off planet; what gets goods to the city?* I guess I'll have to look up how to start an auction.  At first I found them annoying, because they literally pause the game while you play them out.  I would jsut skp them, to get back to game play.  Then I learned some auctions should be won at almost any price.  And then I wanted to know how to make them start.  But this is a con because the few patent options should never be part of the auction.  I think it ruins the patent model, and it doesn't make sense.If you like strategy business games, then this is enjoyable.  For the price, you'll have more fun with civilization or colonization, but if you already played those and many other similar games; then buy this.  It is definitely different from those games and is fun.Tip:  While I find little value in the sabotage features of the black market, look over at carefully.  Some black market items are not sabotage items, and they provide key advantages in the game.			"

												Though quite expensive, this game is very enjoyable. At first, I thought this wouldn't be that hard.I've never been so wrong in my life.This is one of the most strategic games I've ever played. I goal is to basically ""buy out"" other players' companies, whilst expanding your own. Multiple resources need to be managed, you can sabotage players in different ways, and you can choose your desired company.Overall, I would say this game is worth the money. You can play with your friends, too, which makes it even better!I don't have friends. "

								The Guild IN SPACE! Pro: Minimalistic and beautiful artstyle. Tense mining, trading and buyout action.Con: Not fleshed out enough for the full price. Too many sabotage acts become frustrating.A solid economy game which grows tense as bases are fully built and players race to buy enough stocks to take over other players. Tutorials and tooltips need more love. 40€ is too high, especially for early access. Do not go over 20€ on this one, if lower its a safe bet for fans of Anno and the Guild.			"
