												TO begin with, this is a Facebook game that is a clone of the popular Clash of clans. Unlike alot of Facebook games this DOESN'T have an energy bar, what it does have is gems (or gold in this case) that can be used to speed up construction of buildings or recruitment of soldiers, this currency is rewarded for free from achivements and leveling up. While gold can't be used to buy and premium troops (who would have boosted stats), whoever buys the most gold will have the highest level and more troops to use repeatedly, so its P2W.In the settings there are three choices (count them 3!), Music on/off, Sound Effects on/off, and Connect to Facebook so you can play with your friends because using the Steam friend sytem would be to difficult to use.... -_-Gameplay- Exactly like Clash of Clans, boring, and meant for mobile games.My final rating- 1/10, the 1 for not having an energy bar, if it had an energy bar I would just uninstall Steam completely, everything in game can be gotten for free but the ones who drops $100's will be on top of the leaderboards, this game should of stayed on mobile/Facebook and never brought to Steam.Do steam a favor and not give this game any cash, because if you do, MORE Facebook games will come to Steam trying to get the same kind of money out of you people.

												This game is absolute garbage. I am getting sick and tired of seeing these Mobile-To-PC ports showing up on Steam. The developers were so lazy that they didn't even change some of the words, because there are still words like ""Tap"" instead of ""Click"". This is literally just a mobile game, with MAYBE better graphics. I wouldn't know that though since you can't adjust any of the graphics. It has all of the micro-transaction as a regular mobile game, too. And I hope you like not seeing the bottom part of the game, because since there is no way of changing the resolution, the game gets cut off by your tool-bar. Don't even waste your time with this game. It's horrendous.			"

												This game is the same as the mobile version and if you do not want to waste your time and sanity then do not download this game! This game was originally made for Mobile phones however they have done nothing to improve the game or even change the game by adding additional features as the Windows, Linux or MAC are many times more powerful machines than a mobile phone...In my honest opinion you should not download this game as its a point and click game that has very small features, making you wait for hours upon completion of building and the game itself has very simple strategy mechanics that are totally boring. However this game does suit people who like clicking based games as this game introduces simple tycoon mechanics and more of a casual game-play.The storyline for this game needs work as they are not narrated and are very basic text. The main animations and sound of the game also needs improvement as they are not very appealing for PC users, the whole game has been recoded to work on the computer but no extra features have been added! Not even graphical improvements, no improvements on the whole story and the strategy side of this game is appalling.Thank you for the game but I do not recommend it.			"

												It is Pay2Win, it is a game i started hating right with the tutorial and here is why.Build this, build that and wait, it costs resources and time to build, with ""gold ingots"" aka ingame currency you can build faster, skip waiting time, that's all what the tutorial ingame is about, a bait-mechanic to trigger your ""i-needz-teh-gold-ingots-and-pay-for-it-if-required-to-be-l33t-faster""-sense.There are also other buildings that require gold ingots in order to be able to build them, if you don't have them, you could earn them by reaching achievements or pay for it - let's say 300 gold ingots for 1,99$.Uninstalled and removed from my library, be very careful when you have kids with own money, it is a game that aims for ripping younger people off or people in general.

												Tapping into that extraordinarily familiar ground that Clash of Clans first revolutionized, Battle Islands is a briefly entertaining if slow-burning freemium strategy game. It’s a little too familiar to truly warrant much excitement but those keen for a World War 2 themed title will find more enjoyment.Set in 1942, players control a platoon of soldiers as they attempt to establish bases on various tropical islands in the South Pacific. While the theme is slightly different from the norm, the gameplay remains much the same.A brief tutorial guides one through the basics, which mostly relate to placing buildings and training troops. A barrier keeps players protected from enemy attack for a few days in order to give them a chance to be more established, but this is easily circumvented by the bloodthirsty. Once the tutorial is out of the way, structure is offered through a series of challenges that can be completed with the bonus being that they offer up gold bricks.Gold bricks are essential here given that they’re the premium currency that affects how quickly projects are completed, among other things. While Battle Islands might seem initially generous with the gold bricks, they vanish quite quickly – leaving one quite restricted due to the plethora of timers.Waiting around for various tasks to complete will be a regular part of one’s sessions with Battle Islands. It’s really quite slow going. Competing with opposing players is briefly fun, but it’s nothing new for the genre and plays it very safe.It’s the theme that makes Battle Islands slightly more noticeable, with the World War 2 theme often proving more endearing than something fantastical. That’s sufficient for a brief play session but I’d be surprised if anyone found the game truly gripping for any length of time. It’s not that it does anything particularly badly, it’s just all too familiar.Graphics / Sound Rating: ★★★½☆Gameplay Rating: ★★½☆☆Playtime Rating: ★★½☆☆Replay Value Rating: ★★★☆☆Overall Rating: ★★★☆☆			"

												This game is kind of fun and have spent hours playing it. Ultimately though it is a giant time sink with insane times to upgrade and ultimately will require money to get anywhere. It's a lot like Boom Beach but with way less balance and is ultimately ruined once you reach higher levels. Also the top 100 board is almost all bots. This is completely ignored by the creators and the more time goes on the more I think the bots belong to the people who actually made the game in an attempt to make it artificially competitive though they will never aknowledge many of the top 100 alliances are bots. You can look at individual players and one alliance has twice the listed dog tags (victory points) than all the players added togther. It's one thing to have the game be set up so that it ultimately requires money, it's another to try to absolutely deceive the player about the game to obtain it.More Cons: The game is ultimately broken on so many levels. One major flaw that they have never fixed is the fact that when your troops land they very often will get stuck in spots and run in circles or just stop moving all together. You can't control the troops after they land (unlike Boom Beach) so there is nothing you can do. You also can be raided by any level and most high level people will because it's a very cheap and efficient way to build vicotory points to raise your ranking. When teams start to figure out which alliances are bots that are artificially propped up the admins just add additional dog tags to them as a team total (that doesn't match the individual player totals)  and the cycle continues. Recap: The game is super bugged. MUST spend money after a certain point. The developers deceive the players with tons of fake accounts (they seem to be almost half of all players), the game constantly crashes. If you check it out and like the concept, play the game this rips off and download Boom Beach on iOS or other platform for a fair and balanced free to play game.			"

If you're sitting at your computer, you have countless games available to you via Steam to play instead of this awful piece of garbage. Even dozens of fantastic free options on Steam.This is the sort of thing that nobody wants. It isn't a game. It's a fishing-pole looking for a whale to land and suck dry of as many dollars via in application transactions as possible. it's everything that is wrong with games and everything that is becoming wrong with Steam.If you know someone who tries to play this, cut off their hands.

												THIS GAME IS NOT A RTS!I've spent several days and weeks playing this on the phone, then I saw this PC port, they were saying it was a real time strategy and making the trailer look as RTS-like as possible. Trust me, this is not an RTS. If anyone is familiar with the game Clash of Clans, we can all say that its not an RTS. This game is very much based off similar mechanics as CoC, timeconsuming, pay to get things faster etc. A RTS is when you build up your base and manage recources in a REAL TIME (current time) strategy game. Which means managing units, where the units go, managing buildings and how to defend them etc. This game offers no such thing as RTS. You go into a battle, you spawn your units, after they are spawned you have no control over them WHATSOEVER. This is not RTS. The mobile verison is great and all, I actually love the mobile verison, but right off the bat I saw when I moved the camera, the game rendered wierdly and did some crazy fps drops. In general, I just put 10 minutes into this port and I saw several rendering issues and FPS drops when I try to move the screen. It was a great mobile game, I still play it to this day, but the PC port was unnecessary and just another way to make money! Get the mobile verison, not this.			"

												Always the same Facebook games. You start playing a tutorial with the same story (your base is under attack or you found a enemy base and need to recover it), always the same gameplay (construct things and protect your turrets to prevent enemies to farm you) etc.If you want original and exclusive games, this is not for you.The only reason I see to play this is if you are having any problem when playing similar games from the browser. Because this one will give you superior performance.I have a few better games to recommend to you, if you like this style:Galaxy WarsClash of Clans (Android, but you can easly emulate it in your computer, there is a bunch of softwares to do that)The Last Stand: Dead ZoneCastle Clash: The New AdventureThey are a lot better than this.

												Do not bother with this game.  It is a total  SCAM run by con-artist. to get players to spend their own money.   The only way to advance in this game is to spend lots of your own cash.   Not only do you have to spend your own cash but the game itself has an extremely low ceiling, so after a few months, the player has spent their own cash on a dead end game and there is absolutely nothing left to do but wonder where your money went.   This game is full of hackers and cheaters and the devs at 505 games  do nothing to stop them.  Also the game is full of bugs  and game crashes once you log into the game.   505 does nothing to help players with these issues but tell them go to facebook.    When you do complain you are told they can do nothing and that it is your  fault.   505 games give you obsolutely no support here on Steam and  they expect all players to go to facebook.   505 should be banned from STEAM and go peddle this fecal matter of a game somewhere else.  What's the point of a Steam account if you have to do everything through facebook!    TOTAL GARBAGE			"

												The ""gameplay"" mostly consists of waiting. This wouldn't be so bad if there weren't two annoying things:You can be attacked. I don't know what happens if you lose but at least you will lose resources and probably defensive troops.You need to check back too often. If it was designed as a game where you check back once or twice a day, it would be okay to mostly wait. Unfortunately in the early stages resources fill too fast in production buildings, and things get expensive quickly, so you need to check back every few hours to not waste resources, especially in the oil rig that produces 1300 and holds 2500 at level 2 on which you'll be for a few days.Obviously I can't say how the late game will play out, but currently I see it as a way to get achievements easily every few days, instead of a real game. If you don't go for achievements, you will want to avoid this. But ok, below is a short review.What is Battle Islands?Battle Islands is a F2P-style base builder in isometric perspective. It is completely controlled with the mouse. The graphics are  as seen in the screenshots on the store page. The sound is nice but in style with the game heroic and military. You build a base on an island, or later several islands of which your first one always is the biggest, so the base won't grow too much. There also are water buildings, adding a bit to the depth. The game has PvP which can be turned off only for a short time with real money currency (gold bars) paid items. Gold bars are also acquired for achievements and very few sometimes at a daily spin. This will allow you to realistically get three buildings or upgrades built at the same time later, however they will take several days or maybe even longer to upgrade. You can promote units to make them stronger, the cost increase for them that comes with it won't matter much.There is a campaign against the AI, consisting of 30 missions. Lost units won't be regained, but also surviving units won't return to your base, forcing you to rebuild every unit you send. Units take a moderate time to produce, I'm not sure if they take longer later.The best thing about the game is that you get achievements essentially for doing nothing but waiting and upgrading your base... if you're not robbed in PvP...Producing ingame resources goes fast, but later upgrades cost a ton of resources, accumulating to already several days of production even with fully upgraded buildings. For that reason, it might be best to upgrade the command bunker and resource productions and possibly defenses first and invest not much in offensive, but this would need testing.Recommended: Only for achievement hunters			"

												To begin with, the Battle Islands is not a strategy game - it's just a ""click and wait"" something embedded in the realities of the Pacific WWII. There is not a lot of elements to analyze and manage. The game mechanics is strange - it generates the need to purchase units in the various objects which manifests itself, of course it follows with need to click on each building separately...etc.  Despite winning the battle yur spared units are lost and you need to train them again... :(  The game is very simple. Thats becouse its cross-platform shared title. I think it can be played even by a monkey or a chicken. Moreover, our units on the battlefield behave idiotically which combined with Imited time for the battle, results in the great unknown at the end. I do not recomend this game - mutch better idea is to buy for little money some older titles like the Settlers or Age of Empires - a real strategy games.Final score 1/10			"

												I thought a long time whether I suggest the game or not. Now I could make a decision because of DR Studios.Positive:The design of the game elements is goodEven if this game is a P2W title you can get everything without spending gold, you just need time (but a lot of ;) ). There are a few possibilities to get gold without spending money for itI haven’t found annoying bugs in the game, more in point negativeNegative:You cannot say in this game is tactic. It is the simple concept mass wins, most of the time the time is the thing which saves you from more damage especially on the early levels. Later you can alsoWin battles with your defending. The balancing isn’t really good, many battle ships can be the dead to every island only the Gun Turret has a chance against them. The tactic is place first tanks and behind themTroops Permanent disconnects after end of fights. Sometimes I haven’t got the loot of a fight because of the failing synchronizing with the server.What strengthened my decision were the recent server problems. Server problems can always happen but it can’t be that you lose your save game, in which you put a lot of effort and time, because of that.Dear developers why you can’t do it like it is in steam, make a local save game and a server save game so that you have a save game even the server crashes. Yes I know they have a support for this problem but it is now Nearly a week since I have contacted them.Conclusion: You can definitely try this game because it is free to play but you shouldn’t spend money for it because the system is unsafe and there aren’t new inventions.ich habe lange überlegt ob ich das Spiel empfehle oder nicht. Nun allerdings konnte ich dank DR Studios eine Entscheidung treffen. positiv:das Design der Spielelemente ist gut gestaltetobwohl das Spiel P2W ist kann man alles mit Zeit erreichen. Es gibt auch Möglichkeiten Gold zu bekommen ohne es zu kaufen.Bugs die das Spiel ausbremsen habe ich nicht gefunden, weiteres im Punkt negativnegativ:Taktik kann man das nicht nennen. Es funktioniert nach dem simplen Prinzip Masse gewinnt, denn meistens wird man nur von der Zeit vor größerem Schaden bewahrt besonders am Anfang, wenn man seine Inselnoch nicht so gut aufgerüstet hat. Später kann man dann auch mit den Verteidigungen so manche Schlacht gewinnen. Allerdings ist das balancing noch nicht wirklich ausgereift, so sind Schlachtschiffe ingroßer Anzahl der Tod für jede Insel, diese können nur effektiv von der Gun Turret ausgeschaltet werden. Das bisschen Taktik beschränkt sich stark auf die richtige Wahl der Truppen erst Panzer dahinter Infanterie.ständige Verbindungsabbrüche nach Kampfende. So war es zumindest bei mir nach einem erfolgreichen Sieg gibt es nichts nervigeres als wenn das gesammelte Lot nicht angerechnet bekommt, da dieSynchronisation mit dem Server fehlgeschlagen ist.Was mich jetzt allerdings endgültig zu meinem Entschluss bewegt hat waren die kürzlichen Server Probleme. An und für sich können Technische Probleme immer auftreten, allerdings kann es nicht sein das man seinen Spielstand dadurch verliert in den man viel Zeit und vielleicht auch Geld gesteckt hat. Liebe Entwickler macht das doch einfach wie Steam es wird einmal lokal gespeichert und einmal Serverseitig, dann hat man wenigstens noch seinen Spielstand lokal und muss nicht wie ich wieder von Level 1 anfangen (davor 49). Es gibt zwar einen Support der sich um dieses Problem kümmert, es ist jedoch schon 1 Woche her das ich diesen kontaktiert habe und noch keine Rückmeldung bekommen habe.Fazit: Man kann das Spiel definitiv ausprobieren da es free to play ist verliert man dabei nichts, allerdings würde ich kein Geld investieren, da das System zu unsicher ist und es keine neuen Innovationengibt.

												In Sum: A dull Facebook game that is unbearably slow without microtransactions, and suffers from apparent controversy by the dev.  It just isn't fun.  0/5-----This is basically a Facebook game on Steam.  And it brings with it the failings of a Facebook game.The biggest issue in design, as far as I'm concerned, is the time.  This is not a game that you sit down and play.  You do an action, then have to wait hours, sometimes, days, for it to happen.  The game uses real time for this.  Games such as this are not designed for fun or competition.  They are made for compulsion.  And that is the psychological strategy of this game.  You can build or upgrade something and wait from 10 minutes to 24 hours (maybe longer), or you can whip out the credit card and do it instantly.  The design of the game isn't necessarily ""pay-to-win"", but rather to make not paying so annoying and frustrating, that you pay repeatedly just to find the enjoyable game in here.  Meanwhile, those who do pay can progress essentially without limits, as every aspect of the game can be instant with purchasing.  To be fair, it is possible to play this game for free.  If you only play sporadically and are willing to progress painfully slow. I realize this is common practice in mobile games, but it is out of place on Steam.  Coming from a number of strategy games before playing this, I found the soldier's actions to be irritating to watch, due to the stupidity.  Sometimes you see them actually do something intelligent, like stopping just outside of howitzer range but in general, attacking troops will run into danger, then proceed to attack buildings while being fired on.  They also will try to group together in a clump, which makes them easily killed as a group.  Due to the slow progression, it is probable that defenses will develop faster than attack power, which causes a sudden bottleneck in progress...unless the credit card comes out.  Overall after playing a few hours, I have to say, I'm not having fun.  I don't feel this was a particular good waste of my time.  I don't feel I have much in the way of positive feedback, because the issue is ultimately the design of the game.  It is truly a casual game in every sense, that not only is it meant for people who only check in every so often, but it requires you to approach it casually.  As for the game, it's not broken, it's just not fun.I have some concerns as well, about the developer's reputed actions on the community hub.  Apparently, criticisms about the game are being deleted, critics of the game are being banned, and recently a dubious set of community rules was posted on the forum superceding Steam's rules that, along with reasonable prohibitions (which were already against Steam's rules), states that ""spreading misinformation"" will result in a ban.  This could reasonably be construed as any information contrary to the developer's statements, which would include criticism.  Adding this clause lends credence to the reputation this game has been developing.			"

												Okay sooo i quited at 84lvl. I really enjoyed the game in the past BUT now at these levels when i`ve ranked up all buildings to the max and most of fortifications(didnt spend a cent btw)  there's nothing to do than spending money to upgrade units in the command bunker which costs 4.000.000 or maybe a lot more + 20 days(?!?!!) of wait time??? Also its IMPOSSIBLE to gather that much when at around 500.000 i get attacked and lose money. Only camo will do the trick, but still not worth spending gold bars for it. It's embarrassing when you almost fully fortified your buildings and every attacker STILL destroys your base at 95%+++. Like really??I`ve made it this far to get stomped like that? Even units glitch most of the time when they cant reach the specific target and they start to run around which results in a huge fail/loss. Nonoooo... i won`t recommend it for sure. First it was somewhat cool but now its only a waste of time.PS: Those 4 charges of Artillery Strikes in the communication center building is a disgrace. GG enemy base			"

												I would recommend this game, if it was for a phone. It is another Clash of Clans clone but what's worse its it is horribly ported over. No Option for full screen, doesn't use Steam Friends (It uses facebook), only options are Music and Sound. Everything in this game just screams it is mobile. Its a money pit because if you have the payed for currency of the game you can just spam troops over and over because you can instantly make them. Even the normal recources that can be made without paying can be payed for which allows any player to become an overpower death machine by putting some money in it. This game is nothing more than a Clash of Clans clone that made it onto PC somehow that points in the direction of ""If you pay some money to us we will make you a god for a couple of days."" It's a prime example to show why not to port over a phone game.			"

												It is basically Clash of Clans but takes place back in WWII where they used different weapons than clash. I recommend for people who would like to play Clash of Clans in a WWII setting. I don't recommend for people who hate copied games. I mainly wouldn't recommend this game because of that.			"

												Did I not write a review for this already? Oh yeh, I didn't see this insignifigant and bad game in my library. A WW2 era of CoC was a good idea, but this game is NEVER updated. It requires NO strategy and in the 525 hours I've played this game I've never been attacked. They also changed how the characters look, which sucks. They were good already. And even if you look at global chat, the last message written is probably 3 days old. No one plays. I reccomend this game as a timepasser. You will get 20 hours of gameplay out of it probably. Just don't trust this to amaze you.			"

												Only 3 minutes to raid which is garbage considering AI pathfinding is outright wierd, some units are very, very slow and islands are long chains of land with many walls. Raiding becomes terrible the higher up you go.

												Here's is a game that is strongly...inspired....let's be a honest, it copies a lot from from the old GBA games called *Advance Wars*. The newest itteration in a wave of mobile and Facebook games making their way to Steam, it is filled with the same empty and repetitive gameplay you can find in Farmville or the likes. What else could anyobody expect from a F2P game other than a cash shop. Of course, it comes with it's hefty quota of P2W schemes,  you pay to skip grind, repair faster, special paywall buildings, etcetera. The plag...inspiration, the mobile quality, the straight from FB port, and the cash shop all make this a big red flag for anybody that remotely cares about quality gaming. There you have it fellas, FB games have arrived to Google Play...I mean...Steam.			"

												It can be enjoyable for a few first weeks, but sooner or later you simply hit the line where you can't gather enough resources for upgrading before being attacked by another player.Lately, there have been some updates, which actually worsened gameplay a lot for me. Random disconnecting being even more frequent, for example. Oh and I got an alliance application bug, so now I can't enter or leave any. The window just tells me to wait.I am going to wait, then. Elsewhere.Cons:- pay to win, of course- terrible controls; obviously an adapted touchscreen game. Clicking the buttons with mouse is incredibly frustrating.- lots of bugs. The game often disconnects.- inequality of the players. The ability to fight each other is only limited by rating (""dog tags""), not by your levels. This allows a lvl 80 player attack a lvl 20 player.			"

												I downloaded the game because I kind of enjoy that kind of games (not their pay to win side though). After like 40 hours of gameplay I've regretted even bothering checking its trailer out. First of all the ranking system is unbalanced... AF. What do I mean? Currently I'm level 35 and I was trying to gather 4 million crates to upgrade my command bunker. After I managed to gather more than 1 million every single player in the game started attacking me. Duh I know this is supposed to happen since I have a large amount of supplies but when the average level of players attacking you is between 75-120 and you're 35.... To be honest I don't even get the point of rankings since the only thing they do is just give you some extra crates after each victorious battle.And here comes the fun part. Did you know that you can actually hack the game with Cheat Engine?! Yes Cheat ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Engine. Gotta love it when a level 20 guy drops like 7 mortar strikes in my base and when I check his base everything is upgraded to maximum. Best of all? There's no report option so here's a huge FU to the face of all you who want to play the game without cheating.Even though there are actually many different units in the game only a couple of them are actually useful. So if you want a strong army all you have to do is to buy: Tanks (Tanky af and have highest dps comparing to any other land unit), Submarines/Warships (Submarines = Oneshot everything in the sea / Warships = Tank everything ) from naval units and Bombers from air units. On low level's it's pretty much like who has the most bombers wins. They are too tanky early and turrets cant shoot them down fast enough.If you need to upgrade something that requires a lot of supplies then you have to pay for camoflage because you'll get attacked from every single player in the game. Otherwise you can just wait that they may get bored and stop attacking you somewhen since this will be the only way you will actually manage to gather the supplies (eveytime you get successfully attacked from an opponent you lose a specific amount of supplies, 200k in my case which was all the supplies I was earning in one day)The only good thing about the game is that unlike other pay to win games this one actually doesnt force you to pay. Gold is kind of useless in terms of power. The only things you can do with it is buy more engineers (builders) for you base, boost the productivity of a factory for 1 hour or complete an upgrade without having to wait for many hours or days. There's no unit's power boosting option, in-battle reinforcements by using gold etc, so in a few words paying for the game is pointless since the high ranks mean literally nothing.1/10 if you actually wanna play that kind of a game go for Stronghold Kingdoms, it's way better and offers more things to do in game. P.S. Forgot to mention the exit game thingy. Every single time you try to exit the game, the game will actually crush. No matter if you press the X on top right or ESC> Leave Game the game will ALWAYS crush. 4 freaking months since I've downloaded the game and they still haven't fixed that bug. ggwp 9/11 for the crush			"

												This is not a good game, and I'm not recommending this game for anyone who doesn't have $1000 dollars to waste. For me, I just play it to waste time. But this game is really trying to get you to pay for their microtransactions. See something catching on? This is a mobile game. Brought to Steam. You can easily tell that it is a Pay2Win because when you buy gold, which you pay REAL MONEY for, you level up in game. When you level up, you get higher and higher on the leaderboard. They didn't even bother with changing certain words from the mobile version, like how the game asks you to ""tap"" a button, instead of ""click"" a button. I really hope that Steam will stop putting these horrible mobile Pay2Wins on here, but that probably won't happen.			"

												Quick and Dirty:You start of with 500 Gold (Real Cash Currency) and your 1st engineer (building/upgrading/fortifying of buildings).Then you tutorial FORCES you to spend 250 of your Gold for the 2nd engineer.So far so good because engineers are important.The 3rd engineer costs two times the amount of the previous one : 500 Gold.Bank : 250 Gold  How do you get more Gold?The hard way : stack up achievements; level up and collect random air drop supplies around your island (Takes hours/days)The easy way : >>>>>>   pay  <<<<<<  (takes few clicks)Whatever! 250 Gold in achievements was not that hard: farm low level scrubs to get your 25 consecutive wins and bam 100gold + the rest for all the other achievemnts + level on the way.3rd engineer unlocked, yay me! The 4th engineer costs ..... : 1000 GOLDBank : 132868 gold to goThe hard way(?): forget it ! there are not enough achievements + level to reach the 4th engineer without payingThe easy way    :  >>>>>>   pay  <<<<<<In conclusion: the more money you have to spend on this little piece of art the more skill you obvious have while having all engineers (max 5) unlocked. Why is an engineer so important? Building and upgrading buildings takes hours days to complete and having 5 engineers work on your island at the same time increases your growth tremendously.But it's O.K.A.Y.! If you want to ""compete"" in this ""game"" you can ""play"" and ""support"" the ""dev"" of this ""game"" by paying real money for ""gold"" go right ahead and be one of the cool kids.For everyone else there is : Warframe , Dota 2 , Team Fortress 2 , Path of Exile  and many many more REAL F2P GAMES!

												Because my opinion of the game is so similar to other reviews, let me word everything a little different.The publisher of this game is 505 Mobile Games. This game is a mobile game. The game wants you to connect to Facebook. Like many mobile games that try to get you to connect to Facebook, is plagued by the need to constantly pay to speed up building/upgrading process. That means that all of the game's mechanics are build around the idea of being as tedious and bothersome as possible to try to get some money. Of course many players will stop playing as soon as they realize what the game is all about but that's okay because these kind of developers are not interested in entertainment, they just want to get money. So if you don't want to pay, you are not the target of this game.It's almost impossible to recommend this game even to people that enjoy these kind of mechanics, because most of them probably have already ""invested"" in another game like this one, and considering this game has nothing new to offer, they won't be interested in playing the same game they are playing but with different graphics.

												One of the games more recent updates ruined the game. It used to be if you were successfully attacked other than having to repair a few units you didn't actually lose very much cash you have accumulated in the game. Now a large portion of your cash is actually gone. In some ways this is great because it is more realistic and gives you incentives of building up better defenses. However, I can no longer build up in game currency fast enough to purchase items anymore so I'm either forced to pay real money to buy camo to protect me, or I have to pay real money to upgrade items. The most disturbing thing is today for example I was attacked by a level 136 player and I am only a level 36 so obviously they are going to wipe me out. I was never attacked by players that large before. As my upgrades are at a point I need to accumulate almost 2 million dollars to upgrade items I have a lot of ""cash"" on my base while I'm saving and it tells you how much cash they have and that they can win. So I'm an attractive victim. Even worse if I go to attack others there are now almost no players at a level I have a chance of winning that have any cash to win anymore anymore so I can't gather cash that way either. Basically what it seems to boil down to is there are not enough people playing this game anymore and it relies on the number of people playing to survive this model.			"

												Can facebook games be on Steam?, well, i don't think this one sould be.It's buggy, developers have fled the community forums despite critical bugs being reported (losing all progress), And besides that, the game isn't even good.I've been playing it alot, and now that i'm further to the ""later stages"" of the game, it has become apparent to me that this game isn't worth anyones time. Planes are such a good mechanism for defense that i have never defeated anyone i attacked who had planes to defend. the AI just does what it wants. And that's a major problem, the AI.. Your units will move to the nearest building and attack it, even if getting in range of that building requires the unit to move around walls, and even if they are getting attacked by turrets while moving to the location.Once i even had tanks move back and fourth infinitely untill time ran out and i lost. I sure hope nobody buys gold for this game to get engineers either, because you'll struggle to keep them occupied and you'll have to attack 5-6 times a day to keep them busy (for me training my units back after a battle takes 50min).Mines are extremely overpowered, too, and can one-hit kill any land based unit. Though, i've rarely seen other players use it.In general though, This game might seem like a good timewaster, playing it a couple of times a day, but you'd be better off elsewhere, just watch videos on youtube or something. This game has bugs, is unbalanced, without developer activity on the forums and has no real ""endgame"" that is worth getting to. It's just the same over and over and over.			"

It feels like the game is more about waiting for your soldiers to be trained, soldiers to be promoted, and construction of your buildings, not the game where you're in a mission to claim all of the islands			"

												So after a few weeks of playing I really started to enjoy it... but then the resets came... twice it reset the whole game to starting point with no way to get your progress back... the developer says its because the game only saves when it's linked to your facebook account but that can't be true... how did it save for all the time i played before... i never linked it to facebook and never will...

												Well, First off, This game is almost completely P2W. Who ever has the most gold, Wins. Then there's the fact that its a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ copy and paste from a mobile device. In a lot of ways it is very similiar to Clash of Clans, A Game I found very enjoyable, it was simple and it was MOBILE.                    I also find it very troubling for the game, considering I could get anything on the game by using Cheat Engine!Everything, except for Gold, was easily obtained with cheat engine. Its a good game to practice your Cheat Engine skills on. The developers didn't protect anything from cheats, except for the thing that would make them lose money.			"

												Ever since the last update i have not been able to load my own alliance  (which i've owned before the update) and i cant search alliances. None of it will load. LEaderboard is working just fine but other than that the alliances will not load no matter how much time i give it. I did not have this problem before the update....It's been at least 2 weeks since the update so they've had time to fix something as simple as this...also, the AI do not always work/target what they're supposed to. Tanks for example went through several walls, targeted something behind another and decide to go ALL THE WAY AROUND THE ISLAND while being gunned by MG's and such just to go through an opening...They've had plenty of time to fix this too....Good game but they've goofed pretty bad.

												Everyone knows the reason people love PC gaming is because, at its core, the real reason people buy 2,000$ or more gaming PC's.... is to play pay to win Facebook and Ipad games! Right? Am I right? No? You mean the real reason is to play awesome games like League Of Legends, Age Of Empires, Just Cause 2, the supirior version of Portal 2, Half Life 2 and Team Fortress 2? Well, then I guess you should'nt download Battle Islands. Honestly Battle Islands was a game that could have been great if it took the approach of combining RTS elements from Age of Empires (The Original) and combined it with the whole Clash of Clans system. What I'm saying is that if you were able to build your Island without being tied down by the horrorable system that defines Facebook games (BUY STUFF TO DO STUFF FASTER ;D) and were then able to invade the island of another player that IS NOT OFFLINE, then it would be BETTER.  Think of it like the RTS version of Ascend: Hand of Kul, were you have your own territory that cannot be attacked or invaded while offline but can be attacked by other players through sending enemies into your world. Now imagine its you sending you units that you trained with resources THAT ARE NOT GAINED THROUGH SITTING THERE FOR AN HOUR WAITING FOR AN AMOUNT OF RESOURCES WORTH A DAMN TO COLLECT, but are instead gathered like in ge of Empires and then sending them to the enemies island while maintaining the ability to CONTROL YOUR UNITS so that the gameplay is more than watching your men commit suicide on enemy turrets when they should be attacking the resources which are ungaurded. Then the game would be awesome. But its not. Its a PC version of Clash Of Clans and Backyard Monsters. By the way there is no fullscreen so prepare for the wonderful world of window mode! yay! cheers! Thank heaven there is no full screen option or I would kill myself.... oh wait.			"

												This game is a very much strategy game.This game is based around defending your base,Attaking other people's bases and building up your base so that you can be undefeatable.Its very similar to other games such as clash of clans.This game is a awesome game and definetly worth downloading.

												This game is overall a fun experience if one is willing to put the time and effort in. Progress will be very slow, and saving up resources is difficult because of the constant threat of attack. It is very similar to Clash of Clans, but in my personal opinion has a more logical setting. There are several negative things about this game, however. As far as I know, there is no form of a group attack, and very little reason to be in an alliance. Attacking other islands is difficult. Not because the controls are bad or anything like that, but simply because you have 20 seconds to plan your attack, and then 2 minutes to finish it. This is not nearly enough time to plan a well-executed attack, and will usually result either in defeat or a disheveled victory. Also, there is LITTLE POINT IN BUYING CAMO. It goes away as soon as you attack someone else and so should only be bought if you want to sit there and do nothing. Nevertheless, the gameplay, and unlockable items are fun and there is definitely some strategy involved, which is why I would recommend this game.			"

Its meant to be played on mobile.Well guess what it can be. Its on both PC and AND which is fantastic because since its a casual strategy game (which belongs on mobiles) you can download it here, link it to your mobile app and play there. Oh did I mention you are also able to receive achievements even if you have been playing on mobile.Lets move on from that and here are the pros and cons:ProPlay on any platformAlmost no learning curveGame is still balancedConUpgrade prices are pretty high (not too bad though but still..)Once you attack someone you stay on there board saying you've attacked them. I've been revenged upon many times because of this.Other that those pros and cons its a good game, not too bad, not too good.			"

												I like this game. I see a lot of reviews claiming it's pay-to-win, but I have over half the achievements now and I've yet to pay a dime (nor do I intend to).If you don't plan to pay, you'll find yourself doing a lot of waiting (for buildings to be constructed, units to be trained, etc.) but that really just adds to the appeal. You can pop in for five minutes, take care of things, then check back later.It's not perfect, and I don't like the way it encourages you to buy gold (though I can understand why it does), but if you have patience it can be quite a bit of fun.Oh, and it's free. Fun + Free is a hard combination to beat.			"

												I have 26 hours into this gameso far. I found it fun until I had a connection issue the has yet to be resolved. It's definitely a browser style game, so limit your expectations. Those saying it is pay to win are incorrect. I got up to level 15 with many victories and many base improvements without ever putting a dime into it. It all comes down to how you play. The only reason to spend gold is because you don't want to wait for a building/training/promotion timer to finish. Even then, you start with a good deal of premium currency, and can earn more by accomplishing in game achievements. Anyway, I'd still be playing this if I could get it to connect. Because of that unresolved issue, I can't currently reccomend the game, but will definitely change to a positive recommendation if/when it gets fixed.			"

												Have ground for over two years. Sweet for five minutes of non thinking brain destress after a hard days work with imbeciles on periods so massive a med factory bigger than Trumps ego, working around the clock 9 days a week, would not staunch the gushing flow.Mindlessly invade an island and let your men be slaughtered and slaughter like the thoughtless pixels they are whilst you sip a rum in your undies and think about what got you to this point in your life as your steak and potatoes cook on the stove behind you, whispering their need for fresh bread and butter and a hint of garlic and cracked pepper.  No complaints, it's free..and as usual, the Russians hack like rabid snow dogs with the smell of rank meat in there nostrils. Needs more 1940's era pin up girls.			"

												im still trying to give it my best shot... and do i recommend it? NOPE. when you send in your troops to a battle... even if they havent died in battle. at the end of the match. they are dead now... you'll have to recruit more and start all over. now that may be o.k with some of you... but some of these units takes 7 minutes or more each to make. i'm still making tanks. i'm not even sure how long it takes to make airplanes. the upgrading is out rageous. takes 3 days where im at the get 4 levels higher from start. you can by pass this by purchasing gold to speed stuff along... well... because your stingey. i will NOT be putting my money into this game. stop forcing players to pay in.... be good to your customers. and maybe you'll catch more flies with your honey. i bet you devs are all asian and i can see you now squinting at my comments getting mad and yelling at each other over my comment. well... stop arguing and listen to your people... take players votes. give the players what they want and make people vote on it. but your not listening... thats the problem... and thats why you'll fail			"

												Yes, this game is a blatant clone or clash of clans but that is what makes it good. It is for those people who want to play clash of clans but have guns instead of bows and arrows. While i doubt i would have even thought about getting this game if it cost money, having a free, 5 minutes session game that can get very competitive with steam friends is actually quite fun. Its great to cool down off after a long gaming session and since it is so quick to start up you can start opening a new game and play this to fill the time waiting for it to load. I would reccomend this game, but only really if you and a few friends get it together and I would warn you all to not assume its a bad clone of clash of clans, rather its clash of clanes hundreds of years in the future (in the game i mean)			"

Its a really fun game once you get to playing but there is a few bugs like why is the Engineer walking on water? why does the People walk through walls etc. But the Campaign kinda sucks so for the Campaign-5/10 Its a Average Campaign... I love this game exspecially when you raid other people... Multiplayer-10/10 But don't raid anyone above your rank though... But th game is awsome I love its soundtrack but it can get repetive so Soundtrack 9/10 Its a little good But that wraps up th Review today cya tommorrow :D			"

												I honestly don't quite understand why they would put an iOS game on steam especially one of these kinds. I get that some people may like the idea of it being on steam but if they want to have it across devices then maybe they should at least change the controls to better suit PC such as scroll bars rather than the whole click and drag. 4/10			"

												Another game like Clash Of Clans, If you guys want a game better then this, Play  Clash Of Clans, Unless you dont have an Andriod/Apple device then... GG, Battle Islands is pretty well made, although there isn't as much players as CoC, theres still a fair amount of players on Battle Islands, But its also on mobile and Facebook...  Battle Islands 8/10. Why? Well they did a fairly good job making this game... So i wouldnt give it a Down Vote. Still prefer Clash of clans :D 10/10			"

												Nothing fancy, but still I got hooked on that crap looking pay to win or free to play game.I have over 1100 games and wtf, this one are a bit like drugs to me!.I dont care about the reviews, as so  many just say super games or bad games after just 1 hour play, well its their choice - and this is mine.I never play a game on FaceBook (US Intelligence monitored ♥♥♥♥Book!)So hate it or just say wtf and spend the time.I was attacked for the first time after 2 weeks of playing amd as a F2P person its not to bad.Sure you can Pay to Win,  or just try your luck and see if you get further as a F2P person .Now troll me, i dont mind - are a grown up old fart ;-) from the C64 days.

												Cool strategy game. Pretty good, I like that it doesn't lag on my computer and it's pretty fun to play. The gampley itself makes you want to play more! You can build stuff, you can upgrade stuff, you can destroy stuff! This game is a real time strategy game. Sooo maybe when you're offline you'll get ♥♥♥♥ed up wich is pretty annoying..... BUT GUESS WHAT? You can buy a camoflauge it costs gold though. This game those have microtransactions. But you can get the gold for free aswell it's just harder! But if you attach someone while you have a camoflauge on your camo ends. STRAIGHT AWAY! But except for that it's an AWESOME game!And I don't see a reason why wouldn't you download it if it's FREE. (With some microtransactions)			"

												This is the same as the mobile version, which makes the resolution a bit akward, and no advantage to using a computer.  The game itself if okay, but still requires work.  When I first started there were a lot more supplies to be had, now there is really no way to save enough to upgrade defences further.  Example: I'm at level 65 with 2400 dog tags; I can only find around 200,000 supplies in an average battle (and even this takes a lot of searching), but it costs me 130,000 to deploy a full army, meaning I only net an average of 70,000 per battle, but need 3,200,000 to upgrade the hangar...  If that's not bad enough; as soon as I save up 1,000,000 someone at level 120 with 2800 dog tags will come and take half.  Because they take more than I can possibly earn in battle, I will never be able to upgrade beyond my current state. Also, AI is terrible, half of the time my soldiers just pace back and forth in the same spot until time runs out and I lose what would have been a winable match.			"

												This game is a lot of fun. It can be a little challenging (ok, a lot) with all the bully commanders and tyrants out there pummeling your humble defenses and farming away your hard earned crates. But, that's one of the reasons to like the game - the challenge and strategy required to preserve your stockpile long enough to advance to the next level and achievement. It can be a little disturbing when your supplies get taken away, especially just prior to the implementation of upgrading your units and defenses. I'd whine and cry a little more if I wasn't guilty of doing that to others myself - after all, it's WAR! And even the mighty lion and the fastest cheetah go for the weakest prey. Why fight someone your own size to risk great loss when you can pound a lesser army and take all the booty you want. Ever hear of Sun Tzu? It's a great game, loads fast, functional and free to play, The developers are happy to sell you gold at a fairly reasonable cost which can be used to purchase massive amounts of supplies. . .but where's the fun it that? Only a weak-minded, cowardly, punk-axx, spend-thrift little sissy/bully would need to do that. Also, it can be very helpful if you have the availability to log on for a couple minutes about every hour or so, but you can also go days and weeks without doing so and still find yourself in pretty good shape since no one can actually permanently destroy your base - you just lose crates and dog tags. Give it a try, it's cool. And, you can also draw really cool pictures of the islands and units in a makeshift birthday card to your girlfriend when you forget about her, add a quick rhyme and a clever poem about your gameplay and how it in no way compares to all her talent and beauty, and then she'll love you even more and appreciate all your efforts in the game while she's making dinner and cleaning up around the house. (She's smacking me in the back of the head right now - I gotta go) Play the game.			"

												making the game available for pc through steam is brilliant, and the graphics is well above expectations!what i lack in time played on steam, i make up for on my phone :)the only concern i had, was how the game would load up old game data, but even that was quickly sorted out.during game load, a big button appears, and offers to load old game, which then requests linking to facebook (mind you, to read save data from the phone, it too has to connect with facebook before all this).i wonder whether or not they have considered G+ aswell, for storing/retrieving game data (but that's outside the actual review).enjoy, and have fun out there peeps			"

												For those out there comparing this to many other games so far everything is f2p. Gold Bars can be earned much faster then normal games and meaning this isnt a pay to win game just time to win game, dont believe me then you play for more then an hour then see if you waisted you life to find out the hard way. I like the game and recomends more games like this to come to the pc world over the tablet world.			"

												Ok i've played it.Despite the reviews cursing it, I have to admit its a cute little time waster, this isnt a AAA and you can tell this game is  for mobile and if you google it, it's avaliable on Android and iOS.But looking beyond that, this game is avaliable on android, iOS and PC, i've never seen a game do this. Also looking at the community, the Dev is actively posting and interracting with players, something else you don't see on steam.It's being called a cow clicker made by money hungry dev's but if they cared so little why are they being so active on steam?Something special is going on here, the game may only be good to sink a few minutes while waiting for queues, but i'm liking the support thus far.

												Battle Islands is alot like Clash of Clans in many aspects.  The game is blatantly ""pay to win"" by nature, while not completely limiting free players, it gives paying players a large advantage when it comes to base building and unit production. I dont automatically discount Battle Islands because of these facts though, as they show more of the nature of the mobile and social gaming industry than they display how poor the game is. I think Battle Islands is a decent game on the mobile/ social standard but it does leave much to be desired when it comes to a PC game. Overall I hope mobile and social gaming will hit a point where the start to realize you can have a good game without making pay to win shortcuts, but I doubt this will happen if people still make there crappy in game purchases. So in the end all I can say is give Battle Islands a try, just try not to pay real money for anything.			"

												Enjoyable game play without requiring extreme amounts of dedication, though you will find yourself logging in to see how your troops are progressing toward the next series of goals. You can play alone through the campaign mode, or with others in the Alliance/Rival mode, or just in one-off attacks against other players. The developers have kept it so battles are reasonably well matched in the one-off mode. Rival mode allows you to play against anyone you're connected to.			"

												First off, I want to say that I do play Clash of Clans. I will say that I prefer CoC over this; but this is a fun game to play on the computer if you are bored. I haven't played much of it so far, but from what I can tell, it has it's own little differences from CoC. People are saying it's a pay-to-win type of game when really I see that it just takes a little more work than it does in CoC. A lot of games like these, battle beach, CoC, boom beach, castle clash, have players that do pay real money to help upgrade faster. But that doesn't mean you can't have fun and you can't be good at these types of games. I give this game an 8/10 just for another strategy/run+gun type of game.If you're happy with any other game that's like this, and don't want to get involved on another, don't worry about it. But if you want another to play, I'd give this one a shot. If you don't like it, don't play it; if you do, great. Don't give this game a bad review because your opinion on it is bad. Someone else could like it and love it when you don't. Give it a try and if you don't like it, it's about 10-30mins out of your life.			"

												Pay to win in the worst way. I find it a chore to play. Some of the worst pathfinding and AI ever. All of your units will beg for death which just made me not want to spend money that much more.I do not recommend this facebook quality money grab. Which is sad, because with more unit control and removing the long build times in favor of a pay to own model... I would have bought the game and likely enjoyed building my island base.			"

												Okay, lets get to down to what this game is. This is a ""Pay to win"" kind of game. Now just because it is pay to win dosen't mean it is bad. I am a person who tends to have alot of time on their hands and has nothing to do. So I've never payed a dime on this game. I will mention that only certain types of people will like this game. Yes, it is a clash of clans rip-off, but that does NOT matter. If you have not played clash of clans and you have lot of time to waste, then this is the game for you. If you have no time on your hands, DON'T bother playing clsh of clans or this gme at all. If you've played clash of clans, stick to clash of clans. That is how I see it. There is some things I do not like about this game, like the waiting element. (Also hate that in clash of clans.) So yea, that is my review.			"

												Many say that this game is another money grabber a pay to win game & yes they are correct in saying that to a degree BUT they only get your money if you choose to give it to them & if you enjoy the game for what it is then you are basically not paying to win but playing to enjoy. ----- A Few Points -----#1: The game has been labeled as a f2p so you choose weather or not to install & play it, you don't have a loaded gun against your head that's forcing you to do so, either play it or not its simple.#2: I admit i have payed alittle of my own money to get an extra engineer & maybe a few quick upgrades but AGAIN thats players choice not the devs threatening your life if you dont,but you do get a few free gold (microtransaction currency) by completing some in-game achievements which is nice.#3: This game has its moments & i have no complaints with it being a f2p but mere suggestions on what may need improving, yes it has its in-game issues for a few players and they can be very upsetting but thats because its a video game not a painting by Leonardoda vinci (refering to it being perfect :p)#4: This is a browser style kind of game that you progress through with the aid of real time, for example: The command bunker level  3 upgrade (level 3 unlocks a nice selection of units) will take 24hours in real time to complete, yes its quite a wait but when you leave the game to do its work and go off to play something else it has the next stage ready for you to use when/if you return which to be honest i like but could do with a slight tweek here and there.----- Final Verdict -----Battle Islands is a very fun small f2p game that has its moments and can be enjoyed by anyone, it may be a bit of a waiting game (literally) but can be played WITHOUT any microtransactions if one chooses.Overall Score 8/10Hope my little rant has helped in some way :D''See you on the battlefield'' (or not)			"

												Update 04/25/2015 Saturday I have switched my vote from recommend to not recommended.  After you get so far the game becomes a pay to win.  You can't really get past a specific point without wasting real money to buy gold so you can use the gold to buy supplies.  Its not a bad game but if you want to get anywhere in it be prepared to spend your hard earned cash_____________________________________________________________________________________Facebook game.  Its okay but only since it is free to play.			"

												30/100 - Pay2Win and plain stupid!This is bad, even for a browsergame.Every moment shows it´s made for Mobiles..After 30minutes you´re lvl 3 and need to invest..about 2€/hour at least to be halfway - let´s say competitiveI save yourself the time to read though other CON´s, but the major issues are:-bad controls (imagine a browsergame 10years old by now^^)-no direct combat, no positioning,nope.. you just watch your units die or win!-don´t expect any gfx setup, same for audio-even the Cashshop lacks functionalityCashshop everywhere - OMG!Avoid it at all costs!!

The complete arbitrary movement of your units ranks right up there with the greatets WTF reacions of video game history. While the game in not horrible you may have more fun bypasing the toilet and using a litter box for a week. I give this game a playable but the more I play it the less positive I think of myself.  I only reccomend it because its free but don't get me wrong you will pay if you play this game.			"

												After looking through and reading all of the current reviews for Battle Island's, I can see where everyone is coming from, it maybe a copy of Clash Of Clan's, all though it's more like Boom Beach, pretty much every F2P game like this is also gonna have in-game purchase's, there's not much anyone can do about that, that's how they make their money, not sure how much they are gonna make of this at the way it's going. Gameplay wise, it's decent, there is a lot of work needed to be done, not sure why they decided to put a Facebook game on Steam, seems like a terrible idea, would I recommend this game? Yes and No, more No then Yes, only download if you are intent on going through with it, otherwise I wouldn't waste your time. Right now it's 3/10 and could use a lot of improvement, I wonder what they can do with this.Chiiiickeeenn.			"

												The game starts off and is alot of fun! You construct and maintain your islands and army, you raid other players bases, and run through the campaign, which at some points, others up a bit of a challenge. Seems like a blast right? IT IS! But then reality sets in. You get build times of 10 days just so you can hold more resources to wait another 10 days to spend. Training times for troops aren't too bad at first, 20 second, 45 second, but then you have some that are an hour, which kills the whole 'quick retraining' thing. I see what the Devs want, which is for you to spend money to build stuff quicker, but the amount of money you would have to spend to make any difference at all is absolutely ridiculous.Over all, I feel like it is a good game, but due to the huge wait times and extreme depending on spending cash, I would not recommend this game.

												This game is actually pretty good, im just Level 3 now but I used to play this type of game before, known as Clash of Clans.. It might become more complex than CoC in late game, and I hope it doesn't require so much time as CoC needed to upgrade buildings at high levels.I truly recommend this game to anyone who's up to play strategy games from anywhere, from your phone, from your PC.. Because the link you have with your devices it's through Facebook (I have it on my phone already).So cheer up and start as soon as possible, because this is those kind of games that you'll keep the advantage if u start sooner than others, and obviously, keep playing as hard as u started.

												After looking through and reading all of the current reviews for Battle Island's, I can see where everyone is coming from, it maybe a copy of Clash Of Clan's, all though it's more like Boom Beach, pretty much every F2P game like this is also gonna have in-game purchase's, there's not much anyone can do about that, that's how they make their money, not sure how much they are gonna make of this at the way it's going. Gameplay wise, it's decent, there is a lot of work needed to be done, not sure why they decided to put a Facebook game on Steam, seems like a terrible idea, would I recommend this game? Yes and No, more No then Yes, only download if you are intent on going through with it, otherwise I wouldn't waste your time. Right now it's 3/10 and could use a lot of improvement, I wonder what they can do with this.Chiiiickeeenn.			"

												Absolute garbage. To begin with, you have to grind hours after hours to get something. Factories take wayyyyyy too long to give you supplies. But of course, this was meant to be on a mobile device. I love this genre but this... this.. is crap. Soliders have one of the dumbest AI's. Wanna attack that machine-gunner? Hold on, lemme shoot this building, is basically the AI. Supplies are too scarce. I've had to be idle for 5 minutes to get supplies enough to make a few troops and one mortar. Good tip for these game dev's is to keep this in mobile, fix the stupid AI, and easy the start diffuculty. But that only adresses so little. I've played it for a while and can't even begin to imagine how many bugs and glitches are in this. But I've spotted a few. Mortars stare straight at enemies and just stand there. Sometimes buying won't get selected so you'll need to reopen the game. Fix this crap game. 3.5/10			"

												If you never played this game before you will probably dislike it like I did when I first started.  I didn't want to quit playing it on the first try so I played it for 2 or 3 days to see if it would hold my attention. I now play it on the IPAD, PC and PS4 on the daily basis because it's very entertaining once you understand the mechanics.In short, you have to build your military might by attacking online rivals, completing battle campaigns, upgrading your factories, oil rigs and defending your resources from invasion.  The players  whom have the best offensive and defensive strategy rise quickly via upgrades, promotions and joint battle operations.If you don't like waiting you have the option to buy gold bricks which allow you to avoid long waiting periods associated with crafting your offensive and defensive measures in order to engage in more intense battles. Gold is rewarded to all players after their meter reaches 100% and they move on to the next level so this is completely optional.The game gets better as you progress and build a stronger military to handle both offensive and defensive measures. Eventually you will want to form an online alliance or create your own. This will allow you to team up against stronger rivals whom will grant you many more rewards if you are successful on the battlefield.There are some frustrating issues with the games like tanks ignoring enemy fire even though you send in 5 tanks to handle business in the general area. Another issue is bunker soldiers shooting through buildings and destroying tanks and soldiers that are clearly at a safe distance behind a fortified wall ect .. The artificial intelligence could be a bit better but overall it's still a fun game to play overtime.			"

												This is a cheaply made time management game. This is very apparent from the tutorial where it shows you that you must build a barracks, which will take a minute, but if you spend gold, you can have it now! Gold is the premium currency you pay money for. This is a silly, pay to win time management game not so different from what one finds on Facebook. In my opinion, ""free to play"" pay to win time management games with very little production value have no place on Steam. I would not recommend this game to anyone, as it is merely engineered to make you want to spend money while offering almost no real value.			"

												First of all this game is not  clone of clash of clans or any other game similar to it. People dont seem to understand that it dosn't make it a copy of CoC  just because you have gems and you can build things and train troops. If you dont like games like these then dont get them in the first place.			"

												Has micro-transactions that allow you to get ahead, although it is possible to grind your way to the same point without any money just takes some time.If you enjoyed Clash of Clans you might enjoy this, like all mobile games it has a grind and that grind leads you to even more grind, so if you like grinding to nothing then this is for you, I was having fun with it for a while then it just became a job and I still continued to play it for a while after that, No more playing for me.

You can check in it between matches in cs go or whatever game you play, they make the game a non pay2win because they give you challenges to complete to get more gold. The supplies are a fair game too because they have the free daily spin then its 1 gold to spin again just by using it Ive made about 150 off the wheel.

												The game starts off and is alot of fun! You construct and maintain your islands and army, you raid other players bases, and run through the campaign, which at some points, others up a bit of a challenge. Seems like a blast right? IT IS! But then reality sets in. You get build times of 10 days just so you can hold more resources to wait another 10 days to spend. Training times for troops aren't too bad at first, 20 second, 45 second, but then you have some that are an hour, which kills the whole 'quick retraining' thing. I see what the Devs want, which is for you to spend money to build stuff quicker, but the amount of money you would have to spend to make any difference at all is absolutely ridiculous.Over all, I feel like it is a good game, but due to the huge wait times and extreme depending on spending cash, I would not recommend this game.

												After a while I lost my current game state and the game started from the beginning. I thought it can be maybe a bug and tried againt. I played 2 days with this and it was fine. I developed some things, builded buildings. But now I lost my current status and the game loaded that state which was I lost some days ago. I can ask wtf was that? Why couldn't they just store my game state normally on server?Btw withouth this bug (when I lose 2 days gaming) I could enjoy the game. It wouldn't be soo bad. But now I lost my mood to play -.-			"

												So this is the future of Strategy Games-Swarming with many CoC-like ""strategy"" games instead of top quality good ol' classics like Command & Conquer.I wouldn't hate it if it stayed on the phones,but trying to enter Steam,where most of the games are good ones?Hell i'm gonna admit-This makes Command and Conquer 4 look like an 10/10 game.The Gameplay mechanics is basically the same as CoC-You send troops at the enemy base and watch your troops mindlessly blast and shoot at the enemy.Like many mobile games,it's full of micro-transaction.(Like 300 gold for 1.99-Seriously?)And the worst thing is in this game P2P=Top of the leaderboards.Do everybody a favor and do NOT spend money on this game.Instead,try to support the ones who are making good ones.

It is a pay to win type game, and shouldn't even be given a moment of your time.			"

												Let's try to leave out all ""it's pay-to-win"" kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, because let's be honest - 97.4% of games with micro-transactions are that way. And this game isn't the worst of it's kind! since you get enough of gold from leveling (which is easy - just build troops) and crate drops.What really ruins this game for me is matching system! I don't get what match making is based on.. How come I get pummeled by players twice my lvl, twice tag amount or army lvl but never see someone who is half my lvl in any of those categories? And sometimes I think that when I get over some money threshold I get lit up like a christmas tree for all the high lvls: I fight battle after battle with equal levels (sometimes winning, sometimes losing) and when I get closer to building something expensive out of nowhere I get rolled over by someone who sweeps my defenses like if they weren't upgraded at all..Talking about battles I like the idea! You get different units which go for specific buildings and you have to decide were from you launch them so that you get the best outcome for yourself. Same goes for building your base. You have to make smart layout to slow your attacker. On the plus side you can change layout as many times as you want without extra charge.			"

												Ten-hut! This is Battle Islands, a ww2 based ""free-to-play"" game, where the player will have his/her own island fortress, it's basically a singleplayer strategy game online, and with singleplayer I mean that you can't see your friends/enemies play but you can still fight them when they're offline. In Battle Islands the player have to focus a lot on both defense and how to attack the enemies. You can have as follows: Land units i.e. soldiers, jeeps and tanks.Naval units i.e. gunboats, warships and submarines.Air units i.e. fighters, bombers and torpedo bombers.In this game you'll be using supplies and gold as a currency. Supplies is used for the most e.g. training units fortifying structures, upgrade/promote units and structures and also buy stuff. Gold can be used to buy supplies and camouflage (camouflage is used to be hidden from other players so they can't attack you). The player can also buy gold with real money if necessary, but it's not needed since you eventually earn gold throughout the game.Battle Islands is a game that craves a lot of patience, so you better find yourself something else to keep you preoccupied while waiting, unless you buy gold to boost the gameplay. Your armies can be used to both attack other bases, as well as defend you own. You can also build different structures, like factories, supply depots and rigs to get extra supplies from. Barracks, ship yards and hangars to get your attack troops from. The basic defense units comes from the camp, harbor and airfield. You will also be using machinegunners, howitzers, anti-air guns and sea forts to defend your base.In battles against players you'll take and lose dogtags, dogtags tells how experienced you are in battles against other players, and if you've been attacked a lot.There is a campaign of 30 levels where you can loot some supplies. If you're a beginner I would recommend to fight the campaign first, but you won't earn any tags from it.In Battle Islands you'll spend a lot of time on upgrading your stuff, blasting other players bases and move around structures to create a stable defense.I think this game is simply fun,challenging and a bit frustrating. But this game still has some minor bugs, for some reason the one you chat with can't see some words you type, it's like some weird censorship e.g. if you type ""attack"" you'll see it but other players will not, and I really mean that ""attack"" is censored in the chat. There is another weird glitch: In some random occasions the jeep in the command bunker or barrack displays a destroyed look.I would recommend this fun game to anyone with patience and taste for simplicity.Battle Islands is currently available for iPad/iPhone/iPod, any android device,PC and now PS4. Did I miss anything?Dismissed!.			"

												This is a good game, I like that it was ported onto steam so I can play on my phone and continue it on my computer.  It just needs more resources from an update because I'm to the point that it takes weeks to update and ill play less.			"

												When I got this game, it was kind of fun, I enjoyed playing it and attacking other people for their dogtags and/or resources. I despise a lot of things about this game, however. Such as the following:1) It's p2w. You will see about a hundred pop-ups a day saying ""Ohh buy this"" or ""Ohh buy that"".2) It's a complete rip-off of Clash of Clans.3) You will get attacked. A LOT. I once got 100,000 resources from raiding people for countless hours, I logged off, did stuff, but then I turned it back on. ""10 people attacked you.""and 4) Most of the units are legit crap. I thought jeeps were good, they are not. Sure, they'll go for the resources, but they'll die before they even fire one bullet at it. The naval units are crap as well. Gunboats will are fragile and Battleships take up a huge amount of space. I can only train one of them. And they are SOOOOO SLOW.But, there are things I kind of like about the game, such as:1) It doesn't cost any resources to attack people.and 2) There's some kind of wheel of fortune. Generally, you need gold to play it, but you can also get it free once a day for a chance of getting 4 gold bars.Not a lot of good things about the game, I can't say I'd recommend buying it. In my opinion: It's okay. It's easy in the lower levels, but as you progress, it's like you're slowly descending into the pits of hell.			"

												Pay to win in the worst way. I find it a chore to play. Some of the worst pathfinding and AI ever. All of your units will beg for death which just made me not want to spend money that much more.I do not recommend this facebook quality money grab. Which is sad, because with more unit control and removing the long build times in favor of a pay to own model... I would have bought the game and likely enjoyed building my island base.			"

												30/100 - Pay2Win and plain stupid!This is bad, even for a browsergame.Every moment shows it´s made for Mobiles..After 30minutes you´re lvl 3 and need to invest..about 2€/hour at least to be halfway - let´s say competitiveI save yourself the time to read though other CON´s, but the major issues are:-bad controls (imagine a browsergame 10years old by now^^)-no direct combat, no positioning,nope.. you just watch your units die or win!-don´t expect any gfx setup, same for audio-even the Cashshop lacks functionalityCashshop everywhere - OMG!Avoid it at all costs!!

												NOTE: This game is Free to Play, as a result of that fact, take this review and all others with a grain of salt as you can basically play it yourself, and I encourage you to, so you can see with your own eyes. Infact, do just that instead of reading this review so your opinion will not be weighted by my own.So this game is basically Boom Beach in a lower quality. In the very beginning, you are greeted with an on-rails tutorial segment that everyone that isn't Supercell does with their Clash-like or Boom Beahc ripoffs... usually.As a note, this game will be treating it as just that; a boom beach clone.So after playing it some more after that point, I've found that you can add segments onto your island, though I feel this limits defensive possibilities, you can't cancel upgrades, change resolution, make the game fullscreen or change hte UI screen size, and most of all... units that deploy have no collision with the environment's rocks, and with eachother, which doesn't make much sense since there's always multiple entry points to any base.Looking at the unit list, there is definitely alot to be unlocked and aimed for, and due to the fact that nothing requires a level 10 or higher HQ (It's called a Command Bunker, but bear with me.), I'll assume hte level cap is or may be Level 10, even if temporarily. Also alongside units are even more buildings to get, most of which are gained before HQ 7, which also might be the level cap right now or for all time.The game at first has one resources; Supplies, which I assume you get more resource types later on.I didn't play for long since... Well in my honest opinion, boom Beach jsut leaves a better impression.I would suggest that the game's unit collision (while deploying, when deployed I don't care) is adjusted to be there, at least with the environment as it just looks bad. I also would at some point put some more work into the grapical design, it looks pretty basic for what (i think) is a completed product.I also would strongly advise allowing players to skip the tutorial.Altogether, the game left a fairly sour first impression with me, so I will rate it...4/10. The game does seem to have some good, unique-ish elements like island expanding which is slightly cusomizable, but it needs work before I personally would call it passable by any means.It's free to play, so maybe you'll enjoy it more, just get past the tutorial and act as if you just started playing.
