												First things first: This game was originally called Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, it was ranamed Arma due to legal problems between publishers and developers.Now to the review:I came across Operation Flashpoint way back on 2001. It was just mind blowing, at that point there simply were no game with such an broad scope and such a powerful imersion.The story takes place in the good´n old 80´s, when there were real intenational tension and warfare wasn´t a matter of eletronics, laser targeting and remote vehicles.A crazy russian general takes a nuke, a division of the red army and a lot of tanks and takes over some islands in the north atlantic, but those islands are under NATO protection, so the war begins.During the game you take the role of 4 soldier with distinct roles in the army. A foot soldier, a tank pilot, a chopper pilot and a black ops expert. With all 4 you climb up in the ranks, starting as a grunt and ending up in commanding large groups of units on the battlefield. It also ends in delivering a very diverse experience, as you play on several unique missions and control an interesting variety of ground and air vehicles.The gameplay is rather chunky, the movement is very limited, it all seems weird at first, but it is actually very immersive. There is one of the great virtues of the game, its realistic aproach to combined arms warfare. If you imagine that a soldier is carrying over 20kgs of equipment and ammo, it would be really hard to run and jump as you do in Call of Duty.Without planning and the right resources, there´s nothing a squad of soldiers can do agains an armored vehicle, and the importance of air support is acurately shown.The game is very unforgiving, the damage system works like this: Shot in the legs, and you can´t stand. Shot in the arms, you cant aim. Shot twice and you die. Shot in the head, game over.This actually works out very well, as this system forces the player to play cautiously, and adopt real world strategies to stay alive. You are forced to take cover, to look around for enemies before moving, to pay attention to orders and intel in order to not fall in a trap or get flanked.Another strong point from this game is the support developers gave to the community. The game was designed to be easily modded, and the developers were very active in the community, patching the game and implementing features that the players asked for.The game also featured an mission editor mode, wich was the same used by the developers to create the main campaign, allowing players to create their own missions at will, sharing with other players or even creating awesome co-op or PvP missions.It was a very new thing at the time, and the community was very solid. This philosophy is still kind of rare, but it was always part of the Arma series, and Arma 3 specifically targets for a relevant community participation in game developing and content creation.Operation Flashpoint was improved in nearly every aspect along the Arma series, but still stands as the game that started it all.Its vast open terrain, flexible and diverse gameplay, realistic aproach and some trully memorable events changed the landscape of the military games and still survives as an enjoiable game.In it´s time it deserved a 10/10.Today, we can see that it aged well, and still attracts attention as milestone in millitary simulation. 8/10			"

												""TARGET! RIFLEMAN, 200 METRES! SOUTH-EAST!""My childhood, rests right here. Don't let the title fool you, this is Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis. One of the first milsims of it's time. A decently groundbreaking game back in it's day, with a strong cult following.It has been renamed as such after the scummy devs from Codemasters fully acquired the rights to the title from Bohemia Interactive, and ruined the franchise to hell and back realising they don't have the ""Czech touch"" to games like this, spawning awful games such as Dragon Rising and Red River, which weren't QUITE generic cawadooty CQB shooters, but were basically casualised versions of the former games.Naturally this game got later rebranded after Bohemia released ARMA, the spiritual successor to OpFlashpoint. It lacks one of the expansions, Red Hammer, due to it's partial ownership to Codemasters, but it's easily downloadable and works fine.My childhood of dicking about in the world editor, spawning in yourself with jets and jeeps to roam the huge islands, and slavic inspired villages, brings a tear to my eye to this day. Naturally this game is even better on LAN or with something like Evolve w/ friends.Sure, you could buy Arma 3 and tack on hundreds of mods and play in Zeus (which is pretty great by the way), but this is where it all began. Good for a laugh at the primitive graphics or if you want to take a trip down memory lane, and take it for granted.10/10 buy it now, it's not even that expensive. Buy on sale, or you can buy a certain package with Arma 3 that gives you this game for free. (as a giftable copy, too!)			"

												What can I say, one of the most complex (for it's day, in fact some pre-release news articles said what they promised was not possible!) and exceptionally deep FPS / WAR SIMS ever created. Ok the graphics where slated from the start, but at the time NOBODY had whole island you could drive arround for hours, CS maps are stamp sized compared to the almost limitless world found in this game. Hence something had to be reduced, and that was the bitmap and model quality. However, the game play, quirky AI (some times they do funny things them AI), and a great story. It's got a steep (not CS player friendly) VERRY steep learning curv, but once you have it mastered, you will love this game. You can only save once per mission, is a master piece, which forces you to re-appraise your tactics. Brutally hard in places, epic in others. I actually think the views down a valley, with tanks (oh and the sound is ace too) rolling in with smoking engines and dust... was just beautiful. It for me, is the defining open world game too. Here's an example, there's a mission to take out a scud launcher. Time is limited, you have a load of men, some trucks and I think an APC and Jeep. I spent a couple of days trying to complete this mission, and then I thought about what happens in the mission. At a certain point, an enemy chopper attacks (a hind I think), so that made me think, where did that come from... so I worked out it's arrival vector (seriously) and then the next mission I send the guys to 'distract' most of the enemy forces, whilst I took the Jeep and raced in the direction the chopper would later arrive from... sure enough several KM away, there was a field with the Hind and several pilots, some support vehicles and a landing pad. So what? Well this is an open world, so I shot the pilots and soldiers, stole the Hind, flew to the SCUD launcher, blew it to pieces and was home in time for supper. Another time, I dumped in the middle of nowhere, in the dark and must head to a specific direction... it's didn't take me that long to work out to use the Pole Star to get a bearing... priceless gaming at it's absolute best. TBH most all of the new 'versions' of ARMA (which follwed this game), where not as good, no or little story, but better (and slower) graphics sure. But I think like chess (which I've played a great game with bits of tissue with letters on as the pieces at an Airport..), it's not really how it looks, it's not how slick the controls are (they are a little clunky), it just every little thing else. That is why, this is probably STILL the best gaming experience of my entire life, and I'm not sure (like a first love!), I'll ever quite get that feeling again, no matter how good anything new looks.... At this price, it's a gift and should be in everyones collection. :o)			"

												Bought and played when it originally came out, both single and multiplayer. Got it on steam on a sale recently and tried it again.  Single player campaign is awesome (really!) and got me hooked again. Pretty hard though. Atm I'm lost in enemy land where you can try to be bold and get to primary pickup point quickly, or go alternate routes with more time and patience involved.Many vehicles and helicopters can be driven/flown and houses entered for cover. Missions have countless ways to be executed. On one I remember veering completely off the logical path and ran out into the countryside where I after some time found an enemy team guarding a Mi-28 Havoc. I managed to overcome them and steal the chopper which resulted in a very interesting and different end to that part of the campaign. This is single player I'm talking about still. ;)Only one save per mission even on standard difficulty so no run and gun in this military simulator. Needless to say, you have to be very patient, constantly on the move and very tactical or it's a quick game over.Be prepared for pathing problems and the occasional AI getting stuck needing reload to continue. Trigger points to end the mission can also be troublesome sometimes.Other than that, I still think it's one of the finest games ever released. Highly entertaining but also very challenging, as it should be.			"

												This game shows its age. The graphics are dated. The controls are clunky and sometimes illogical. Flight is difficult, as you can barely render in the ground without crashing. The AI is infuriatingly good at some times. Its freaking brilliant.As you can see by the ammount of hours i've sunk into this game, its a damn good game that, if treated correctly, can be played for a long, long time. The AI makes the game an actual challange (something many modern mainstream shooters lack theese days) and, when you fall to the ground in a hail of AK-47 bullets, you know its probably because you did something wrong. The mission editor is one of the best features - it has allowed me and a small group based around this game to access hunderends of user-created mission for our multiplayer sessions, preventing us from getting bored of the same-old, same-old.Modding is another great factor; its very simple to install mods (and, admittidly, break your game) which can range from a few extra units to a total conversion. I'm currently running with the WGL5 mod, which adds much improved animations, models, weapons and a rudimentry medical system.Definatly worth a play. If you get bored, add a modpack or two.			"

												It had been 12 years since first time that i play this game. And now i'm still playing this game.If you look for a combat simulator game then you must have this game(and of course ARMA, ARMA2, ARMA3), and if you prefer an arcade shooter game you should go for COD or BF.This game offer you a realistic combat : when you heard a shot you MUST go prone or crawl to make your safe. A heroic action such as run towards the enemy while you shooting at them is not a smart idea. You will die in a second if you do that.This game will takes your time as much as you wanted to survive on the battlefield. A great plan may takes your time to wait for the right time at the right place. You may move on a longer path to the enemy position to make a safe approach.And don't forget, this game come from 2000's and graphic is suck(compare to 2014's) but gameplay is great!I give this game 10/101 : 3, Driver get in that Abrams.3 : Roger!KABOOOMMMMM1 : Oh no! 3 is down!.

												This is one of the best games ever made! Although it came out in 2001, it is still not outdated, and I regularly play it in 2013. The reason why is because it has so much potential. First, there are two official campaigns, that take place in a possible Cold War conflict, which escalates into armed confrontation. You play either as a infantryman or a squad leader, but can also access any unoccupied land/sea/air vehicle should you need or want to. Every mission in this game in non-linear, so it offers unique experience each time you play it. Story is believable and takes a realistic approach towards waging a war (you are not always on the offensive - sometimes retreat can be regarded as a strategic success). In addition to that, there are many separate single missions that offer a new perspective on the original story. But the real benefit comes with tons of free addons, created by modders. That way, you can expand the game with countless new units, weapons, vehicles, missions and even campaigns if you want. Some are even total conversions, which improve graphics and gameplay mechanics too.Speaking of wich, I have to mention that default gameplay mechanics appeal to me very much, especially looking around and aiming. In my opinion this game feels better and easier to play than its successors in the game series.The only area that lacks a bit is AI driving. It can sometimes miss the road and break immersion, but otherwise it's ok.But my favourite feature (that you should absolutely try) is mission editor. It is easy to use and combined with the previously mentioned addons, you can design and play in your own playground of destruction. You can instantly play your missions as you design them, so you can test different approaches and decide whether to actively participate in them or just be a mere observer. You can create massive battles with air, land and sea units or just small skirmishes to try different tactics. The only barrier is your imagination and I still haven't reached it in more than 10 years of experience.I definitely recommend this game - its value far exceeds its price.			"

												Cool game. I actually played through it a month or so ago off Steam and it's a lot of fun. Originally released as Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, this is a tactical Cold War shooter. It hasn't aged that well and the voice acting is quite wonky but it has an excellent campaign which is the main reason why I picked it up. It's more of a thinking man's shooter, and after a few missions you'll be put in charge of a squad which you can order around. I was really surprised at how well the squad mechanics worked, it's not just a worthless gimmick. It was quite fun playing this game in contrast to ArmA 3 and seeing how the series got started and has evolved. Unlike the ArmA 3 campaign this one featured a greater variety of missions, there's stealth missions, tank missions, heli missions, even one where you fly the A-10. While the outdated graphics place a lot of limits on how large scale the battles are, the game still has pretty good draw distance for its time which makes tank battles really feel like tank missions (after the first tank mission I hated them, by the last tank mission I loved them). If you're a fan of Cold War stuff there is a lot in here, you'll be running from BMPs loaded with Soviet troops, supported by HINDs and T80s rolling around destroying everything while the SHILKA denies friendly air support. This is all accompanied by a great original soundtrack which I feel was a little hampered by the poorly chosen licensed music. The difficulty picked up significantly during the last few missions (I actually had to resort GameFaqs, something I haven't done in a while) but overall the game is very playable aside from a couple crashes and bugs. So in conclusion it's not perfect, but still a great tactical Cold War shooter that's worth picking up for free.Favorite quote (something you should get used to hearing):""Fall back into formation."". . .""WHERE ARE YOU?!?""

												This is the classic.To this day, Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis (Now labled ARMA Cold War Assault) is still a fantastic tacticool shooter and soldier sim. The visuals have aged badly, but it's got it where it counts: the fun factor.If you have a low-end system, this is a great game to pick up. It includes the Cold War Crisis and Resistance campaigns.This is not a game where you can rely on your twitch abilities, regenerating health, and hit markers. One shot can mean death. There is bullet drop. There is armor to contend with. You have to think to win.A brilliant game, full stop.			"

												Walks around for a while *Hear a gunshots Lie downstand and start cowering all squad got owned by T72run for my life to objective Win ?!!!BTW this game is really unforgiving if anyone thinks it is a game like COD or BF think again because this game does cost us time a LOT for a 1 mission (no wonder because of its topography was HUGE) and the realism offered here was outstanding if we are expecting M16A2 to fire full auto well sadly no it only offer semi and burst althought it makes the gun really accurate. You are rambo type player ? well go on try your luck a gunshot wound to the leg will render you crippled and can only crawl your way to nearest medic (provided if the Med are alive). more interesting thing are there is feature of gunshot wound to your hand which will reduce your accuracy greatly, if you asking for gunshot to the head effect thats obvious you'r dead as dead as you can be. rocket launcher here is nearly like to BF and it does arcs when it traveled too far. and experience as Tank commander will be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥since commanding a tank isnt that easy like in BF because the tank was controlled by more crews instead of 1 player fills all crew. first time i played this game i thought that this game is very awkward but it's actualy offering us a realism. Got body bagged everytime i engaged bunch of soviet squad just because i aim so badly earlier on. I almost quit but i did'nt quit since i have found a true value of this game: Commanding (Obey or Disobey one choice will bring your death or survival)Overall this is a nice game even for an old game 10/10			"

												The original operation flashpoint from codemasters remade into this, now I didnt play the original game to know the diffferences but this one is really amazing for an army simulator.Ignoring the old graphics this game has everything, there is two campaigns, the main one is really long and challenging, you are USA throughout it you'll do missions on foot, in tanks, in helis, in jets, in boats, stealth missions, assault, defend, everything, you will go under the command of someone at first and then you will be in charge of units, whether ground troops or tanks and you have all the controls you need under your disposal to execute any plan you have in mind because in each mission after you get your briefing you can actually choose your loadout from a wide variety of weapons and the route that suits you to do it, same mission might end as smoothly as possible or it might end up messy, totally up to you and your efficiency carries to the next level so you need to plan right, and the story is really really good. Now the second campaign happens in coordination with the first you play as the resistance, it is not short but you will start with less resources than the other campaign and depending on your gameplay and how well you execute the mission you can get more, it develops in gameplay as good as the first one. I personally preferred the story of the main campaign but this wasn't bad either. The game campaign could be finished as multiplayer but I didn't try it myself and after gamespy shutdown the devs posted a fix in the discussions. If you are into army simulators this is definitely worth checking despite the old graphics and gameplay it is truly very rich on contents.			"

												Since I don't really know how to review a game properly, I'll just do it my own way.Be advised, there are a lot of better reviews than mine so you might aswell go check them out first.This is one of the first games I've ever played, and it is awesome. To give you a little background, the main campaign sets you on a belic war between the USA and what seems to be Russia. You have to fight the hostile forces, drive your allies from point A to point B, recon the surrounding areas of your camp, and many more things.The graphics are okay for it's time, the game puts you into an open, inmense world all for you. The music is pretty good too, you'll be hearing it a lot during the battle. But what his game has that others don't (I'm looking at you COD and BF) is actual tacticool warfare, you follow or give orders, play smart as a group, and a lot of other cool stuff. This is the first Arma, so if you want to get into the series I'd recommend you go for Arma 3 instead, a much better version.			"

												""I have played this for hours and hours when it was released in 2001, called Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, almost 2 years before Steam was released""An old classic military simulator, actually the first one.Have had many hours in this game, building Zombie missions, getting chased by robots and just pure and fun deathmatch with friends!If you want an improvemwnt to this awesome game try the FFUR 1985 2008 Mod, which keeps some things from the original ARMA: http://operationflashpoint.filefront.com/file/FFUR_1985_2008_Edition;92092Or the FFUR SLX 2007 mod, which improves everything: http://operationflashpoint.filefront.com/file/FFURSLX_2007;82613It'll improve the AI and also the graphics/gameplay!There's also plenty of addons and mods out there that you can mess around with in the built in mission editor.

												This game made a very big part of my war loving childhood, and a love for tactical gameplay with a lot of realism, this is a godsent for all the people that want a challenge and a bit of fun with the game's setting of the good ol' 2001, yet it doesn't even take away from the realism one bit. The only downside is that its missing a working multiplayer (it has MP support, but there aren't any active servers sadly), which would really make the game a lot more cooler just like the other games in the Arma series.And yes, the graphics aren't as good as they are today, but it does give a bit of a nostalgic feeling to it, I mean, just look at those face textures, put a bullet in them, now look at them again! And yes, there are a few bugs and glitches which aren't exactly sorted out, but it doesn't matter, nor does it take away from the game, yes, even the flying bodies after explosions don't take it away, despite how funny it looks to see a body flying across the landscape.Storyline is, meh, not really a stretch, but there are some moments the game will really give you with it. I will even mention, the outdated dialogue alongside the radio transmissions are always fun to hear, really, it is, just listen to Kowalski arguing!The game also comes with the amazing mission editor, just like in the rest of the Arma games, make your own missions and such, it's pretty fun when boredom is not an option, while it doesn't give as much as the other Arma games do, it suffices enough to keep you screwing around with for more.Is it worth buying? YES. Especially since it's only 4€, it's a perfect price worth taking, especially since its rather old, but nevertheless, gold. While of course I still wish it had a few servers around that I could play in with some other people, and perhaps a bit of workshop avilability (this game CAN be modded, though its really hard to find any good mods around the internet lately, either that, or I'm just bad at searching) to make the game more fun to play with, in any case, this is still one of my games that made my war loving childhood, and I wish for it to get into the hearts of many people of today, to give them the taste of what amazing masterpieces games like these were back in the days.Oh, and remember to use cover and prone a lot, those AI might have a dumb coding which makes them go into crawl mode from simply hearing a single gunshot, and run-stop-run around, but they aren't exactly forgiving if they see you running around an open area in the distance, not to mention aimbot you at mid ranges if you aren't smart enough to duck behind cover in time, just a friendly advice, is all.

												Right about the time this game was released, I was playing Deadly Dozen and knee deep in Tomb Raider titles on the Playstation. This game absolutely blew my mind with it's open world playing field. Unlike any other games that were out there, the only boundary that existed was the water, unless you were in an air or water vehicle, then you could essentially drive that boat or plane for infinity with no land in sight and the water and sky would continue to regenerate. I played this game for 2 years before I ever opened the editor. When I did that, I was hooked for life. It was the first game that introduced me to player mods and I must have downloaded every free addon and mission I could find. I also learned about scripting while using the editor and expanding the fun that much more. It still survives today among a limited community on the BIStudio Forums[forums.bistudio.com] and you can find those free player made addons here at http://ofp.gamepark.cz/ as well as years of editing discussion at OFPEC[www.ofpec.com] The Editing Center. These sites contain a ton of free user made missions/campaigns/islands as well. This title may contain outdated graphics, but the game play is still better than many modern day titles of this current period. Definitely worth paying the current price to play through the well made campaigns as well as some of the user made missions. You'd be surprised at how free you are to adopt your own tactical approaches. Have fun!!!			"

												This game isn't all that bad. Certainly not as bad as negative reviews say. It's extremely outdated, but it's still fun. In this game, don't expect to go around taking names and kicking asses on the battlefield acting like a bullet sponge. Don't expect to go prone immediatly after hitting the button.  One shot and you're dead most of the time. And just like in real life itself, you'll get killed by enemies that you can't even see a lot. This is about teamwork, about cover, about not going out there in the open just to get killed. Sure, modern Arma games are better when it comes to that, but this one is still...Pretty good.			"

Got to be careful playing this game. Ambient is totally war like and soundtracks are also very good,Spent so many hours in mission editor, making missions however i wanted, playing as sniper, special forces, commanding tank platoon, civilian life, air missions,....

Product received for free
It is the last mission... We've beaten the Russians off to the end of the island, and now it's time to apprehend the mastermind behind it all... General Guba.Me and my spec ops team of eight finish our briefing: to find and capture General Guba alive before he makes his escape off the island. As we make for Guba's headquarters in our M113 Armored Personnel Carrier, we see a friendly machine gun jeep, probably forming into the friendly assault that will schedule a little while later. As we drive further to our objective, I spot a dirt trail along the mountain path. We follow it to find two ruskies guarding an abandoned outpost with a Mil Mi-24 ""Hind"" attack chopper hiding in the back. The gunner of the M113 takes out the two in quick bursts and I tell my men to board the Hind. ""Out of fuel"" 3 in my squad tells me. I find a fuel truck hiding behind a wall and refuel the Hind. As we start the chopper me and my men get ready for what comes next...As we fly our way to Guba's base, we evade enemy anti aircraft vehicles, namely the  ZSU-23-4 ""Shilka"". A little while later, we spot a friendly assault on the frontlines. An M113 supported by a group of infantry heads for Guba's base. A few yards beyond them, we see the diabolical ruskie tank, the T-80. I tell my gunner to engage the T-80 before our friendlies get slaughtered. I hover the chopper for my gunner to lock on and we destroy the T-80 just in time before it fires a shot at the M113. As we see the friendly assault push forward, we return to our main objective.We hover over Guba's base and spot him in a UAZ, getting ready to leave for good. Luckily we catch him before even sets a good distance into the Shilka infested lands. My gunner guns down any infantry and spetsnaz units guarding Guba and we land to apprehend him. As we finally apprehend the mastermind, he speaks in Russian of how the island will be nuked with his SCUD launchers that is set up somewhere on the opposite side of the island. Lucky for me, I can translate what he was saying and report it to command. Command replies that our new objective is to take out the SCUD launchers ASAP. As we board into the Hind once again along with our whimpering captive, we search for the SCUD launchers...I hover around the coast and spot a group of Shilka AA vehicles firing at me. A little beyond, I spot the SCUD launchers... Ready to launch. I tell my gunner to fire at will at the Shilkas but we take too many hits. My gunner and a few others in my squad are dead... I tell my remaining men to ditch as our helicopter moves closer to the ground... crash landing...Me and a few others, including the captive ditch the chopper just before we hit the ground. I find my legs bleeding and look at the crash site. I call all my units to report their positions to me. Only three of my men were left, along with our captive. I tell them to stay put and look after the captive. As I look infront of me, I see the SCUD launcher's nuclear warhead. I'm lucky to be so close to the nuke... but not so lucky to have my legs broken. As I crawl my way to the SCUD launcher, I spot the same ruskie Shilkas that shot down our chopper. Luckily they seem to be too trained to the skies in search of more prey. I was suprised at how there was not much infantry guarding the SCUD launchers. I crawl my way under the SCUD launchers and plant a satchel charge for each. I crawl my way back to the Hind crash site and tell command the job is done. I take a look back to the nuclear warheads. I set off the charges and watch the explosion. ""Mission Complete"".My Personal RatingI picked this game up a few years back when it was on some type of free weekend where you could pick up a copy for free. Since I had no other choice and was limited to gaming because of my terrible 2007~ish computer, I happily took the chance and launched it. I was so amazed at this game. Even though the graphics may be dated, the gameplay and the detail that goes with the missions make up for it. The mission above is the second to last mission in the game and there were so many routes you could take to achieve it. I was VERY suprised to how I survived the crash and landed right next to the SCUD launchers, allowing me to be able to complete the mission without any saves (there is only one save per mission). This game has to be the best classical military sim. I'd pick it up for the $5 it is now if you are one for nostalgiac feel or just looking for a not so graphic/system intensive game. If you want to enhance the game or are having problems launching/graphic wise, I'd pick up some mods, addons, and support at the official BIS studios: https://forums.bistudio.com/forum/9-arma-cold-war-assault-operation-flashpoint/Overall this game deserves a solid10/10 "

												Here is my review for Arma : Cold War Assualt (renamed in 2011). Previously named Operation flash point : Cold War Crisis.Released back in 2001 a military simulation of might have happend if Cold war actually happend.First off if you are into Call of duty (COD) and/or into scripted corridor shooter's then let me tell you right of the bat that this game is not for you.Shall we beganStoryWhile not going to spoil it for you but let me tell you it's very well done. Most people may think that it has no story or what so over but before you make that judgment let me tell you it's there and it's amazing just progress over the missions and you will see. And your character also talks here yes in cutscenes as well.SoundtrackOver a big total of  track's in total. All macthing the game in various way's and mostly just Epic.Gameplay  The main part. Does it live up to rest of the game?Surely it does let me tell you why. Realistic in a big way and in many aspects. First of all teamwork,strategy,proper planning is the key here or else you wont survive for long. Item pick up system. Crouching and going prone required for proper gun handling. Hud doesn't tell you your health nor your clips remaining bullets, leaving on you to precisely reload or you might just waste up your ammo. And the gun play well certainly the recoil here is pretty low compared to real guns but still gun play is fleunt. And very un scripted you also dont get screemed at for leaving the scripted area because of course  we cant let you do that or else ""sigh"" you will destory the special scripted part ""sigh"". Well guess what? Theres non of that♥♥♥♥♥♥here.ControlsWhile overly complicated for many people but just right once you fully adopt them. I would say most new people would get frustrated but just a word of advice take your time and try to adopt to them and you will be doing just fine.Ai One of best here while buggy at times but still best for it's time till now. Responsive. Do team work. And can even track you if a explosion near occured or from lights of flare. And let me tell you a little story and you will see how cool is that. I was playing one of the missions in this one a head or whatever comes to check you at night after after checking he leaves back in is whatever vehicle but you can shoot down its tyres and then he will go back on feet but on then on theway he will also help you shoot down some soldiers at night. Now how cool is that? You see they actually do have a mind.GraphicsWhile the textures are mostly pretty bad but overall still pretty good here and worth watchable different types of options as well in all still a pass here.Amount of play timeMore than 40 hours with a total off 43 campaign mission's.ConclusionFully worth the price only 10 dollars for a gem like this. Id say get it if you can deal with some of the problems and odd controls.Good story,combat, entertaining. While some clunky controls and a little rough around the edges but overall a classic.===================================================================Click me and follow us as Curator "

												I played this when it was Operation Flashpoint.    Back then the fact that it was open world with every random vehicle being drive-able, and being able to switch between ground, vehicle, and air gameplay was unprecedented.The game was interesting and challenging.   However, the thing I remember most about it was the final mission.  After you've completed the game, you fly back in on a personal aircraft.   You then get into a civilian vehicle and drive around the island.   You pick up some of your buddies (characters you played as during the campaign) and you tour through the various battlefields that you just got done fighting in.It was surprisingly cathartic and I started to get choked up.  ""I remember that place!!""    It's rare that a game evokes that deep of emotions.			"

												A classic to be sure, this game started the MilSim genre. The AI is a little buggy but this is to be expected from a 1st generation game.Since its release in 2001 ArmA (Better known as Operation Flashpoint), has become increasingly popular due to its heavy modability and huge open world. A lot of this hype, however was generated by a mod we all know today as DayZ. Bohemia Interactive nearly shut ArmA down at ArmA 2 because of the l\ack of sales until DayZ was released as a overhaul mod. "

												So, I've realized how retardeed my review for this game was....Time to change it..So, this game was my first shooter I have ever played. I guess I was 10 when I played it first time. Old days.... haha... I remember this game used to be called Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis.Ok, I have admit one thing and that is me being unable to finish the campaing as I was an absolute nooooooooob. Well... how the hell did you enjoy this shet when you were so bad you ask ? Ha.. Custom missions is your answer. The editor ? The best thing ever. I created hundreds of my own missions. From s1mple: couple of units againts each other, to complex missions with units, vehicles moving all over the map and doing multiple tasks (with a background story somewhere in my head). Example? I would start with SpetzNatz parachuting into US military base during the night. There were in a disadvantage (usually 5 units) but still managed to weaken the enemies who then would face attack from the Russian army early in the morning. In a while Chinooks would drop out backup while the Russian were on their way in their tanks for a second attack.... all of this happening while both side's jets fight in the sky.I would spent days (with 3 hours per day) to edit all the timing and make sure it all goes in the right order I want it. Sometimes I played as a civilian just to watch the whole thing. Not impressed ? Well, whatever you say but I think it's pretty cool..... as I was 10 years old ;)Oh and....Also it was one of the fewest games I could've ran on my 512MB RAM PC....also with (for me still unknown) shet CPU and GPU. (Well....after all it had ""Windows XP Home"" installed which kinda gives me a hint that it was far from ""gaming PC"")I don't care if there is something wrong, bad in this game. This game means alot to me. Awesome nostalgia while playing it nowadays.My childhood was 10/10, this game was part of it and so... 10/10 for this masterpiece.And hey, putting this here just in case....... English is not easy, ok ?			"

												Pretty much the first true war simulator out there. It's not about pulling the trigger. It's about working with your squad, managing your ammo, completing orders and finally - surviving. You'll be out in a huge landscape, wondering where on earth is enemy engaging from. Your commanders may die, and you'll have to make decisions yourself. Few bullets and you're dead. Sometimes you'll be on a boring patrol, sometimes you'll drive a truck, sometimes you'll be forced to retreat, one day you'll fly a helicopter, drive a tank and become a commander yourself.However age leaves a mark in graphics. Also aiming feels quite unsensitive at some point, mainly because you'll engage the enemy at 100+ metres and even with low senitivity it will feel odd.9/10 if you like it hardcore and don't mind the age of this game.

												I'm defending a coastal town from an enemy assault, wielding an assault rifle at a defensive position. I see enemies far away at the beach. They look so small, like ants. I hear a bullet whizzing just past me, then screams of death somewhere near. Then it happens - I get shot in the leg. There's a flash in my eyeview as I scream in pain. Unable to walk anymore, I start crawling. At the same time, the unspeakable happens: There's a radio command, explaining that the assault is too strong and that our forces are to retreat from the town to a rendezvous point at least 500 meters away. I cannot believe what is happening. While others retreat running for their life, I do so crawling. Soon I'm left behind, all alone, using but bushes as my cover.The crawl to the rendezvous point took from 15 to 20 minutes. I groaned in pain all the way there.5/5 would play again.			"

												i was playing this game when i was a teenager, the begining of a love story. This game was so realistic i couldn't believe it, the first assault on everon with helicopters dozen of units at the same it was really an achievement back then.Cold War Assault provide the best campaign with the most variety, you will play a pilot with the famous code name of November still used in arma 3, a spec ops team leader and finally a simple marine with a bright future ahead.Always a pleasure to go back on this game, a must have for nostalgic player			"

This is the game that got me into PC gaming over a decade ago.I still remember the very first time I played it. This masterpiece felt like a true war simulator back then, since there were not many games like this. It was really realistic in terms of difficulty.● Really immersive campaign. Multiple characters, each having their set of skills on the battlefield. The cutscenes in this game are so good and long. It actually feels like watching a movie of Cold War.Campaign is also quite lenghty, variety of missions, never a mission indentical to another.● Realism is top notch in this game. You'll die within 1-2 shots depending where you got hit.It really hit me back then and still does, when I get 3 shots to my leg and my whole squad gets mown down...crawling 3km through woods without having a chance to stand up and fight...● Graphics...now this game unfortunately has aged pretty badly. BUT when it was first released in 2001, it was a big thing! I imagine for a person who haven't played this game and decides to test it out Now, big chance is he/she ain't gonna like it due outdated graphics. For me nothing beats nostalgia.● Mission Editor makes this 10/10 masterpiece into a 11/10, no jokes.It's so fun, endless amount of variety!I remember creating hundreds of different missions, stealth assasinations, all-out war, destroying convoys and even a whole new campaign. It really offers you to create any kind of mission you'd like and it's super easy aswell!● Expansion packs - God damn these expansions felt like a standalone game on it's own! Offered bunch of new content, a huge new island to turn it into your playground. Red Hammer had such a good storyline with a twist at the middle!Resistance also had a great campaign with a whole new island and missions.Now that's what you can call a expansion pack/DLCThese were probably the most important things to bring out in a review. I just grabbed this game for 0.79c and I am once again playing this game for about 20th time I think. I still have the game boxes so one day I can pass that legendary game to my children etc...

												Great battlefield simulator. It plays as if it was part of a movie that took place during the Cold Wat. The gameplay takes you through training as if you were in the military and a few in-game simulations. The actual battlefield on the other hand is very difficult, very life-like. Once I got the controllers down right I was able to go in better and then got shot down. I did find it odd that I couldn't jump but then again I didn't seem to need to jump in-game. Here are the first few minutes of gameplay all the way to my death:

												Old game that I have spent more hours than I dare to count. This was total blast as a multiplayer and single player campaign was interesting enough to keep my engaged until I finihsed it (multiple times even). Some of the missions are quite tricky and may require multiple tries, which coupled with the limited saves per mission can get very frustrating.Infantry operations are the most fun part of the game. Messing with tanks is tolerable and flying vehicles are annoying. I especially enjoyed that not all missions were about running into a village and gunning everyone down, but required stealth or simply survival.Game is pretty old and graphics reflects this. Good part is that it should run on a lower end machine as well.			"

												One of the best war simulators ever created. The first time you play it the game is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ but once you learn how to move, shoot and stop it's super efective and easier. The vehicles are a strong part: Jeeps, Tanks, Helicopters and Trucks. Command your own squad makes it amazing and interesting too. I repeat, you could hate it, but you just need patience to get into the heart of this game. Instead of the Armed Assault franchise, I prefer this game (originally called Operation Flashpoint).PS: THE EDITOR! CREATE YOUR OWN MISSIONS! YAY!<3			"

												When I got this game as a gift from my friend I seriously was not interested in playing it. However after opening the game I ended up trying out its missions. I remember being somehow impressed by the way how an old game was able to satisfy me, so I got more and more into it and now I'm pretty much playing Arma CWA daily. I would recommend finding friends to play the game with you. Of course messing around with planes, weapons n' other ♥♥♥♥ in the mission editor is loads of fun (at least for me), but nothing beats doing a Spec Op mission with 4 mates. A lot of people take criticizing the game for granted because of its age and bad graphics, but try the game out! I'd recommend checking out http://ofp.gamepark.cz/index.php?showthis=2692 as it's probably the most popular/well-known community website there is. Over there you will be able to find lots of single missions, mp missions, addons, skins... Pretty much everything!Just because it's not the newest of videogames, it doesn't mean that it's bad or unplayable. It's annoying how people just toss this awesome game away after just looking at screenshots of the game. "

												Still one of my most favourite games. Once in a while I start it up with ECP and some graphics mods to play a round of MFCTI versus bots. The feeling of trying to take the first town on insane resistance difficulty, gathering all the guns and ammo you find in the trabant you stole from a civillian a while earlier and then just going from town to town is awesome. Best LAN game ever! The feeling if one of your buddies is designated driver in the early game on MFCTI maps, just ferrying people from the base to the battlefield - everyone just doing his job to capture more villages until one can finally unleash the full armoured might of the soviet union - PRICELESS!I've been playing this game since it originally was released!

												I played this game way back in the day and it really shook me how non-linear a game can be. You have to realize that at its release, most games had you storybording through the game on one single linear path. It became quite obvious that OFP was the game for me. People think this game doesn't hold up well today but that is false. The game has multiplayer still, me and a couple of guys frequent coop missions and th ey are a blast. If you want to play multiplayer with us, look up a program named Operation Monitor on the BI studios forums. Thats all you need. Cheers to a great game.			"

												this game is way ahead of it's time compared to other game that was released in 2001. the fine attention to detail is what staggers me the most, time cycle between day and night depends on the time of day,month and year, randomly generated number plates and the lot.. At that time no game could even come close to this revolutionary to open world game.when i was a child my dad borrow this game from his friend and me being a 6 year old boy who really love to play army men, i saw my dad played this game and i asked ""can i try it?"" and he let me tried it and instantly fell in love with this game. after fiddling around in the single player mission and failed horribly i accidently stumbled across the Mission Editor, i completely baffled by the UI because i couldn't understand a thing (let alone english) and what it does at the time, then i tried to mess around with it and slowly figured out how to place soldiers and vehicles then starting to put waypoints to a unit and create my very first mission. even though the mission itself didn't have any objective i imagined the soldier have their own quest and conversations between each other and having a blast on making it as well as playing it.since i grow old enough to understand this game i can really felt the struggle, the emotion and fear that the soldier have through out the campaign and made a lot of single player missions by the time i was 13. eventually i finished the game and boy i never felt as close to a real war playing any games other than this ( little bit of exaggeration but you get the point.)thank you Bohemia and Codemaster for this incredible game, but mostly a huge thanks to Bohemia Interactive Studio to made a sequel to this we all know today as the ARMA series			"

 ArmA: Cold War Assault REVIEW Many years ago in a time called 2001 came a legend called Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis and it gained many rewards along with a expansion pack called Resistance and even got Game Of The Year. But then around a ayear before ArmA: Armed Assault came out Codemasters and Bohemia had some troubles and split and Codemasters took the rights to the name Operation  Flashpoint and got re-released in 2011 under the name ArmA: Cold War Assault.ArmA: CWA is a military shooter/military simulator that is set during 1985 at the height of the Cold War. Soviet forces invade a bunch of islands and thats where you come in as apart of the U.S. army which is all I know.The graphics haven't aged well over the years and don't live up to todays standards. Textures being quite blurry and models are low-poly don't look nice but I guess computers weren't power beasts back in 2001 to be able to render some very large maps like Everon, Malden or Nogova which is the largest there.Sounds aren't to bad, ambient sounds being the best and the weapon sounds are lacking but do deliver a nice feeling of power. There is little ambient combat sounds which makes it hard to detect how far and where the fire is coming from but you do have a direction of where it might be coming from.You have the basics of shooter elements W,A,S,D move you around the map as a infantrymen. Z prones and Q goes crouch Q stands you up which is odd but you get used to it. Many more controls in-game but I'll explain vehicle controls. The basics when in any ground vehicle Q is slow speed, W is medium speed, E is fast speed, A turns left, D turns right and S goes backwards. Aircraft is a different story which would be best to learn in-game.There is selection of weapons and vehicles on each side and they have equal power to their opposing side. Sometimes even having a strong point and a weak point like the West side's Jeep is weakly protected but is faster than the more armoured East side's UAZ which is slower but can fit more people. Tanks have equal strength and power like the M60 is equal to the T-72 (unsure about the Resistance T-55.) Its missions can get buggy and glitchy but thats only the missions.The multiplayer servers are no longer online but you can download programs to see servers so it isn't fully dead yet.Overall I think its a decent game worth the money, it may be old but it still lives up as a good game and is GREAT when modded to utter♥♥♥♥♥♥I would give the game a 8/10 but with the community sitting behind it with thousands of mods to improve and add to the game I give it a 9 out of 10 and if theres anything I shoudl add to this review you can tell them in the comments and have a great day.

												Yes I recievd as a Gift. After Purchasing Arma 2 and all DLC, most likely or Arma 3.But I played Original trilogy back when it was still new.A few Features that really Impressed me.First and foremost: The AI did not seem to Differentiate you from other AI's.But if you Fire too many shots w/o changing positions, especially shooting 1, then 2 enemies and posibly 3, by then you have 3 or more all shooting at you.You could injure hand(s), arms, or legs, the one I hate most. I thought it was a bug at first I'd get up and then go prone again.It deserved Every Reward it got, and possibly more.I will Always remember, Definitley top 10 Ever, as far as How mcuh I enjoyed the game then, and considering it vs other games. Also I would gladly give the Game to anyone who would Enjoy it.After Playing Arma 3 I will not play this game again as Arma is over a decade Ahead, and still getting better.I was dissapointed the other OP Fp were not same maker's and worse, I did not Discover Arma till #3, but knew right away it was the same makers, and realized why the other OP FP's sucked.I assumed they owned the game name, but I guess not.

												Okay, I felt I had to do this... hem, THE GAME CAME OUT IN 2001 GUYS! Seriously how many negative revews are there whinning about this game having ""bad graphics"" and that for a game in 2011 it looks really bad...""Arma: Cold War Assault"" is the retitled game by Bohemia interactive known as ""Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis"" and it was made in 2001. Yes a full 10 ♥♥♥♥ing years older than these idiots are claming it to be. It was renamed in 2011 by Bohemia (the original developers and creators of the ""Arma"" series) in order to draw a gap between it and the Horrible ""game"" by codmasters  Operation Flashpoint: Dragon rising"". Because Codemasters kept the rights to the name, bohemia couldn't carry on their series under that said name so they created ArmA, but only in 2011 did they actually rename their original game Operation Flashpoint to mark it more as their property which it is. Soooooooo. Oh a 13 year old game? not 3 years? OOOOOoooooooWhat AMAYZING GraphicsWhat AMAYZING ControlsWhat AMAYZING PossibilitiesSeriously this game let's you do what you want, you can be a soldier, a tank commander, a helicopter pilot, a truck driver... Be anything, Do anything, make your own missions, or just play the extensive and challenging campaing. Calling this masterpiece and cornerstone of war simulation a ""piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; is sickening at best and comes from a crowd of 13 year old COD players who wern't even born when this titan of a game was released. So please all you idiots who can't tell a 13 year old game from a 3 year old one, just refrain from posting your poisonous oppinions and atemting to tarnish the imaculate reputation of the greatest war simulation franchize of all time and one of the best game series out there. Also if as most of these kids you truly believe that COD is a better game... just keep your oppinions to yourself, because this just isn't the game for you. I don't go around throwing punches at Final Fantasy because I know I'm not the target audience and such an exercise would simply be... Pointless.Thank you, and I hope someday a lot of you will do a little research before ""revewing"" a game, let alone actually play the game.			"

												This is quite the interesting game. I got it, seeing how I've shown some interest in ArmA, I have a low-end PC and the game itself was pretty cheap. Needless to say, I was far from disappointed.But to prevent others from being disappointed, let me make one thing clear:  This game, in terms of realism and style, is nothing, and I mean nothing like Call of Duty or Battlefield. Those games try to be cinematic and intense, leaning on explosoins and special effects that almost trump Michael Bay in terms of how ridiculous and frequent they are. ArmA, at least this one, tries to approach genuine military simulation, and it shows.For example, let's look at the damage model:  A shot to the legs, you can't walk, a shot to either arm, and you can't shoulder-fire your weapon, a shot to the head? Well, unless you're a courier stuck in a desert, let's just say you won't be stumblign back up. For most, it's two pops and you, your allies, or your targets are dead; none of this life bar that slowly regenerates which the newer Battlefield and CoD games do for whatever reason. If you're hurt, you need to call a medic, no easy way out.Also, vehicles. You can't just hop into a tank by yourself and go and wreak havoc. You must get into a vehicle, and depending on the circumstances, you must crew it (If it's a multi-person vehicle), rearm it, repair it and refuel it, call it your Three R's. Like with a tank, while there *is* a manual fire option, I suggest not using it, as it only aims in the direction that the weapon is last fixed in. So you must have a commander tell the driver where to go, and the gunner where to shoot. Operating on a team is absolutely vital to winning. Which means team participation and roles are imperative to the gameplay.My only qualms lay in the graphics and the voice acting. I've seen some pretty impressive titles come out of the year 2001, (Does the name ""Halo"" ring a bell?) and the graphics are blocky, choppy and overall unpleasant to look at. I like that they tried to make character models more organic; not just a bunch of cardboard stiffs, but for some reason the design of their faces make them look perpetually stoned out of their minds. The environments can look a little dull at times, and I can't help but look at trees and bushes that behave almost like cardboard cutouts--like pieces of paper being flattened as you run over them. However, building and vehicle models are rather well done, and guns look pretty good too. The voice acting sounds a little...odd. The way some of the folks in campaign talk in ways that almost seem hammy, Koslowski being the most poignant display of this in my humble opinion. However, I don't mind this too much. Even if the graphics are lackluster, at least it can run on my PC, which has a rather outdated GPU (Has 256MB VRAM, substantially less than the norm)So, if you're looking for a good first-person shooter you can hop into, maybe this shouldn't be your first choice. However, if you want a game that gives you a realistic simulation of the different theaters of combat, and you want to live out what it must've been like in 1985 to see everyone's hate of the USSR before the Iron Curtain fell, and just to overall enjoy yourself in a good first-person shooter that you don't need a top-notch PC to run, then ArmA:  Cold War Assault's your game.

PROS:+ great single player campaign+ single missions & Resistance mini-campaign+ freedom of choice+ cool battle simulation mechanics+ mission editor+ huge mapsCONS:- graphical glitches- weird AI behavior sometimes- multiplayer lag (even with good connection)- LAN multiplayer only- cardboard graphicsComment:What a game! I played this over 10 years ago and the gameplay is just as good today. Back then it was called Operation Flashpoint - Cold War Crisis, from 2001 but due to copyright issues it has been renamed under the ARMA brand in 2011. This game is a war/army simulator and as such it is bound under certain simulation rules. For example everything is hard as balls to operate. Tanks, helicopters, boats ... and planes, holy hell is it difficult to fly planes! But once you learn it, it is fantastic! Flying around in an Apache helicopter and raining hell down on all those shiny tanks is AWESOME! All this is present in the single missions but mainly the campaign. The campaign does give you missions and an outline on how to do them. But you can just ignore all that and do a lot of the stuff your own way! Place C4 to destroy 4 tanks? Nah, get in one of the tanks and wreck everything (including low flying choppers). Carefully use stealth to get to the extraction point while avoiding BMPs and patroling soldiers? Nope, just steal a Skoda 120 car and zig zag between the tank and soldier fire.  Examples like these is what made the game great for me. What extends the experience even more is the missions you do yourself in the editor. However there are downsides too - graphical glitches, stupid AI sometimes and carboard graphics. Multiplayer is pretty much dead except for LAN. But if you manage to hook up a MP game with some friend(s) you will not regret it. Yes, it is a bit laggy because the network code is rubbish, but it still is loads of fun. I recommend this retro game that despite the flaws is just so much fun!			"

												As it was given free by Bohemia Interactive, it would be rude not to give it a thumbs up.in 2000/2001  in its Op-Flash guise,  this was the king of the hill of Mil-Sims. Interesting just for that. A ""Dads Game"" that the kids played as well, and actually featured on some of the early british television PC gaming shows as a regular feature with teams playing each other on a LAN in a TV studio.If you are an Arma fan its an historic addition to your collection, if you are not an Arma fan, move on, there is probably nothing for you here, Arma 2 or its standalone ""expansion"" Operation Arrowhead  or the superb Arma1 (Armed Assault) will give you a much nicer graphical and play experience plus a host of free addons and community mods you you will never have enough time on your hands to get through them all, and then there is steam online multiplayer for Arma2 (plus DayZ mod) now that gamespy has gone.   So really, there is so much more in the Arma games which followed on from Cold War Assault that you won't play this much. But there will be something missing from your Arma collection if you don't have it.Pick it up free when you can, and marvel at what us old people used to think was state of the art back in the day :-/			"

												ARMA is the premier realistic, combined arms tactical warfare simulation. A slightly modified version called VBS is used by many western militaries for training. Like Battlefield or GTA, one can fight on foot, drive trucks and tanks, sail boats, and fly aircraft. Equip and command a squad of up to 12, directing movement, position, formation, engagement, and more with greater control than Ghost Recon or Freedom Fighters offered. The ballistic models necessitate compensation for bullet drop and leading of moving targets. Injuries to certain parts of the body can cripple; a wounded leg will reduce one to crawling, and a damaged arm will detract from ones ability to use their weapon.  Navigate expansive terrain with map and compass or follow the stars. Play through the campaign, challenge friends in multiplayer *, and design your own sharable scenarios in the mission editor. The developer and the community even share tools for creating your own maps, units, vehicles, weapons, etc..Small arms handling and movement are less smooth than Call Duty, and the default models are blocky and their textures have low resolution. This allows for better performance, but if more detailed models and skins are desired, they can be had in community mods and addons. Default controls are unlike any other shooter, but can be easily changed in the Options - controls menu with a click of the ""esc"" button. The VON is broken, and should never be used or it can cause problems.Cold War Assault takes place in the 1980s amid a fictional clash between the U.S.A. and U.S.S.R..* Gamespy support for multiplayer ended in 2014, so use OFPmonitor to browse MP servers, or use Tunngle, Hamachi, or Gameranger.These sites offer additional information, content, and utilities: https://community.bistudio.com/http://dslyecxi.com/ofp.html (WGL links broken, see video description or moddb)http://dslyecxi.com/ofpttp.html http://www.ofpec.com/index.php http://ofp.gamepark.cz/ http://ofp-faguss.com/index.php Multiplayer https://github.com/Poweruser/OFPMonitor/releases https://github.com/Poweruser/PowerServer/releases http://www.tunngle.net/index.php?l=en https://secure.logmein.com/products/hamachi/download.aspx http://www.gameranger.com/ http://www.teamspeak.com/ http://steamcommunity.com/groups/realistictacticalgaming

It has practically all the same game mechanics of ARMA III but none of the spectacular PTSD inducing graphical upgrades.

												A more honest review than my last,stupid one.So,I picked up this game 'cause I didn't know where to spend my cash.I gave it a try and my opinion in this game was neither bad or good.Some missions were hard,and some missions were easy and cool.The campaign was a little hard in some levels but at the end,it proved very good.I also liked those stealthy missions that it had.But,I couldnt find it enjoyable for some reason.Either because of the outdated graphics (I get it,its an old game),the ai of the enemy npcs (russians could snipe me with their ak-47......),the controls or that I forgot that GameSpy shuted all their servers and I couldn't find any multiplayer game.I suggest you buying the newer ArmA games.But if you like singleplayer,then pick this up.P.S. : Best voice acting ever,a bit repetitive however....

												""OH NO! FOOUR IS DOWNN!"" The horrendous radio chatter is all I need to make me reminisce about a time when open world/sandbox games were few and far between. I spent many hours  of my youth playing in the evenings with a bunch of friends, trying out new mods and missions each time. I fondly remember running away from zombies and failing to deploy my parachute on many occasion. It was great a laugh and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  The great thing about this game is the amount of freedom it gives you.  Don't want to be executed by a Russian firing squad? Steal their Hind that they just transported you in. Or you can run off in any direction and hope they don't shoot you in the back. Recently due to the multiplayer side of things being down, I've gone through the campaign again and it was definitely  worth revisiting. I spent the early parts of the campaign recording the various ways my squad leader managed to get himself killed and trying my hardest to organise formations and be an effective team leader. If you have yet to give this a go, I would highly recommend it. In my opinion the campaign is far better than ARMA and its subsequent sequels and if you manage to get a LAN going or end up playing multiplayer through another option, you'll have a great time.			"

												As 3kliksphilip said, ''It's a beautiful memory from the past.'' Game is very realistic and hard, but you can stop playing campaing and testing all vehicles and weapons in the editor instead. And the only reason why this game has ''bad graphics'' is because the game is 14 years old. Deal with it :) "

												I like the ARMA series, so I went for it when I was offered ARMA: Cold War Assault. If I am completely honest the game is (or at least for me was) a frustrating bug filled mess. I spent hours just trying to get the game to work right on my computer. I am guessing most of these issues were simply because the game was so very old. It is forgivable however because the game provides an adequate view into ARMA's roots. When you do get the game running you will be happy to find a decent game and you will finally see how far ARMA has come when comparing ARMA: Cold War Assault (Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis)  to the newest release ARMA 3.  Overall I was glad to have picked this up while it was free, and think many of you, if you have taken the time to read this review might also enjoy the game. I hope you take the time to learn a little about the ARMA series as well.			"

												If you are spoiled by modern games that takes your hand to guide you, heal you in middle of firefight etc. etc..Skip this game.This games is the origin of arma series, one merciless motherload of tactical epicness and best game investment i ever made.  (actually bought this game 2x, i've played it so much when it came out i ruined my discs) No game ever have satisfied me like this one and thats why i'm always coming back to it.Recommendations: - CSLA mod, another 20 hours of mission/campaign and lots of weapons and vehicles- when you get used to the game try setting dificulty to veteran, full simulation not even the little help thats in game will be provided (e.g: enemy tracking on map)Pros n Cons+ graphics (i'm serious)+ tactical control over everything (you decide when to do anything or when to call backups if available, absolute squad control etc...)+ satisfying campaigns & missions ( huge variety of mission types )+ soundso Some people might not like the controls, but i think they were pretty good imhoSince i'm fanboi- no real cons[My steam might say i didnt played the game much but off-steam i've hundred hours on this game]			"

												Got this arma couple days ago, will never regret it yes the graphics aren't how most people like but the game is amazing to me not only can you play multiplayer without having to use evolve or hamachi but just how multiplayer is you can use level editor to make your own missions for you and your freinds or just play levels already made. The only downside i saw to this game was the mouse, it may be because how fast mice are today that it can keep up or it just not smooth either way it something you can get by.			"

												The graphics are terrible, yes you can't deny that, but its still a classic. Gameplay itself is frustratingly hard, unlike CoD, Battlefield, and many other FPS shooters you can't charge around a corner and hope to still live. You can't rush head on into a group of soldiers and expect a victorious outcome. You will die, over and over and over again. It's very hard - but it's also much more realistic because of it. I got this game so that I may give it a good review based off past playthroughs, I'm hoping I can do the same again on Steam.			"

												Behold! The life of a solider, one shot can kill a him, or save him from death. This is the game that even after a decade still holds up the standart for Cold War era games. The fictional conflict between the USA and USSR gives us an idea of how WW3 would turn out with the vast arsenal at the disposal of both sides.It's impossible to describe the feeling of satisfaction when you complete a hard mission after dying over and over again.In short: This is a classic worthy of everyone's attention.

												This is the game which started the successful ArmA-series, it was something people hadn't seen yet: Military simulator with mission editor and endless possibilities. The game is still outstanding, even there has been sequels many for the game.Graphics aren't the thing which make the game outstanding, it is the playability for me. I recommend this for everyone who want a game where you have to be aware as enemy can be everywhere.There is thousands of modifications the most known of them are FDF, FFUR, I44, LIBMOD, WW2MP, WW1, Napoleonic Wars, American Civil War & SLX. There is many more big modifications worth of naming, but the list would be endless.			"

												This game is very dated, and it shows its age. This doesn't take away from the fact that it is a true Arma title, however. It is still founded in the same shooter and tactical mechanics that make Arma 3 a great game.Cold War Assault has its drawbacks, but it is worth playing to remember Arma's roots and it serves as a refreshing shooter experience.

												This is my review for ARMA: Cold War Assault a.k.a Operation FlashpointI didn't manage to pick this up when it was free a few months ago but did when it was on sale for a buck, and all I can say, is that this game is very ADDICTING! I managed to put many hours into the first few days playing this non stop.The age of this game hasn't age all that well for some people if they judge by graphics, but if you are like me and focus on gameplay alone, then this is an excellent game. In my opinion this has just been the copy for the newer Arma games because I played them all and I can say for sure that they all were just a copy and paste from this one with just a newer engine and updated graphics.But with that beside us, let me get down to the pros/consPros:Very realistic and our own military uses the newer arma games for some training programs and demonstrationsNice mods that implement many more campaigns, WW2, Vietnam, ectGreat teamwork online(yes people still play)With mods, improvement in graphics and soundsOverhaul, excellent and get this if your hardware can't handle the newer arma gamesCons:Without mods, not so great graphics/soundsSome hiccups for an older engineUI for editor is ok, make sure to have it on advance,Thats it, I highly recomment it, thanks!

												This game is also too graphics intensive. I had trouble running it on my GTX 750 Ti, and was only getting 20-30 FPS on the lowest graphics settings. The textures are absolutely beautiful, though. For a few minutes, I felt like I was looking at pictures from real life, not a video game. The voice acting is brilliant. No pause between words whatsoever, it makes you really feel like you are there. Only get this game if you've got a 3-way SLI GTX 780 with at least 5GB GDDR5 RAM per card. That might get you medium graphics settings. A very revolutionary game, but I'm wondering how Battlefield 4 got more attention than this? This game has better gameplay, better graphics, better voice acting, and a GREAT singleplayer campaign. If you are thinking of wasting money on Battlefield 4, just get this game instead. It is free, afterall. Seriously though, this game sucks lol.			"

												Man, when I play this game, all I can think is quality. Textures? Flawless. Gun mechanics? Flawless? There isn't a single thing I would have changed if I made this game. It is simply that amazing. In fact, I took a screenshot while looking at the sky in-game and compared it to a high-resolution image of the atmosphere taken by NASA and could spot no differences between them. In fact, I sent a side by side comparison of the two to NASA and they couldn't tell which was the fake and which was real! I mean, for a game made in 2001, that is impressive. I'm pretty sure this goes without saying, but this game runs twice as well as newer games such as Batllefield 4 and Call of Duty: Ghosts, while including twice the content. Again, the degree to which the developers went with this game to reach this gem of a first-person-shooter is simply mind-boggling. Never before has the gaming industry seen a game with audio and models in game that are nearly indistinguishable from people and noises in real life. Truly, if you have been searching for a game where you hunt communism through the western frontier all your life, search no more. ARMA: Cold War Assault is the game for you.			"

												I didnt know what to expect when i first saw this game when it went free for a few days on Steam. I downloaded the game and hopped in. Boy this game surprised me.This game is an open world squad based military shooter. Sounds awesome right? Beacuse it is! Fighting across massive islands in tense firefights struggling to survive to see the next tense firefight is a lot of fun. This game is also NOT I repeat NOT for you that like casual shooters. 1-3 bullets can kill you. 1 from a headshot if you get unlucky. This game is NOT for casuals. When I first started playing I got frustated at the amount of times I was dying, which was an absurd amount. You HAVE TO play smart, and make every bullet count. There is very little room for error. The combat for me took getting used to, there is a learning curve. The NPCS are also surprisingly smart when it comes to combat. They take cover, launch grenades, take out veichles like its a priority, and are scarily accurate. Perhaps the greatest thing about the game is the level editor. You can select from 5 massive islands to create your own battles. You can place different factions down, set patrols, waypoints, objectives, ranks, behaviour, etc. Making massive battles to take place in is very fun. I have been screwing around for hours just making large battles, its fun to see so many tanks fight at once :) . The level editor does take learning and the internet to know how to use. There is no tutorial for it. And when it comes to waypoints its gets a little tricky.. And NEVER try to make a tank or any veichle cross a bridge via a waypoint. Its painful to watch.Pros-Tense, stressful, rewarding combat.-Large, fun battles-Level editor is a beast-Massive maps to fight on- As long as you keep coming up with new ideas, Level editor will keep you entertained for a long time.- Impressive NPC to fight against. Definetly gives you a challenge.- Lots of variety in combat. Foot soldiers alone have lots of different classes.Cons- The NPCS dont have the best pathfinding- Learning curve- Dated graphics (Graphics to me personaly dont matter though)- Boring campaign in my opinionOverall I would give this game a 9.5/10. This game is very impressive and fun. You may experience some annoying glitches with pathfinding and such and it is a bit dated, but it hardly subtracts from the overall experience. Definetly a fantastic game for you that like a challenge in a military game. "

												Picked this up for free back during the Bohemia Anniversary a few years ago when they were giving free copies.No regrets at all. Not only was it a no brainer since it was free, it's still fun and plays great for a game originally released 15 years ago. And even if you do buy it, it's cheap. As of writing this on November 23, 2016, it's 80% off, at $1.19. Original price: $6.It's worth the small amount of money it costs. Great story, good gunplay, enough realism to make your teammates scream after getting shot, and decent graphics.And don't forget to nominate it for the ""Test of Time"" Award.			"

Even the mission!  It is crazy that you can die in 3 seconds, Multiplayer or not.  All in all... 10/10 for people who can handle it.			"

												Imagine if Ukraine was a Socialist Island with NATO Units stationed there. And the Socialist government dissolves and Russia has to throw their dice into the fire ASAP, with NATO troops stationed there. No, not the Ukraine on the news, a tiny one, and it's the 1980s. Then Russia magically wins against NATO because the U.S. carrier group sent out to aide it's NATO counterparts never shows up. Ever. And there's also a resistance campaign, because everyone wants to resist Russian takeover Even Taco Bell.			"

												Back when it was called Operation Flashpoint and Arma didn't exist, I probably put more tme into this game (obviously outside of Steam) than anything else I've ever played. As far as military sims available to the public went, this was the be all and end all, Ghost Recon x 50. I couldn't believe such a game could exist when I first picked it up. I must have spent thousands of hours in the editor. Of course the Arma games have surpassed this title greatly, but they never matched the feel I got from playing this when I was young, there was always just something about it, it felt completely real. For the price, you can't go wrong.			"

I hear everybody everyday complain about ""Oh, this game is not realistic, I do not want to play this crap!"", but they don't understand that gaming is not about the graphics. With ARMA: Cold War Assault, you have all the realism of war with nostalgic graphics. A true first-person shooter classic. I suggest this over any of the Call of Duty games.			"

(my reaction)You run r.etardedly when unequipped a weapon.Can get annoying when You die cause you have to start the whole thing all over again.Overall i enjoyed this when i sticked around a bit longer and learned the ropes.now its time for the scoreI'll say... 8.9/10I also recommend buying it before monday cause its free till then.GRAB A COPY AND ENJOY!

												By far the best graphical experience ever to be had in the history of the world. From the breath taking character animations, which look like posters glued onto a manequin and then roasted over a napalm fire, to the realistic gunplay simulation. Heart racing action packed voice acting and many more facets of this perfect game are waiting to be unlocked. A well thought out interesting plot, which could rival that of even COD, will keep you dreaming for literally centuries of the immaculate life you will have after the purchase of these accumulated files. 10/10 PErfect.

												One of the fathers of all modern Army Simulation games. Operation Flashpoint as it was known before.Where do I begin with this old beast ? It's that kind of game that can entertain you for hours, with its long campaigns (although there are only 2 campaigns here : Cold War Crisis and Resistance. The Russian campaign, Red Hammer, was removed for some reason), its many SP Missions, and the Editor, oh boy, the Editor.Even if you don't like the campaigns, the Editor will entertain you for days. You can build your own missions, with scripts, even build full campaigns, or just place some soldiers and armored, and start a little battle. It's a lot of fun, and with the possibility to add custom units (well, most of the websites dedicated to that are dead now), you can have a lot of variety !The father of military sim, and one of the old gems that the gaming industry has made !

												Call of Duty®: Advanced Warfare, developed by Sledgehammer Games (co-developers of Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® 3), harnesses the first three-year, all next-gen development cycle in franchise history. Call of Duty®: Advanced Warfare envisions a powerful future, where both technology and tactics have evolved to usher in a new era of combat for the franchise. Delivering a stunning performance, Academy Award® winning actor Kevin Spacey stars as Jonathan Irons - one of the most powerful men in the world - shaping this chilling vision of the future of war. All digital purchases of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare include the bonus Digital Edition Personalization Pack with a custom weapon camo, reticle set and playercard. Power Changes Everything.An Advanced WorldCall of Duty: Advanced Warfare takes place in a plausible future in which technological progress and today’s military practices have converged with powerful consequences. In this carefully researched and crafted vision, Private Military Corporations (PMCs) have become the dominant armed forces for countless nations outsourcing their military needs, redrawing borders and rewriting the rules of war. And Jonathan Irons, the founder and president of the world’s largest PMC - Atlas Corporation - is at the center of it all.An Advanced SoldierPowerful exoskeletons evolve every aspect of a soldier’s battle readiness, enabling combatants to deploy with an advanced lethality and eliminating the need for specialization. The introduction of this gameplay mechanic delivers enhanced player movement and verticality through boost jumps and grappling, covert cloaking abilities, and biomechanics that provide unparalleled strength, awareness, endurance, and speed. With the advent of the exoskeleton and newly advanced armor and weaponry, every soldier commands tactical freedom in any terrain unlike ever before, fundamentally changing the way gamers play Call of Duty across all modes.An Advanced ArsenalHarnessing the power of next-gen platforms, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare introduces a new hi-tech, advanced arsenal and ability set, arming players with all-new equipment, technology, perks, and vehicles like hoverbikes and highly specialized drones. Players can also choose between standard ammunition and an all-new class of directed-energy weaponry that enables totally new gameplay dynamics. And with exoskeletons delivering a massive force multiplier and unprecedented tactical freedom, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare evolves every firefight.This game is fun. 10/10			"

Just the third mission tasked me with running so ♥♥♥♥ing far with just me and another guy, and I killed a tank and 2 squads on the way.The only reason I survived was the rocket launcher I looted on a whim.10/10 always take the rocket launchersEDIT: Later on, mission after that, what I first thought was realism turned into the game straight-up breaking. There's a lot of moments that make you go ""Can't tell if realism is currently making them do this, or if the game is being nuts""confirmed by code popping up in the top left talking about how a variable wasn't matchedstill 10/10 though			"

												This title was seminal in producing a large number of modern combined arms/battlefield type games.  Right now, I consider this title utterly dataed, and I would not really recomend it to anyone, but back in the day it was very enjoyable.  Play it for nostalgia reasons.  If you like the concept purchase ARMA III its sequel.  I recall spending countless hours modding for this title and it honstly was one of the best experiences of my life.			"

												The only real game bohemia ever released, Operation Flashpoint was awesome, is awesome, and will be awesome. Unlike some other products bohemia later started to poop out, OPFP was released with full single-player campaign and multiplayer and did not require million user-made mods to give 100 hours worth of gameplay. However, this package ALSO has the excellent resistance expansion pack which adds yet another very good quality campaign of 10-12 hour range and as you can guess, there still exists a ton of user-made awesomeness into this game.

												Its a fun tactical game that was originally released as Operation Flashpoint:Cold War Crisis but due to copyrights  (Codemasters own the Operation Flashpoint name) they renamed it to Arma for this release. Not really a mil sim (atleast not these days) as its not quite that realistic in my eyes. And in terms of single player stuff its way better than Arma 2 and 3. 3 dousn't even have a campaign, just DLC.Regardless you see alot of Bohemia here. Up until Arma 2 they just recycled the same buildings and plants over and over essentially. They used new models and textures but weirdly enough alot of the buildings are basically the same sorta stuff. Thats fine to me. What isn't fine is Bohemias long term inability to optimize their games. Try playing this game on high maxed or on very high settings. You won't be getting a good framerate. The game runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥for as old as it is even on newer hardware. Bohemia didn't do anything to this game besides whitewash the old name out from what I can see.  Bohemia isn't the worst in how they treat their niche fans (tripwire takes that cake) but they sure don't seem to care about giving the customers what they want anymore atleast. Arma 3 was just as unoptimized as 2 and still runs terribly and they didn't even try to optimize this game for modern hardware. Atleats it works and has 1080 resolution which is more than alot of steam games these days.Regardless its a cozy albeit quirky tactical FPS from a bygone era and possibly the best Arma/Bohemia game single player wise.  I remember getting a copy of this game under the OPF name like 6 years ago and playing it in high school. I think it was a GOG copy but I don't remember. I would get that version if I were you. But regardless it ran very well on WinXP Pentium 4 with probably 512mb of ram or maybe a 1gb and intel integrated GPU. Possibly better than it does on my FX 8350, R9 270x, with 8gb of RAM. Time is a ♥♥♥♥♥ so that might be not completely true but this game dousn't really like new hardware. Thanks Bohemia on shafting me once again.Arma TacticsArma 3 Arma:Cold War AssaultHave all been pretty terrible releases with the last being on GOG at some point. Just go find the GOG release as anything GOG is way better than steam anyway. They might be selling it on GOG again but idk. Cold War is the only game really worth playing though. Arma 3 is just a huge dissappointment and seems like alot less community than 2 had plus it still runs like utter garbage for no reason. Bohemia isn't a good developer is what I'm trying to say. They occasionally make something thats pretty okay now and then.			"

												its a Solid Glorius/9000and i know how can it be over nine thousand well arbitrary number is arbitrary  but to be honest this game is great and i still play the game the multiplayer is up and down most of the time down but this game is great and your willing to not play multiplayer because lets be honest its not as active as it used to be but if you like the single player or can rally a few friends to play this game just might be for you			"

												I recommend this game for everyone. In my opinion, I like this game. I first got it for free, I got luck because I had to wait, and it was like 50 minutes till the free access ends. So it finished downloading, I started to play it. I went on Campaign, completed the first mission. Then I was bored, I went to map editor/mission editor, made my own mission, and had fun experimenting with stuff. then I completed the campaign, so I went on with ""Single Mission"". I completed all the missions in Single Mission, even Resistance, and that's all. I highly recommend it to everyone, you'll have fun in no time 360 noscoping losers.			"

												Pros:Extremely large believable world to relive your military fantasies of World War III. ArmA: CWA delivers in breadth and really astounds. There is quite a lot to see and experience in the game that you'd probably be wanting to replay the campaigns long after you've completed them.Mission objectives are varied and usually fun to complete.Campaigns are long and come with interesting movie cutscenes to watch.The AI is quite good (but also unforgiving).You have the ability to toggle between first person and third person views.You essentially get Cold War Crisis and the Resistance expansion updated to run on modern systems.The mission editor continues the life of the game indefinitely.Cons:You character will die very often, so make sure you save. This brings me to the next point...Unfortunately you can only save once for every mission in the campaign.Missions usually take more than 15 minutes to complete. Make sure you have catered time to play them.The missions are scripted to the point that if you deviate from your objectives too much, you may find yourself not able to complete the mission.Vehicle physics is very simplified... don't come away from reading this review expecting realistic vehicular simulations. The base 3D models for humans is unimpressive.There is that irritating shouting of instructions by your squad leader where nothing can be done about it.The game still has the rare crash to desktop problem; make sure you save your missions.It's truly a godsend that Bohemia Interactive has given us Armed Assault: Cold War Assault. This game allows us to re-live some exciting battles from the Cold War Crisis and Resistance campaigns. I will never forget the fun times I had with the game series. I got to storm a beach with a lighthouse in Red Hammer, then there was the time when I had to escape by foot to an extraction point all by myself in Cold War Crisis, and the time when I made the wrong choice and got an innocent resistance soldier captured in Resistance.

												In all honesty I consider this game better than the ""new"" Arma series.This game is Operation Flashpoint, not Arma Cold War Assault. Yes the graphics aren't up to date with todays standards.But nothing will ever beat the feeling of laying still in a bush. As a BMP drives up beside you and shuts off it's engine, awaiting for you to step out to your imminent death.Or when you're under fire and take a shot, it will make you cringe with disgust at how raw the sound is. The sounds in this game are so beyond its time. And I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a computer that's running Windows 95.			"

												This hyper-realistic first-person tactical shooter is one of the best ever, hands down! Yes, it's hard. No, it's not CoD, where you can get shot ten times and come out smiling. You will die a lot in this game. But what do you expect, when it's made by people who build military simulators? The difficulty of this game as compared to other first-person shooters only makes the success of a mission that much sweeter. Or, you could be like me and, after completing the objectives for a mission, go off and annihilate everything that moves on the island. Either way, victory is sweet. There is a great variety of weapons and ""classes"". The mission editor, once you learn how to use it, ensures that all content in the game is at your fingertips. Dogfights between A-10 and SU-25? Done. Tank battles between Shilkas and Vulcans? Easy. The possibilities are limitless! Last but not least, the vehicular warfare is the best I have ever seen in a video game. Nothing beats the thrill of laying down heavy fire on helpless tank/infantry columns in an Mi-24 Hind. 10/10			"

												A game from my childhood, Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis (as it was known back then) is THE ACTUAL FIRST ARMA (the original ARMA: Armed Assault is a spiritual successor to this game), and one of those games where you don't have any handholding. The game has two difficulties, Cadet and Veteran, or, as I like to call them, ♥♥♥♥ You and ♥♥♥♥ You Harder (Which you can tweak. God, old games are awesome). There is even an extra choice to make the AI even harder in the options menu, called Super AI, that you can apply to the other difficulties. I haven't tried it yet (since I'm still gitting gud) but I'm betting it turns the difficulties into You're So ♥♥♥♥ed, and Oh Look, You Just Got One Shot No Scoped By A Pistol From The Other Town 10km Over. Expect Dark Souls of shooters. If you aren't careful, you WILL be shot, and if you are shot, you are either dead, forced to crawl, or were extremely lucky and can take an extra shot. Overall, I really like the game, and the nostalgia factor that it has for me allows me to completely ignore it's visibly aging graphics and mechanics.			"

												ARMA CWA has really showed me what FPS games are about. These are litterally THE BEST GRAPHICS I'VE EVER SEEN!!!!! The story is just amazing, and the detail on the peoples face are just.... WOW. Like I said, it is the best FPS game out there. I would rate it 20/10. A must get! If you don't have this game and are just sitting around playing COD all day your a loser because COC has no match against these graphics and gamplay!			"

												Reason to buy: If you're a big Mil-sim buf who also enjoys Cold-War themed heavy storyline with a lot of cutscenes and a very clear idea of whats happening as it's happening (for the most part) threwout the campaign from many different perspectives (like a movie).This is Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crises & It's Stand-Alone Expansion in the Day; Resisitance. This was the original Arma, and it still holds up for those who just like story-driven Military Simulators. Both campaigns will take you threw some intense moments, not exactly 'exploding' battlefields, but the action can get hot. OFP Was very innovative in its day, I remember playing it ever since it's demo was released. Countless hours of fun, an actual gazzilion addons are still all over the internet for it as well, including entire custom campaigns and maps, vietnam assets are also avialable.Mostly the reason I'd recommend this is for the story driven campaigns at this point, they're still very good and quite cinimatic, the only reason I dislike this edition is because it lacks the 'Red Hammer' Expansion, which was not stand alone and told the story (few?) Russian soldiers as a prequel and tie-in to the original main campaign- It was also a very good expansion, though had a lot of random acts of violance.			"

If this is a preview of what I have to look forward to in PC gaming then I believe Im through, wasted 34bucks, live you learn. Graphics- 1star, Controls- 1/2star, Online multiplayer- Non-existant.

												When an old game like this is still broken (or f***ed up, depends you're mood), it just deserve to be forgotten into the abyss of gaming. Deceived by the devs's work, by the impossibility to end a mission with a cheat code ("" Oh nice, I'm stuck in campaign SOLO mode ! ""). You earned wrong your money, and I canno't do anything to fix it, but pledging that I will never buy your game, and will only play it unlegit, just to say how much you p*** me off at the face...    No Multiplayer working, no solo mod working, just hacking it and dling onto the net seems appropriate before wanting to buy this piece of ****, even for  1 buck ! "

												A leap into futuristic space combat hasn’t breathed a lot of new life into Call of Duty. With a scenic but poorly paced single-player campaign and multiplayer and zombies modes that succeed mostly by sticking close to what Black Ops 3 did last year, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare is a generally fun but inessential shooter.2016 has been one of the best years for single-player shooter campaigns of the past decade. We’ve seen Doom, Titanfall 2, Gears of War 4, Battlefield 1, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided… and they're all better than Infinite Warfare’s campaign. It's not for want of something to differentiate it: this is a Call of Duty game where you fight in zero-G environments, and where you fly a spaceship called a Jackal and have a robot buddy called Ethan who is endearingly written. It should be awesome... but it’s mostly slow and plodding, and by the time the pace picks up there’s not enough game left to wash the disappointment of the first two-thirds out of your mouth			"

Playtime at time of review:45 minutesDate at time of review:6/2/14First mission:Killed all of team unit before first rendezvous (getting out of helicopter), yet still heard characters talking at mission point. (Dead bodies surrounding me - I lol'd)Graphics/Video: [3/10]They are pretty impressive for being from 2001. Today, they are sub-par. But that's to be expected. Voice/Sound: [1/10]It was PROBABLY ok in 2001, but... It's not so great by todays standards, at all. I think this was the most unattractive part of the game for me.Game Mechanics: [5/10]The gameplay was pretty good, I really liked the aiming, and body mechanics (Except you could NOT sprint without a weapon in your hand? Confusing).Overall Score:[3/10]The game was ok, but the sound/voice acting killed it for me, nice game mechanics.Would recommend buying 75%-90% off if you're wanting to play this game.			"

												To put it frankly, this game is far too old and atiquated to enjoy. Being a 2001 game, you'd be surprised by how advanced this game makes Halo: CE seem and feel. As someone who is so used to playing games made within this decade, ARMA: Cold War Assault is a game that's graphics, mechanics, concept, and overall feel do nothing for me. I'm glad I got this game for free, because I would have absolutely regretted paying any amount of money for it. Perhaps if I played this game 13 years ago I could have enjoyed it, but with no sentimental value placed on this title, there is no reason for a gamer like me to play this game.			"

												TL;DR Rating: 1/10I'm being completely honest when I say I couldn't even play this game. Despite the graphics looking like they where created on Windows 95, I decided that I should give this game a whirl since I got it on a free weekend. I launched it today for the first time, and used the fullscreen mode. I was using Steam Big Picture Mode to launch it, and it broke my gaming rig where it tried to draw windows over the screen and wouldn't accept cursor clicks in the game, but instead on my other windows. Thinking I hit a bug, I tried again in Windowed Mode. BIG MISTAKE. I tried this 3 times, as the cursor wouldn't sync, but instead have 1 cursor outside of the window, which sat upon the top left of my screen with no border to move it, and another cursor in game that was flying around like it was on a ton of sugar. I finally got full screen mode to work after numerus tries, and the cursor flew like I have never seen before. It was extreamly hard to get the the mouse sensitivity page like this, and when I finally did and set it lower, the cursor would lock in place constantly, only going on 1 axis (Mostly the x-axis). By this point I had reached my limit trying to play this crap. This isn't something that should be paid for, or even free. Honestly, I am disappointed that something like this would come out of a company such as this one. For anyone wondering, here are my specs just to be clear that it was not me:OS (Operating System): Windows 7 Ultimate EditionRAM (Random Access Memory): 6 GigabytesProcessor: Intel i7Mouse: Razor NagaKeyboard: Logitech EliteIn summery, I would not reccomend this game for anyone, and I think it would be better if it where completely removed from Steam altogether, as it's more trouble then it's worth. 1/10			"

												Crappy game. It runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on a quite decent rig, it skips a whole second of gameplay every 10 seconds or so.. The game is a bloody dinosaur, and even back then , I don't think it took any prizes for anything. But I guess if you're into oldies maybe it could grow on you. On the technical side, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nightmare. It suffers from HORRIBLE mouse accel and the sensitivity itself is a nightmare to set. It has 10 notches. On notch 4 is INSANELY HIGH, on notch 3 it's INSANELY LOW... So be prepared to pull your hairs while trying to get a fix for that... I couldn't even get into it because it has so many technical faults. Bad experience. Do not recommend.			"

												A game I would classify as ""so bad It's good"". This game isn't exactly the most wantable or worthwile thing on steam, but worth it on sale, just for the laughs. It's rather difficult, but I still had fun being bad at it :) And since I got it for free I definitely won't complain. It's fun, but I'm sure that many other games, particularly the new Arma (s) are better. Save your money and get something else.			"

												Nope, I can't do it. Most of the game is unexplained, so it means absolutely nothing, the controls aren't smooth, it's slow-paced, you die after literally one single hit, and the graphics look like they belong on a Commodore 64. All the hype is from these sperglords wearing their rose-tinted glasses.

												To put it frankly, this game is far too old and atiquated to enjoy. Being a 2001 game, you'd be surprised by how advanced this game makes Halo: CE seem and feel. As someone who is so used to playing games made within this decade, ARMA: Cold War Assault is a game that's graphics, mechanics, concept, and overall feel do nothing for me. I'm glad I got this game for free, because I would have absolutely regretted paying any amount of money for it. Perhaps if I played this game 13 years ago I could have enjoyed it, but with no sentimental value placed on this title, there is no reason for a gamer like me to play this game.			"

Yes there are bugs in mission editing firstly throwing gernades is impossible for some reason in this game editor secondly the enemies that are in the same group break and spawn far away.

												After playing Arma 2, OA and 3 I figured that the game that kick started the series must've been at least of decent quality considering the others had massive success. So the game is free for a while and I download, sitting in my chair I slap my scrotum as the download lurks to 99% complete. I boot the game, my hand shakes faster than when I got in a gunfight on a rainy day in new york when i tried to buy a kilo of crack. but the guy set me up so i shot him. but wait some dude ran around the corner and i pistol whipped him. anyway as i was saying it launched i screamed i clicked play... then I cried. this game is one the most try hard games i've ever seen. it is about as realistic as gothom city imposters and thats a stretch considering the graphics are worse than an army man game i played once that was made in like 2001. you could except the vehicles to handle a bit like saints row and ai are about equivalent to that of the ghosts in pacman. please save your how much this game costs for something better like ice cream or hispanic hookers ps they're the cheapest pss might have aids though			"

												I happened to get this for free during Bohemia Interactive's anniversary so I got a little curious to try it out. Basically what I'm going to say is that this will be based on my first impressions on this title and to me being exposed to the ARMA franchise in general. After playing the campaign mode for a few hours, I got bored and had more fun team killing my own AI squad members than actually playing the game simply because of how restrictive I felt performing these missions and add the fact that I was walking around 90% of the time with nothing to shoot at. I'm pretty sure you can run off from your squad and do something else, but even if that was possible, the level still feels barren with very little encounters. Of course, what else am I expecting off of this, it's a modern military shooter so of course the entire point of the game is to do objectives while trying to avoid firefights as much as possible. Story-wise, it's not very interesting with the game being set in during the Cold War with the main objective is, you guessed it, kill the Russians, simple as that. The controls at first feels very awkward, but that can always be fixed by rebinding your keys to something you would feel comfortable playing with. Personally the other modes like multiplayer and custom missions are more fun to play because you obviously have more freedom for you to play around. If I were to come back to this, I would just play around with the custom missions, but thats about it. I simply cannot recommend this game just for my own disliking of modern military shooters, but if you are a hardcore ARMA fan, then go right ahead and buy this. It has everything you would expect from an ARMA game.			"

												This game is a great example of how the future versions of Arma are so successful. By taking the flaws from Arma: Cold War Assault, future games like Arma 2 and Arma 3 improve upon its past mistakes and push out a product that is enjoyable to the players. Would I recommend this? No, but Bohemia Interactive has expanded and provided massive improvements in its other games. For an enjoyable and modern experience, I suggest looking at Arma 2 and Arma 3.Rating: 0.2/10 (2%)No Achievements.Game Done. "

												I got it for free first things first. Not really my cup of tea. The graphics are horid, but it is a really old game. I wouldn't be writing this review if it wasn't for free one time because I never would have bought it. I uninstalled it pretty fast after I saw how boring the game play was. The guns and hit-boxes are just so bad. I cannot recommend this game no matter the price, it's just not worth it.			"

												This game is a great example of how the future versions of Arma are so successful. By taking the flaws from Arma: Cold War Assault, future games like Arma 2 and Arma 3 improve upon its past mistakes and push out a product that is enjoyable to the players. Would I recommend this? No, but Bohemia Interactive has expanded and provided massive improvements in its other games. For an enjoyable and modern experience, I suggest looking at Arma 2 and Arma 3.Rating: 0.2/10 (2%)No Achievements.Game Done. "

												At the time of writing it's free, so you might as well download it and try it. I predict disappointment though. Awkward controls (which includes a menu you scroll through and select actions like ""climb ladder"" or ""reload gun""), bugs and unclear objectives make this a game that hasn't aged well. Unless you're a true fan of the Arma series, go ahead and play something else.			"

												This game is a waste of time, it is very dry, and it took me 45 minutes to get through training... I understand that this is an older game, and that many people (like myself) got this game free on Bohemia's 15th birthday. the battle objectives are slow, and not accurate, i find myself going 6000 meters away just to be assigned to a different target. the controls are pretty crummy too. This game is full of soldiers still doped up from Mothers Day. I would never pay for this game. I recomend DayZ instead, also by Bohemia.			"

												I'm sure the game was fine in 2000, but now, this game is seriously outdated with just a huge lack of features, detail, and a realistic simulation of combat that just makes it feel like other 2000's fps. The best thing about this game was the plot and story, as it's really well done compared to Arma 2, but that can't be made up for flat-out dated gameplay. Don't get, and don't play, unless you're like me who got it on the day it was free.			"

												In the 7 minutes I played this, I wanted to cry, throw up, and spit on the computer screen all at once. First came nausia at the main menu's mouse movement, and I've never had that happen for any game, then came the sorrow, thinking, ""I actually bought this?"" when going into game and getting the ♥♥♥♥ed up movements, then I realized that I got it for free, and then came the sarcastic ""I feel sorry for you,"" sympathetic type thing for the fact that this game was free and still terrible, then came the confusion at the fact that there are so many positive reveiews and the GOTY awards and such, then the anger at the many mixed emotions I was having. I have nothing against the graphics, the terrible story and setup, and even the controls could be useful if there was the option to turn off the mouse-like crosshair like in 007 Goldeneye and Time Splitters 2, but to leave me to deal with that in a huge fire fight? Normally I'd laugh at games like this, but since I know that this game has the makings of a good game, it still sucks and is too outdated to hope for updates. Yeah, I dont regret getting it considering it was free, but I do regret ever hoping ""Hey, this is a good deal for a game in an AWESOME series like ARMA,"" Just promise me you won't use your 5.00$ on this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and get something like Oddworld, K?

												This game is clearly not meant for everyone. I would only recommend it if you enjoy shooters that try so hard to be realistic that they stop being fun. I prefer classic Ghost Recon over this, that game had a lot of realism but it was still enjoyable as it had a very forgiving save system. As far as I can tell this game allows one save per mission and getting shot at once means death, or maybe not as I couldn't really figure out what was going on.			"

												The game looked like it would be anice relaxing game to try. It looked like a layed back game and occasional shooter kind of game. But when I wasted money on this game I only found out that its gameplay was despicable and the movement of the screen was extremely inaccurate for a FPS.			"

												Arma Cold War is a solid game and a respected predecessor to the newer Arma titles, yet this game really shows its age. The graphics are very polygon-heavy, the levels are often too open and undetailed, the difficulty is too easy, and the simplicity of the gameplay strips the meat off the metaphorical bones (You only have a M16 for most of the campaign and you can't drive any vehicles unless it's required for the mission at hand) But I digress...I personally rate Arma Cold War a B- . It's not a bad game, especially for one that Bohemia gave us for free during the 15th Anniversary Sale, but comparred to it's successors it feels like one big demo. For a true-blue military simulator experience, buy Arma 2 instead, and if your system is REALLY beefed up, punch it up a notch with Arma 3. "

												The game doesnt even work propperly, i am unable to set terrain to very high as it crashes the game yet my pc can clearly handle it. The mouse is subject to alot of acceleration and locks to the vertical and horizontal axis. I am also unable to launch the advanced options and must manualy go into the game directory and launch the .exe to do so.annother issue is that many menu options actually lag and put strain on the performance as they are changed (of corse the high they are set the more lag so you have to do so gradually). In game the assets are slow to load and unload when the player has their back turned to them, this causes your performance to drop when turning around as it needs to reload every last asset and unload what was previously infront. This game also lacks any sort of tutorial which normally, would not be a problem is the mouse intergation on the menus wasn't so bad.I stongly suggest never touching this even though at the current moment of writing this it is free, it would be a massive waste of data.

												Call of Duty is a 2003 first-person shooter video game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision. It is the first of many installments in the Call of Duty franchise. The game simulates infantry and combined arms warfare of World War II using a modified version of the id Tech 3 engine built for Quake III: Team Arena. Much of its theme and gameplay is similar to the Medal of Honor series; however, Call of Duty showcases multiple viewpoints staged in the British, American, and Soviet theaters of World War II.The game introduced a new take on AI-controlled allies who support the player during missions and react to situational changes during gameplay. This led to a greater emphasis on squad-based play as opposed to the ""lone wolf"" approach often portrayed in earlier first-person shooter games. Much of Infinity Ward's development team consisted of members who helped develop Medal of Honor: Allied Assault.In September 2004, an expansion pack called Call of Duty: United Offensive, which was produced by Activision and developed by Gray Matter Interactive and Pi Studios, was released. On November 10, 2009, the ""Hardened"" and ""Prestige"" editions of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 debuted, including redemption codes for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions under the title, Call of Duty Classic.

												Pure crap.  The 1980s called and want their graphics back.  I'm running a 4.0 ghz processor with a Nvidia 745 GeForce card, and Arma3 and DayZ SA look awesome...this POS made PacMan look good.  I won't even mention how oversensitive the mouse settings are -- even turned all the way down, aiming was next-to-impossible.  Add to the the fact that it couldn't detect my ACTUAL monitor settings, and screwed up the resolution so that I had to re-install the damn monitor, and even at the price I paid (free) it was WAY too much -- they shoulda paid me for my time.  I uninstalled that crap and am not gonna look back...only question I have is, why the hell would Bohemia put the ""Arma"" name on it?  It just makes that brand look bad...			"

												My first venture into the ""Arma"" series and not looking good unfortunately, I applaud the game for being so vast for it's publish date but it seems as if they tried to do WAY too much with it for technical limitations. We all love intricate games that let you control various things, but it is more time spent looking for the right button and trying to figure out how to perform the simplest of tasks that are compounded by going through 4 different mini-menus on the screen.  I really don't care about graphics, but the game plays smooth, I will give it that.As for the single player, I'm stuck following a yellow square for the objective, but it feels as if the game drags me around on a leash instead of the clear plan they present at the beginning of the mission. For one that is go south, then go north-west... it turns into go south, then make 50 course-corrections only to be told to turn around and follow the leader and wherever he decides to turn while still fumbling at controls to tell each person what direction to properly stand it seems.I really was hoping for a great experience as I hear so much hype about Arma, but this just seems like a game where they tried to cram too many interaction controls into too many menus, for concept I give it an 8/10.... but overall layout and execution sorry but it's dropped way down to a 2/10.

												Played the first few missions of the campain..Most of the time you are walking around waiting for the other squad members to catch up. The AI movement is not very good.I could no longer play the campaign, as when you board the M113 it doesn't move. The game crashed shortly after.I guess it just doesn't work well on Windows 10. The framerate was choppy unless I turned down the visibility to mininum.			"

												Should have posted after I finished the game. Instead of doing a review in progress.Early stage of the game, lots of pointless moving from point A to B. Can't tell friend from foe and can't see where the enemy is, especially near night time, but somehow your AI can tell where they are and their AI can tell where you are. Daytime, I actually seeing and killing the enemy, but my squad is still able to kill them before I see them or they get themselves wipeout and I just run to an objective point. To elaborate why I consider how the missions are setup to be a waste of time. One mission defend installation. Could be a glitch but only one enemy showed up. Waste of time. Some mission in one form or another. Go from point A to point B. Die at point B. Waste time moving to point B again. Die. Repeat a few times before decide to use up my only save slightly before point B. Skirmish from point B to C. Waste time moving to point D. Seems like people equate repeating the same tedious moventment as the price of failure somehow makes this a good game. Half way through the campaign you get to choose your gear and control your squad. If I had the sniper rifle at the beginning of the game, i'm pretty sure i could of Ramboed my way across the map. Really the AI isn't that good, the only thing is you have to kill them before they notice your presence since they are very accurate once they know you're there. Otherwise they are very clueless. Either I could be prone in plain sight about 50m away and they don't react or I kill a bunch of their comrades but they don't seem to notice. Really only 2 or 3 missions were hard fun. A good chunk were just tedious. Since some of the positive reviews haven't put much game time in recently, I'm thinking nostalgia is factoring into their opinion, though I can see why it was GOTY in 2001. Of course, the graphics sucks but it's a 2001 game not a 2011 game. Wish steam would put when the game was originally released not digitally released. Playing on a xp computer game works fine.			"

												Got this game for free, still disappointed even though I certainly do like old classic games.I like tactical shooters, but ARMA: CWA has bad performance on my modern PC - it lags. Plus it looks bad and it feels bad.Developers tried to make ""cool"" cut scenes on the game engine that can't handle such stuff (it's good for open areas, but not for cut scenes).Weapon animations... do they even exist? Weapons look worse than in Half-Life or Battlefield 1942.All the animations in the game are too bad for beginning of 2000th.There are some cool elements in the game though, but you better skip this game and get ArmA 2 or 3 which do have all of the neat stuff.

												Arma: Cold War Assault was probably a great game for its time. That being said, it completely sucks now. It has way too many commands that are never clearly explained. It is brutally difficult. It is slow paced and anticlimactic. Worst of all, you have to wait like 25 minutes just to join a multiplayer game. I highly recommend that you don't waste your time on this disappointing, slow paced wreck with clunky gameplay.			"

												Operation Flashpoint (I'm not calling it ArmA, it's Operation Flashpoint) is one of the best military games ever and this one, the very first one, is my personal favorite because it has the best campaign and atmosphere (nothing can beat the Cold War)However, all of that excitement and excellent gameplay goes out the window the minute you start the missions, because 80% of the time the scripts controlling the missions DO NOT WORK CORRECTLYExample: I failed the tutorial just because I completed it too fast2nd example: I spent at least 1 hour on a Rescue mission that takes 5 minutes tops, because the Friendly AI would not move faster even though I clearly secured the village, and they would NOT ♥♥♥♥ING DRIVE THE TRUCK BECAUSE THE COMMANDER KEPT TELLING TWO SOLDIERS TO DISEMBARK EVEN THOUGH THEY SHOULD BE IN THE VEHICLE AND BY THE TIME THEY DID GET OUT AND GOT BACK IN, A ♥♥♥♥ING TANK COMES IN AND KILLS US ALLI'm sorry, this franchise is fun and I love it but I can never enjoy it most of the time due to the broken mission scripts that plague every single game (OFP, ArmA: Armed Assault, ArmA2 + OA) and if ArmA3 continues this game breaking issue, it will be a huge disappointment			"

												If there was a Dark Souls for military shooter sims, you're looking at the comment review section for it. Her unforgivable shooting mechanics, brutally low player hp and sneaky AI makes for a frustrating playthrough. It's just that with the low price of Arma 2, and the success of Arma 3 you'll realize that the game is not in its best form here. Multiplayer is non-existent, graphics are putrid, and the weapon diversity or action options can get pretty stale. If you're desperately looking for a free game title, this might be worth the pain and agony. Do not pay for this. Battlefield 2 would be a better cure for your old school FPS nostalgia.			"

												Screw it, I'm going to be completely honest here.An unwanted gift from a very, very annoying person. ARMA is a right bloody mess with unflattering graphics, batcrap difficulty and clustered controls. Even considering it's release date it's not pleasant to look at and I'd rather crazy glue my nose to my monitor while I play a poorly emulated copy of Star Fox 64 to make my eyes bleed out of their sockets and cause my brain to melt from the inevitable seizures. Do not buy this game, ever. Let it be written in the scrolls of the future post-apocalyptic society that ARMA is to be avoided.			"

I am reviewing this game to modern standards. While not exactly fair to the game, I am showing why I find it a bad purchase.This game is amazing considering it was made in 2001, but it certainly does NOT hold up to modern day standards (which is no suprise). It is clunky, has fairly bad controls (but can be rebinded), and on top of that the graphics are flat out ugly.However what I do love about it is that there is so much variety compaired to ARMA 3. But sadly this does not make up for the clunky, outdated gameplay.Purchase if your looking for a ""novelty"" or nostalgic type of game, but I can't say you should buy it if your looking to actually play the game. If you are purchasing a realisitc/ARMA game, I'd suggest the upgraded (but still buggy) ARMA 3, or the cheaper alternative (but with more content), ARMA 2. A2 has a lot of quality DLCs too, would be a good deal to get it on sale with all the DLC.But do know that the review of the reviews are very biased on this game, and I'm not saying that because I'm getting bad reviews. If you look at the all time negative reviews you will see all are majorly downvoted.			"

												According to all known lawsof aviation, there is no way a beeshould be able to fly. Its wings are too small to getits fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't carewhat humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow!Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry?- Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening?- I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your fatherpaid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate.We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz.- Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.- Bye! Barry, I told you,stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam.- Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel?- A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school,three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I tooka day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry.- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie?- Yeah. - You going to the funeral?- No, I'm not going. Everybody knows,sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel.Such a hothead. I guess he could havejust gotten out of the way. I love this incorporatingan amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp...under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men.- We are! - Bee-men.- Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oitygraduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your careerat Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennasinside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like?- A little scary. Welcome to Honex,a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee,have worked your whole life to get to the point where youcan work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant PollenJocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected,scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctivegolden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot.- She's my cousin! - She is?- Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right.- At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspectof bee existence. These bees are stress-testinga new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes?- Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement,the Krelman. - What does that do?- Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs aresmall ones. But bees know that every small job,if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the jobyou pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life?I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees,as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?""How can you say that? One job forever?That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only haveto make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could theynever have told us that? Why would you question anything?We're bees. We're the most perfectlyfunctioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe thingswork a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you knowwhat I'm talking about. Please clear the gate.Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!- Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's likeoutside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks!- Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters!You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were.- I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knowswhere, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a PollenJock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollenthan you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol.Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing itand the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies?Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys.- Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerousbeing a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned meagainst a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat,and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my!- I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today,wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patchsix miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh?- Barry! A puddle jump for us,but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am.- You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy?Are you bee enough? I might be. It all dependson what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices.- But you only get one. Do you ever get boreddoing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you justmove it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm.It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad,the more I think about it, maybe the honey fieldjust isn't right for me. You were thinking of what,making balloon animals? That's a bad jobfor a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not surehe wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes.- I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're goinginto honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer?- No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now.I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Geta gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today!- Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobswill be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available?- Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations!Step to the side. - What'd you get?- Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first?- No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open,not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman?- Sure, you're on. "

												Don't let the somewhat quirky graphics fool you. This game is a masterpiece. Released over a decade ago and yet still in my opinion, the greatest game ever made. I can't tell you how many thousands upon thousands of hours I spent in the editor making my own missions and battles. Your heart will actually beat faster when sneaking up on a base full of ""reds"" in the aim of blowing up their parked tanks. You will have to take your time and be tactical in your decision making. This is no ""run and gun"" arcade shooter. This is ""I have to position my AT soldier on that hill, so he can hit that tank in hope of disabling it whilst we open fire at exactly the right time on the sentries patrolling the surrounding cluster of houses. If we don't kill them all in time they will spot and maybe take out our injured and exposed fire team who has painstakingly crept into position just behind that grouping of bushes"". It is an amazing experience and still market it to friends as superior to any of the unfinished pre-alpha crap that game makers release today.			"

												I mostly enjoyed my time with the game. For it's age the gameplay is really solid and the realistic nature makes it one of the most immersive war games I have played. There are two points that made me stop playing (for now) however;1: I'm pretty rubbish at games like this and the realism really is brutal.2: I found it insanely difficult to pick out enemy soldiers.For a better player than me, the campaign will probably be one of the best you play in a game like this, and the gameplay will be really rewarding.

I've played this game when it came out originaly called Operation Flashpoint, and this game still kicks♥♥♥♥♥ AI is pretty much skilled and they kill very easily, one shot = one kill...- 2 Campaigns with awesome story (Resistance and American), but too bad there's not russian campaign called Red Hammer, which was also quiet amazing.- USA campaign tells the story of an Soldier, Tank crew, Pilot and Special Op guy, through 30 missions you will basicaly learn everything, from how to shoot and and survive to driving tank, airplane, choppers, etc.- Resistance campaign is also very amazing, because you need to get as many stuff (weapons, NV Goggles, ammo) as you can and take care of your people, because it transfers from one mission to another...- You can drive almost every vehicle in this game, from planes to motorcycles,- lead your own team of people, and order them what to do and where to go- Awesome mission editor where you can make your own missions and campaigns.It's really worth of the money, really cheap for a really good game			"

												Even tough Arma is an old  game you can have a lot of fun with it. The only disadvantage is that you can't play multiplayer as their is no server to join, + the aditional bugs like AI's get stuck in trees and things like those. I would give a 6/10 , it's fun playing if you have it for nothing.			"

												the oldest but still one of the best Arma games out there. Lets just say if your comp isn't able to run Arma 3 your not going to miss much playing this beauty. really the only big changes to Arma over the years is the graphics and physics the gameplay is almost the same, the editor hasn't really changed over the years, and if you downgrade to 1.96 the online community is still alive and kicking. in short if you don't have a comp that can play arma 3 or just can't see yourself dishing out the cash for it Arma: Cold War Assault is your best bet.

												This, to me, is the Best Game Ever Made.A big statement, I know. And not too meaningful, if you take into account the multitude of tastes and preferences people have in gaming. But bear with me while I explain why I allowed myself to indulge in making such a hyperbole.My reasons for thinking of this game as the pinnacle of game design are largely very subjective. For one, I am an Eastern-European and grew up in a Slavic country in the times of the Soviet era. So to me, the setting, the distinct scenery, the nature, the towns and the cars all have a meaning, they capture scenes of my childhood… A boring reason for most of you I’m sure but bear with me for just a moment longer.The 80s are also my favourite era in military technology. This, for me, was a time when weapons and equipment were modern enough to have the relevance and wow factor, but were not too overly reliant on electronics and computers.These are not the most important reasons why I like this game so much. The most important by far is the sandbox nature of it. It is not the first sandbox game ever made, but unlike others before it captured perfectly what a sandbox should be. You have a vast island (more than one, in fact), replete with varied but believable scenery. That gives you freedom to move around, explore. You have weapons, vehicles, and equipment, and an AI that can use it well. And you have a powerful mission editor. The game designers used the very mission editor that comes with the game. I designed a few missions myself, and the editor is a pleasure to use.The missions and campaigns that come with the game are varied and challenging. There is a good story interlaced with cinematic cut scenes. I love especially playing the missions without my position marked on the map. It is immensely satisfying to do a bit of orienteering while navigating using landmarks and the compass.The weapons are varied and have a good feel to them. I like the (mostly) realistic way you need to limit how much you carry. The vehicles are great, cars drive well, tank guns are very satisfying to use, helicopters are easy to fly. There is certainly a wide scope of things to do.Of course the game is not perfect. First and foremost, the game is old. Not aging, not getting a little long in the tooth – it is properly old. It was, in my opinion, revolutionary when it was first released, but now the concepts are not as novel and the graphics are aged. There are also some problems inherent in most sandbox games – AI, while great, is not perfect and sometimes acts foolishly, or worse yet, super-smart beyond the human level. The maps have to have some sort of a border so the designers made them into islands  in sea, although Chechoslovakia was a land locked country, so a little supension of belief is necessary.  Some minor gripes, such as the useless night vision goggles and unpredictability of the saving feature (you only have one save per mission you can do, but the mission will save it from time to time- you just never know when) will occasionally make you grind your teeth a little. But I have never come across a game that did not have faults. And trust me, these are but little foibles that do not destroy the immersion.Bohemia Interactive tried again and again to improve on their initial “masterpiece”. Curiously, though, they failed. Each successive sequel to the series introduced new features that detracted from the experience and took away something instead of building on the original game’s strengths. The graphics got better but playability and immersion suffered. I would love to enjoy the other ARMA games (I own them all) as much as I did the original Operation Flashpoint, but it doesn’t even come close.Let me end my rant with the disclaimer that my opinions are just that, opinions, so I don’t expect anyone to agree. But if you are thinking- Should I try this or not? – maybe knowing that someone thinks of this as The Best Game Ever Made might persuade you to try it and who know, maybe you will get some proper enjoyment out of this old gem.Now excuse me while I fire up the game and go on a sniping mission deep behind enemy lines… "

												This, to me, is the Best Game Ever Made.A big statement, I know. And not too meaningful, if you take into account the multitude of tastes and preferences people have in gaming. But bear with me while I explain why I allowed myself to indulge in making such a hyperbole.My reasons for thinking of this game as the pinnacle of game design are largely very subjective. For one, I am an Eastern-European and grew up in a Slavic country in the times of the Soviet era. So to me, the setting, the distinct scenery, the nature, the towns and the cars all have a meaning, they capture scenes of my childhood… A boring reason for most of you I’m sure but bear with me for just a moment longer.The 80s are also my favourite era in military technology. This, for me, was a time when weapons and equipment were modern enough to have the relevance and wow factor, but were not too overly reliant on electronics and computers.These are not the most important reasons why I like this game so much. The most important by far is the sandbox nature of it. It is not the first sandbox game ever made, but unlike others before it captured perfectly what a sandbox should be. You have a vast island (more than one, in fact), replete with varied but believable scenery. That gives you freedom to move around, explore. You have weapons, vehicles, and equipment, and an AI that can use it well. And you have a powerful mission editor. The game designers used the very mission editor that comes with the game. I designed a few missions myself, and the editor is a pleasure to use.The missions and campaigns that come with the game are varied and challenging. There is a good story interlaced with cinematic cut scenes. I love especially playing the missions without my position marked on the map. It is immensely satisfying to do a bit of orienteering while navigating using landmarks and the compass.The weapons are varied and have a good feel to them. I like the (mostly) realistic way you need to limit how much you carry. The vehicles are great, cars drive well, tank guns are very satisfying to use, helicopters are easy to fly. There is certainly a wide scope of things to do.Of course the game is not perfect. First and foremost, the game is old. Not aging, not getting a little long in the tooth – it is properly old. It was, in my opinion, revolutionary when it was first released, but now the concepts are not as novel and the graphics are aged. There are also some problems inherent in most sandbox games – AI, while great, is not perfect and sometimes acts foolishly, or worse yet, super-smart beyond the human level. The maps have to have some sort of a border so the designers made them into islands  in sea, although Chechoslovakia was a land locked country, so a little supension of belief is necessary.  Some minor gripes, such as the useless night vision goggles and unpredictability of the saving feature (you only have one save per mission you can do, but the mission will save it from time to time- you just never know when) will occasionally make you grind your teeth a little. But I have never come across a game that did not have faults. And trust me, these are but little foibles that do not destroy the immersion.Bohemia Interactive tried again and again to improve on their initial “masterpiece”. Curiously, though, they failed. Each successive sequel to the series introduced new features that detracted from the experience and took away something instead of building on the original game’s strengths. The graphics got better but playability and immersion suffered. I would love to enjoy the other ARMA games (I own them all) as much as I did the original Operation Flashpoint, but it doesn’t even come close.Let me end my rant with the disclaimer that my opinions are just that, opinions, so I don’t expect anyone to agree. But if you are thinking- Should I try this or not? – maybe knowing that someone thinks of this as The Best Game Ever Made might persuade you to try it and who know, maybe you will get some proper enjoyment out of this old gem.Now excuse me while I fire up the game and go on a sniping mission deep behind enemy lines… "

												I could not recommend this game to yonger players as they wont be able to get pass the graphics.  Game was Gold back when it came out and while not the first game to offer aiming down the sights, it was one of the first well known games to have such.  When i first played the demo back in the early 2000 time frame, concluding a mission with a Blackhawk that flew to you and landed in real time, climbing on board and watching the landscape slip away below you = Mind Blown!   The only game that could touch it was the original Ghost Recon which i also loved very much, but OFP had no invisible walls and drivable vehicles that allowed for freedom of movement that had'nt really been done before in a FPS.  Games such as Far Cry, Crysis, Call of Duty, Halo, and many more owe this game homage in some aspect.  Its too bad Ghost Recon went in the reverse direction and became more linear.With so many Addons and missions it was easy to waste away weeks worth of hours away.			"

												Despite the early-2000s graphics, this game is an excellent purchase.  As the game that started it all, it can be expected to deliver much enjoyment and many hours of fun.  By today's standards, the game is poor in quality, but the visual and audible shortcomings are but an insect in the path of the oncoming tank that is the gameplay experience itself.  Nothing feels more satisfying than mowing down Russians in a stolen MI-24 HIND that is still sitting on the tarmac, or crawling for miles to search for a medic to heal my broken leg, only to discover that the medic was killed in a firefight with a Russian patrol (which, by the way, is hunting for YOU now).  It is not hard to see why this game not only sparked the fire, but also fanned the flame to build the community and following that the whole ArmA series has now.			"

												The thing that really blew me away about Operation Flashpoint was the deadly realism. The game came out when Quake was popular and other makers of shooters tried to copy its manic play style. But, Operation Flashpoint was different. If you run down the main road of a town, you will get shot and you will die. I swear, I spent half the game crawling on my belly, since I knew peeking my head up over the grass could mean instant death. Playing the game again, I was impressed by how it was still fun the play. Sure, the graphics are dated, but it didn't matter after a while. Modern Warfare immerses you in the setting with beautiful graphics, but breaks the illusion with magical ""healing behind cover"". Cold War Assault doesn't catch you at first, but the stunning realism makes you feel more like you're actually there than pretty graphics. Modern Warfare fans will have to adjust to a more realistic way of playing...and I think you'll like it.			"

												I Enjoyed Operation Flash Point a great deal, and so did my Grand Sons. It was a great game and ARMA made it better as far as I can tell. All of the MODs and Add on s make it great.  The Editor allows you to make a situation. The AI is very good, in fact better then/ harder then fighting a real opponent.  The Universe is Huge, and changes with the other islands, and add on maps. The only issue is the Faces are blocky and Cylinder shaped, (then again who spends all that much time looking at the faces). Just walking, driving, or flying around the map is fun also. The ""Solo"" missions are almost impossible, They could have been much better, but don't get wrapped up in those. It also comes with cheats, so let that work for you.			"

												I played a lot of this when it was called Operation Flashpoint. The AI is particularly impressive. Once, my roomate at the time designed a scenario where a small American force had to destroy an enemy self propelled AA gun. Once it was destroyed, additional troops could come in by air. Then, after every Russian in the area was dead, we'd have ten minutes to prepare for a Russian counterattack.Well, the counterattack would never fire. So, we watched a replay. A Russian officer and some conscripts, fearing for their digital lives, took a civilian car and drove out of town. We did nothing to code this. They just wanted to get the hell out of there. Other replays showed similar behavior. Troops would flee into the wilderness.So, the triggers had to be revised so that we'd only have to drive all enemy forces from the town to trigger the counterattack. Even then, when we loaded up an destroyed almost all of the attackers, one infantry was still alive huddled in the wreckage of a T-80. The single player is great. There is a level where you have to try to get to an evac point asap. There were a lot of Russians looking for you, so I found myself compelled to take the long route through thick woods. Laying prone and waiting for a nearby squad of Russians to pass (while hoping they didn't see me) was one of the most intense moments I ever experienced in gaming.			"

The graphics got better but playability and immersion suffered. I would love to enjoy the other ARMA games (I own them all) as much as I did the original Operation Flashpoint, but it doesn’t even come close.Let me end my rant with the disclaimer that my opinions are just that, opinions, so I don’t expect anyone to agree. But if you are thinking- Should I try this or not? – maybe knowing that someone thinks of this as The Best Game Ever Made might persuade you to try it and who know, maybe you will get some proper enjoyment out of this old gem.Now excuse me while I fire up the game and go on a sniping mission deep behind enemy lines… "

												Had not played this for years. Graph were never this games' strong point, but the gameplay and the almost too real war experience is awsome.  It was released in 2001. Back then, Gamespy was the master game server for online games, now you need to get OFPmonitor from github (free). That said, there is still a lively community of players and modders, and after 14 years, that is strong testament to the gameplay's immersiveness.I'm still loving this game, and recommend it to anyone who cares more about gameplay than graphics.

												Don't let the somewhat quirky graphics fool you. This game is a masterpiece. Released over a decade ago and yet still in my opinion, the greatest game ever made. I can't tell you how many thousands upon thousands of hours I spent in the editor making my own missions and battles. Your heart will actually beat faster when sneaking up on a base full of ""reds"" in the aim of blowing up their parked tanks. You will have to take your time and be tactical in your decision making. This is no ""run and gun"" arcade shooter. This is ""I have to position my AT soldier on that hill, so he can hit that tank in hope of disabling it whilst we open fire at exactly the right time on the sentries patrolling the surrounding cluster of houses. If we don't kill them all in time they will spot and maybe take out our injured and exposed fire team who has painstakingly crept into position just behind that grouping of bushes"". It is an amazing experience and still market it to friends as superior to any of the unfinished pre-alpha crap that game makers release today.			"

The mission editor is also SO FUN to mess with and create random scenarios if you are into creating missions. But if your not into the creator, you can play the random Single missions, or you can play the Campaign! But there is also a multiplayer that is not too heavy with people, but maybe you can play with friends in the MP, LAN or on a Random server.			"

												I Enjoyed Operation Flash Point a great deal, and so did my Grand Sons. It was a great game and ARMA made it better as far as I can tell. All of the MODs and Add on s make it great.  The Editor allows you to make a situation. The AI is very good, in fact better then/ harder then fighting a real opponent.  The Universe is Huge, and changes with the other islands, and add on maps. The only issue is the Faces are blocky and Cylinder shaped, (then again who spends all that much time looking at the faces). Just walking, driving, or flying around the map is fun also. The ""Solo"" missions are almost impossible, They could have been much better, but don't get wrapped up in those. It also comes with cheats, so let that work for you.			"

												I played a lot of this when it was called Operation Flashpoint. The AI is particularly impressive. Once, my roomate at the time designed a scenario where a small American force had to destroy an enemy self propelled AA gun. Once it was destroyed, additional troops could come in by air. Then, after every Russian in the area was dead, we'd have ten minutes to prepare for a Russian counterattack.Well, the counterattack would never fire. So, we watched a replay. A Russian officer and some conscripts, fearing for their digital lives, took a civilian car and drove out of town. We did nothing to code this. They just wanted to get the hell out of there. Other replays showed similar behavior. Troops would flee into the wilderness.So, the triggers had to be revised so that we'd only have to drive all enemy forces from the town to trigger the counterattack. Even then, when we loaded up an destroyed almost all of the attackers, one infantry was still alive huddled in the wreckage of a T-80. The single player is great. There is a level where you have to try to get to an evac point asap. There were a lot of Russians looking for you, so I found myself compelled to take the long route through thick woods. Laying prone and waiting for a nearby squad of Russians to pass (while hoping they didn't see me) was one of the most intense moments I ever experienced in gaming.			"

												ArmA Cold War Assault is the rerelease of the original Operation Flashpoint Cold War Crisis. As such, it's not going to have the amazing graphics of ArmA 2, and the interface isn't as complex, but that doesn't necessarily mean you shouldn't buy it. With this game, you get a great campaign, and the editor is just as fun as ever, this time featuring a lot more land areas than ArmA 2. I always reccomend this game to people who want to get into ArmA, because it's cheap and it's pretty much the same type of experience. For this price, this game is more than worth picking up. Arma Cold War Assault is among my favorite milisims.			"

												OK LISTEN UP YOU MAGGOTS!!!! <---- Imitation of a drill sergeantThe release date here on steam does indeed say August 8, 2011 BUT, and its a big but,  it was NOT first released in 2011.The game was first released to the public in 2006.  This game is a remade Operation Flashpoint Cold War Crisis (2001), updated graphics engine, scripting abilities, physics, new units and vehicles, but Bohemia broke ties with Codemasters before 2006 and since Codemasters has legal rights to the name Operation Flashpoint Bohemia Interactive had to choose another.From having played Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising, Codemaster developed and published, it was much more acadey then the previous OFP game and I assume Codemasters wanted a faster pace and easier game to publish to appeal to a wider audience and hence make more money.  Nothing really wrong with that but i do prefer Bohemia Interactives vision more even though I die, ALOT, usually (At times it seems it's a toss up between Dark Souls Prepare to Die edition and Arma series how often I end up dieing(ok trying to be funny as I am not really THAT bad of a player).  The successes make it worthwhile.  Oh some of the mods for the different ArmA make it extremely fun, easier or more difficult if that is your thing.			"

I got it here for free on Steam during an event.There's a heavy emphasis on tactics and precision. As far as I can tell, most of the problems evident in this game have been ironed out in the sequels, but this is still worth a try, at least on discount, to give people a better idea of what military shooter simulations used to be.

												The thing that really blew me away about Operation Flashpoint was the deadly realism. The game came out when Quake was popular and other makers of shooters tried to copy its manic play style. But, Operation Flashpoint was different. If you run down the main road of a town, you will get shot and you will die. I swear, I spent half the game crawling on my belly, since I knew peeking my head up over the grass could mean instant death. Playing the game again, I was impressed by how it was still fun the play. Sure, the graphics are dated, but it didn't matter after a while. Modern Warfare immerses you in the setting with beautiful graphics, but breaks the illusion with magical ""healing behind cover"". Cold War Assault doesn't catch you at first, but the stunning realism makes you feel more like you're actually there than pretty graphics. Modern Warfare fans will have to adjust to a more realistic way of playing...and I think you'll like it.			"

												Arma: Cold War Assault (Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis) is my most favorite game of all time for a reason.  This is Bohemia Interactive's brilliant 2001 classic that started it all and set the bar for open world military simulators.  No, this game doesn't look that pretty (although i'd argue the visuals were fairly good for their time), yes, it has clunky controls and movement mechanics, but oh man... once you really bite into the game and realize the openworld simulator potential.... holy crap this game still blows my mind 14 years later.  No two playthroughs are ever the same, and in my opinion this one has the most robust and fleshed out single player campaigns out of any of the armas.  It's definitely got a bit of a learning curve if you're not familiar with any of the ARMA games, and it's very difficult and unforgiving (I honestly recommend cadet difficulty if you're playing this for the first time, as this allows you more saves and HUD indicators/map icons that can be confusing for a first timer without).  I'm currently playing through the campaign of this to get me pumped up for ARMA 3, as I plan on getting that soon. God I love this game in all its realistic glory!			"

To tell the truth the audio in this game is the WORST I have ever seen in a video game.2. Camera can use a hude update.3. No one plays multiplayer :(NOW FOR THE GOOD1. It can run very well on MOST BAD PC's on mid to high settings at about at least 30 FPS2. It's a hell of a lot of fun and with the mission editor it makes it a ton of fun3. A wide amount of vehicles and equipment.4. A lot moreAll in all you should get this game for people who have bad PC's (like me untill I get my gaming PC) but want to play a game just like ARMA 2.

Then you spent about 3 hours running for your life.And eventually you might get to see some combat, but by that time you really dont want too.A true simulation and a nigh on perfect game.Long live Flashpoint.(Ps the last mission takes 5 hours and you just drive everyone to the pub)			"

												Okay so I was doing this sniper mission where I had to shoot an officer or something in this convoy. So when I saw him I took the shot and I got him!!! But then (as in real life) all the enemies knew exactly where I was and they started shooting. So my guy was running to the extraction point and the tank (which was like on the horizon) fired and killed me. So real. So lifelike. I wondered why I forgot about this game. And I pondered for a very long time how precise the Russian tank was. But then I realized Soviet Bear was probably piloting the tank. And Soviet Bear hates the West with extreme prejudice. So I finally figured out how I died lol.10/10 (with such realism and graphics you cant put it down)			"

												OPERATION FLASHPOINT.The game that was the most realistic military combat simulator, ""back in the day"".Played it from a DEMO disc running on my first computer and I fell in love.Beware, your squadmates are your best friend and radio chatter your conscience.Nothing goes as expected and there are multiple ways a mission can play out.Be cautious as you tread behind enemy lines and ruthless when on a full out assault.

												This game is amazing. There are many problems but all in all it's so worth it. The engine and controls are clunky, the graphics are attrocious (understandably) but it doesn't matter because once you get into it it's so immersive.So to keep this from dragging on, the gameplay is awesome, it's realistic (as far as a game of this age can go) so one too many shots and you're dead. If you get into an engagment and take hits it's pretty much over, you really need to be the one with the better position or be the one who fires first. This makes tactics extremely important for example positioning yourself, knowing when the move when to stay put, when to fire and when to hold. It could all mean the difference between them getting a few shots off and that'll spell you're end.And the missions are extremely varied, the story is naf but the missions range from 1-3 men late at night blowing up an entire base (stealth and tactical). Mass infantry+armor operations to attack towns and villages. Helicopter transport/attack etc missions. Tank crew missions (which are awesome fun but take time to get good at) and even more than this. It's seriously awesome. So i would no doubt recommend this game, it's incredible and I still have fun playing it this long after it was made. The one draw back i should point out is the checkpoint system as you can only save once per mission which means you take 10 minutes longer to do anything which some poeple (including myself) like. However if you dispise this feature and wish to be a little more reckless i will give you this hint/cheat for reading all the way to the end. Go onto the pause menu at any point in a mission and click ""shift"" and ""-"" at the same time then type ""savegame"". You're welcome. :)			"

												I could not recommend this game to yonger players as they wont be able to get pass the graphics.  Game was Gold back when it came out and while not the first game to offer aiming down the sights, it was one of the first well known games to have such.  When i first played the demo back in the early 2000 time frame, concluding a mission with a Blackhawk that flew to you and landed in real time, climbing on board and watching the landscape slip away below you = Mind Blown!   The only game that could touch it was the original Ghost Recon which i also loved very much, but OFP had no invisible walls and drivable vehicles that allowed for freedom of movement that had'nt really been done before in a FPS.  Games such as Far Cry, Crysis, Call of Duty, Halo, and many more owe this game homage in some aspect.  Its too bad Ghost Recon went in the reverse direction and became more linear.With so many Addons and missions it was easy to waste away weeks worth of hours away.			"

												i remember playng this when i was 7 - i was addicted to it. this game was literally my childhood. every day id hope my dad came home from his IT college course with some form of addon, as he did occassionally. this game has plenty of mods for you to choose from, ranging from full conversion mods to small little addons such as just a simple vehicle or gun. the singleplayer campaign is great because of how diverse it is. the game is truely open world, you can go where ever you want in what ever mission. the mission editor is your chance to create your own mission to share with the world, or just to have a bit of fun. this is the mode i played the most, and you can do everything in it. the multiplayer in the game works the same as the multiplayer in arma 2.all in all, this game is a must and im so glad that it is free now, because the original discs i have are.. ""aged""this also includes the ""gold upgrade"" pack, and the ""resistance"" expansion, filefront is also a very good site for getting mods and addons for this game			"

												This game is one of my favorite games of all time.  Alot of people may hate on this game saying ""These graphics are♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; or ""It's too hard"" and such, but the graphics don't matter at all, I mean for Christ sake, it was made in 2001!  I still play alot of older games especially PS2 games, which had some really good games, but compared to now the graphics are♥♥♥♥♥♥ WHO THE ♥♥♥♥ CARES?!?!?!  Arma Cold War Assault is a realistic war simulator.  You are put into a scenario, in which you choose how you are to finish.  You can go stealthily through on some levels, or come in guns a blazin'.  While the aim may be a bit weird at first, you'll get used to it and see that if that it's actually in some cases better than just a crossheir stuck in the middle of the screen.  This game also happens to be as hard as my♥♥♥♥♥♥ and can get frustrating at times, but the challenge is fun (At least in my opinion).  Side note: I am not a hardcore Arma fan or anything, I just got into the Arma series like 6 months ago, and saw this one over the weekend was free, so I downloaded it.  Even though this is the oldest of the Armas, this one is probably my favorite.  As long as you can get past the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ N64 like graphics, DEFINETLY download this.			"

												Something is wrong with the mouse sensitivity settings which makes it almost impossible to navigate the options screen. It appears to be hyper sensitive even when set to the lowest sensitivity iin the options. However, when in game the mouse acts almost normally (there is some unwanted acceleration).What little of the game play I could manage was quite interesting, which makes this more frustrating.I will retry after a full reinstall of Arma. Other steam games (Starbound, Deus Ex) as well as other non-Steam games work with normal mouse control behaviour on my laptop, except Alpha Protocol which also has excessive and unchangeable mouse sensitivity.Tested on an Acer Aspire V3-571G laptop on its own display with no external monitor attached. No difference seen when 1680x 1050 external monitor attached.Windows 8 OEMIntel i7nVidia 710M "

But for a classic, hands down it was my favorite game and still is easily in my top 20 of all time. This was the beginning of the Operation Flashpoint / Arma franchise and is well worth a fire-up as the game still retains its rustic charm. Plus you can still do CRAZY stuff with the editor.			"

												this game is very old game since 2001. This game have single player, campaign, multiplayer and editor mode. And i will teach you how to play online on Arma: Cold War Assault. you will see that your multiplayer cant play online. What you need to do is go to internet and search ""OFP Server"" and you will see on the title ""OFP Servers - Forum ArmaGame.pl"". you click and it will show the server on that page. Next step is open the game (arma: cold war assault) and click multiplayer and go to Remote and you will see it have address and port. what you need to do next is copy (ctrl c) address and port on ofp server (internet). For example 77.251.174.249:2322  like this. and put to game and click ok. you will see that you have 1 server in your multiplayer. And server that you put in game, it can play online with everyone. thanks for read, visit in online server ""OFP Server"" on the title ""OFP Servers - Forum ArmaGame.pl"".			"

												It is not a bad game but very old and not many people play online.  The story is a bit boring but not the worst game ever.  For 6 bucks, i would say get it on sale or buy it if you want to try out the first game in the series of ARMA.  ARMA 2 and 3 are much better games.			"

												This game was once called Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis. It takes place in Cold War period on 3 islands. In the Cold War campaign you play as 3 different men. You can save only once on every mission, don't worry though because there are checkpoints too. Game is pretty fun and realistic once you get hang of it. What you might don't like is the choppy movement, not the best order menu and the fact that sometimes mission bugs out and you can't finish it unless you load the save or restart the game. I also want to mention awesome soundtrack this game has and the fact that game comes with second camaign too, which is called Arma Resistance. It takes place before the Cold War campaign and as the title says, you play as resistance member. In Resistance there are also few new weapons. I reccomend buying this game, especially on sales.			"

												I Enjoyed Operation Flash Point a great deal, and so did my Grand Sons. It was a great game and ARMA made it better as far as I can tell. All of the MODs and Add on s make it great.  The Editor allows you to make a situation. The AI is very good, in fact better then/ harder then fighting a real opponent.  The Universe is Huge, and changes with the other islands, and add on maps. The only issue is the Faces are blocky and Cylinder shaped, (then again who spends all that much time looking at the faces). Just walking, driving, or flying around the map is fun also. The ""Solo"" missions are almost impossible, They could have been much better, but don't get wrapped up in those. It also comes with cheats, so let that work for you.			"

												I played a lot of this when it was called Operation Flashpoint. The AI is particularly impressive. Once, my roomate at the time designed a scenario where a small American force had to destroy an enemy self propelled AA gun. Once it was destroyed, additional troops could come in by air. Then, after every Russian in the area was dead, we'd have ten minutes to prepare for a Russian counterattack.Well, the counterattack would never fire. So, we watched a replay. A Russian officer and some conscripts, fearing for their digital lives, took a civilian car and drove out of town. We did nothing to code this. They just wanted to get the hell out of there. Other replays showed similar behavior. Troops would flee into the wilderness.So, the triggers had to be revised so that we'd only have to drive all enemy forces from the town to trigger the counterattack. Even then, when we loaded up an destroyed almost all of the attackers, one infantry was still alive huddled in the wreckage of a T-80. The single player is great. There is a level where you have to try to get to an evac point asap. There were a lot of Russians looking for you, so I found myself compelled to take the long route through thick woods. Laying prone and waiting for a nearby squad of Russians to pass (while hoping they didn't see me) was one of the most intense moments I ever experienced in gaming.			"

												An undying classic from my childhood. It is clunky, rough, has weird controls and a steep learning curve, and as a new player, you can expect to be killed over and over again by unseen enemies hiding in bushes 300 metres away. It is the dark souls of military games. Yet, if you overcome this frustration and learn the enemy's behaviour, you will be rewarded with it's deep strategic gameplay, non-linear mission design and strong atmosphere.			"

												I played this when I was a kid. I thought it was next gen back then.It's aged fairly badly. The graphics look terrible for the most part and the campaign missions are full of awkward silences as the games logic decides what it's going to do next.However. The story is still really good and it's the core mechanics and gameplay of arma 2 & 3 so if you like those you will probably like this game too.Whenever I load it up I cringe at the facial models and some of the textures just look horrible. But get past all that garnish and play the game. It still plays really well and feels distincly arma. It punishes you for mistake and gives you personal achievement for logically thinking through a situation and making the right call.There are moments looking through the binoculars at the impressive draw distance of a soldier framed by woods at low light, the game can almost look pretty.Play one of the first missions, it's about picking up a jeep from a town. If you hate this mission, then that's all you need to know about operation flashpoint - I mean ama. cold war assault.			"

												Originally released as Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, this is the game that brought military simulators to a mainstream audience. You have to be warned that this isn't your typical FPS - it's a military simulator with a steep learning curve.  The combat tries to be as realistic as possible, to the point that it was adapted into VBS1, a training simulator used by NATO.  The gameplay is very unforgiving, but rewards smart, tactical play.Mechanics:It looks like a normal FPS on the surface, but the combat is designed to be a realistic simulation rather than a balanced game.  Projectiles are individually modeled according to physics projections, rather than the raycast + RNG system that most modern shooters use.  Weapons penetration is realistically simulated as well - it takes a lot of heavy weaponry to hurt an M1 Abrams, a .50 cal can tear through a thin-skinned vehicle like a BDRM, and a 9mm is only going to penetrate people.  However, destructible environments are not present due to engine limitations of the time, so buildings do not respond to gunfire this way and only some can be destroyed by explosives.  The health system responds to hit location - being injured in the leg will slow you down, being injured in the arm will affect your aim, and bad injuries can actually render you unable to move or fire.  You can also be insantly killed by a lucky or well-placed shot.  Vehicles have a similar but less robust system, where their wheels or tracks or guns can be destroyed. The squad controls are much more in-depth and situational than other games. This allows an experienced player to pull off coordinated tactics, but it requires an up-front investment to learn. The result is that a new player will often blame the AI for their own inexperience with the controls. A unique feature that I've only ever seen in the Arma series is that the AI is capable of visibly identifying other characters.  This allows for some neat tricks on the stealth missions - you can actually grab a civilian or enemy vehicle and use it to drive right past checkpoints and patrols.  The AI only sees the exterior of the vehicle and recognizes it as non-hostile, so you're safe as long as you don't let them see your actual character model.  Conversely, if you steal an enemy vehicle and try to escape back into your own lines, your own allies are going to light you up because all they see is a target charging them.The worst part of the game, by far, is the archaic save system.  If you play by the rules, you're restricted to one save per mission, which is absolutely ludicrous for a game this difficult.  However, there's a simple cheat that enables you to save like a normal game - press left shift+tilde, then type ""savegame"" and the game will automatically overwrite its previous save.  Future Arma titles learned from feedback on this and included multiple save systems by default.Level Design:The missions offer a wonderful amount of variety.  You have desperate base defenses, coordinated infantry assaults, recon and scouting, patrols, major armored offensives, air strikes, stealthy commando raids, and intense escape & evasion situations. All with realisitc parameters, rather than fictional superhero fantasies of many shooters.A crucial aspect of the gameplay is the wide-open nature of the maps.  Unlike most shooters, which have tight and linear levels designed to deliver a preconceived experience, Arma: Cold War Assault is more concerned with simulating actual combat.  Therefore, the player always has access to the entire map in every mission.  Only have to patrol a forest?  Entire map.  Only have to defend a town?  Entire map.  It's usually not smart to go too far off-course - this will often cause you to run into areas that are either super heavily defended or absolutely empty - but the fact that the game leaves this decision up to you is really important.  The early missions will hold your hand and help you learn how to play, so you're pretty much expected to just go along a single route, but the later missions often require you to think strategically and use the map to your advantage.In the beginning, you play as a normal US rifleman in an infantry squad, following AI commands and learning the ropes. Gradually, the game introduces other characters that allow you to take on special forces, tank, and helicopter missions. Narrative:Set in 1985, the game portrays a ""Cold War gone Hot"" scenario.  A small, fictional island chain with Balkan flavor becomes a flashpoint when a Soviet general decides to attack the NATO garrison there.  Tensions escalate as the Kremlin tries to decide whether to officially support the invasion or not - after all, it goes smashingly well at first.  The US garrison is driven off the island of Everon and barely hanging onto their base on the island of Malden, awaiting reinforcements as the USSR pushes its advantage and tries to conquer the entire island chain.The storytelling is generally good, but its cutscenes often feel more fitting for a Hollywood movie than a military simulator.  I think this was definitely the publisher's influence, because Bohemia Interactive has kept to a much more realistic tone ever since they went independent.  AestheticsGraphics were outstanding for the time, with a focus on modeling weapons & vehicles accurately. Map is huge and provides a good variety of interesting geography. Some well-chosen heavy metal tracks accentuate the action-packed missions. The voice acting is decent at best and painful at worst.Expansion:The expansion pack, Resistance, is one of the most unique shooter campaigns I've ever played.  It’s a prequel to the main campaign, taking place during a previous Soviet attempt to grab the nearby island of Nogova (leading to the NATO garrison in the region during the main campaign).  In it, you play as an ex-military man trying to lead a peaceful civilian life on the island – the first mission literally has you driving into the city to go to work.  But everything is interrupted by the Soviet attack and you end up taking command of the fledgling resistance movement, fighting a guerilla war against the Russians.The thing that makes this campaign so unique is its armory system.  In the main campaign, you always have a fairly restricted access to weapons that’s based on US military issue – riflemen carry M16A2’s and machinegunners carry M60’s and so on and so forth.  In Resistance, your fledging guerilla movement starts with only a handful of old Sa-58’s – basically a Czech AK-47.  In order to keep getting more weapons and ammo, you have to “liberate” them from the Soviets.  In fact, much of the early game is dedicated to building up your resistance movement’s arsenal, until you can afford to upgrade everyone to AK-74’s, PKM’s, and RPG’s (or however you want to equip them – it’s entirely up to the player). The game always provides you with a base supply of cheap weapons, so you can’t just run out of things.  But if you ignore this resource mechanic, your forces are going to be outgunned and low on ammo the entire time.  Diligent scavenging, however, will lead to a resistance force that’s capable of destroying whatever the Soviets can throw at you.  Later on, you get NATO support and special forces advisors, resulting in a limited supply of NATO weapons that you can upgrade to.  You even wind up stealing old Soviet T-55’s and T-62’s, so that you can mount armored attacks. The missions are nice and diverse here as well.  The expansion starts out slow, with atmosphere-building events that draw you into the story.  Then you fight a guerilla war, striking at vital targets but running and avoiding the major Soviet responses.  Finally, the end-game sees you amassing a strong enough force with enough NATO support to launch a counterattack and push the Soviets off the island.Overall Rating:  5/5 "

												I would have enjoyed this game as a kid. It’s got decent cinematics for its time, but the voice-acting is abysmal. The game is also really hard. The pace and difficulty remind me of the original Rainbow Six: you can’t just run-and-gun. You’ll get killed like that.			"

												I have a love/hate relationship with this game.This game looks ugly,is harder than Dark Souls(All the enemies in this game received some kind of tracing rounds) the story is bland(Another Russian/Eastern European invasion) and the levels are literally generic Eastern European town/village or generic american/Russian military base.This game also has a hard to use interface.Thats a pretty good way to describe this game,hard to use.Everything in this game from the interface to even the menus are hard to use.The thing is,I keep on coming back to the game because It does have a few good missions here and there.Verdict: 4/10 ,			"

Once you get over the graphics not being 2015, you can really enjoy the game. I would even go as far as recommending it over the newer ArmA titles.			"

Couple of the controls may seem a little odd at first, but once you get a feel for it the game becomes very rewarding. Just remember this though. Bush =/= cover.			"

Not really appealing to play on my desktop but when I can only use my sister's laptop its great.Has sandbox mode, for example, spawning 20 vs 20 tanks from either russia, NATO, or resistance. Tank gameplay is great, individual parts can be damaged such as barrel, turret and hull. Crew members can be also killed, leaving your tank immobilized or defenseless. I give 7 waterbottles out of 3 coconuts for this game. "

												OK LISTEN UP YOU MAGGOTS!!!! <---- Imitation of a drill sergeantThe release date here on steam does indeed say August 8, 2011 BUT, and its a big but,  it was NOT first released in 2011.The game was first released to the public in 2006.  This game is a remade Operation Flashpoint Cold War Crisis (2001), updated graphics engine, scripting abilities, physics, new units and vehicles, but Bohemia broke ties with Codemasters before 2006 and since Codemasters has legal rights to the name Operation Flashpoint Bohemia Interactive had to choose another.From having played Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising, Codemaster developed and published, it was much more acadey then the previous OFP game and I assume Codemasters wanted a faster pace and easier game to publish to appeal to a wider audience and hence make more money.  Nothing really wrong with that but i do prefer Bohemia Interactives vision more even though I die, ALOT, usually (At times it seems it's a toss up between Dark Souls Prepare to Die edition and Arma series how often I end up dieing(ok trying to be funny as I am not really THAT bad of a player).  The successes make it worthwhile.  Oh some of the mods for the different ArmA make it extremely fun, easier or more difficult if that is your thing.			"

												This game was once called Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis. It takes place in Cold War period on 3 islands. In the Cold War campaign you play as 3 different men. You can save only once on every mission, don't worry though because there are checkpoints too. Game is pretty fun and realistic once you get hang of it. What you might don't like is the choppy movement, not the best order menu and the fact that sometimes mission bugs out and you can't finish it unless you load the save or restart the game. I also want to mention awesome soundtrack this game has and the fact that game comes with second camaign too, which is called Arma Resistance. It takes place before the Cold War campaign and as the title says, you play as resistance member. In Resistance there are also few new weapons. I reccomend buying this game, especially on sales.			"

												this game is very old game since 2001. This game have single player, campaign, multiplayer and editor mode. And i will teach you how to play online on Arma: Cold War Assault. you will see that your multiplayer cant play online. What you need to do is go to internet and search ""OFP Server"" and you will see on the title ""OFP Servers - Forum ArmaGame.pl"". you click and it will show the server on that page. Next step is open the game (arma: cold war assault) and click multiplayer and go to Remote and you will see it have address and port. what you need to do next is copy (ctrl c) address and port on ofp server (internet). For example 77.251.174.249:2322  like this. and put to game and click ok. you will see that you have 1 server in your multiplayer. And server that you put in game, it can play online with everyone. thanks for read, visit in online server ""OFP Server"" on the title ""OFP Servers - Forum ArmaGame.pl"".			"

There is so many unique and different ways to approach your objectives that make this game very fun. For me the controls are hard(especially with me being mainly a console player) but I guess like other pc games I have played I will get used to them over time. One final thing is that I like how this game can run on very bad pcs like mine. Overall I give this game 10/10.			"

												This is the game is easily THE game you have to have played if you're into military simulation shooters. This paved the way for the whole milsim genre and was really ahead of its time. The story telling in the original and resistance campaign is just awesome for the time and so good that i even came back for a playthrough just now. Don't expect 2010s graphics, instead enjoy the oldschool culture of milsim games. This is really a piece of culture.The later ArmA series games are my favourite till today though never any of the followers really catched up to this jewel for me. If you're into milsim please play this just to see how it all began.			"

												I played this when I was a kid. I thought it was next gen back then.It's aged fairly badly. The graphics look terrible for the most part and the campaign missions are full of awkward silences as the games logic decides what it's going to do next.However. The story is still really good and it's the core mechanics and gameplay of arma 2 & 3 so if you like those you will probably like this game too.Whenever I load it up I cringe at the facial models and some of the textures just look horrible. But get past all that garnish and play the game. It still plays really well and feels distincly arma. It punishes you for mistake and gives you personal achievement for logically thinking through a situation and making the right call.There are moments looking through the binoculars at the impressive draw distance of a soldier framed by woods at low light, the game can almost look pretty.Play one of the first missions, it's about picking up a jeep from a town. If you hate this mission, then that's all you need to know about operation flashpoint - I mean ama. cold war assault.			"

												Not what you'd expect based on other ARMA games, but a decent military sim anyway. Seems more difficult than the sequel since you die more easily, trees block your vision but not bot vision, and there are fewer animated ways to get over/around things.EDIT: I can't recommend this particular version due to the complete and total lack of multiplayer. Oh well.EDIT 2: Somewhere along the line, the game finally got multiplayer! Better yet, the game works decently under PlayOnLinux (you can join games, but you can't host due to most Linux distros preferring to keep their ports closed; Port 2302 is the port to unblock).			"

												Originally released as Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, this is the game that brought military simulators to a mainstream audience. You have to be warned that this isn't your typical FPS - it's a military simulator with a steep learning curve.  The combat tries to be as realistic as possible, to the point that it was adapted into VBS1, a training simulator used by NATO.  The gameplay is very unforgiving, but rewards smart, tactical play.Mechanics:It looks like a normal FPS on the surface, but the combat is designed to be a realistic simulation rather than a balanced game.  Projectiles are individually modeled according to physics projections, rather than the raycast + RNG system that most modern shooters use.  Weapons penetration is realistically simulated as well - it takes a lot of heavy weaponry to hurt an M1 Abrams, a .50 cal can tear through a thin-skinned vehicle like a BDRM, and a 9mm is only going to penetrate people.  However, destructible environments are not present due to engine limitations of the time, so buildings do not respond to gunfire this way and only some can be destroyed by explosives.  The health system responds to hit location - being injured in the leg will slow you down, being injured in the arm will affect your aim, and bad injuries can actually render you unable to move or fire.  You can also be insantly killed by a lucky or well-placed shot.  Vehicles have a similar but less robust system, where their wheels or tracks or guns can be destroyed. The squad controls are much more in-depth and situational than other games. This allows an experienced player to pull off coordinated tactics, but it requires an up-front investment to learn. The result is that a new player will often blame the AI for their own inexperience with the controls. A unique feature that I've only ever seen in the Arma series is that the AI is capable of visibly identifying other characters.  This allows for some neat tricks on the stealth missions - you can actually grab a civilian or enemy vehicle and use it to drive right past checkpoints and patrols.  The AI only sees the exterior of the vehicle and recognizes it as non-hostile, so you're safe as long as you don't let them see your actual character model.  Conversely, if you steal an enemy vehicle and try to escape back into your own lines, your own allies are going to light you up because all they see is a target charging them.The worst part of the game, by far, is the archaic save system.  If you play by the rules, you're restricted to one save per mission, which is absolutely ludicrous for a game this difficult.  However, there's a simple cheat that enables you to save like a normal game - press left shift+tilde, then type ""savegame"" and the game will automatically overwrite its previous save.  Future Arma titles learned from feedback on this and included multiple save systems by default.Level Design:The missions offer a wonderful amount of variety.  You have desperate base defenses, coordinated infantry assaults, recon and scouting, patrols, major armored offensives, air strikes, stealthy commando raids, and intense escape & evasion situations. All with realisitc parameters, rather than fictional superhero fantasies of many shooters.A crucial aspect of the gameplay is the wide-open nature of the maps.  Unlike most shooters, which have tight and linear levels designed to deliver a preconceived experience, Arma: Cold War Assault is more concerned with simulating actual combat.  Therefore, the player always has access to the entire map in every mission.  Only have to patrol a forest?  Entire map.  Only have to defend a town?  Entire map.  It's usually not smart to go too far off-course - this will often cause you to run into areas that are either super heavily defended or absolutely empty - but the fact that the game leaves this decision up to you is really important.  The early missions will hold your hand and help you learn how to play, so you're pretty much expected to just go along a single route, but the later missions often require you to think strategically and use the map to your advantage.In the beginning, you play as a normal US rifleman in an infantry squad, following AI commands and learning the ropes. Gradually, the game introduces other characters that allow you to take on special forces, tank, and helicopter missions. Narrative:Set in 1985, the game portrays a ""Cold War gone Hot"" scenario.  A small, fictional island chain with Balkan flavor becomes a flashpoint when a Soviet general decides to attack the NATO garrison there.  Tensions escalate as the Kremlin tries to decide whether to officially support the invasion or not - after all, it goes smashingly well at first.  The US garrison is driven off the island of Everon and barely hanging onto their base on the island of Malden, awaiting reinforcements as the USSR pushes its advantage and tries to conquer the entire island chain.The storytelling is generally good, but its cutscenes often feel more fitting for a Hollywood movie than a military simulator.  I think this was definitely the publisher's influence, because Bohemia Interactive has kept to a much more realistic tone ever since they went independent.  AestheticsGraphics were outstanding for the time, with a focus on modeling weapons & vehicles accurately. Map is huge and provides a good variety of interesting geography. Some well-chosen heavy metal tracks accentuate the action-packed missions. The voice acting is decent at best and painful at worst.Expansion:The expansion pack, Resistance, is one of the most unique shooter campaigns I've ever played.  It’s a prequel to the main campaign, taking place during a previous Soviet attempt to grab the nearby island of Nogova (leading to the NATO garrison in the region during the main campaign).  In it, you play as an ex-military man trying to lead a peaceful civilian life on the island – the first mission literally has you driving into the city to go to work.  But everything is interrupted by the Soviet attack and you end up taking command of the fledgling resistance movement, fighting a guerilla war against the Russians.The thing that makes this campaign so unique is its armory system.  In the main campaign, you always have a fairly restricted access to weapons that’s based on US military issue – riflemen carry M16A2’s and machinegunners carry M60’s and so on and so forth.  In Resistance, your fledging guerilla movement starts with only a handful of old Sa-58’s – basically a Czech AK-47.  In order to keep getting more weapons and ammo, you have to “liberate” them from the Soviets.  In fact, much of the early game is dedicated to building up your resistance movement’s arsenal, until you can afford to upgrade everyone to AK-74’s, PKM’s, and RPG’s (or however you want to equip them – it’s entirely up to the player). The game always provides you with a base supply of cheap weapons, so you can’t just run out of things.  But if you ignore this resource mechanic, your forces are going to be outgunned and low on ammo the entire time.  Diligent scavenging, however, will lead to a resistance force that’s capable of destroying whatever the Soviets can throw at you.  Later on, you get NATO support and special forces advisors, resulting in a limited supply of NATO weapons that you can upgrade to.  You even wind up stealing old Soviet T-55’s and T-62’s, so that you can mount armored attacks. The missions are nice and diverse here as well.  The expansion starts out slow, with atmosphere-building events that draw you into the story.  Then you fight a guerilla war, striking at vital targets but running and avoiding the major Soviet responses.  Finally, the end-game sees you amassing a strong enough force with enough NATO support to launch a counterattack and push the Soviets off the island.Overall Rating:  5/5 "

												This was a game I first purchased with my first proper pc. Which at the time was a 700mhz Duron and TNT2 card. (later upgraded to a 1ghz)This was a time when the competition to hit 1Ghz was only just starting.This game is primarily a nostalgic review because the memories found with the emergent gameplay. It was a freeform scripted world that allowed you to act how you wanted WITHIN constraints. It was NOT a pure open world game that would ♥♥♥♥ you over from shoddy gameplay it just gave you 50 ways to complete a single task.The graphics at the time weren't great but the size and adaptability of the world was.This is in many ways a personal favourite I find more fun than ARMA. the lack of polish meant you found glitches and other weird gameplay issues more easily but in many ways like Hidden and Dangerous the game breaking bugs were actually what sometimes allowed you to have the most stupid fun.Attack an enemy base with C4? Nah i'll steal the enemy chopper parked up and then simply mow down every enemy AI until the game works out i've won.The game editor was the first PROPER modding tool for a game like this that taught you how to script sequences etc with unit IDENTs and other very long winded coding principles. But the simple fact is it taught me how procedural coding worked.It also allowed me to invent my own little zombie survival game that I have knocking around on a CD somewhere. This was about 5 years before the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that was Day Z came along.The game IS flawed. It's NOT great in places and it BREAKS a lot because of weird scripting issues, but it lets you fly A-10s in custom built levels against aircraft carriers with spawn points 10Km up with multiple custom elements.You are going to have fun then you are going to throw your pc out the window because some random AI decided to see you across the map with 500 trees in the way.""OH NO!!! 5....is down!""

												I first played this game in 2011, so it was already over 10 years old. Yet, it didn't stop me from spending thousands of hours playing it. I don't know what it is about this game, but it makes you feel like a kid again, playing with them green armymen toys. I think the game shines the most because of its easy to use editor. You can make millions and millions of different scenarios, whether it be a massive combined forces assault on some  village, a fighter jet dogfight or simply a tractor race you can make all those missions by yourself in not much longer than an hour. The game also has a massive and I mean massive modding community. I'm pretty sure there are still mods being created on it today, not many games have such dedicated communities. The campaigns are really nice as well, maybe even better than those of newer ARMA games. You feel very vulnerable and unprepared all the time, you never know when a single stray bullet might hit and kill you and you really feel great when you survive against all odds, it's a truly great feeling. Sure there are some serious problems that this game struggles with, like bad voice acting, stiff animations and obviously outdated graphics but you have to remember that this game was one of the first games to have a massive and a truly open world. You will probably have such a great time playing that you won't even notice these problems much. So, grab a buddy and go play it, I promise you, you will probably have such an amazing experience that you will remember it for years to come, I know I still do.			"
