												Everything BC Kings does some other RTS game (usually Warcraft III) did before, and I am hard-pressed to find anything completely original in this title that would warrant a purchase.The theme should have brought about at least something innovative, but this is really Warcraft III with dinosaurs. The gameplay can be enjoyable on occasion, providing a solid RTS experience, but there is a host of ancillary features that are either broken or missing completely. No attack-moves. No online multiplayer. A short campaign. Annoying multi-level maps. Translation issues. There are just too many little problems in BC Kings that add up to one big headache. The lack of innovation seals the deal: there are way too many other RTS games just like BC Kings to make it stand out. Overall 5/10.			"

												I won't say anything bad about this game because it's obvious when you look at the screenshots and because a Steam friend gifted this game to me. All I will say is that I do not recommend this game to anyone! The only good thing about this game is that it made me want to play Warcraft 3 again. However, I believe that any game deserves respect so I'll at least upload a proper artwork to this game's Steam tab before forgetting it forever.

												Despite the dated and simple graphics (and the music tracks not appealing to me), this game turned out to be quite fun to play.  Be prepared to restart some stages a few times as it is all too easy to lose a unit that ""must"" survive to complete a quest.BC Kings has some really good design innovation elements, but not all of these are flawlessly implemented.  If you are looking for a more polished product that has some similar gameplay elements - look at Warcraft, Warcraft II, Warcraft III.However the setting for BC Kings is quite unique and the whole Neanderthal setting with cavemen and dinosaurs has a certain quirky appeal to it.  With a revamp of the artwork and graphics, some voice-overs and a bit of refinement this game would certainly have more appeal and value.Overall as it stands you get a game that is fun to play, but it is very much a diamond in the rough.

												Way back in 1997, an extremely well designed RTS game, Age of Empires, blew many players away. Granted the gameplay at the time was similar to the ‘big two’ being Command and Conquer and Warcraft, it stands out due to its storyline as it ties in playing out our history. Personally, I loved it because you get the play out the Stone Age as no other games done this effectively since. Fast forward to 2008, another RTS game arrived where you can play out the Stone Age (with some twists) and filled the landscape with dinosaurs – and who doesn’t like dinosaurs? This game, BC Kings, whilst kept on the traditional RTS formula (explore / build / conquer), it added some RPG elements and encourages exploration as well. A decent game considering it’s an indie title however I wished there were more dinosaurs to play with.Overall, the game was a blast to play from start to finish with some twists and turns along the way. Yes it does feel like a rip-off from Age of Empires however it’s obvious that there’s a lot of love and care poured into this game. The UI is nicely designed with beautiful pictures that resembles cavemen paintings splashed throughout is an example of devotion. However I praise the developers for trying out something new to the ever-so overused RTS formula where it encourages you to explore, have multiple maps, a spray of RPG and even has a third person view option (well…one mission has this). Some of these innovations plays well and others not so however that’s not to discredited their efforts. It’s a light hearted RTS that’s very enjoyable to play until the very end. Let’s put it this way, when I think of that title, it places a smile in my face and that’s a good thing.8 / 10Full review here:http://www.gamespot.com/bc-kings/user-reviews/2200-12641425/ "

												Its a fun quirky strategy game that is fun to play but I bought the game on sale when it was much cheaper. Definitely do not buy it for full price, compared to other RTS games that are made today it is not as good but it brings some of that old-school RTS feel with it and is good for gamers that remember the challenging mechanics and playstyles of old RTS games. It has an interesting campaign and a fun variety of units but the graphics are dated and the online is all but dead. If its on sale though its not a bad deal.			"

												This is a traditional RTS where you collect four resources which you later use to build structures and create army. The strategy is not revolutionary in any way, though you do have some interesting elements such as a secondary quest system and a possibility to travel between maps. The biggest drawback is the graphics. Everything would have been much better if the devs had paid more attention to the engine. If, on the other hand, you're into old school strategies, but don't mind the graphics, give BC Kings a go. :)			"

												This is the RTS I have been looking for for the past few months. Been dropping money on wannabes until now. This is seriously fun. I can tell just by the tutorial. Though the difficulty on this even on easy will have you sobbing like a little girl. AI Pathing system is slightly flawed.  Very intensive micro-managing combat system if you're into that. 3 min Auto save feature built right into the game. Easily 8/10 Highly reccomended (Warcraft RTS clone)			"

												So cheap, so fun, so traditionally RTS/Strategy.   But with slight twists, like multiple maps.  It's really fun game for how cheap it is, really worth the investment!  You'll get a lot of fun out of it, plus a good challenge.  It's extremely traditional though, which is what I liked about it.  I'd whine about the dated graphics, but hell, I still love to load up Age of Empires and have a damn good thwarting, so it doesn't bother me at all!The units are what you'd expect, which is helpful.  The story and the humour is quite good.  Overall, it's totally worth more than what you're going to pay for it, and you're going to have a great time.			"

												This game seemed so attractive! Warcraft III in a prehistoric setting! What a dream! (I sincerely think all of it.)And yet, it is unplayable, ugly beyond your imagination, and intolerably buggy. I spent twenty minutes on it without being able of reaching the camp in the first tutorial mission, as nothing was working properly. A good flavor of this technical mess is that you have to choose the language game every time you start it between English or Russian... But if you inadvertently click during the time the menu loads, then your click counts as selecting Russian and you have to start the game again.Also, it doesn't quit properly. With Windows, you have to end the process by Ctrl+Alt+Del, otherwise it will be still running.As for the game per se, the mouse doesn't always respond and everything freezes every ten seconds. What a pity.			"

												I enjoyed this game and was worth the few bucks i spent on it. Its not a hard thinking game just an enjoyable casual expercience. Buy it if you want to play something cause your board or for a child just learning how to play rts's.			"

												This game was clearly inspired by Warcraft 3. The game mechanisms and graphik style is similar, although both are somehow worse than the much older W3. The setting is interesting and kinda unique and I can image it would have been fun for a few hours in 2005. However, nowadays I can hardly see a reason to play BC Kings.  "

												Old school, i would give it a thumbs up if the guys tried to polish the game, since they just made only the fundamentals part of the game and did not care about the details and left everything else to be terrible, i decided to not recommend this, stay away from it.			"

												Finished it today. Game is fine for it's price and it does offer a lot. I had paid only close to 50cents and already got more out of it. It feels and plays like warcraft 3 but let's say without any voice acting. To understand the story all you gotta do is just read, read and read. I am okay with the reading part but if you're someone who doesn't like to read and find it annoying then you might not like it. Graphically game feels dated but its okay as long as it is able to entertain you. The game has some humour into it and does the does nicely or I should rather say cutely which is good enough to bring atleast a smile on your face. It does offer multiplayer option but I haven't tried it. If you're a fan of warcraft like games then you can buy this game and it will not disappoint you. If possible get it on sale, the game is still fun especially for RTS Lovers.Edit: I didn't encounter any bugs except just one while trying to play a random match. If you add more than 2 match participants(In Random mode) then it's likely to freeze on loading screen besides that in approx. 26+ hours I didn't encounter any bug or whatsoever. Game is very stable.			"

												It is a good game, I get it for £0.69 but even £5 up to £10 is ok for this. It was developped by a very small team. The programmer and one of two 3D designer is the same guy. It look like a game that have been made in familly. Some good ideas, some bugs as well (I cannot see the cursor on spell casting). You cannot compare this game with warcraft III, that is not the same budget and not the same team. For the price go for it, no matter if you do not like it, the price is so low that you will not lost a lot of money.One rare STR based on prehistoric age.			"
