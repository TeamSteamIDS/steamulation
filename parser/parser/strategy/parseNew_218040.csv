												Overall 5/10Pros:- The idea behind it is good, you get to play a government and using different policies you try to get reelected while improving a country.- Some concepts behind it are solid, both in terms of ecomics and social policies.- It is easy to understand what each polciy does.Cons:- It is probably too easy to beat, just a bunch of algorithms to beat.- There's only one way to ""win"" and that is pretty much going full ""social democrat"", nothing else seem to work.- Very few scenarios.- The consequences of some actions are totally off, like raising VAT to 70% and seeing your opinion rating go up.I truly like the idea behind it, and I hope the author gets backing to develop it into 1) a real game, made by pros and  2) a more realistic simulation, but as it is now I cannot reccomend it.

												Better as a lesson of how interconnected things are, and how quickly things can go stupid with just a few bad mistakes, than as a simulation of real politics. Still can prove quite fun til you figure out how to tweak the folks to get them to do what you want. At some point, it loses its charm, but you may have a bit more respect for your politicians by then, if you're not wondering why they haven't implemented all the policies you did to have a socialist utopia. 3/5			"

												Buyer beware - This game has limited functionality on Windows 7 & 8. You most likely will experience a display issue cutting off half the icons needed. It seems to be an issue related to widescreen displays. Changing the compatibility mode does not work for most either. Unless the developer manages to patch this and solve the UI issue, do not buy this game.			"

												Let me start out by saying that I have a degree focusing on Political Science and have worked in the sector....The Socioeconomic policies do not reflect what happens in the real world, more what someone idealizes how they should work. The Human Element is not well represented, such as in situations where a positive outcome is seen, but the electorate is unhappy due to outlying political/social/etc beliefs (e.g. the goal is accomplished, but not HOW the populace wanted it accomplished, etc). The Political system is rather simplified and this makes a Democratic Socialist approach far too easy and ignores key psychological responses that have been observed in the real world when certain situations arise.After playing for a few hours, using demographic knowledge of game developers, and knowing the political beliefs behind certain policies, I easily beat the game with a Social Democracy....which appears to be the ultimate point of the developers. Comparatively, I attempted a few other forms of government approaches that have been historically stable in the real world, but those forms were not nearly as friendly in the game world.As this is intended to be a political sim attempting to replicate the real world, I cannot recommend this. However, if this were a model that honestly stated its intent to show HOW a Democratic Socialist contruct can best be made and why it is best for them, in their view, as compared to other options...Then I would say that it accomplished its intent.

												Love the concept. The UI is bad, but I would be okay with it if the game was balanced. Starting scenarios are far too random. In the same scenario, sometimes I started with a $10Bn deficit which was manageable and fun, but several times I started with a >$40Bn deficit which needs almost all turns until the election to just correct, changes take too long and I found the game too difficult to be fun. Perhaps I need to change some parameters to make it work, but I think it is just bad game design overall. Really wanted to like this game			"

												Definitely a great game, but you have to fit the right niche. No flashy graphics to distract you, just a screen and some government policy options. It's pretty fun to try to build different types of countries, such as a socialist one or a pure capitalist democracy, or even try to model it after the style of leadership of an individual. It's your chance to create a country the way you see fit, so why not take it!			"

												Democracy 2 is a really lackluster game.It's rare that I play a game and feel like I've wasted my money, but D2 had me feeling that within half an hour.For me, the dealbreaker is the fact that when you aren't voted back in, the game ends. What's the point in that? I was actually looking forward to being opposition leader and laying the smackdown on the current government while I set my party on a road to recovery.It just made it a really one-dimensional and short-lived game for me.

												This game is a fun political simulator. Only complaint I can think of is that it encourages you to go to extremes on all the issues and doesn't really encourage moderation (basically, if you're going to anger a certain part of the electorate anyway, then the game doesn't discourage you from going all the way).I've also heard some complaints that this game has a left-wing bias but I don't buy that. You'll get some bad events if you go full-blown socialist to the point of alienating your capitalists.			"

												Overpriced, unbalanced, inflexible. This is a game that is over 4 years old now, and still costs 20 dollars. It's ridiculous! Second, many of the in-game options are unbalanced. I have been assassinated, by environmentalists, when I had a carbon tax and strong anti-pollution regulations. Most importantly, I find, the amount of actual changes you can make besides different degrees of neoliberal capitalism is very low. You can't have any kind of socialism(Social democracy is very attainable, but the closest thing to a leftist ideology in the game, and it's still capitalist.), you can't abolish the government, and limited government doesn't work great either. You can't really have fascism either. Even the sequel to this game(Democracy 3) is still plagued by many of these problems, but slighty less so. If you really want a game like this, just skip this one and get Democracy 3, but the entire series isn't the best, I find. There isn't a really high amount of replayability, either, it all gets to be the same pattern, for me. (Make some changes, keep budget balanced, some terrorist group gets angry, I get assassinated after about an hour of playing) Can't recommend.			"

												For a political game, it sure doen't like you making choices. I'll give you an example.Say that I'm the Labour Party. The Labour party does not make decisions based upon the Daily Mail, but rather based upon their fat cat union paymasters. So when the Labour party starts to impliment these Union policies the Daily Mail doesn't like it and SENDS OUT HITMEN TO KILL THE PRIME MINISTER. The same could be said when playing as a liberal, although you would have to add THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND to the list. You know, the tame and timid church of dwindling numbers and no real passion? OK, OK, it may very well be Muslims, but it wasn't a masque that denounced me a month before my assassination.Try to impliment the policies you think are the best and you will be killed. Betray your voter base who wants these reforms and you may just get a coup from your ministers. Quite frankly, I agree with my ministers, I want to run a liberal government. It's just a shame that UKIP and the Church of England disagree, because it makes the game dull. To play you must now tow the center ground, pander to all groups and believe in nothing. DId Thatcher pander to socialists? She most certainly did not, nor did Reagan or the two Bush's. Where they assasinated by Socialists? NO?!? WHY THE HELL NOT?Let me put it this way, if Ed Miliband came in, do you really think he would listen to the 50 year old UKIP voters who read the daily mail and wouldnt vote for his party anyway, especially given that they dont give him any money? Of course not! So would he be assasinated? The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is not some bannana republic that was just liberated from the tenticles of spain and doesnt know how to run an election! What this game does allow you to do, is manage the budget, which is reletively easy to do since it devoted over 25% of the UK budget to the military. just reassign the funds. OH BUT YOU TOUCHED OUR PRECIOUS MILITARY, I'M SHOCKED! I'LL BE WRITING A STRONGLY WORDED ARTICLE TELLING OUR HITMEN TO GO FOR THE THROAT!I'm one of the only people devoted to politics you'll ever meet, so when I say this game is dreadful, that not even my latent interest in the topic was enough to carry me through, I god damn mean it.

												Unfortunately this game could not hold my attention. As an avid lover of paradox games, I really love to get involved in in-depth strategy games which involve hours of thinking, plotting, reviewing, controlling, etc. I felt like this game was simply a "" click here to please the public"" game , which required me to make choices to appease the public. I found it slightly frustrating that one problem would resolve, and then another problem would emerge. Graphically, it was not pleasing, nor was the gameplay particularly engaging(every turn you spend your limited ""political capital"" in order to enact policies, etc. The game was also difficult, but that was not a deterrent. Most importantly, I felt like the balancing and the hidden calculations in this game were not right. In other words, I was not convinced that the programmers had a solid understanding of politics, and/or economics.			"

												I waited for this to go on sale 75% off (4,75).I find it encredibly addictive and fun to play, though most of the time playing it goes with thinking about what to do, and how to solve the problems that come up.Try to make the society you want, and you will fail. Try to make a society that works, and you will succeed.If you're not into politics, this is NOT the game for you.Every game you start with a solid debt and a boatload of problems that you have to get rid off. Without♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off too many voters. It's a lot harder than it sounds.There's no mercy in this game. If you♥♥♥♥♥♥off the voters, they'll punish you at once.A lot of what you can do has inertia effects, and may take up to two years to come to full effect. Most tax-fiddeling will be instantaneous though.Your cabinet gains (or loses) political power, which is what you use to pass laws.If the public are dissatisfied you lose some, and if they're happy you gain some.And without it, it's very limited what you can change or do.Theres 10 different countries to play, and they all have different voters and problems.If you're into modding and know a little programming, you can make your own countries, laws, events; and even choose your own voter behavior.You win the game if you manage to stay in office the full number of periods you've chosen to play (1-10), and you lose by not getting re-elected or by reaching the maximun allowed debt (differs according to country).It's not worth the full 20€ they want for it, but at 4.75 it's a pretty fun little game.

												This game looks way more complicated than it actually is, so don't be put off by the screenshots. And it's actually pretty fun, even if it is absurdly America-centric; for example, ""teaching creationism or eveloution in schools"" is always an issue and takes a ridiculous amount of effort to get rid of, even if you're playing as the country where most of the population are atheists. I guess Americans just can't imagine that not being an issue anywhere. Oh, and patriots are always in favour of reduced gun control, because that's how it works in America. Despite that though, it is a fun little game, though probably not one you'll spend a huge amount of time playing.			"

												As a national government simulator with a relatively minimal UI, I recommend this game on sale for Sim buffs.  For me, its intricacies outweigh any complaints that I have of its shortcomings.  I got this instead of Democracy 3 because I heard that the only difference is a cleaner UI and not much else.			"

												This game is not well supported on current pc's. Also it has a good crash potential. That is something too keep in mind.But if you like a good in-depth game with a lot of strategy and every choice you make has impacts. I would say give it a go.			"

												This game looks way more complicated than it actually is, so don't be put off by the screenshots. And it's actually pretty fun, even if it is absurdly America-centric; for example, ""teaching creationism or eveloution in schools"" is always an issue and takes a ridiculous amount of effort to get rid of, even if you're playing as the country where most of the population are atheists. I guess Americans just can't imagine that not being an issue anywhere. Oh, and patriots are always in favour of reduced gun control, because that's how it works in America. Despite that though, it is a fun little game, though probably not one you'll spend a huge amount of time playing.			"

												I haven't yet played Democracy 3, but since that exists and has achievements, I'd say your best bet is probably to play that game.  I enjoyed my brief time with Democracy 2, but I can't really recommend it as a game, and I'm rating it 5/10.  It's really just about familiarizing yourself with the relationships and dynamics of the various functions withi the game, and then 1) immediately fixing the emergency problems upon starting a new game, folllowed by 2) micro-managing and tweaking these elements, which doesn't change very much from game to game once you've taken care of #1 and have some general control over the country's economy.The setup of these dynamics is interesting to examine, and doesn't seem overly simple at first.  But the more you play and see the interconnectedness of the various elements, the more it reveals itself to be simple.  And there's not really much gameplay on the top of everything.  Democracy 2 is good for a few hours of understanding these systems and general gameplay, at which point you end up wishing there were more functional achievements and a deeper game.  I'm hoping that's what Democracy 3 is.			"

												Bloody terrible. Don't get it. It's outdated and gets boring very quickly. If you're even thinking about it - stop. Take it from me, I generally love these sort of strategy games; but this one's the scum of strategy. If I could give it a star rating, it would get 1 out of 10 if I was in a good mood. There are so many bugs it's just painful to play.			"

												Just one single piece of s**t... It starts but it cannot handle windowed mode, It won't let you create new game or even tutorial. Pointless to buy/install on any PC with OS newer than XP...But on the other hand on older machines or virtual one it works fine... but at the moment when you realize that ultimate laws combo - being ecofriendly, make public transit and tax every bit of carbon in the air you breath - you don't see a point in further gameplay.

												This is a very simple and minimalistic government simulator type game. After playing about thrice, you learn all the mechanics inside out, and it becomes boringly easy to ""win"". It has a very linear type of policy making panel, with far left, or far right, and everything in between. Everything has a linear and predictable effect, and all-in-all, it becomes very tedious.It is fun for the first few hours however, I won't deny that. But it simply has no replayability. Games like Masters of the World have a much better and in-depth mechanic and policy implementation. But if that's too complicated for you, then this game is just fine. Grab it on sale since this is an old game, no point paying full price like I did for a game that's just about mediocre.Overall Rating: 6/10			"

												Not userfriendly UI, a total mess. There is no cause and effect trigger in the game and sometimes doesn't use logic at all so it put me in a bad mood about the game. I played it 5h and I'd not go back and do that again. :) I'm not such a follower of those kind of games but sometimes I enjoy playing them. Not this time.PS: Everything u read in here is a personal statement, coming from my point of view and maybe not reflecting what the game itself looks like.			"
