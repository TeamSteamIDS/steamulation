												Rating: 9/10Unity of Command is a turn-based, hex-based strategy game set on the Eastern Front of the Second World War. The scale of units depends on whether you play as the individually superior Germans, organised into divisions, or the numerically superior Soviets, organised into corps. Battles occur along what were historically organised as single operational fronts by the attacker. This game has an incredibly functional and elegantly minimalist UI, which makes planning and manoeuvring simple to execute.Strategy heavily focuses on logistics. Instead of drowning players in a sea of minutiae and micromanagement, the mechanics elegantly strip away all the non-essentials for this scale of warfare. All players need to be concerned about are maintaining supply lines—and how to cut off those of their enemies. Resupplying your own troops is done automatically at the beginning of each turn. Terrain features that support or hinder logistics, such as railroads, bridges, mountains and rivers, are the most important strategic points on maps and are furiously fought over. Although weather rarely becomes an issue for most maps due to the corresponding historical dates, the Russian winter at its fiercest can seriously limit your supply and unit movement range.Unlike almost all other games of this scale, the presence of logistics means that encirclement attacks work realistically, where you surround enemy units and cut off their supply (e.g. food, fuel, munitions). After being out of supply for 2 turns, a unit's combat effectiveness is incredibly compromised. After 4 turns, enemy units are unable to attack. In other games, encirclement merely increases the surface area from where can an attack enemy unit (i.e. multiple friendly units can attack the same enemy). As with German strategy in the first half of Operation Barbarossa, sometimes it's better to bypass large enemy formations and hit their rear supply lines using more mobile divisions (e.g. armoured, mechanised, motorised or cavalry units) than to fight a grinding battle of attrition focused on the complete destruction of the enemy.Despite deceptively simple mechanics, this game is quite realistic at portraying the effectiveness of strategies of the period. There are three main realism problems: (1) No fog of war, though formations at this scale are almost certainly known to enemy reconnaissance; (2) No command structures, which assumes that command delay is less than 24 hours; and (3) Air supply is not subject to anti-aircraft attack. There are far more complex and detailed games that achieve greater realism, such as Gary Grigsby's War in the East (Matrix Games[www.matrixgames.com]), but the overall effectiveness of those strategies is largely the same as in this game but include far more micromanagement.The singleplayer AI is very well crafted, but there is a serious caveat: it's limited to planning one turn in advance. This makes the AI devastatingly effective at conducting defences, launching counterattacks and striking at supply lines, but unable to follow through strategic attacks. This is why in singleplayer you can only play as the attacker. To increase the difficulty, instead of simply achieving a marginal victory, you can take your chances at achieving a brilliant (i.e. perfect) victory by reaching all the objectives in record time.The multiplayer community is small, but you should usually be able to find at least one or two games every day through the following Steam group (Unity of Command Multiplayer). Unfortunately, there is no matchmaking service, which is why people use this group. Be careful though, as strategies that work against singleplayer AI are usually unsuited to facing off against infinitely more crafty human players.			"

												The good:I like the simplistic gameplay, and the focus on keeping your supply lines intact while pushing forwards. That´s what this game is about. Capturing objectives while keeping your units in supply so they don´t run out of juice on the front lines. All within a tight turn limit.It´s an intriguing and (to me) novel concept.The bad:It´s frustrating beyond belief. Not because it´s hard (it is) but because it´s to damn random. +Pushing an enemy off a tile is random.+Getting ""Overrun"" results, which allow you to attack again in the same turn, is random.+A battle can randomly turn out to not go as predicted and you don´t defeat a unit that you needed gone (the game shows you the expected outcome before you attack).+Bad weather which heavily favours the defender (you are never the defender) may randomly show up and completely screw over your push for the objective.+Specialists (expensive and often crucial) within your units may or may not be among the casualties when the unit fights.The problem with that is, the game does not give you the time for this kind of randomness. The turn limits are so tight that any one of these events can screw you over. Sure you might still beat the mission but the game differentiates between normal, decisive and brilliant victories. Many follow up missions are barred behind decisive victories and some even behind brilliant victories.So you try over and over again, without any change in strategy (once you got it down) and hope that you get enough ""Overrun"" results with your armoured units and you hope that your push doesn´t get stuck in bad weather until you finally beat it in time. Due to this, I can´t really recommend it as much as I like the concept of the game.			"

												TL;DR: It's awesome if you know what you're getting and if you're into this kind of game. To know what you get I guess you have to read the rest of this wall of text. I promise it will be a nice and informative read while covering most of what you'd want to know before you buy the game or one of the two DLC's.--------Unity of Command is an excellent game that manages to achieve a thing rarely achieved by wargames that deal with WWII on the operational level: It's accessible to newcomers and easy to learn, it's simple on the surface and in its gameplay but it still has enough depth and complexity to offer interesting decisions for veteran wargamers, because almost every decision you make carries some weight when it comes to the end result. There are other wargames comparably excellent to this one, but they make most newcomers want to vomit blood out of their eyes - because the developers place their confidence in you being willing to read a 100 page manual alongside playing their game and they assume you will look past the hideous and needlessly overcomplicated user interface. (I'm looking at you Korsun Pocket - excellent game, terrible learning experience).None of these things are an issue in Unity of Command. The user interface is excellent and very user-friendly. You don't have to click on a unit to get information about whether it can still attack or move, you see it at a glance because each unit has tiny icons below and around it, that tell you everything you could possibly want to know about your or your enemies' unit at a glance without wasting your time and clicking every unit to check manually.Another point where this game shines is its ""realism"". I know this word is hard to swallow if you're a ""serious"" wargamer and you look at Unity of Command. But this game basically models the higher-level essential things of what war in the eastern front at the operational level was all about. For the Germans it was about advancing as fast and as far as you can to take key objectives without outrunning your own supply or your supply lines being cut off by the enemy. The flipside of this naturally means encircling your enemy and cutting of their supply to weaken them and eventually starve them out completely. Also it's about breaking through (sometimes multiple) defensive lines of your enemy. Pick the weakest link in their line, punch a hole with a massed attack at that point, and then squeeze through everything that has wheels to advance as fast as possible towards your objectives, while your slower infantry divisions advance behind your motorized divisions and worry about securing the supply line for those advancing units, whilst simultaneously trying to encircle and destroy the enemy. The deceptively simple game mechanics of  movement and attack (whilst also considering rivers, terrain features and weather effects on your movement and attacks) are excellent at modelling all of the above - and in the end I think the gameplay mechanics really model everything truly relevant in the context of this large scale warfare level.Each of the units you'll see in the game represents several thousand, if not ten-thousand men and each single single hex represents 20 kilometers. Almost all you ever do in this game is move and attack with your divisions, move and attack. But where to move? What to attack? What to attack first and what with? Where to break the enemy line? How do you cut off their supply lines to starve them out? You also make important decisions in the form of ""theatre assets"" (air raids, building or blowing up bridges, extending the range of your supply depots etc.) Also you have to decide about reinforcements as the game progresses over turns (each turn represents 4 days), so new reinforcements may come into play - on your side as well as on the side of your enemy. Sometimes you need to take a specific area at the edge of the map so your own reinforcements may enter from there, at other times you just replace some losses that your divisions in play suffered already (which sensibly you can only do if they are in supply).So yes at first glance your options seem somewhat limited but they always make perfect sense in the context of modelling the war in the east. You could bomb a city where an enemy infantry division has entrenched itself, but each air attack you launch on that city has a chance of turning the city into ruins, giving any enemy division within it even more defense as fighting on a pile of rubble increases their chances to hide and ambush if you launch an attack into that city. Some divisions have artillery attached, but if you move that unit its artillery attachment (""step"") won't contribute to your attack value, it will only contribute in your defense and attack after you end your current turn and they have set up. This game is just full of gameplay details like this which make absolute sense. If you enjoy pondering these kinds of decisions with a feeling that virtually each small decision matters for the outcome, then this is a game for you. You can also play this game okay without paying much attention to the deeper details - you won't excel at it but you could still play very competently and there aren't that many details to know either, the complexity of your options and decisions arises from the interaction of the gameplay mechanics and the finer details.Also there are ""Zone of Control"" mechanics meaning every (non-weak) unit in a hex extends a zone of control into all six hexes around it (as long as those hexes are inside the own territory), meaning enemy divisions who move into these hexes are immediately ""pinned down"" by the division controlling the zones around it and so the pinned unit can't move any further this turn. This leads to excellent tactics, where some of your units ""clear"" those zones of control and get pinned, while others advance through and past those friendly pinned divisions and thus can advance deeper into enemy territory without getting pinned themselves. You'll learn what that means and how important zones of control are soon enough, because the nothing short of excellent AI will constantly make intelligent use of this mechanic to exploit any hole and weak link in your own defensive lines which may have looked good and solid enough a second ago when you ended your turn, but proved to be as fragile as a butterflies wing a moment later. Also the AI is excellent at defending any objectives you need to take. It knows exactly what your objectives are and dynamically and competently adapts its defensive lines to hinder your progress at every turn. Good times.-------------I do have some gripes about Unity of Command as well however, but they are nowhere seriously bad enough to spoil the fun and experience you can have with this game. I've come across at least two maps that are ill-conceived for 1920x1080 resolutions, because there is a limit to which point you can drag the map view around and some of your user-Interface elements can end up blocking a part at the edge of a map that isn't greyed out and where the actual gameplay still happens (though you can quickly enable and disable user interface elements with hotkeys, so the problem is merely annoying, not gamebreaking). Also there is little variety in terms of music, but the music that is there is really nice. (And it's not as if I can't mute it and play my own music anyway). If I had to criticize gameplay I would say it's mainly this: Your performance is solely ranked based on how timely you take objectives and nothing else. Rarely this can lead to stupid outcomes where I took Stalingrad on time with two completely weakened divisions, my other forces virtually obliterated. I'd have lost on the next turn, but because I took everything on time it was a ""brilliant victory"". Troop loss should have been included in your performance rating. Also random outcomes and weather can prevent you from achieving the best possible rating.			"

												If you ever wondered ""Hey, I wonder what all those hex-based, turn based, 70s board wargame-inspired are all about"", this is the game for you. Also, if you love hex-based, turn based, 70s board wargame-inspired games, this is also for you.The GUI is silky, the AI is cunning, and it looks fabulous -- which last is rare for a game of this kind. The interface makes it easy for newcomers, and it's bloody hard, making it lovely for verterans. Novices would be well served by picking up the Red Turn DLC, as it's about the Soviets curb stomping the Wehrmacht in the later years of the war, and the scenarios are a little bit easier than the ones in the base game.I've been playing turn-based wargames like this since I was a kid in the 80s, and I can say without reservation this is the best one I have ever played. Go up and buy it.			"

												Do not buy this thinking it is a strategy game. A strategy game lets you explore many different paths to victory against an opponent that is reacting to you. You can create your own strategy to beat the enemy. This game on the other hand, is more like a puzzle game.The units are set up in predetermined positions. The AI is extremely passive and just reacts to the very few outcomes you can do by scripting. The AI stands absolutely no chance in a fair fight. The only reason why the campaign is so hard is because you are usually extremely outnumbered, you have a limited number of turns to get your objective and the supply line mechanic is designed so you are at a disadvantage as an attacker. Combined with the extremely closed scenarios, the AI just reacts to your predictable movements with strategies scripted by the designer. I frankly do not find any fun in that.TL;DR This is not a strategy game. It is a puzzle game where you play against the level designer to beat a level in a few turns with an overwhelming disadvantage. If you like that and pretty graphics, try this game. Otherwise stay clear of it.			"

												Even after few years, this game is so fresh and enjoyable to play. Its quite easy to learn basics and quite hard to master, I d reccomend it to any WW2 fan. I must note that reviews of the players who spent cca 10 hours in this game are rubbish, cause game is much more complex than written in reviews. Amazing thing about this game is that it doesnt have only operational side of the war gaming and one can easily notify strategic side of each map. Due to this, multiplayer games are never the same, or even similar, which constantly adds fresh flavour of this game. Defo one of the best&most realistic ww2 strategies, only object I have is relatively small community of players. Cant wait for new games from Uzelac& company :)			"

												If you've never played a turn-based, operational-level strategy game before, this is the best starting point. The intuitive UI and the kind of cartoony art assets make for a game that feels very inviting. However, this game is hard, but in a good way. Your onus as the player is to be clever, to examine the situation and find weak points in your enemy's defenses and assess risk and reward. You end up thinking like a World War 2 general after you play a little bit, and that's really cool.			"

												Bought it on sale, trusting the so many positive reviews, and the ""that's just like panzer general"" gimmick.After a few games, I lost interest and can say I would not recommend.disclaimer : I play mostly offline. The 1.3 hours are not accurate. Pros :- supply lines are the best feature of the game. You need to protect yours, strengthen your salients while piercing the frontline, extend with caution when the front has collapsed, and it's very rewarding to pocket enemies. It adds a real layer of tactical depth to the game.- suppression and weakening of units is nicely implemented.- and that's about itCons :- No fog of war : all units (and their strength, and type) are always visible, not matter how far they are, even in forests or with bad weather. Why you would remove such a critical (both historically and gameplay-wise) element is beyond me.- Passive AI, challenging only because of the usually tight turn limit : seems programmed only to make you miss the ""brilliant victory"", which is incredibly tough to get (needs perfect play and weather : no hex wasted, luck in all rgn fights). If you don't care about ""brilliant victories"", there's no challenge once you've mastered the basic rules. On my real first try at the ""Black turn"" campaign, I had all decisive victory except for Moscow, where the (random) weather  pinned my offensive for so many turns. The real game in ""Unity of Command"" might as well be about  ""getting 100% brillant"". The problem is that the game is not satisfying and rewarding enough for me to care. It's simply not good enough.- meagre gameplay : that's what made the game quickly repetitive and boring. You don't control your airforce, you don't control your artillery, there's no naval force, did not see paratroops... meaning your panel of actions and tactical choices each turn is very limited : thick ground, and that's it. You can't combine the way PG let you combine 20+ years ago, or build these fat infantry/flak/artillery mutually defending clusters.- The game lacks the entrenchment ""finesse"" of the old PG : entrenched units had and could be softened/suppressed/peeled in different manners, while in Unity of Command it's binary : resists/breaks through the use of a specialist unit, of sheer force. It might as well be a justified by the fast pace the developers intended to give their game (most battles must be resolved in 5-6 turns), but it's a poor choice, as it makes the game more arid.- no real campaign (as it seems to be) : defeat means game over, normal or decisive victory lead to the same results. No branching.Could be wrong though, as I never achieved brilliant victories in campaign (couldn't be arsed).- no deployment : even in campaign mode, the starting positions of all units are predetermined : really absurd, and twice. First, if I'm Zukhov or Paulus, why am I tied to the choices of other Zukhov or Paulus ? Second, since you can't place your units were you want, you can't use where needed the units you previously overstrengthened or augmented with a specialist token. Meaning the huge amounts of prestige spent doing so are used to their full potential only during the battle you did it.- music is generic and unatmospheric at best. Best muted.- etc.Could go on with the consUoC could have been so much more enjoyable.A real disappointment.			"

												I love this game, but it should be made clear that it is NOT a strategic or tactical combat simulator like games such as Panzer General. I think that many users dislike the game because they have mistaken it for a tactical combat simulator, which is just not the case. It is instead an Operational warfare simulator where the destruction of enemy units and control of the map are less important than creating and exploiting breakthroughs in enemy lines, disrupting the enemy's and protecting your own supply lines and sparingly deploying your reserve forces. Because the game focuses on the Operational level of warfare, it is entirely possible to win a decisive victory without destroying the enemy's army if you pay attention to maneuver and logistics. You will actually be punished for throwing your forces into a full blown assault in an attempt to destroy their forces or control the entire map because the AI prioritizes logistics and maneuver, and because the scenarios have a very short turn limit. I recommend this game but do NOT mistake it for a tactical combat simulator. This is not Panzer General; winning takes careful planning and attention to factors that other strategy games downplay or leave out all-together.			"

Even though this is not an easy game and has more depth then it looks at first glance it is easy to get into the game thanks to a good tutorial and intuitive UI.If you like Stratego and chess then I highly recommend to pick this game up!

The user interface is perfection and does not take up 40% of the screen like other strategy games.  I love that you can see the risk involved in your attack moves beforehand so your can approach conflicts in your own way.   Really like the combined arms play and excellent balance.  Love the theater of war moves, the complexity of logistics, and sharp background music.  Replayabilty is very satisfying.  Greatly detailed manual as well. Highly recommend!			"

												If you've ever whiled away an hour or nine playing 'hex wargames' -- those things that a great many gamers used to play back in those dim, dark and distant years BC (before computers), the ones with paper maps, cardboard cut-out unit counters, thick rulebooks, charts and random number generators (RNGs) called 'dice': you're in for a treat with Unity of Command (UoC).UoC: Stalingrad Campaign elicits in me strong memories of many such happy hours playing 'Battle for Stalingrad' by Simulations Publications Inc (SPI) back in my teens. I used to lose to my mate Roland -- a lot. But I always came back for more :)Of all the games I've played recently, Unity of Command has possibly the best potential for true longevity -- if it develops into a framework for folks to make their own wargames.

												As a Military Historian and a fan of Strategy games I can say without a doubt that this game is worth the buy, especially with the DLC. This is the most realistic WWII game I have played. Every decision you make has a consequence and that powerful armored thrust that you think will win you the battle, can suddenly turn on you when they're cut off and surrounded making your job even harder. This game gets so much right when it comes to being a general. You have to plan 2-5 moves ahead so you can not only find the proper strategy but outsmart a THINKING AI.			"

												I was really missing Panzer General series and its operational level simulation. This game delivered but also gave me something new. The main innovation, suppy lines, has a big effect. One must think about encirclement and weak points instead of wiping out every unit in one's path. It's also important not to leave your supply lines exposed as having them disrupted even once can mean the difference between victory and defeat.The mechanics are fairly easy to master and the game can tell you how many units you can expect to destroy/lose in any given encounter. There are many interactions to consider (terrain, weather, entrenchment) and since its an operational level game you can be winning individual shootouts yet lose the big battle because you are acting too carefully. The game takes about 20 hours to fully master but provides replay value as you can try to win every battle with a brilliant victory or just try a slightly different approach.Unlike PG you can finish each scenario in one sitting. The size of the maps is pretty manageable. There's no such diversity of units as in that game but I didn't really miss it. Ultimately the most interesting thing about the game is making decisions of how many units to commit, where and for how long and doing it all without outrunning your supply lines, often this requires coordination between units.My two complaints are: the AI is a little weak, enough to provide a challenge but not enough to really surprise you and often committing foolish errors; the other is that battles can only be played in a pretty strict sequence. So if you finish a campaign and want to replay a battle from near the beginning, the later battles will become inaccessible.I loved the game enough to buy all the expansions and play them through several times.My wish for the game would be that units carried over somehow. It was great to see my units in PG progress from green to elite and encouraged me to be careful and avoid throwing units into meatgrinders. Although bashing at a city while suffereing bad losses in order to achieve your objective is often needed in UoC and is an interesting part of the game since it forces you to take risks.I'm still looking for a game that would combine this kind of battle simulation with an economic simulation since as they say WWII was won in the factories.

												Unity of Command and it's DLC's Red and Black turn are some of the best games I've ever played. The campaigns are difficult, hell I failed the ones rated easy quite a few times, and even then I have never been able to get a brilliant victory on them. You alone must find a way to circumvent or smash your way through the enemy forces and capture the objectives. However, the AI will not take this lying down. You wipe out half their units and are close to grabbing the objective, and they wipe out your suppressed Panzer Divison because you thought it would be a good idea to smash 3 different Mechanised Corps and open the way for your infantry divisons to surround those 2 tank diviosn that are in a nearly unassaliable position, and then strikes right into your supply chain, You have 1 turn to get your supply chain back, and by then they've repositioned their defences around the objective.To quote X-COM""Good Luck, Commander""			"

												Did you play ""Panzer Genaral"" back in the good old days?If the answer is yes, this will bring back very fond memories.Its a tactical wargame that works with hexes (altough sadly, no nato markers).Very simple explained: You have units and there are turns, you have objectives to take, and the way you do it is up to you. The faster you are, the better. There is a campagin and scenarios. The game is easy to learn and quick to get into.It has obviously not the depht of a grand strategy game like ""Hearts of Iron"", but thats not what it aims for, its just about the battles, and this it does very well. There are aspects like supply and airstrikes, and also resource points (prestige) for reinforcments. Overall this is historically quite accurate, down to the unit names and battle lines. Graphically it is very well drawn and nicely animated, sounds are good as well.If you have a drop of strategy gamer blood in you, you should buy and play this right now. Its worth every cent! =)			"

												So. Unity of Command. A little strategy game set around Operation Barbarossa which harkons back to the old days of strategy gaming where you didn't need the reflexes of a four year old on a sugar rush. Very beginner friendly, but not so much in skill required to play. As much as you might feel the desire to charge towards Leningrad and damn every Soviet who stands in your way, I'm afraid you'll have to hold your horses there. There's just a bit more to this little gem that just clicking and attacking. You must manage your supply lines which stretch so many tiles from the the rail lines and supply depots. Along with trying to not be too reckless with your panzer and infantry brigades as you only have so many reinforcements you can call in. However, with careful use of units, supply management and using your dive bombers and bridging units to full affect, you should be well on the road to victory. Oh, and the music is priceless. The couple of tracks which loop over, will send shivers down your spine. If a piece of music doesn't portray the hard slog the Soviets and Germans endured on the Eastern Front, then I have no idea what does. Easily worth the £14.99 price tag.			"

												A nice tbs game, a lot like panzer general.Differences:- there's unit supply to take into account- there are  less unit types, however there are attachments to units- the campaigns and scenarios are all on the eastern front- air support is mission based, there are no aircraft unitsThe interface is simple and the game looks simple enough, but it's quite challenging.You must not let the enemy cut you your supplies, you must keep your units supplied and you must advance fast!Against:- there are to few campaigns - only 4 (with the dlcs)- the game doesn't integrate well with steam, you can't access steam within the game nor take screenshots.- you can't play more than one campaign at the same timeAll in all it's an interesting game despite its limitations.UPDATE:I found out that saving campaigns is quite easy, using the Load Game/Open saved games folder and copying the folder in windows.Uploading screenshots from windows to steam is also possible but more complicated.

												Though it has quite a bit of a learning curve, Unity of Command is an excellent turn-based strategy game, and is very realistic in the sense that spamming infantry simply won't work if you opponent is well set-up. The Supply Line feature is also very realistic. While it allows you to potentially thrust deep into enemy territory along the railroads, any enemy presence on those lines will cut off supply.The game is good for both a defensive and offensive strategy, where units can entrench themselves, making a line of them near-impenetrable even with tanks, or by equiping your units with ""specialists,"" or specific units, such as StuGs, T-34s, or Engineers, you can give them a huge advantage on the frontline. But above all, my favorite feature is the one that urges you to minimize loss of life. If a unit is destroyed, the overall morale will drop, and your troops will be less inclined to stand their ground.Overall, this is a strong choice if you want a turn-based strategy game.			"

												This game is by far one of the best strategic games I have ever played. I am in love with it.The soundtrack gave me goosebumps and sent chills down my spine. The game can be played without a tutorial; it's that simple. I seriously hope they make more additions to this, perhaps a North Africa or a Pacific add-on.			"

												A solid intermediate entry into logistical and strategic wargaming, with both beautiful and clean assets and a foreboding soundtrack. Yes, this might appear to be like many other board or video game strategic wargames. What separates Unity of Command, however, is the cat and mouse aspects of defending your own supply line while simultaneously attacking your opponents, to prevent your troops from running out of supplies (ammo, clothes, food, one would assume) while taking away these necessities from your opponent, giving you the advantage. Without saying much more and probably repeating what others have said, UoC is one of those games that appear simple on the surface -- youu load the deceptively small game, play through the tutorial, and then load up the campaign or scenarios hitting the ground running -- but after your first and second round you begin to realize that it will be hard to master. Sure, the initial handful of scenarios are easy, even for the relative genre newbie, but the difficulty begins to quickly ramp up, never treating you with kids gloves. It is important to note that the game is difficult without being unfair, or using cheats to compensate for lackluster AI: you won't find those problems here. All of the aforementioned, should be noted, sits pleasantly under one of the most pleasing UI design choices in any wargame I've seen. Like the game itself, the art direction and UI can be summed up as simple, effective, and beautiful. This relatively inexpensive game will serve you with many hours of fun for a long time. Definite thumbs up from moi! :)			"

												Impressive strategy game. You command either the Soviet or German forces on the European eastern front of WW2. The game is accurate to history reagarding the sequencing of Stalingrad, and a perfect way to carry out the battle as you may seem fit. But remember the game is just that: Stalingrad with surrounding skirmishes, and nothing but that.The combat is comparable to Civilization V's: hexagons with finite movement for units. The main difference between Unity and Civ's combat systems, however, is the logistic behavior. Units have supply gauges that change with the availability of resources, toggled by supply line efficiency. Of course, if the enemy captures a section of your supply line, it will not be efficient for you! So a main component of the game's objective is supply line management, a category of logistics.One might think that this game is simply strategy combat, and therefore boring. Within an hour of gameplay, that person can testify otherwise. The dynamic weather/landscape and intelligent AI kept me engaged for sure; the enemy always has something brewing in the pot. You can notice its strategy, often focusing on your weak and vulnerable units to find a path to your supply line. Other times it makes deliberate retreats when you do that same thing to them. It's truly captivating.If you are interested in a microcosm of Civ V's combat and then some, this is the game for you. Nothing daunting, just casual strategy fun. 9/10			"

												I'm really enjoying this game currently. It's perfect for me because each map takes a little less than an hour, so I can still get some excellent strategy in a limited amount of time, or chain together several battles when there's more time. The game is like a tabletop wargame but with all the benefits that a computer can bring. The game isn't quite as random as another reviewer mentioned as long as you become very familiar with your units and their various strengths and weaknesses. Beyond pure armor versus infantry, you can add modifications to your units like recon, artillery, and motorized. With the right combination of units, good planning, and just a tiny bit of luck, it's definitely possible to score brilliant victories (which are very satisfying, as the time limits are very tight and totally unforgiving).The historical accuracy of the game is excellent, and is strictly adhered too--it's a game that's more about the strategy of a specific battle than a 'map painting' game like EU4. The game is also not about logistics, which is enjoyable in this context. Someday, a WWII game may come along that makes logistics enjoyable and also can do battlefield strategy, but until then, I'll play CIV when I want to build a giant army and then be bored for two hours while the computer fails to execute the most basic defense, and I'll play this game when I want a tactical challenge.

												After well over one hundred hours invested, I can say I highly recommend Unity of Command to any gamer that likes strategy games. My congratulations and thanks to those that made this game for getting their history right. The individual divisions and corps that are in the battles in this game were in the actual battles as well, along with the correct opposing generals. Those involved in making Unity of Command really did their homework!! As a newbie, I appreciate the individual scenarios starting 'easy' and working their way up to difficult. It allowed me to learn the game, although for an old man, those 'easy' senarios were anything but. The game is well thought out. Like the real Eastern Front campaign, you fight the weather, supply lines, terrain and the Russians with panzer, motorized and infantry divisions. The original game features the Stalingrad campaign, the DLC features the Russian offensives of 1944, with additional DLC taking on the 1941 German invasion of Russia. My favorite is Operation Typhoon, the battle for Moscow. Like Field Marshall von Bock, you command six entire armies and over two million men, the largest land force under one commander in history. Unity of Command is a strategy video game and chess with panzer divisions all in one. It's challenging, frustrating, addicting, but most of all, it's fun. I highly recommend it!!			"

												An overlooked gem of WW2 strategy games. Really hits a sweet-spot of 'Not too shallow, not too deep"" that is all too rare in this genre. (See also the Decisive Campaigns games -- more complex than UoC to be sure, but not overwhelming a la GG's War in the East.)Unity of Command is *not* Panzer Corps / Panzer General -- decent games in their own right, but very Beer & Pretzels without much complexity. UoC makes for a far more interesting challenge, taking into account the importance of logistics/supply, giving a historically accurate order of battle on the divisional/corps level in a series of well-designed, historically informed scenarios.The devs deserve a lot of credit for design concept. UoC is an elegant WW2 wargame -- stylish, pleasing to the eye, easy to understand and functional UI -- that more 'grognard' game designers could well afford to take a lesson or two from.			"

												I've played most of the first campaign (finished 11 of 13 battles). It's just not a lot of fun though.- Crushing time limits. You have to push, push, push every turn. There's no measure advance possible in any of the scenarios. No time to manuever troops in any real way to try and take advantage of a speed or terrain advantage.- Almost pointless reinforcement. The cost to add steps to a single unit chews up nearly your entire alotment. It's such a tiny drop in the bucket it serves almost no purpose.- Crushing randomness. I'll have a factor 2 advantage, preview says 1 loss for them 0 for me. Actual results, 1 for them 3 for me. This happens constantly. Some randomness is expected, but the deviations are incredibly severe.- Cutting off supply is great, but the time limits are so severe by the time you manage it there's barely enough turns left to matter.

												This game is fantastic. One of the better strategy games ever made.It is a challenging and very rewarding game. There are no difficulty levels in this game. You can choose whether you want to go for Brilliant Victory withouth spending on reinforcements or not. You can always come back and try a different approach, maybe with reinforcements just for fun. Weather is randomized and dice roll is involved so scenarios will play out differently every time. This makes the game fun and not predictable, unless you are going for Brilliant Victory.Then there is the multiplayer against these four star generals around the globle :) Hit me up with a game, I'll most likely do it.Yes, so the supply system is basically what makes this game so good when it comes to other strategy games. It by far is one of the best game mechanic implemented in to the strategy games ever. Supply is everything in this game, your breakthroughs, your chances to win come from supply. AI will swiftly punish you for your mistakes and cut off your supply, some times even too eagerly by committing too much instead of retreating. This will make some scenarios look kind of silly but I love the fact that my mistakes will be punished in this game more than anything else.I love the way this game looks, 2D art is absolutely stellar. Love the sound desing and even though music is just three tracks ""short"", I find them to create the athmosphere this game needs. Music is awesome and if that is not enough you can easily play something from youtube or whatever.I highly recommend this game, in my opinion this is one of those very special games.			"

												I've played nearly every WW2 strategy game there is, from the classic (Panzer General) to the endlessly complex (Hearts of Iron), and I can safely say that Unity of Command finds a niche as a fun, accessible strategy game focused on the 1942-43 Campaign on the Eastern Front. I like this game a lot.Unity of Command is simple to learn and fairly fast-paced. You can sit down and run a scenario in 10-15 minutes if you want. The graphics are simple, but they function well and everything is very smooth. It's very easy to keep track of individual units based on their veteran status and nationality.This is really a game about logistics and prioritizing targets. The absolute most important thing to do in every scenario is keep your supply lines open and, if possible, cut the enemy's. Everything else is secondary to that. The AI does not care about what might happen in the theoretical future; it will send suicidal attacks your way if it means cutting your supply for even one turn, because losing that turn means losing your chance at a brilliant or decisive victory. This can be frustrating, and I would often sit here and think ""What, really, all these soldiers are going to march to their deaths with absolutely no chance of survival? They just cut *themselves* off from supply too! Idiots!"" Yes. They will. Every time. The AI is doing what it's designed to do.My only gripes with the game are that several of the later scenarios are almost entirely dependent on luck to achieve a 'Brilliant' victory necessary to unlock certain scenarios. Granted, the historical probability of these scenarios is almost zero, but that shouldn't excuse forcing the player to execute a rote strategy again and again until the dice fall his way. Because each unit's strength is represented only by up to 7 (and usually 4-5) points, having the odds fall against you just slightly completely alters the timeline of your attacks. I don't mind having to replay a scenario multiple times and being forced to try new strategies - that's part of the genre, after all - but sometimes Unity of Command drags this out a bit too much. The replay value isn't great, but mastering the campaign and the DLC should take you no less than 12-15 hours, and the online function adds some value.All in all, a highly polished little strategy game.

												This is an intensely innovative successor to the original Panzer General game.  It's an extraordinary game, blending together a number of simple and straight-forward mechanics to come up with a masterful strategy title.  Competent AI and tight scenario-design make this a simple game that will keep even the deepest strategy game nerds challenged for a long time!Pros:+ The basic combat system is only a tiny bit more complicated than Panzer General.+ The addition of changing weather and the introduction of simple-but-elegant supply rules introduce a whole different level of complexity to the now-so-familiar ""You have X turns to take Objectives Y and Z"" game design.+ The campaign format for stitching together scenarios is novel but intriguing.  You can ""save spam"" each scenario and replay it until you get the ""Perfect Victory"" every time, but you can also just play each scenario as it comes and see how well you might have done were you the commander of the whole campaign.+ This is not a computer opponent you can sleep on.  The AI is fiendishly good, especially when it comes to cutting my supply routes at just the wrong time.  If there are exploits for the AI, I've not found them!Cons:- There is no continuity from scenario to scenario.  You don't get to follow your units as they level up and grow in power.- You may get more experienced units in the next scenario, but their stats will have no relationship to where they were or what they did in the previous scenario.- This is still a ""puzzle game"", like Panzer General and so many of the other hex-driven, turn-based strategy games out there.  It offers more complexity than most such games (i.e., there are usually more ways to win a scenario), but if you don't like solving puzzles, you'll likely find some of the scenarios a bit tedious.- It exclusively focuses on the Eastern Front (not a problem for many, but it makes me sad!).

This is a deceptively simple yet elegant game, especially when you add the black and red add ons.  As advertised this is an operational level wargame with no economy or technology features.

												With all the preference for grand strategy games that include every aspect it's good to see a company going 'back to basics'. That doesn't mean that the game is dumbed down but just that it uses the essential elements (combat and supply lines) and in addition keeps the scenarios to a manageable level.This also means it's far easier to understand how to play the game - there's nothing more frustrating than coming back to a game after a few months and realising that you've forgot how to play it - and scenarios can be completed in an hour not a week.As with any strategy game there is the question of how's the AI? The answer, fortunately, is relatively good. No it won't put up a good as a fight as a human opponent and like most AIs it's much better in defence than attack but it with give you a challenging game without having to resort to artificial help.If you like turn based war games that are stream-lined ensuring it's a war-game then this comes highly recommended and there's also two DLC's to keep you happy afterwards.

												One of the most addictive games I've played in a while. Not too complicated to get into and enjoy. The real challenge comes from trying to work to a ""brilliant victory"" by capturing each objective within the alloted time.Random weather conditions affect supply lines and movement distance. It's a nice mechanic that offers variation each time a map is played - but it can be frustrating when you've spent the past hour trying to capture Moscow in time and your reinforcements get bogged down in mud. AI reflects the strategy of the time, and is pretty ruthless when you leave supply lines unguarded.Well worth buying, plenty of replay value. "

												The developers really managed to capture the essence of tactical combat with this game - whether one wants to call this a puzzle game or a wargame is irrelevant - UoC and its expansions are very entertaining and offer very different types of challenges.Mechanically speaking the game is very simple: every unit has an attack and a defense stat, and a number of ""action"" points - when these are removed (by being attacked) the unit is destroyed. Campaign is played in independent scenarios, so your units do not carry over from mission to mission (which in my opinion is great so I can focus on tactical combat and not in overall strategy).What really makes the scenarios interesting is the concept of supply - when an unit is out of supply in the battlefield for a few turns, its action points become suppressed, which makes it much more vulnerable to attacks. This creates a nice dynamic when playing Soviet scenarios for example, where your individual units are much weaker than the German ones, so you must make do by cutting supply lines.My only minor, minor complaints:1) You cannot play more than one campaign simultaneously;2) The in-game UI is fine, but menus outside the main battle interface have buttons that are a bit too small, and it is quite easy to wipe out a campaign if you are not careful;3) No steam achievements			"

												An outstanding game. My number one recommendation is to try the demo - that way you'll see if the gameplay is for you. After that you'll probably wonder if it is worth the money - I mean, some scenarios only consist of 6 turns! Well, those 6 turns will take you half an hour, and you'll probably fail, and have to try again and again!			"

												Proper wargames are rare to find on Steam. UoC is a fairly traditional, hex-based, operational-level game. It stays true to its gaming roots while bringing a level of polish and approachability that is necessary to appeal to less intense players. In addition to being a solid wargame that is already benefiting from great DLC, this could easily serve as a sufficient ""gateway"" for people to jump into more complex titles like The Operational Art of War series or even, if one desires to punish oneself, War in the East. Undoubtedly worth the price. Hope to see more from this studio - and sooner rather than later.			"

												A good turn-based strategy in the line of Panzer General. It has some flaws:- dumb, unrealistic AI- no difficulty level modification- not possible to save during a scenario, not possible to play two campaigns at the same time- encircling enemy unit does not give you attacking bonuses- attacking enemy unit from multiple sides does not give you additional bonus- very little randomness during battle- no separate units of artillery, anti-tank, aircraft- some minor absurds in supply/territory controlOnce you get passed through them, the game becomes very enjoyable and quite addictive.

												Before I say every positive things about this game, I have to say one thing:The game's tutorial and manuals are ♥♥♥♥ing LAZY. They never tell you enough about the mechanics, they never specify how each mechanics would affect the units. So many things are untold abou this game in tutorial and manual that it makes player to give up the game entirely before they get the hang of it. The Devs should've included more thoughtful introduction to this game for sure. While the ones who developed might see it as ""obvious,"" to people who are going into this game the ♥♥♥♥♥ that computer throws at the player is infuriating to say the least.Now that's out of the way, don't let my rant about the tutorial make yourself hesitant to purchase this game. There are many ""strategic"" games available in Steam store, but there are so few that actually makes you think for turns. Most of the ""strategic games"" either encourages player to ""turtle up"" or go ""berserk"" (Yes, I'm looking at you Valkyria Chronicles and XCOM). However, neither strategy is viable in this game. You truly have to play in a way that you maintain both offense and defense so that you can spearhead to exploit enemy weakness and protect your supply lines. You know, like real war. What makes this game truly unique is the importance of supply line. So many war games neglect the idea of logistics or oversimplify that application in Unity of Command is quite refreshing. As General Robert H. Barrow said, amateurs talk about tactics, but professionals study logistics. True that. It makes you think for everything. This game is literally for those who wants more than just tactical sim. This game is truly a masterful strategy game.p.s. If you see the ""negative"" reviews, most of them are under 5 hrs. This ties in to my initial rant. Because the game doesn't tell you about it's mechanics to the player, those who couldn't understand thinks game moves at random, or things just don't make sense. It took me good 5~10 hrs to get complete grasp of the game, and now I can win most of the scenarios without any problem.			"

												Unity of Command is a fantastic game which deserves more publicity. It's polished and quite easy to learn, but with lots of depth. The supply system is probably the defining game mechanic: you advance and take territory but if the enemy manages to surround you or cut off road/rail links those advancing units will eventually be stopped in their tracks. The thrill of breaking through the enemy's lines and strangling superior forces this way will keep you playing for hours. The AI does a really good job of exploiting weaknesses and adjusting to your tactics, so the experience doesn't get old. If you've ever enjoyed a turn based strategy game, get this!			"

												Deep but accessable; strategic but simple. a great strategy game depicting battles between the germans and soviets in a board game style. the hotseat is particularly fun, and it is very easy to get friends that might not be into these types of games, to play with you, because its not over complicated. even with this increased accessability, it has a lot of features that hardcore wargamers will enjoy. the AI is top notch, and reacts dynamically to your actions. you can not just stupidly run your units into a death trap and expect to ram them through with sear force, you will probably die. instead, its better to pick specific units to attack at certain places, with others move ahead and fill in gaps. also, both sides have their strengths and weaknesses. the game is very well put together, and it has a lot of different scenarios for you to choose from, especially if you make the decision to purchase the DLC packs. bottom line, i highly recommend this game. its got a great single player AI, and the accessability of the game makes it wonderful to bring in newbies to play with. its almost like a wargame chess. easy to learn, hard to master, and certain pieces fill certain roles.

												Epic Game In short if you like tactical/strategic thinking (without a time limit), where supply matters (cutting off the enemy weakens them, but they can do that to you as well), then you are in luck. This game provides some real depth to this genre, without getting so complex you can't play. recommend giving the manual a quick review, but otherwise, you can pick up and play and then just figure it out as you play. Oh and one other thing...the AI in this game is sneaky and devious. Leave a weakness in your front line? AI will exploit. Unit alone? enemy will focus and destroy it. This game punishes you for mistakes..but well if you lose in this game...you deserve it as it will be the result of an error you made. The only caveat to that is weather...it reduces your supply and such and can starve your army. I am kind of on the fence about this one game mechanic. it is a real pain in the butt to have my offensive stopped cold by random weather...that said it is still doable, just harder. However, this is in keeping with WW2 realism...one of the reasons the nazi's couldn't take russia was the weather, so it makes sense it has an impact in a historical game. Also, if you are anal about doing things perfectly, you can just reload your match if you get crappy weather and hope rngesus doesn't give you a blizzard at turn 5 again. Ultimatley, this game combines many different facets (realism, historical accuracy, rewards planning and strategic thinking etc, but more importantly, it is really fun. It is hard to get perfect on your runs, but it is doable, and even just doing the map in the maximum amount of turns will feel like an accomplishment. Just remember this game is like chess...think things through or your opponent (in this case the AI) will punish you.  "

												Unity of Command is a simplified strategic turn-based look into the eastern fronit during WW2 - similar in many ways to the classic Panzer General, while adding some fresh ideas of its own (such as the concept of supply, which enables increasingly realistic maneuverig in the spirit of the historical blitzkrieg. Having said that, the game also suffers somewhat from oversimplification, repetitiveness and rigidity. When considering buying the game, consider:Pros:-Easy to get into, yet challenging enough to try and master-Some tactical planning and thinking required, luck and chance is involved so there is some variety in gameplay.-Quite immersive, the total seems more than the sum of its parts.Cons:-The AI seems quite simple: you make a certain set of moves and it always reacts similarly.-Unrealistic winning objectives - sacrifice your army simply to gain possession of a few winning hexes for one turn and you suddenly have ""won""?-No air units available-Only scenarios where offensive is to be taken (AI lacks the ability to launch a coherent offensive?) - some defensive scenarios would be welcome-""Brilliant victories"" often depend on chance (e.g., chancing in-game weather), yet proceeding in the campaign in some cases requires such victories - the game therefore makes you grind several scenarios over and over again.-The scenarios always start the same - some alterate starting positions would be welcome for variety.-After you win the campaign, there's a smiple ""Campaign completed"" message and nothing else - really?-Music can get repetitive and the graphics are not the selling point of the game.Overall, I tend to recommend the game for people interested in the topic and looking for some easy-to-get-into strategy gaming - not at the level of Metacritic (average 84/100), but rather at the level of the user reviews (7.2/10).In other words, it's quite ok.

Simple core mechanics and well-explained inputs mean you can jump into this game and learn as you play. It also does a fantastic job of systemizing the units it's portraying, and showing the importance of elements like weather and supply chains to war, something other games sorely avoid. However be prepared, this game is hard, and the AI is spectacularly ruthless. After a few attempts I avoid the campaign mode as my skills aren't cut out for it, opting for the non-persistant skirmishes instead.

The base game includes the Stalingrad campaign from both the Soviet and Axis perspective, but the DLC adds in Operation Barbarossa and the Soviet resurgence from 1943 to 1945.  The gameplay mechanics are simple but elegant, and the AI is solid but with a few quirks.

												A very good and deep wargame. Enjoyed the Soviet campaign, haven't played as Germans though as it would be rather painful to replay the attack on my country and capturing it.The specialist arms system, whereby a unit can be assigned an additional weapon, is ingenious. Sometimes it was a game-changer! I also appreciate the well-timed missions. Sometimes it took me many attempts to clear the objectives in time, but I enjoyed trying nevertheless.Overall, a great game, if only a bit short, even with all DLCs. A couple more campaigns would be just perfect, but then I don't and probably won't play as German.The historical accuracy is almost complete, and the real tactics may be traced in that the in-game Soviets have to pave their way with bodies of their own, as they get a lot of infantry and often not much more, and almost every German unit is here superior to a corresponding Russian one, the Soviets just have more men to dispose of. The real campaigns, according to the best accounts, were fought just like that.			"

												UPDATE:  After 210 hours, I finally completed all the campaigns. I can't believe it requires a Brilliant Victory to advance in some of the scenarios.---After over 100 hrs of play, I finally completed an entire campaign (Russia 1943 - 1945).  As many others have said, this is a very difficult game due to the time constraints in the scenarios and having to hit specific marks to unlock remaining scenarios.  I still haven't gotten more than four scenarios into the German Stalingrad campaign before being brought to a halt.The AI is unforgiving in most situations, but will leap at the chance to capture one of your supply sources.  I've used that to let the AI grab a supply source with its most capable units, then swung around behind and trapped it there while the rest of my forces go for the objectives.I'm also not thrilled with German units sitting in cities, completely surrounded, out of supply until all steps are suppressed and they can still repulse attacks from all six sides.  Very frustrating.Still, I continue to play and see if I can beat some of the scenarios I've never succeeded at.			"

												I've never come across a strategy game which featured AI quite so capable of inflicting a  sudden defeat when that hard-fought-for victory seemed in the bag. Just now, for example, an elite German motorised unit made an audacious and successful bid to recapture an objective with the result that I ran out of time to win the scenario.It is this emphasis on protecting supply lines as well as captured objectives  that makes Unity of  Command a unique, tense and thoroughly enjoyable experience. It is essential to understand the mechanics behind this to have any chance of succeeding. In particular, defending railway lines through your territory is crucial to keeping combat units in fighting condition at the front line. Even then, most of the scenarios are carefully balanced to give you just enough turns and units to win.The only significant weakness is the structure of the campaign itself. Units are not carried over and the scenarios themselves feel a little disjointed. The campaigning element is represented in terms of ""prestige points"" which are earned for capturing objectives within a certain number of turns. These prestige points can be used in subsequent scenarios to purchase additional units. Individual scenarios can be played and, although I haven't properly tried it out yet, the scenario editor seems intuitive and powerful. I can't vouch for the two DLCs, and whether they bring anything new in terms of mechanics, because I haven't got round to playing them yet.Overall, this is an absorbing, challenging and refreshing take on turn-based wargaming and deserves a place in the collection of any strategy player interested in the period.

												This game is simple in its mechanics, and thus not very hard to learn, but boy it has difficulty. The AI doesn't mind just throwing units in your face to stop the armored onslaught, and still manages to have enough in reserve to stop you once you break through. But this difficulty makes it so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ satisfying when you finally get that last objective.In short, this game will make you like having your brains overheated. 9/10 will definitely buy any expansions that follow.

												It's alright, but more of a sort of puzzle game than a real strategy game and it HEAVILY relies on random chance. I've had fast wins because a couple of my units got repeatedly hammered without retreating and long grinds because a good plan was foiled by a 'veteran' panzer unit retreating from minor damage. It's more often than it should be up to how much the game decides to randomly gift you or screw you over, not whether or not you do something clever.Air strike damage, damage attacking units recieve/dish out, whether or not retreats/overruns occur or even whether or not damaged units are killed or not (there's 'suppressed' where part of a units strength is temporary removed and 'KIA' where that strength is just wiped out) is all random. I get this is likely meant to represent the general randomness of battle and the impossibility of a commander accuractely predicting all results but at the same time the game goes entirely against that, showing you the strength, addons and statuses of all friendly and enemy units on the entire map at all times. Like some 'strategy' games the RNG is basically there to pad things out and mask a lack of real depth to the gameplay (hey, Darkest Dungeon), rather than offering interesting variation within gameplay already featuring a wide variety of options (hey, XCOM:EU, also in that and similar games there are ways to force certain outcomes, such as guaranteed damage abilities).At least in the main two campaigns there's only one real gamemode, 'capture these things within X amount of turns' and the only bonus objectives are doing that within a stricter amount of turns. Objective defence or target assassination scenarios for instance would've been fairly easy to implement and could've been great additions. Some proper side objectives, even just stuff like 'win without using air support' or 'destroy all enemy armour' would've been great too and added some more replayability.The main good parts are that it's well presented with a good looking map and well functioning UI, it's easy to get into (though that's largely because of the lack of depth) and relatively cheap. This review is overall a positive one because it ultimately suits its cost (especially considering what shallow crap can come with a $60+ price tag these days).If they'd gone for way more depth, more units, more abilities, more objectives and more meaningful decisions with less random outcomes rather than hiding what is honestly pretty simple gameplay under tons of RNG then it would've been a great game rather than just a good one.

												If you are a fan of strategy games I highly recomment this one. It is a lot of fun and can be challenging to complete objectives within the specific amount of turns. Replaying missions allows you to try pushing through at different points which may lead to breaking through and encircling enemy forces and cutting them off from supplies, or could lead to you trying to charge forward with armor and mobile infantry to reach further into enemy territory. Just watch your supply lines. Air supply drops, air strikes etc can help offer up more variety in missions.The basics are easy to grasp and if you are new or curious about these types of games this is the perfect place to start. The games offers more than just basic movement, such as air strikes, entrenching troops to give them a defensive bonus etc.Stop reading this and go buy it!			"

												A caucious recommendation. This game has a lot potential and I hope the devs will bring out a sequel with some of the most annoying negative points (that where already covered in depth in other reviews) out of the way. Below is a list of negative pointsBut first I want to point out that all the rest is great - I like the style, the idea behind the combat system, the strategic and tactic behind it all, etc. Near everything else not mentioned fits. Also, if one wants a decent or even great WW2 turn-based strategy game one should support this however possible.tl;dr its hard mostly because of randomness in combination with the turn limit- missions where one can not progress the campaign with a regular victory -> when reaching set goals the game should progress, do not punish me for just being okay one mission :(- with the soviets I need to accumulate prestige to have a chance, but accumulating prestige is hard without prestige ... quite punishing- too much randomness in overrunning -> some mission rely on overrunning working ""unusual"" often for better victories- punishing turn limits, especially when having a bad turn without overruns the mission can be restarted (when being in the same situation later and doing the same stuff it can totally work out, this should not be)- first game I needed to constantly lean forward to see stuff on the big screen, introduce zoomlevels perhaps?

												Unity of Command is a great game. It is presented in a straightforward and elegant way, making what could have been an incomprehensible mess into a very accessible wargame. However, do not mistake this for a lack of difficulty. The extremely crafty AI is very quick to put this idea to bed. Attempting to reproduce the stunning encirclements that the Wehrmacht pulled off expertly throughout Operation Barbarossa often ends up in disaster when the AI exploits the holes left by your advancing troops to turn the tables and cut off your supply lines. If you want an easy game, then you are looking in the wrong place with Unity of Command.Speaking of supply lines, they are often the key to success or failure. Cutting off the supply lines to a strong enemy force can turn an impossible fight into an easy cleanup operation. Because there is such great risk involved, and it often goes pear shaped, the satisfaction that results in successfully pulling off a large scale encirclement is huge. It's what keeps me coming back to Unity of Command again and again, even though the AI continuously puts me in my place when I get careless or overconfident.For anyone with an interest in the eastern front during World War 2 and turn based strategy games, I cannot recommend this game enough.

												Unity of Command is a tough one. The game works very well. I particularly like the way that it visually represents the action that your seeing, with each of your unit's having pips showing their combat effectiveness. However, the turn limits per scenario are, frankly, brutally unrealistic. In many cases, the enemy would just gang themselves around 1 of my 5 objectives and literally make it impossible to do anything within the rest of the time frame. However, this is done to show the way in which the Russian front battles took place, as the German's frequently relied on the Blitzkrieg tactic to rapidly advance and crush their enemies, forcing the Russians to have to adapt and use similar techniques while countering. The game, I feel could have used either longer time limits, or no time limits, but replace these with much higher numbers of units, perhaps staggering them to arrive after a certain objective is met or a certain time limit expires. However, it's an enjoyable and interesting experience, and should definitely be looked at for fans of Risk type games.			"

												To ""H---"" with this game.  It is a simple and somewhat interesting rudimentary strategy game, but every little thing has to roll your way to really have a chance to win and you'll need an act of God to win with full prestige as the game progresses. The computer AI is actually not bad but it seems to have better odds of coming up with good rolls of the dice than you. I found it is deeply fustrating to make the neck break turn based strategic goals with a game that requires all your attack rolls to come up big (one or two bad rolls often dooms your chance of beating the turn clock), also any bad weather will set you back a turn or two (which is all the game needs to make you start over yet again). Supplies (always a life blood of an army) gets really freak'n thin in the later scenerios, and good luck getting your lousy Luftwaffe to actually kill something. It is very true that the difficulties make a game more interesting to play, but only up to a point, and this game rockets well past that point to become simply being as much fun as banging your head against the wall until you knock yourself out cold.

												Great turn based game following the eastern campaign of WWII. It may not be the most advanced of turn based games but I see no problem with this. The game can be rather difficult if you do not make the right tactical decisions so replaying missions is rather encouraged. Each mission feels different in how it's layed out, with some being considerably more challenging with how many units you're given or what your objectives are. With the dlc there is a considerable amount of content, it caught me off guard with how many missions/scenarios there are. I heartily recommend this game to anyone who enjoys games focused on the Second World War as well as to anyone who enjoys a turn-based and hex-based strategy game.			"

												Had hoped this one was a new direction in light wargaming, but found it very disappointing overall. Its much more a puzzle rather than a military game, with scenarios that simply need to be ""solved"" - once you've done that (and its fairly easy) there's little or no replayability. Not recommended for anyone looking for an engrossing wargame experience.			"

												Slightly shocked by how short the two campaigns were. Each consisted of just 3 to 4 small battles. And I'd finished them both in a little under 2 hours each.So not much gameplay.Also not much strategy either. Units are all basically the same, and your strategic and tactical options are severely limited.This was, sadly, not the wargame I was hoping for. Just needs a bit more depth and complexity. Probably good for the casual wargamer, but somebody like me who was hoping for something more along the Koger Operationl Art Of War lines? Not what I was wanting.			"

												Very fun, turn based WW2 strategy game. It's relaxing, engaging, and could almost be compared to a WW2 Battle for Wesnoth. What I love about it, is it is all about holding lines, keeping supplies open, and breaking through your opponent's line as well, all the time pushing to an objective. You can call in airstrike, reinforcements, and additional supply. Campaign has been very fun. I like this game quite a bit.			"

												A fantastic little game, don't let it's ugly cousins give you a bad impression of it. From the outside, it looks like a standard Paradox/Geopolitical combat game, but in reality the combat and strategy plays like Civ. All you need to concern yourself with are the objectives you've been set, the time limit on each scenario and your supply lines. Rather than being given an entire country and told to manage it's economics, politics, diplomacy, research and military tactics all at once, this game deals with none of that. It is purely and simply tactical/strategic warfare. The combats similarity to Civ V (which, I am told, in turn is similar to Panzer Corp so maybe I should be comparing that) is based upon it's turn based, one unit per tile nature. You capture any land you walk on, but are restricted in this by your supply lines, which you can extend or cut off by capturing roads. If your troops are poorly supplied, they may become easy targets or have their movement range progressively reduced or be unable to enter combat. There is a turn timer related to your objectives, and this provides a good kick up the backside and adds a great deal of tension to your strategy, although missing the final objective by one hex can be extremely frustrating should it happen.Overall, a really good strategy game, it doesn't over complicate it's subject matter and deals well with the simple concepts that it uses.

												The gameplay mechanics are really good.  Personally I found it a bit too limiting in that you have to play each level with whatever starting conditions (locations, units, etc.) that the designer chose for you.  It makes it more like a puzzle game than a strategy game.  But if you don't mind that sort of thing it's really quite good.  UI is really nice and clear as well so it's easy to figure out what's going on.			"

												I seldom play turn-based games on PC.Unity of Command is probably the best turn-based strategy game on PC I have ever played.It's easy to start to play but having deep tactics. This game is definitely better than Hearts of Iron 3.Not to mention the stupid so-called 4X, in that game you don't have the feelings in battle. Simple text-like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t can represent an army, Sorry to hear me complain Hearts of Iron 3. But actually I haven't make a review for Hearts of Iron 3. Because just don't want to hurt a strategy game company. Hope they can improve one day.Return to talk about Unity of Command, the gameplay is more direct and visual, You can play well and know what you are doing now no matter you read the manual or not, even no need to start the tutorial.In battles, different types of tanks and soilders have specific 2D models, at least what i look at is not a simple stupid text or simple picture. This is the most important thing to me. I just hate simple text-like stuff on maps because it give me no feeling i am playing a game. to me, it's not a game. it's a text♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sorry again, i can just blame other games to show how good Unity of Command.

												Unity of Command is basically a much more accessible, combat-only version of the Hearts of Iron games by Paradox.Like old-school board-game war-games, Unity of Command works off of simple mathematical statistics within a turn-based framework on a hexagon-filled battlefield. The computer makes the random 'dice-rolls' for you, and streamlines the war-gaming experience. In addition, the computer also adds some very limited random elements - primarily semi-randomized weather effects which change movement rules and cover calculations.Each game is a particular strategic scenario on the Eastern Front of World War II: many are historical, while a few entail hypothetical operations. The campaign-mode is just a sequential playing-through of those scenarios, with only a slight change in that sometimes you have to win a scenario with a certain score to progress to the next one. Honestly, the campaign-mode is not very fleshed out, and I don't play it much at all. But individual scenarios are great. They range from 6-turn affairs with just 20 units on either side, to 18-turn massive battles with dozens and dozens of units to move around. And the scenarios can be played in single-player, in on-line multi, or in hot-seat multi modes, so if the (remarkably good) AI isn't quite enough, you can easily recruit a friend in your neighborhood to play against you.It's alot of fun, and I recommend getting the DLC packs (Red-Turn and Black-Turn) pretty much right away so that you have a good number of scenarios to play through. That said, there are also user-created scenarios on Steam Workshop, I believe, but they vary greatly in challenge and entertainment value. "

There are turn limits, making it feel like there is only one way to complete each scenario. Yes, I said scenario. There is no true campaign, it's a series of preset scenarios which you have to solve in a given time limit. Each unit starts in a set position on the map.

												While the game is great in basically everything it completely misses the mark on difficulty. I tried some campaigns maybe 20 times to only get to the third mission or so. Its ridiculously hard, time is always a problem, its not that perfect victory is incredibly hard, thats probably close to impossible, but just barely passing is often times very hard, having to restart the entire campaign a dozen times or so. This is marketed at the absolute hardcore fans of the genre, no room at all for anything but the best most dedicated of players.			"

												Unbelievably dull wargame. Scenarios or well researched but the game is a series of race against the clock missions where the enemy AI simply tries to block you getting a piece to the objective. Barely a wargame at all, very little in the way of strategy or depth simply a very basic board game with an illusiory ww2 overlay so you can pretend your piece is a tank. The rave reviews of this game are a mystery to me, it was abundantly clear how shallow this game was in about 5 minutes. I played for a further half an hour in the hope I ws missing somethng but no. If you've never played a wargame and you want an entry level game sort of in the genre you might enjoy this. Its crisp, easy to grasp and nicely done for what it is. If you actually want anything in the way of a battlefiled experience you're wasting your time here.			"

												A brutally hard game in which you must complete objectives in a VERY short timespan.Now THIS is fine, testing your skill in strategy is a good thing, but every attack and defense you make with every unit is based on LUCK. You could either wipeout a unit with one attack, or they could delay your entire force by a single turn, and you NEED to complete things quickly if you wish to win.You can help increase your odds of success by using your stronger units and adding modifiers such as an anti-armor vehicle or even replenishing your units to a set amount of health, but in the end, it's all down to a dice roll on if you're going to win or not.Personally, I find this game to be naccaptably difficult due to simple random number generation that decides if your attacks/defenses win, or lose. If you want to try it out anyway, download the demo and see if it will sit well with you.			"

												Simple to play, but difficult to master. The clean and easy to use easy interface means you can pick this game up in minutes. Its a Turn based war game that plays a bit like a puzzle game, and its pretty tricky. Will make you think without much need for rule books or you tube.I reccomend this to anyone who likes turn based games.			"

												I honestly did not enjoy this gameI was expecting a fairly casual turn based strategy game where i could sit down with a cup of coffee and spent hours taking my enemies apart piece by piece, if like me thats what you want from a game, this is the wrong game.To start with the AI is pretty ruthless, while there are people out there that hark on about ""the good old days"" of hard games as stardard, these days an option of 'Easy - Normal - Hard' is just common common courtesy and aids in enjoyment of the game for a wider audience, additionally there are (pretty restricting) time limits place on all objectives, so you're just getting into the scenario and then it ends - and you've lost, frustrating. these things combine to mean there is only 1 strategy to complete each scenario and thats just boring, I personally wanted to play with history, not follow it precisely or be slapped the the wrist!So I cannot recommend this game, which is a shame, because I wanted to like it.

												Hmmm. The most frustrating game I have played in a long time.I play games to... oh I don't know, play games. Not to be frustrated because of some insane turn limit that causes me to lose a brilliant victory at the end of the last turn. I'm not worried about the brilliant victory because I want some trophy, but you can't get to certain missions unless you get certain levels fo victories. Also, first time through, you don't know that, so you have to start over the whole campaign if you want to replay a level.The Good: Pretty tough AI, makes the game challengingSounds are goodI enjoy turned base games, this one has some great ideas like encircling to cut supplies, etc.The Bad:Frustrating turn limits (time)If there's bad weather, start overConstantly replaying same scenarios to get right level of victory to unlock all levelsNo Easy - Medium - Hard optionYou have to start over the whole campaign if you want to replay a level.Why even have allies, they can't even harm the enemyI have enjpoyed playing it from time to time, but evey time I get immersed, I end up getting irritated and just quit.

												Not recommended. It's got frustrating controls and very limited save functions.  Apparently, you have to meet several ""checkpoints"" in order to have your progress saved. This gets frustrating if you don't have enough time to finish a campaign.  Also, if you want to restarta  scenario within a campaign, no luck.  It restarts the whole campaign meaning you have to redo all the scenarios you've already finished.  Extremely frustrating. I don't know why they didn't add these features.Also, it's not that great as a strategy game.  The high point for me was the V for Victory series, wayback when.  This is a logistics focused game, but it doesn't really get that right either.  It has some weird calcuating rate where if one enemy unit advances several hexes behind your lines, it gets to disrupt your whole supply line.  This sounds reasonable at first, but think about it.  How can, say, a tank division get past several enemy controlled hexes and punch through without any suppliies of their own AND disrupt enemy supply lines?  It completely ignores spheres of influence. This game basically boils down to the hugely unrealistic strategy of luring your enemy away from their supply lines and then slowly grinding them down (hugely unrealistic) and not very satisfying. Not recommended.			"

												Despite the very interesting gameplay mechanics and being a real fan of TBS games, I can't recommend this one.Pros:- great gameplay, with the interesting resupply mechanicsCons:- The luck element.  It's pure luck whether you:  Forcing the enemy to retreat  The enemy becomes weakened (no longer projects ZoC, so you can go around them and attack their other units).  Your unit gets overrun to attack again (generally ranges from 90%, 40%, or 10%).- To go with the luck element, there are absolutely insane turn limitations for the campaign.There are various objectives which you much reach and capture on the map.  You can still win without capturing every single one, but for a perfectionist, you want to get every single one.Unfortunately, due to the luck mechanics, the only real way of capturing every single objective is pure luck.You can run the exact same strategy, and sometimes it will succeed in time and other times it won't, depending on whether you get overrun or weaken a critical enemy and such.Note: you don't need to capture every single objective to beat the missions.  But it's still bizarre to me.Personal pet peeve:In the first few missions (I didn't get very far in the game)- The AI doesn't actually attack most of the time.  Instead, their goal is purely to stop you from reaching your objective, which means they set up their units in front of you to block you.Really?  That seems utterly inane to me.  They're not here to fight you, they're just here to march in front of you and block you!Maybe this changes in the later missions, I don't know, but it really killed my immersion in the game.			"

												A rock hard strategy game. Unfortunatly luck based fights between armies. If you like gambling, this game is for you. The difficulty is determined by the amount of units you have, their type and their special skills, NOT by your strategy.Worst is when you play 45 Minutes, see your ""strategy"" fails in the end and then you have to start all over again.Normally you would have fog of war but since you can see all enemy unti, the AI can see your units too and thereby cheats such like:Throwing units at you, not to fight, just to abuse game mechanics such like blocking your path and since it´s a turn based game you loose again 1-2 turns. You would win the war - not a question, but you loose against the time / turn limit. So you have to trade your good units to remove the blocker and continue.If you know anything about strategy a general would never send a small infantry unit against 5 tanks, but game mechanics you know.....

												I am a huge fan for turn based strategy games. A heard a lot of good things about this game and so when it went on sale for a 1$ including all the dlc i bought it. Game mechanics are good but I can't stand the randomness of the movement for the ai. At the same time the game limits the amount of turns you can use. Its stupid how I lose because my troops movement per turn isnt very far and the last objective to capture is far away. By the time i get there im out of turns and I lose despite my army still large and I could win in another 2 turns. There is no strategy except send your tank and armored car units in as fast as you can and hope they don't get blown up on there way there while your infantry sit in the back unused because they don't move far. DON'T BUY IT!			"

												I thought at first sight I would fall in love with this game and it hit all the boxes, turn based strategy, world war 2, nazis killing soviets, etc... but in the end all it turned out to be was a tight necked objective based game that forces you meets its requirements in a period of turns in which you do not have enough in order to complete. The game is too tough on general players, and pushing people away from the game itself, casuing them to get too upset or too aggreviated enjoy. If you want to waste $15 or so on a game, there are better ones out there, dont even bother with this game, its a waste of time, money and effort. 2/10.			"

												""Easy to get in"" - definitely. Very simple, even too much for my taste. But not ""easy to play"". It's not a game you would find relaxing and digging into unit stats, enjoying them fighting the enemy and caring for each one. The game is a barebone operational level wargame. And on that level you are supposed to mercilessly spend your reserves to meet the Command demands in an extremely limited set of time. I suppose that's realistic - WW2 was all about OOB and time plans. But that's very uncomfortable. You feel as a Soviet commander who is going to be shot if he fails plans of advance.Another downside - the game is not so much a struggle against AI, as a logical puzzle. Spend your troops and overcome resistance in a set amount of time. Not much tactical thinking or gameplay.So, if you know you want that - buy the game. Otherwise - think twice.			"

												I'm not used to many hex based games so perhaps it's just not my genre, but I didn't enjoy this game.Pros-I liked how mobile the tanks and motorized did feel, I felt like I could blitz behind the enemy and cut off their supply lines very satisfactorily.I liked being able to build and demolish bridges.The UI did feel polished and well made.I enjoyed the focus on mobility and logistics, since those were what won and lost theatres in WW2.Cons-The enemy AI nearly never attacked (even when they were in imminent danger of being encircled), and always had this annoying tendency to retreat exactly where the enemy front was weakest even when this involved it retreating in the wrong direction.I’d have it so that I believed I had a reasonable chance at taking an objective the next turn, and while trying to encircle the enemy any troops I had to mow down from behind the objective would willing retreat forwards into the pocket.  With this I’d lose my chance at taking an objective before it began losing prestige value. This seemed like a terrible oversight. Sure it’s a great tactic for the AI if it wants to deny you an objective, but the point of retreat is that it shouldn’t have any control over the unit anymore, the AI being able to treat it as an organized advance is nothing short of infuriating.Yeah the AI was tough, very tough, if that’s your thing then good for you. I’d have preferred a casual option though, or maybe one called realistic. For example in the Stalingrad campaign in Operation Uranus I thought the two day objective looked reasonable at first. Little did I know the entire 6th German army would completely evacuate Stalingrad to form a borg cube around two objectives denying me a victory at all. It felt like the enemy AI needed to have objectives of its own besides just denying me my objectives. For example it left cities that were non-objectives completely undefended.The predetermind locations of your units at the start of a scenario was a kick in the teeth as well.The time limit seemed like a cool idea until I played the game, and I understand that to add challenge to the attacker when you have a huge majority it's neccesary, but I feel like it could have been improved upon. I'd have prefered it to been a campaign feature rather than a feature in each individual scenario.Finally it had randomized attack features like overrun, which let a unit attack twice. I don’t play strategy games to have to worry about critical hits.			"

What a waste of money this game is!!STAY AWAYYou must play each map until you get it perfect before you goto the next map. yes thatsright, 5,10,20 times before you get it perfect. if you dont your limited to 3 maps out of 9+ because the next map doesnt open up unless you get a perfect score on the map prior. no saving at different intervals. no stopping one campaign and trying another without deleting each completed map youve done. what a crock of ♥♥♥♥ this game is.Every thing is random, the combat, everything is preset as for the units. and did i mention insanely hard?NOT WORTH YOUR TIME			"

												As close to Panzer General I as I have found (for new Windows) - but supply is ludicrously brutal, as soon as your panzers move one turn's distance they get out  of supply and by turn two cannot move or fight. Also there are only 4 - 6 turns per scenario. Not really worth buying.			"

												Great wargame and fun to play.  It has the feel of the old style board wargame.  I especially like the scenarios that have the ability to increase your supply lines by choosing the ones to increase as this adds a logistics element to the scenario.  I would like the developer to create some additional scenarios and even maybe a DLC to add the other theaters of the war.			"

												The game is ok but didn't live up to my expectations.  It's biggest weakness is it's lack of customization.  You don't get to pick your units like in PG series. You can carry over experienced units if they happen to show up in later scenarios but it can be very difficult to level up a large number of units.  In addition, the game penalizes you for attempting to attempt a sound military victory and instead forces you to simply get units to objectives as fast as possible without regards to casualties or the state of your battle line, something no commander would ever ignore.  Overall I give it a 6/10, it could have been much more than it is.  The PG series did all of these things with a good level of balance that this game does not provide.			"

												So, this game is pretty good, and a little addictive.I originally got into it because it was billed as an ""accessible grognard wargame,"" which... I suppose is accurate? It's not really a grognardy wargame at all though, and it's much more like a puzzle game -- but that's not to say it won't scratch the strategy gamer's itch (it excels at it). For a niche game, the art design is really fantastic, and the polish is second to none.There was a very slight difficulty curve at the beginning, but definitely nothing like other games of the wargame genre. It took me about an hour to really get the hang of it and learn that I was supposed to be thinking strategically (longer term goals, forcing encirclements, getting my enemies out of supply, etc.) instead of thinking tactically (exploiting opportunities as they naturally occur). Once I got that method of thinking down, I was all good.Overall, it's challenging, and very rewarding when you beat each scenario. I'm only a few missions in and looking forward to continuing.			"

												The king of the strategies(Hearts of Iron) is dead, long live the king!Sorry Enemy Unknown, you were great too but here we have an underrated gem which deserves some love.Main campaign is about Stalingrad Offensive of Germans and counter offensive of Soviets. DLC's consists of Red Turn(Which is ""Race to Berlin"") and Operation Barbarossa(1941 offensive of Germans)Only minus sides of the game are first you can't be defender side while playing against AI. Developers say AI has its limitations and ""think"" only one or two steps forward. Ai is awesome as defender anyway so i'm not sure if i can count this as ""minus"" side.Secondly maps has turn points, if you fail to deliver all at the end you fail. You get more prestige points for earlier capture. Sometimes in bigger maps(like Moscow) it makes one crazy to lose at the end because of ""turn limit"" but you can always restart the map *shrugs* But it is kinda historical if you think Germans' race against winter(which failed) but again it is not a nice feature but i don't mind.Except this everything, from AI to maps, from historical accuracy to gameplay, specific units(Romanian, SS, Italian, Hungarian divisions) to randomness(Such as weather change)... Everything is fine.9/10			"

												Played for couple of evenings. After the start, game goes quite swiftly.Usual battle system (move and fight) have a bit of random outcomes, though some estimation is seen beforehand in info-screen.In addition of fighting or moreover most important thing in game is support-lines, for without support units starts to lose their strength in couple of turn. So support points are also the target of attacks alongside of main objects.Campaign seems to be a bit of try and error. You cant go on after failed battle, so there is little taste of repetition. I like myself kind of games like SPWAW, where you have to live with your errors in future.So far Really nice game after half of the Stalingrad capmaign.			"

												I keep comparing this game to Panzer General, the real classic. Definately it's much simplier, but still realistic. You won't have your core units anymore, nor alternative history scenarios (you just have to keep winning). You can't also chose from different types of units - you only have infantry (may be mechanized), cavalry and tanks (although you can add specialized step to each like artilery, enginers or recon). There is no fog of war and the scenerios are much shorter (half an hour is usually enough). No navy and air support is very simple. Still I like the game for the way how supply routes are treated. This is a thing that Panzer General really suffered at. You had to supply your units sometimes, but rarely, so they didn't really feel bad in encirclement. Here it is different. Your units even after one turn of lack of supplies will suffer and after second turn they can't attack. After third turn they are so easy to kill. Therefore in you offensive you really aim at a blitzkrieg - fast advance and encirclement. This adds another dimension which PG lacked. I would really like to play PG with this system implemented, but would I still find time for that? I'd like to play this alternative histories with my core units again - this game lacks a lot of stuff compared to PG but still is extremely fun to play!Definately if you loved PG and don't have time for it's enormous scenarios anymore - this is a game for you. Highly recommended. If you have time - why not install original PG on dosbox instead? If you never tried PG and you like hexes then you will be probbably amazed with the game.			"

												For a game that doesn't have very high system requirements, this game looks and plays incredibly well.

The gameplay reminded me of Civ, minus the civilization portion, and if Civ solely focused on combat.

												A very tight and evocative gaming experience.For what is seemingly just a hex-strategy game; every part of it has been so well considered. The rules-set compliments the narrative so well, the music gives it a depressing crushing aura, the visual aesthetic while simple compliments the fatalistic aura and the supply mechanic... it's truly excellent.You and the opponent's forces rely on supply to keep them working effectively; consequently the game becomes one where you and the opponent (usually a desperate AI) try to sever each other's supply line, while protecting your own. Once the supplies are cut, its just time before the opponent (or your own forces) simply stop working!And that time is the key; the game doesn't measure success in terms of kills, or margins of victory; just the time taken to reach certain objectives.I couldn't comment on how historically accurate the game is; but after ten or so hours of play I can't help but feel the designers have sneakily taught me ""things"" about the Eastern Front. I certainly don't want to be a German infantryman, on my 12th day without supplies, trying to hold off a Russian Tank attack.			"

												A great entry level virtual wargame that takes you into the heroic saga of the Eastern Front. From the opening days of Operation Barbarrossa to the final days of the Battle of Berlin, you will fight in a gamut of battles that make up the major turning points of the entire front. But you don't have to settle for just retracing the steps of the past, if you are good enough to surpass the generals of history, you can alter the outcome of the war itself and secure ultimate victory for the Axis powers.The graphics are crisp, the sound is sharp and the amount of content large. The DLC is a steal, each of them containing the same amount of scenarios as the main game itself!

												Excellent.  Encircle your enemies cut off their supplies and slowly pound them to dust.  Very addictive chess type game.  Not for beginners mind as its a steep learning curve and you will be punished.			"

												One of the best Strat games I have played its addictive and frustrating all at the same time. The AI isn't predictable and Thanks 2X2 for supporting Linux all the way and keep up the good work :).			"

												This is a great introductory game for those intimidated by traditional wargames.  Emphasis is on supply effects on the ground unit(s) effectiveness, but has nice touches like air support and bridge demolition.  Highly recommend that you pick it up on one of the Steam sales, so put it on your wish list.			"

												Quite good and very accessible entry level turn-based strategy game, for anything more advanced, you would likely have check out the WWII titles by Matrix/Slitherine. Mechanics are simple to grasp, while giving a rewarding WWII Eastern Front experience. Game can be quite difficult at times, so the replayability factor is certainly there (trying multiple strategies in the same scenario). Solid ""B"" IMHO.			"

												Great wargame and fun to play.  It has the feel of the old style board wargame.  I especially like the scenarios that have the ability to increase your supply lines by choosing the ones to increase as this adds a logistics element to the scenario.  I would like the developer to create some additional scenarios and even maybe a DLC to add the other theaters of the war.			"

												A very solid wargame with a learning curve that's fairly friendly to newcomers to the genre. I definitely recommend it!			"

												For anyone interested in operational level strategy games, Unity of Command  is definitely worth a look. Turn based with a hex grid, it should appeal to traditional boardwargamers and strategy enthusiasts alike.It is very easy to play, and this is what makes me want to play it again and again. The game mechanics never get in the way of playing out your strategy. Once you understand that this is a game of supply, namely maintaining yours and denying your opponents, this is a fantastic game with plenty of scenarios and a great campaign to go along with it.I haven't tried multiplayer yet, I'm still battling it out against the AI, who is quite a clever opponent, enough so to maintain an interest. Even after multiple plays, it is difficult to get a decisive victory condition in the scenrios, never mind getting a brilliant victory, which requires a bit of luck as well as perfectly executed strategy.I come from a tradition of board war games from S&T, AH, West End Games, Decision Games			"

												Very unique and deep gameplay.You don’t just destroy enemy units and capture objectives. You need to concentrate your strongest platoons where enemy defense is weak, breakthrough, and rush forward with your armored and mechanized platoons trying to encircle the enemy leaving them without supplies and forcing them to retreat from fortified positions. And then either you get to lightly defended objective before enemy main force retreats and establish a new defense line, or the enemy will simply cut off your breach head units and force them to retreat.Campaign design is a bit frustrating: if you lose even one scenario you need to restart the whole campaign.Scenarios are more like a puzzle where you have very limited choice of actions and extremely limited amount of turns to capture all objectivesSome scenarios, especially ones with very few units participating, heavily randomized, where victory or defeat is 99% random.

												이 게임 좋다. 상당히 재밌고 맵 에디터의 추가로 재밌게 즐길 수 있다. 근데 인디게임이라 그런지 약간 빈약한 느낌! 그래도 즐길만 하다.			"

												Don't be fooled, this is a puzzle game with a tacked on war theme. There are no historically recognisable strategies or tactics to develop, only a single solution per ""puzzle"". The predeterministic narrative encourages the player to tediously gaming the system by re-booting each scenario until he finally gets a successful attack that he can build upon. I would only recommend it to my enemies.			"

												The game is not easy, very challenging even from the beginning, which force you to think a lot. Unfortunately the AI is fixed in game, so you cannot choose the difficulty.Although it is a very classic hex war game (and surely you can expect how the game runs), but I still love the UI design a lot. But, for me, I think the game is more puzzle-like rather than grand strategy game.			"
