Early Access Review
								I purchased this game some time ago and have waited a long time to review it, due in part to some issues I had with it, but also because I wanted to be fair, considering that it is an early access game. So with that being said, my review:So I was flipping through the steam games and I came across this game called ""Imagine Earth"" in the simulation section, I saw that it had a demo and decided to try it. At the time the demo only had a missions available, a simple interface and not a lot in the way of content... but I was hooked.It reminded me why I like simulation games in the first place, giving me all the things I enjoy with the bonus of playing God to a newly created world to work with. I could feel the nostalgia of Sim Earth I played as a kid. So I jumped right in after playing the demo and purchased early access to the game.Playing the early access version it was immediately apparent the game was slightly different than the demo that been made available, which is okay considering that demos are just that, demonstrations of what the game will look like. But one thing was clear, this was no simulation game.What I got instead was a game that seemed more like a puzzle where your decisions didn't really matter more than getting the right pieces in the right order before you run out of time. I had many issues with the game, all of which I made clear by submitting emails to the developers who were very receptive and seemed opened to the community ideas.Lorian the third world in the game gave me excruciating torment, where it seemed the developers were more interested in creating a game of torture than a game of fun, and it became discouraging to play over and over, failure after failure. So I took a break, quit playing altogether in the hopes some of the issues I had with it would be solved eventually.So after months I decided to try the game again, and I am so glad that I did. All of the issues that I had originally had have disappeared. What was once an overly complicated puzzle of torture, had become a relaxing simulation/strategy game that was less scripted with super hard puzzle nonsense and although still difficult seems less locked into ""their"" pre-defined way to win strategy I sometimes felt when playing. Even when I failed a couple of times, I saw different ways to get to where I wanted and ultimately finished the things that were once overly difficult to beat.The developers have clearly taken the community recommendations and made the game a lot more playable and fun, and that's why I felt like it was time to review this game for them.I wholeheartedly recommend this game now, for its addictive playstyle that will keep you happy for hours on end. While the game is still unfinished, it’s very much where it needs to be now, and playing it no longer feels like an exercise in futility but rather an actual game that is fun to play. I'm excited to see more and cannot wait to see how this one ends.For the people that like extra-long drawn out games, this one might not be for you, as the game only has a few missions, but it almost doesn't matter because the addictive nature of it will keep you coming back for more. I hope to see expansions or additions to the game after it is released because what they have here opens so many other possibilities. Certainly you will be left wanting for more, and there doesn't seem to be any reason why the devs couldn't keep adding on to the game.For the people that love simulation, strategy, space games, this game is FOR YOU! For everyone else that loves fun quirky games, you'll want to play this game too. Beautiful, charming, and challenging. Highly recommended! "

Early Access Review
Imagine Earth or: The game ""Reus"" wants to beImagine Earth is best described as a mixture of puzzle, strategy and management simulation. Even though with a educational mandate, as it's main feature is the fragility of planets. As the title implies this game throws a shadow on the future of our earth. But first things first.What is: In this game you are the jr. vice president of Imagine Earth, Ltd., a coorporation that colonizes distant planets for big profits. The game comes with a nice campaign, introducing you to likeable characters that guide you through your first steps. Expect to fail in the second mission anyways. Even though the tutorial is very well designed and gives a good guidance, the game itself remains a challenge.You start of every new colony by placing your first town centre on the planet. Soon enough new colonists will move in and develop a demand for food, energy and goods. By the games triangular grid, every building has - yes, that's right - three sides. And as you place buildings next to each other they possibly gain benefits or detriments from each other. So in this way Imagine Earth actually resembles ""Reus"". For example, you can increase the energy output of biomass plants by placing them next to forests or farms. But your inhabitants will become unhappy if you build coal plants next to their houses. Since building space is limited, conflicts are inevitable and part of the challenge arises from the task to place your buildings in the most productive and proficient way. What's else: On the other hand there are different types or tiles of terrain. So you want to place your farms on fertile land or your gas plants on top of gas resources to maximize outcomes. This task gets significant harder by the fact that all your buildings create pollution, eventually triggering a greenhouse effect on your planet. Fertile land turns into desert, tornados and volcanoes arise and ultimatly your facing meltdown of the polar caps, rising global water level. To cut a long story short, if you don't take care of your planet, it will want to get rid of you.[/b]]The graphics[/b] are a bit toony, which I personally enjoy very much. The planets themself looking like beautiful blue marbles that I - personally - feel a bit sad for, if my false management destroys them.The Music itself is not extraordinarily remarkable but fits the pace of the game very good. (The speed of the music actually changes with the set game speed - mindblown!)The story is also not quite thrilling but gives enough motivation to play through the campaign which I perceived mostly as a tutorial introducing my to new elements. Once your done with the rather short campaign, there is sandbox mode, challenge mode and a free play mode. You can play on planets, that are procedural created according to player set parameters - for instance like in Tropico where you can choose size of the map, the amount of resources, etc... - what makes the game a good value. (It seems that there is the idea of exchanging planets with your friends, competing for highscorse, but I can not confirm this.)The controls are very simple and easy to pick up right away. One click opens the menu, one click lets you choose, one click places the building. Flaws: As much as I enjoy Imagine Earth, there are two downsides. Even though the planets look beautiful, they feel a bit sterile, as streets stay empty, for example. Where are your 1.5 billion inhabitants? Building big cities is fun and the realy look cool as large skyscrapers emerge, but there is now life in the game. There are neither people or cars (like in Anno, where you get the impression of a busy citylife), nor animals roaming on the map.The other minor flaw is, that you cant buy 5 buildings in a row, as you have to open the menu, select the building and place it for every building. Which I find a little unpractical and thus ironic in a game, that focus on maximizing efficiency.Sum of us: This game is what I expected when I first got my hands on ""Reus"". If you were, like me, disappointed by Reus - even though solely based on your own false expectations - then this game is for you. If you like building simulations and management games, this game also is for you. If you are still sceptical, the free demo is for you.Imagine Earth is charming, challenging, a good value and a game of plain fun. "

								Short story: I like the game but it is pricey for what it is, but if you're a fan of the genre.The Good:The game demonstrates just how simple a fun city manager needs to be.It's generally a capitalist game where you play the balancing act of profits vs catastrophe!Somewhat interesting research/upgrade items.Music is pleasant.I like the triangular grid, it feels inferior but at least it's refreshing.Fun, simple, little game.The Bad:Suspension of disbelief: Why are we colonising planets and still burning coal? Or need a side-task often to do with population in order to get new research points? It may sound like nitpicking but the oddity of the game's reasoning is sticking out like a thorn.Price: I still find it a bit pricey for what the game offers.The Verdict: ★★★☆☆A good little game, with a little more promised for the future. It's playable and enjoyable at this stage.			"

								The game combines resource management, technology planning, and careful positioning at a real-time strategy game pace. It is easy to pick up the basics, but definitely takes skill to get good at it.The gameplay is great, despite the graphics not being the best on the market. Considering this is an indy title, it really needs to get more attention as a great addition to a difficult-to-please genre of players.Look at the negative comments for the game - none of them complain about gameplay. Its all taste-based comments or something that's not an issue like expecting world-class graphics from an indy team. The negative comments don't complain about the gameplay, because the game is fun and challenging.Would love to see how this game ends up at release. Fantastic game so far - This could become a benchmarking game for the genre.			"

								Interesting game. You have to balance the intensity of each resource, you may need energy, food, money; but also you may break the balance of the planet so you will need to invest in ecologic projects... The different types of city districts bring variety. I miss units to do stuff, may be exploration as well, because the resources and the map of the game is known from the begining.			"

								Imagine Earth is a sort of simplified city building game with an easily understood user interface and light hearted characters to meet with somewhat cartoonish nature. You are a colony manager and you build cities in sandbox or campaign with the limit of how much punishment the planet can take before eco collapse. It is a fun game to play if you have a little free time, but I will say that it gets somewhat boring after 20 hours or so. The game is almost to simple sometimes because once you build your city to a good size, then it is smooth sailing until you either stop expanding or destroy your colony with a environment collapse (unless you are in the campaign then you finish the mission). One thing I really found annoying was the tech tree because you earn tech points over time building cities to invest in the tree. You can also buy tech from traders, but once a decision is made, you have to live with it for every new game you start. You cannot start the tech tree over, but buy techs that counter it and this applies to every sandbox and campaign mission started. I will rate the game recommended because it in early access and still is updating regularly. It was fun for a short time, but I would have gotten it on sale If I had the opportunity to start over. "

								***Written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***Imagine Earth is a world simulation/strategy game that is currently available in Early Access. Earth has been almost completely ruined and your job as a colony manager is to help setup and run profitable colonies on distant planets to earn some big bucks for your company. Balancing your resources in this game is very important and putting too much pressure on any one of power, money, food or goods (for consumption) can seriously affect your chances of being successful. +Graphics are quite nice though some of the textures aren't particularly high quality+Simple UI which suits the game well and clearly displays the information you need+There is a sandbox mode where you can create your own worlds to colonize as well as the campaign mode+Relaxing to play and doesn't require full attention+Your actions have direct consequences on the climate and if your carbon dioxide emissions get too high +A wide variety of buildings that are unlocked as you progress+As you progress through the game you unlock new technologies and upgrades to technology/buildings you already have which increase the effectiveness of your colony+Buildings have a cool design+The world's are quite different to each other+Five different speed settings+Nice soundtrack+Steam leaderboards+/-Updates aren't released very frequently but there are only two developers so it is understandable-For what it is the £18.99 price tag feels a bit overpriced especially as there are currently only 5 missions in the game and those five missions have little replay value-Quite a few typos and grammatical errors-Currently no Steamworks featuresVerdict:7A good world simulation game but due to its high price I would suggest waiting for the game to get a sale or significantly more content.El K.

								(This is a review of the studio as well as the game)Imagine Earth is an Early Access world management game. The game has a steady progression of being updated. The build we are on is stable and playable, giving several hours of entertainment. As it stands, the game is very polished, but lacks depth of content. The dev team is responsible on keeping the community (at least, I feel well informed by reading their news feed) informed on how things are progressing.

I believe it will be well worth it once the game is finished and am glad I could help out the developers.So far it's a pretty good game (first three missions are available) and I was able to play through without too many bugs.  Reminds a bit of Light of Altair in terms of the city building elements.The one bug I did have was that research system was screwed up -- when you earned research stars you had to go back to the main menu before they would appear and you'd be able to invest them.

								I love this game!  I've played roughly 34 hours, and still can't get enough, Unless you're in campaign mode, which is either really easy or really difficult based on the settings you chose, it seems like the ultimate ending for sandbox mode is environmental collapse with a lot of bad guys and disasters along the way.  I'm hoping since this is early release that that ultimately isn't the ending you'll get every time you play (it has been for me so far). I would like to be able to evacuate and colonize another planet instead of getting game over.  But even if that is to happen every time, tho, I still love how this game plays, the graphics, the interactions, the layout....everything is just incredibly smooth! I look forward to supporting this game to it's full release and beyond!			"

Early Access Review
								I've had this game since it was released as early access. It's been consistently a lot of fun throughout development and the devs have been really active in updating and expanding the game. An example being I found a bug in Alpha 11, maybe they had already located it too, either way, it was fixed in 5 hours! So, this is not one of those early releases.On the actual gameplay, it's an entertaining simulation, where you're having to develop a colony, with pre-set victory conditions in each level. You can't use all the buildings and techs every time, so you end up needing to be selective on what you develop and coupled with that is the risk of runaway global warming, which results in failure. Added to that is time trials, challenges, free play and planet creators, so it's got a decent amount of replay value to it too.It's a pretty chilled game, which however can put the pressure on at times. For the price it is, I would definitely say it's entertaining and enjoyable enough to be totally worth it.			"

								So far it has been a good ride. Game still needs more definition. Objectives well laid out but balance isn't that great. Hopefully introduction of new worlds and objectives as the game is further developed. There should also be a manual/quick start/quick referrence guide. A 5 minute read to get up to speed vs learn as you go would be a tremendous help for beginners.If you enjoy progression type games (build/upgrade) then this is  a good choice and would recommend. If you are more casual, then this isn't for you .... yet.			"

								Right now the game plays like a teeter totter where once things tip over the balance point it's pretty much all over for your civ. The concept is good but the end game leaves alot to be desired. I played 1v1 free play against a normal difficulty AI, I was having a blast building a 10 mil population city and right at about 8.5 mil I realized that the other civ was about to doom me. Now I thought maybe they were just late to pic up the green techs so I simulated a few asteriod strikes to see what would happen the reloaded to play thru the rest of my ""peaceful"" playthru.Essentially by time I made it to 10 mil the other civ had doubled my polution output with only about a third of the population that I had. The AI civ doomed the planet and the game only gives the player an option to throw asteriods at their foe causing the roid to stick in the ground leaving a blocked space thats unbuildable and as far as I could tell it couldnt be removed either (I'll have to throw one into my own territory next time to see if I can remove it). Without a way to combat the AI the other civ simply just landed more city center where any space was available, seeing as the impact would cause a fire which would burn the trees that would then open up a space for the AI to land a city center, the fight was futile or arguous at best.Apart from the lack of military stratagy there was absolutely no way to combat the rising tides or to attempt to stabalize the atmosphere using technology. Sea walls and carbon capture systems seem like common ideas that would make it into a game like this, given it is only an alpha so maybe more eviromental protection techs will be added but I felt very dissapointed to see my 10mil city go to ruins in the exact same way my 1 mil city did with absolute no way to progress after the collapse even tho I had plenty of capital to invest in recovering the flodded areas.I give this game a 3 out of 5 at it's current version, untill an update adds to the end game content I would not sudgest this game to the average civ gamer as they will feel as I do after playing a marathon; dissapointed in what seemed like the same game weather playing ten minutes or ten hours.  #SeawallsEdit 3/26/16; I have changed my thumbs down to a thumbs up. I still dont fully support the game but the developer is putting out new content and it seems to be moving in the right direction. I look forward to playing the game with the new updates when I get around to it. Rating 6 out of 10			"

I don't know why I expected this but I did. You control a single planet per scenario.I also expected playing against the computer or other players on a galactic level.

The only thing really challenging about this game is finding the Ideon crystals and really maintaning and sustaining your colony on the planet.

								So after hitting up Planetbase and Offworld, I guess I've been hit by this new space bug that's been coming up in a lot of games. So when I saw Imagine Earth, I thought it might be another take on the concept. Sadly, it fell just a few yards short of a touchdown.Imagine's gameplay just feels clunky, from setting up cities to the requirements for upgrades to actually expanding your colony. The upgrades system especially feels odd, considering you're working for a corporation having there be population marks to meet rather that using your money as an alternative feels tricky. Also, there feels to be too much of a limit on what you're capable of doing, though since this is still in early access I know things will change. Maybe making the planets a bit bigger and offering alternative methods to gain technologies and licenses?Right now, I can't recommend Imagine, but maybe it'll surprise me in the future.			"

								Not worth its price. Very basic game that will remind you of an old board game, games that are equally as boring. Weird controls and strange gameplay. Features ok visuals for the planets, but the characters look like they are from some cheesy cartoon. Overall, this game is overpriced and just plain weird.			"
