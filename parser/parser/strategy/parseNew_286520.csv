Rating; 7/10Pros:- Fun, simple, and straightforward- Family friendly- Good storyline- No micro-transactions- Later puzzles can be challenging- Enjoyable musicCons:- Soundtrack is relatively repetitive- Little replayability after you finish all the puzzles- Can be too 'simple' for the veteran, hardcore gamerOverall: Perfect for the casual gamer who enjoys a puzzle or two after work. Simple, fun, and easy to play. Would be way better with Workshop.Review: This is a fun game if you are looking for a fun, puzzle-solving strategy game that appeals to all ages. The gameplay mechanics are simple to understand and easy to grasp, and I believe can be a great game for the family (relatively non-violent, fun, simple). The purpose of the game is that in each level you are designated to help the Viking Brothers proceed on their mission by solving obstacles by gathering certain amounts of resources. The faster you do this, the better the 'rating' you get at the end of the level. The further you go, the more challenging the puzzles get. The story is fun, quirky and a bit funny at times. The character art in my opinion also is simple, cartoon but amicable. Because of the game's simpicity, it is an easy game to pick up and start playing.Overall I would give it a 7/10. It is a perfect, family-friendly puzzle adventure game that is great for the casual gamer, or to plug into a HDMI port in your TV and give it to guests or family for entertainment. It's also fun for the casual gamer who doesn't have too much time to spend playing games, but likes to play a little puzzle after work. The downside is this game costs $10 (isn't too bad but really should cost $5-7 - try to get it on sale), and can be too simple for the hardcore gamer because it is not extremely challenging or detailed. The game also does not have Steam Workshop, so after you finish the puzzles there isn't much incentive to go back and try them again (except for getting a better rating, or reliving the storyline). This can mean your purchase has a certain life to it depending on how long it takes you to finish the game (but they could always add Workshop additions to the game, if they wanted to).If they added the option for Steam Workshop to work with this game, $10 would be worth the pricetag. This game has alot of potential for Steam Workshop, mainly because people could create custom puzzles for the Steam community to have fun on, and create their own stories for the Viking Brothers to go on. If this happens, my score to the game would be 8/10, because it would have potentially unlimited replayability. But as is, overall its a fun addition to Steam if you're looking for a fun puzzle-adventure game that is easy to understand and play; but don't expect something that will last you forever.			"

												If you can shut your mind off and just click with a fairly bad story, it's for you.  Not much story though.  Figured it would be a little clever like the Hercules games but no luck there.			"

												First impression after 21/50 levels: the game is well done. Each level takes about 10 minutes to do once, more attempts if you want to beat the clock challenge, which is reasonably difficult.You start each level off with a single worker who can collect resources that are lying around and don't regrow, and who can build resource producers: farms for food, mines for stone, sawmills for lumber, barracks for fighters, and upgrade his own house for more workers. Since building costs resources, the order in which you collect and build your stuff matters if you want to be quick.Do you want to be quick? If you are, you'll get ""gold"" on the level, and it is marked completed on the map, but you don't need that to progress. Most of the time, I'm getting silver on my first attempt; getting gold requires a second or third attempt with some thought about strategy and a learning process. But do I want to? Initially, I did. But there's no reward other than the satisfaction of having met the challenge (no Steam achievements, either). And you know, doing build strategy against the clock sucks for me -- one reason I'm not into RTS much is that I want time to think, to puzzle out a good strategy, but to do that I'd need to pause the game and review the data and issue my orders, but the game doesn't have a ""tactical pause"" like that. I do tolerably well without that, but I don't really feel in control enough for it to feel fun, and I'm not invested enough to go all out analytical and make charts of the resources required for each upgrade and so forth. So I stopped going for gold after level 7.If you feel you'd enjoy doing real-time build strategy without the fighting, this game will provide a wide variety of reasonably difficult challenges for you, and you're likely to get a lot of joy out of it: for you, to complete the game ""all gold"" might be rated at 15 hours or more, unless you're a bit better at strategy than I am. (And you could still try to beat your times.)If you just like to see small toons scurry about the screen at your beck and call whilst progressing through 50 very varied challenges (the map design has really been nice so far), or would like to have a game to come back to that you can play in 10-minute-installments, you can expect about 8 hours.My playtime so far amounts to an estimated 4 hours, which is fine for the 1.50â‚¬ it cost me. If you see it on sale or in a bundle, you could do worse than to give it a try. Recommended.The game is DRM-free and runs without Steam.			"

												This game was incredible boring without any challenge or pressure at all - even toddlers would get bored. It feels like playing a point and click game without use of brain. There is a timer in the game, however the timer never get anywhere near running out. The music is awful, the sfx ok, the gfx fine, encountered a few bugs. All in all, not worth money.			"

												Viking Brothers is yet another casual strategy game, you've probably seen dozens of times on either Steam or Facebook. The only difference compared to the games on Facebook is that this game does not come with micro-payments or waiting times. Viking Brothers looks cute and is very easy to understand and to play, which makes it a great game for young children. I've only played this game because it would crash right after the tutorial mission but I doubt I would play much more than that. So, yes this game could be fun for your kids.... that is, if you're willing to pay the expensive price of 10 bucks, which is way to much for a game like this.			"

												Pretty forgettable time management game. The graphics are lazily done, with issues like characters standing in front of and blocking resources, workers standing midair in the gap of a broken bridge while they're repairing it, large barriers and small barriers being represented by the exact same graphics, and objects like trees being clickable resources in one level and just part of the background scenery in the next. Bad programming makes it sometimes possible to bypass obstacles without clearing them. Overpriced compared to similar games on Steam. The music and sound effects make me want to stab myself in the ear with a pencil.			"

												Very simplistic building/management game. It wouldn't surprise me a bit if it was ported to PC from mobiles, it certainly looks and plays like a mobile port. I know many people have issues with those, though personally, I'm only bothered by it when the port is bad, and that is not the problem with this title. The real problem I have with it is that it's buggy, plain and simple. The very first time I tried playing it, I got stuck on level 2 with all goals met, but no way to advance. (Screenshot)I get that software has bugs, but to be completely blocked at such an early point just screams poor quality assurance to me.Combine this with the game itself being rather unimaginative and tepid, and there just isn't any way I can recommend this to anyone, and I'm really glad that I got my copy as part of a 8-game bundle I bought for $2.

												Got this in a bundle, and overall it is worth a dollar or two. Like others stated eariler, there is no challege other than trying to click-click-click to get the best time per board. Think this would be best played on a phone or laptop when you have 5 minutes to kill at a time.  Playing straight through gets boring as you repetively get resources and clear objects that block your path on your path to win. While the music is bad and the overall story is laughable, I'd recommend it as for any player of resource mananger type games. "

												By the horns of your helmet, this is a Viking adventure you'll never forget! Join two brothers as they set off across a battle-scarred kingdom to drive off savages, restore their land, and search for the magic items that will breathe new life into their once magnificent realm! "

												Viking brothers is fun. It's not the most challenging game, and of course there are some things that could be improved, but I find myself playing level after level, and will keep doing so until the game is complete.The game is basically a puzzle game click fest. You are presented with a map, often designed in a way to confuse the eye, with tunnels interlinking sections, etc. You gather resources, activate or upgrade buildings, to gather more resources, and use those resources to complete varius objectives. The story is amusing, but you can skip the dialogue if you don't care about that aspect.The game is not difficult to complete, and the only challenge comes in trying to get the faster time for each level (gold badges). Now if you'll excuse me, I just entered the swamp and need to direct my little guys...UPDATE: I just completed the game, in a little under 10 hours. The game does get trickier in later levels, and with limited resources, it is possible to cause yourself to be blocked, and need to restart the level. Not often, but if you don't pay attention, it can happen. I really enjoyed the game, and would buy if sequel if one gets made.			"

												Plays similar to 12 Labours of Hercules (just way more simplistic; 12 Labours is superior in several ways). Good time waster. I'd like it a lot more if it didn't constantly freeze up in the middle of levels. The main challenge in the game is finishing each level quickly; I haven't seen any other real goals. Collect resources, build resource buildings (farms, quarries, etc), defeat savages (barbarian warriors), help the gods, save the world. Graphics are simple; I turn the music down to watch Netflix so I can't comment there. The main story has the Vikings helping the gods repair their kingdom after some barbarians tear through; I'm not sure why the gods are having trouble with some human fighters, but OK. I like simple games like this that I can play while watching Netflix or something, and again, this one would be perfect, but it freezes up in the middle of levels all the time and I have to force quit, then start over.
