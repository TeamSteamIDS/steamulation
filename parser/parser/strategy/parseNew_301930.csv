 Target Audience:   Strategy Gamers who want a simple experience that has some small layers of depth Summary: Sometimes, the KISS principle in a strategy game is perfect for engaging gameplay, and the War of the Human Tanks – Limited Operations is a good example of that. While there are a couple of layers, everything comes down to a few basic actions, relying on you to maximize your fighting potential in unit placement and slow but steady actions of taking parts of the enemies field. The game does well in finding a balance in cautious gameplay with having most of your units able to permadie, but also forces you to be aggressive with the smartly placed timer that it's put on top of it. In addition, the game adds a layer on top of the typical strategy genre with having multiple command tanks at times, which directly affects your loss conditions, and forces you to choose if having one less overall unit is worth having a safety line in the game. And surprisingly, the story written here is actually interesting, in particular with the plot about the break down of the human tanks, and them wanting to fight on or find meaning in their existance. Now, by no means is the game perfect: it's very rough around the edges with small issues regarding map layout and not playing to its art styles full potential. But for the 10 dollar price tag, you get a reasonable strategy experience that keeps things simple yet still engaging, and you really can't ask for a lot more at that price. A good way to cap off the series.Video Review:

			Tank girls? What have I gotten myself into? This key was obtained from the publisher for review purposes. War is hell. Except when there's chibi tanks involved.		

 Lists: Positives: The KISS principle (aka Keep it simple stupid) is in full effect here. The simplification puts emphasis on unit placement and slowly taking the battlefield smartly but efficiently. The AI is reasonably competent. In most cases, they did what I perceived to be the right move, and rarely did it not take advantage of a hole you left in your defenses. Like the command tank system, especially when it introduces a second command tank. This allows for some more strategy and allows the player to be a little more tactical, as it directly effects loss conditions. Permadeath has an impact in an interesting way: you get reasonably reinforcements, but with units within class having different skills/weapons, you do have to consider every unit that you put on the field. The timer in maps are implemented well: forcing you to be aggressive without it being too overbearing. The plot point around the tanks losing the ability to fight is an interesting one, and leads to some uplifting themes about perseverance and fighting on even when things don't seem hopeful. Backdrop artwork forces the focus onto the characters, but are nicely done watercolored type painting. Like the fact that you can lose missions, and there were times I considered throwing a mission because I wanted to keep a tank or two alive for future ones. It's chibi tank girls. I mean, come on. It's chibi tank girls. Negatives:  Map layouts don't necessarily play to the strength of the gameplay. Due to the limited structure on the screen, early game moves are limited due to sheer numbers and open slots: aka, your soldiers are all  clumped together, and you will have to wait for your units to get out of the way of each other.  Confusing terminology in the plot. It may make sense if you played the original 2 games, but the Empire and Kingdom designations get rather confusing on who is who and what part you were actually a part of.   Felt like the game could have better explained its command tank mechanic at first. It relies on a lot of reading, as opposed to showing, and not telling.   Wish an enemy action forced a more distinct stop of the action, as several times I was clicking to check on a character, only to actually click through an enemy action. Was a little disorienting.  The game could have gotten more out of its art style by giving more emotions to characters in terms of artwork. The game relies on the writing to get more of the emotion across, which would be fine, if it wasn't using the chibi artstyle. Part of the appeal of chibi art is the exaggerated facial expressions, so that was an element it did miss out in.  This is a personal one, but while there are “branching” paths in the story, I'm not necessarily a fan of having to lose to get to them. Give me a choice or something.   Game has a bunch of options in the resolution portion of the windows menu, but I never could get it to work properly in terms of actually using those resolutions. The game basically defaults to 1280x720 for recording purposes. But those looking to record with Fraps or shadowplay: look elsewhere. "

												War of the Human Tanks – Limited Operations is the third game of the ‘War of the Human Tanks’ series. Developed by Yakiniku Banzai! and published onto steam in English by FruitBat Factory. This is a strategy game where you control Human Tanks – human-shaped tanks – and fight against other Human Tanks on the side of the hostile country.GameplaySeek out, charge and self-destruct to destroy your enemies in this strategy game! Lead your Human Tanks and complete your missions! Scout out the enemy and plan your strategy, but remember that your tanks will go down in one hit and be lost forever.Before a battle starts you will get to deploy and place your human tanks at spots on the map of course that comes to some planning, clumping them up is s smart choice because a shock tank could kill them all at once if you are not careful. Same as the opposite spread them far apart they will take a long time to move near the enemies and may die to a random blind shot made by the AI which sucks if your key unit gets taken down by a blind shot losing the whole battle instantly.Some things I would like to note is that sometimes the AI feels a too strong but sometimes the AI feels plain stupid in my experience so far. Lets take for example there are battles where I had and I was standing directly in front of the enemy and they did not attack my unit that was placed in front of them at all, instead they opted to attack a random spot with nothing on it which is kind of weird in my opinion.But overall gameplay wise it is enjoyable there is strategy which will be used and some luck may be involved like firing a blind shot and killing the opponent and then feeling the sense of saticfication that you just destroyed the opponent by pure luck.Key Features  Over 50 missions with strategic, semi real-time battles Challenging “Limits” to clear on all missions Countless cute Human Tanks to battle with and against Replay missions at any time to improve your rank English localization features hand-drawn battle backgrounds and an improved user interface Cute tanks To Sum UpWill I recommend War of the Human Tanks – Limited Operations? This is a tough one to answer if I were to give a verdict based on my personal taste I will be sanding on a neutral ground for this. However do go for it if you like strategy games and chibi art style.Full review click here[azusantiara.com] "

												The third instalment of the Human Tanks series, a game where you're a tank, a human one, it doesn't really make sense but who cares? It's fun, and it's absolutely adorable.			"

												If you're new to the WotHT series, it's great and I highly recommend it but this is the third game in the series so feel free to check out the previous two games first.If you're a WotHT veteran, this game plays exactly the same as the previous two but with one major twist in resource management. The ""Limited"" in the title refers to the fact that you aren't able to collect crates and build units as you please any more. You're given a limited supply of units for each mission. You do have two special units (well, one, really) which are Hotaru, who is played up as a powerful unit by the story but turns out to be a bog standard Command unit, and your actual special unit, a Mihari Scout unit, who has exceptional scouting abilities for the start of the game. Then you're given a handful of other units to choose from to deploy as you see fit.It doesn't seem to be a perma-death scenario, though. I haven't noticed any correlation between the units left over from the previous mission and the ones I start with on the next mission. Considering you can go back and replay missions without directly continuing from the previous one, I think it's safe to assume that's the case.I can't really say whether the new resource management is good or bad. On the one hand, I liked building up a super powerful squad and crushing my opponent but, on the other hand, it does take the strategy out of the game when you can simply scount the entire map and then level it all in one turn. It's a matter of balance and this time they balanced it for maximum strategy.Overall, it's still a great game for fans of the series so definately pick it up.			"

												This is only a review around the beginning of the game so I may add more later. Note that I haven't played the second game in this series due to various reasons that I won't even try to explain.If you've played the first game before, then you know that it's a real(ish) time strategy game with cute human tank chibi's fighting other cute human tank chibi's in the fictional land of Japon. One difference though is the lack of the ability to buy new human tanks (as far as I know) and the use of a limited amount of human tanks you can use in your arsenal.This kind of makes you want to switch somewhere from being aggressive (which usually causes waste which was fine in the first game since you can always buy more human tanks, but not here) to being a heavily defended turtle of your most valuable units (like Mihari the scout tank as a great example as she can be the key to winning if you know where that long range enemy unit/commander is) but you're also pressed for time to achieve victory so you always have to calculate for risk constantly whenever your units can move. You can always fire blindly into the fog of war the game has and chances are you'll get lucky in scoring a hit. Note that the enemy can also blindfire and get lucky as well.Graphics: Who cares? I don't for this game.Music/Sound: Personally, I think it's likely a rehash from the previous games for the majority of what I've played so far, but that's fine.One thing I currently find annoying is that it seems to be doing the opening animation and credit scene on each beginning and ending of a chapter. I have no idea is there's any changes in each chapter as each five to ten seconds of both of these seem the same.Now excuse me as I bite my thumb in worry and excitement of how to protect my human tanks as I try to beat this game.

												In the first game, it was a normal fightIn the Seccond game, it was facing horrifically overpowered units with tank specs dwarfing any in the first game fightAnd now they have struck at our heart.  There is no crate farming  There is no grinding for OP units However will we survive now?			"

												I'm going to write a lot of words about anime tanks because I really like this series and I don't think anyone else knows it exists.  The last game in the series, Limited Operations, has been out for around 9 months and has about a dozen reviews.  Here's a really long one and consider this a review for the series in general.The War of the Human Tanks series is essentially anime Battleship.  Fights are real time and pause when you click a unit to choose an action.  There's always a large fog of war and most units are of the one hit, one kill variety.  Tanks are of the mass-produced style, outside of a couple of special NPC's, and are permanently destroyed when killed in action.  Tanks can also equip modules that you can create which do things like increase shooting range and area, increase movement and so on.  Limited Operations changes the last few parts up, though.Unlike in the previous games, Limited Operations, as the title suggests, gives you a set of per-determined tanks for each fight.  You can no longer grind your way to high-level tanks and modules and literally wipe out the battlefield in a few actions.  This may be a turn off for some, but I found the new approach quite refreshing, and it made me use some tank units that I neglected a lot in previous games.  It was nice not to worry about making new tanks and outfitting them with modules and helped prevent the party screen from getting too cluttered.The biggest increase in usage for me were scout units.  Previously, it just didn't make much sense to use a scout in place of an assault tank, since it was better to have killing power over uncovering the fog of war.  LO doesn't give you many powered-up units, thus scoping out the battlefield and making more strategic use of your scouts in combination with your slow, long-range artillery units become a tactic I used way more than before.  I still don't bother with shock units but I liked the challenge the LO provided and I'd say it's the most finely tuned game in the series difficulty-wise due the nature of the troop dispersal.Another big aspect of the WotHT games is the story.  There's a lot of talking, like a lot of talking.  The in-between fight scenes are basically visual novel-type story telling with large-headed characters talking in front of some filtered real-life imagery.  This could be really bad, but I ended up surprisingly enjoying the story parts of the previous games.  LO though is the least compelling of the lot.  The initial story is somewhat confusing and there's a bit too much focus on characters with generic portraits to care about it too much.  It's okay, but I liked the other games story parts more.Another cool thing WotHT does is provide alternate routes in a cool way.  The first game had branching storylines that changed depending on whether you win or lose certain fights.  It's cool as hell when a game continues in a different manner if you lose rather than just getting a game over, and I didn't expect it when I played the first game.  The sequel doesn't really do this as much, but it has a massive extra dungeon which is way longer than the main game and has its own story and unique tank units.  LO is sort of in between, the game does continue whether you lose or win certain fights, but there's only one fight in particular that will result in a different storyline.  It's still cool and I wish more games did stuff like that.  Like the other games in the series, LO has a bunch of unlockable bonus fights.The soundtracks for these games is....something else.  There are some eclectic choices to say the least.  It's better to experience it for yourself.Onward to the negatives.  I said earlier that LO is probably the most challenging game in the series because you can't just grind powerful tanks and modules to bypass strategy, and for the most part that's a good thing.  The problem is that some fights feel a bit more like puzzles than strategy in the sense they feel like they were designed with very specific tactics in mind.  Fights in the series have always had time limits, but they were almost never an issue.  In LO, the clock is definitely something you have to keep an eye on.  I lost a number of fights due to running out of time after it being a near non-issue before.  This is kind of a good and bad thing, but certain fights do feel like they could use a bit more time to them, especially if you're trying to S rank all the missions and clear the action limits.The other two downsides are kind of minor, but annoying nevertheless.  One is a long-standing problem (since the original game) and it's that the episode intro/outro do not ever play the first time I come across them when I turn on the game.  There's audio but no visual.  This has happened since the first game, I have done everything I can to alleviate the problem and I'm computer literate, but no matter the computer I play it on, they never run right the first time, but will do so every time after.  The second problem is that LO sometimes starts to chug and slow down to an unplayable pace until I quit and restart.  This never happened in the other games but I've run into it a few times in LO.  Oh, and I wish the unit placement screen was combined with you tank roster screen so you could see both at the same time when deploying tanks.In conclusion,  the WotHT series is a  fun, light strategy set of games that are extremely wordy and feature crazy soundtracks.  It plays relatively fast and has a good bit of content in each game.  I've always liked strategy-rpgs and this series really itched a scratch I've had for moving units around on a grid and killing stuff.  If the simple art-style and wordiness of it doesn't turn you off, it's worth giving the series a chance, especially since the first game has been bundled a dozen times or so and is likely sitting in your game library without you realizing it.

												This is the third game in the War of the Human Tanks trilogy, and, as such, this is my third time through the whacky world of adorable chibi girl genocide. It takes place in the ‘fictional’ country of Japon, (which I’ve already made fun of twice so will cut some slack towards today) which is nearing the end of a brutal civil war. It’s just that rather than get their own hands dirty, each side have produced an army of cute robot girls who march out to their deaths in the people’s stead. But they’re robots so that’s okay, right? I mean, sure, they’re technically sentient but they’re usually less intelligent than the average human, so them being blown up in mass numbers isn’t that much of a loss. They’re more like interactive chess pieces, with assault rifles and grenade launchers. That form unique opinions and attachments and smile faintly at you as you order them to their demise.There’s a lot of text to run through during a Human Tanks game, most of it dealing with the politics of the war mixed in with a healthy dosage of anime tropes, which leaves the creeping feeling of unease commanding a disposable army to grow on you organically. The tanks don’t really mind dying; they were only created to suffer a flashy death on the battlefield, but it’s hard not grow attached or be a little freaked out by their endearing naivety or genuine affection towards you, their commander.It’s doubly hard to send your Tanks to their doom in Limited Operations which stays true to its byline by limiting the crap out of your forces and giggling behind its hand as it watches you squirm. In the two previous games, grinding your way to victory was a definite possibility. Back then, you could replay old missions as often as you pleased and use the funds gained from your infinite sorties to bolster your ranks with high powered Tanks, or plough resources into research and development to ensure you always had the most advanced army in the fight. Lose that awesome attack tank that could dual wield assault rifles or that scout tank with the insane recon range? Not a problem. You could rebuild them. You could make them stronger. That’s no longer an option.Full Review // http://www.honestgamers.com/13089/pc/war-of-the-human-tanks-limited-operations/review.html "

Now they are gone :( I am going to finish the series afterall, but without all the laughters... this is why splinter cell: Chaos theory is so much fun.

												The third and the last game of Human Tanks trilogy. Not as good as Alter, but still a nice game.While the mechanics stay the same, for each mission you have a set amount of tanks to choose from. So there's no more developing tanks and modules for your liking. For like half of the game it's really annoying, since the enemy is always stronger and you don't have access to the quick scouts or assaults tanks which otherwise you could develop in previous game. Because of this, you have to change your strategy for this game. In pevious titles you always wanted to rush in and kill the enemy before he kills you. Here you have to take more cautious approach with multiple scout tanks (no Koharu for you!). Of course,  you will still sometimes lose because of random Shock tank blowing up in your face or stray artillery.Late game and bonus missions are much more interesting - you have better units, although not too many, so you have to plan ahead  the deployment, etc.The addition of Limits and mission ranks is nice, but not really a gamechanger.Overall, if you liked the previous Human Tanks game, you will almost surely enjoy this one as well.
