												So Not The Robots is essentially a stealth roguelike, where, rather than lurking through dungeon tunnels or planning turns, you're evading sentry bots, avoiding lasers, and myriad other hazards as you progress through procedurally generated floors. Your uni-wheeled robot can roll fast to quickly break line of sight of armed sentries or keep up with a moving laser grid, as well as crouch to hide behind obstacles and avoid other dangers. To complete a floor, your robot must devour a set amount of furniture per level to unlock the exit and there in lies the strategy. Removing furniture means less places to hide, less barriers to block lasers, and makes getting to the exit that much more challenging. You have limited health and your only course of action when seen is to run and hide. Besides your natural hiding skills, you can collect a limited use ability, from going invisible (but motionless) to placing a block down which you can hide behind. You can only equip one ability at a time and they can be used once before having to recharge (by eating furniture) so they must be used tactically and at the most opportune moment. Multipliers, logs that gradually piece together the story behind the game, health packs can also be found throughout each levelBesides the procedurally generated campaign, there are also 20 challenge levels to test your skills, so there's something for the speed-run fan as well. In both the campaign and challenges, you earn more points for not being seen, for collecting multipliers, and speed among other factors. Controls are smooth and responsive. WASD to move, mouse to move the camera, other keys to crouch, use your selected ability. Gameplay is a mix of fast paced planning and maneuvering and evasive sneaking around obstacles to avoid enemies: procedurally stealth with a dash of puzzle elements (as planning what furniture to remove or not remove will help your escape, especially since sentry patrols will change once you open new paths).---After playing a bit more:- There are upgrades found throughout the levels, providing things from an extra inventory slot (so you can two abilities rather than just one) and a scanner to see what abilities are contained in a box- Found some cool new abilities. Dig lets you remove a wall and Sprint give you a few seconds of boosted speed. Dig is especially cool because it lets you alter the layout of a level, opening up new paths for you (and sentries) to use- You also get extra points for eating all furniture and taking no damage. Upon death, you rank up and can unlock permanent upgrades- The variety of hazards continue to impress. From moving energy walls with openings to pass through (giving the game almost a puzzle platformer vibe) to damaging floor pads, the challenge is very high			"

												I've only just started with this fabulous little gem, but already completely hooked. So without giving too much away (since the game developer clearly loves his secrets!), this is basically a tight stealth game, where you are zipping around randomly generated levels picking up 'loot' as you go. The brilliant, brilliant twist is this: that loot is your cover, the only thing keeping you hidden from lasers, levitating skulls of death, and - as the levelling system has assured me - 'nastier things'. So that's twist #1. You have to pick up your 'loot' (AKA 'food', AKA 'furniture) very carefully, since any cover you yank is cover permanently deleted. Yikes! Yet to leave the level you will have to grab a certain amount of it.Then it starts getting crazier. For one thing, new objectives get added. NOW you have to go through a series of ordered points, scattered randomly through the level. NOW you have to 'tag' every enemy on the map by getting close and using an item - scary stuff. Mysterious laptops provide a gateway to the game's cryptic story of business skullduggery and a strong feeling of conspiracy.And, like my favorite kind of rogue-like (sometimes called rogue-lite, I believe), the game changes each time you play. But maybe it should be called rogue-heavy in this case, because the game doesn't get easier (through 'upgrades') so much as harder (new elements, new ENEMIES). Of course, you also get to unlock special challenges (pre-designed maps with tailored problems to solve) and special runs. Some of these provide more 'XP' to continue advancing; some are just for the glory.All of this is to say that Not The Robots is a fantastic, fun, panicky stealth game, pure and simple. There are no weapons (at least, so far), there is limited cover, and there are plenty of lasers and drones to end your run with a foolhardy step. I'm a glutton for this kind of finely-crafted punishment...are you? ;)			"

												I love Not The Robots, and here’s why you should too:First and foremost: Nothing is sacred. You can’t just run from one piece of cover to another. Instead, you actually have to destroy your cover to progress through the game. I can’t emphasize how amazing this is – there’s so much more depth than just waiting for guards to move along a set path and running from A to B. Do you start eating from the start, clearing out room after room, or do you go to one end of the map and only eat on your way back? Ideally, you should eat as little as you can while still fulfilling the objective, but of course that’s easier said than done.The next amazing thing is that slow and methodical play is equally effective as straight-up YOLO running and gunning. The game doesn’t reward recklessly aggressive play any more than it does painstakingly slow play, it only rewards skillful play. Mechanics like eating your cover, inventory management, procedurally generated levels, and random sentry movement all emphasize calculated risks and culminate to create a huge skill ceiling. As a result, any playstyle (even the extreme ones!) can be successful, as long as you know what you’re doing.Finally, the game’s ambiance is perfect. The in-game music “consists of 70 loops which are dynamically mixed together.” It sounds weird, but basically there are a couple of tracks looping which can switch on the fly depending on the current situation. When you’re safe, it plays a nice and eerie theme, but when you’re spotted it becomes faster, louder and more rhythmic. What’s really impressive though is that you don’t even notice this change – each loop flows seamlessly from one situation to the next, and yet it still adapts immediately. Back to the ambiance, haha. Most levels have a dark and off-gray color pallet. It sounds boring, but just like the music it fulfills two requirements: It creates an ominous and tense atmosphere which works incredibly well in the game’s favor, and it’s pretty much as unintrusive as physically possible.One last thing I have to say is that this game is an example of randomness done phenomenally well. There are few enough random elements to count on one hand, and yet they all work in tandem to make this game everything it is. Level generation: This is pretty standard for roguelikes, random levels add replayability and make it so you can never know what you’re dealing with ahead of time. Items and upgrades: Each item has a clear-cut situational use and nothing is ever strictly better than any single other option, except maybe Dig+ and Blocks+. The items are balanced enough that decisions like Dig vs Teleport, Stun vs Blocks, and even Invisible vs Invisible+ are almost never easy ones. Is it worth keeping a half-charged Invisible+, or can Sprint fulfill the same role immediately? Like the level generation, it emphasizes dealing with the situation you’re given with the tools you find. For upgrades, my only complaint is multiplier is mechanically useless. Scanners and Inventory both have their merits – sure, having up to five items is great, but there are always situations where it’s hugely helpful to know what’s in a box in the corner of an empty room. Enemies, especially Sentries: If there’s one thing you’ll quickly find out, it’s that Sentries are a b*tch. They have a formidable line of sight, they can teleport furniture away from you, and they move randomly with no set path? Good heavens! However, I have to admit I love Sentries. I’d even go as far as to say they single-handedly make the game what it is. Every other enemy is extremely predictable and easily avoidable, or both. Adequate cover and charged items are all you need to be well-equipped for an encounter, and even without that you can reasonably run into safety if you can think on your feet.This part extends to all enemies: The game is completely fair. While the later levels no doubt incredibly challenging to say the least, you have three to four buildings to prepare before that. Any combination of items you like, within reason, can be found in 9 out of 10 games before you even have to worry about tagging anything. You have to work for it, though – is that item across the room a teleport you so desperately need, and are you willing to get rid of your trusty Blocks+ to find out? It’s a calculated risk – it could just as easily be another Dig. No matter what, however, nothing in the first four buildings is ever a death sentence. Got three Stuns? Put them in doorways and you can eat like a maniac. Three Blocks? Cool, you have permanent cover wherever you want. Three Digs? Great, you can get to any part of the level in the shortest path possible. Three Sprints? Congratulations, you can literally run away from your problems. Realistically, of course, some levels will always be easier than others, but overall any situation is workable. It’s all about dealing with the situation you’re given with the tools you find, and death is always caused by a mistake by the player. I’d go as far to say that it’s possible to go through the whole campaign with no items without taking any damage. Accomplishing this, however, is an exercise left to the reader.This game is really amazing, and I love darn near everything about it. You should try it.My comprehensive guide to Not the Robots "

												Excellent game that tries a lot of interesting mechanics I haven't seen before, and pulls them off very well.It's a procedurally generated stealth game where you must consume your cover to progress. The guards have unlimited sight range and their patrol patterns change on the fly. This makes the game enjoyably tense, and the procedural generation churns out a fair bit of variety. Being spotted is not an automatic death sentence, and scrambling to meet the level goal while pursued by alert guards is a common occurence and a big part of the game's appeal.The procedural level generation works surprisingly well for a stealth game - everything from layouts to cover to enemy composition to level goals is put together from random parts, resulting in levels that shake up your tactics (or are borderline impossible on higher difficulties). The layouts of levels, cover and guards vary dramaticallyThe game can be described as ""layered"" - the more you play it and the further you progress, the more layers unlock. More enemies, items and hazards in the campaign, more optional challenges, and more story elements. Even as the campaign ""levels up"" and becomes harder, you can still control it with difficulty levels, which range from ""relatively stress-free"" to ""not even remotely fair"".The story deserves a separate mention. It's completely optional and out of the way - in fact, you'll need to put some effort into putting it all together  - but it completely changes the atmosphere of the game. Your first impression of the game will be that of an goofy, arbitrary world where you are are a robot that sneaks around eating furniture in office buildings.  As the story comes together, it justifies most of game's arbitrary mechanics and reveals the game world as somewhat dark place.The game explores its ideas to the fullest, and feels like a labor of love the developer enjoyed working on. I normally dislike rogue-lite games, but I had a blast with this one.			"

												Not The Robots is a breath of fresh air, and has some of the most tense stealth gameplay I've seen in a while. You play as a table leg on a ballpoint, being a complete jerk that eats all the office furniture. It does not allow you to get comfortable and swing into a set pattern when you start collecting cool toys. No, it throws a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥at you, and it keeps throwing more and more variables at you until you have to become a robot contortionist just to get to the next level. The game has a point system that unlocks more terrifying♥♥♥♥♥♥along with cool toys and audio logs (that slowly tell a story that doesn't really come together until the last two are collected), but it still won't allow you to beat the game easily.So what are the things that make me want to throw shade on it? The level randomization will occasionally laugh in your face and dump a bunch of obstacles at the beginning of the level. Sentries have unlimited line-of-sight, which makes stealth harder than it needs to be. And the experience point system should be turned off once all the cool XP-related bonuses are collected, because it gets in the way once it's no longer needed in more ways than one (end-of-level bonus boxes contain all sorts of neat stuff! Including multiplier bonuses, whether you want them or not!)All of these are minor quibbles. Not The Robots is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fantastic, relentless, and it won't ♥♥♥♥ing let up on you until you die or you kill it.			"

												Kind of wish I didn't have to give this game a thumbs down, since it's not a bad game. But just that there's not enough content to stay interesting for long. The novelty of the idea seems to wear off pretty fast and there's nothing much else to the game apart from it.You play as a robot that travels from one office building to another with a single goal - to eat furniture. Not sure why exactly (we don't get a reason). However, there are dangers, ranging from unusually placed laser-beams which can only hurt you, but do not cut through anything else, some kind of floor heaters that switch on and off repeatedly, and sentries in a shape of floating robot heads that shoot at you. I kind of wish all these things had a reason to exist. Maybe they do, but it just is not apparent why in any way.The levels are all randomly generated since it's a rogue-like. You also do not recover any health in between levels. So if you finished one level on low health, you'll continue on from the next one with the same health. Luckily you do occasionally find med boxes that can heal you, but again, it all depends on luck if one will spawn in the level or not.You also get to find various gadgets which can help you, like letting you sprint, or place blocks to hide behind, or dig through a wall, or become invisible. These are all good, but you can only ever carry one at a time (unless you get lucky and find an upgrade that lets you have more), and if you want to pick another one up, you have to permanently drop your current one. One of my biggest gripes is that you can never see what the item inside the box is, so you've no idea if it's better than your current item or not. Again, you just have to get lucky.Visuals are very nice in this game, but I am not a big fan of the music. It was a bit jarring. The sense of humour seems quite nice too. The game has a nice light-hearted feel to it.As I said, it's not a bad game, but I don't feel it has enough content or excels much at what it does for me to recommend it. If you are into rogue-likes or stealth games, you might like it. Probably best to get it on sale, like I did.			"

												If you've ever played the Ultimate Assassin series on Kong, and enjoyed it, you'll enjoy this too. A stealth game with an interesting mechanic; you must eat your own cover (the furniture) to clear a level. Not all of it must go however, so planning ahead is key, and the patient are rewarded. Close calls are common, even at the early levels, and you will need to have both wit and reflexes in order to survive. Features some great abilities to choose from, such as invisibility, removing walls (which are otherwise inedible), placing immovable blocks, teleportation, sprinting, as well as some others. Using the abilities are risk however; in order to activate them again, you must recharge them by eating furniture, so you really want to use them when you need it most. The AI performs brilliantly, making me hate the sentry bots for their perceptibility, yet still feel fair, for they mess up occasionally. The aesthetic is what really gets to me. It is obvious from the get-go that you have been dropped into some dystopian robot future. As I haven't completed the game yet, I don't know what our purpose is behind eating furniture, but throughout gameplay, the game drops subtle hints as to what might have happened, through the snippets of conversations (which are voice-acted quite well), logs, and advertisements of a dead civilization. It's subtle, it's dark, but most of all, it's creepy. There were a few things that got on my nerves however. First off, the game has a leveling system, in which you gain experience each time you die, based on your performance in the previous playthrough. Every level grants you a permanent upgrade. Unfortunately, I can't seem to find a list of my upgrades anywhere, or else I am just missing it entirely. The tutorial is extremely short, which always gets on my nerves, even more so then extremely long tutorials. Granted, it is a simple game, so you shouldn't have many problems picking up the pieces that the tutorial failed to. Lastly, it would have been nice if they included some tooltips or any information on the differences between campaign, challenges, and operations. Tooltips for other functions would have been nice as well, however they are somewhat self explanatory. All in all, a good game, well worth the price as it stands now at $6. At $10, however, it might not be everyones cup o' tea, althoguh I personally would buy it again at that price.			"

												This is a wonderful rogue-like procedurally-generated stealth-oriented game with brilliant mechanics, nice graphics and a good sense of humor going for it. The machines have taken over this office building and somehow you, an exclamation-mark-looking robot with a remarkable appetite for office furniture, are the only one able (and willing) to look into it and discover the truth waiting on the last floor.In order to beat each stage and access the next one you'll be required to consume a certain amount of furniture, but here's the catch, the only way to avoid lasers and sentinels' line of sight is to duck behind those same piece of furniture. So yeah, it's not like you can run around consuming whatever you stumble upon. Luckily the game will try to ease up your time by providing rechargeable assets like stuns, teleportation, temporary invisibility and even means to modify the stage itself. In addition to the standard campaign you'll also find challanges (set number of floors with certain conditions/limitations) and operations (speedrunners-friendly stages exploiting a particular asset/trap)NOTE: there is no character evolution, but you do earn XP which levels up the campaign itself, thus unlocking/upgrading traps and unlocking new assets. At the very beginning, with low levels campaigns, there will be little variety in enemy types, making early runs a little sentinel-heavy, but don't give up, get some more XP and the problem will solve itself right away!!

												Masterpiece !This is ""how to make a procedural game 101""There are really few gameplay mechanics. You'll have to eat office furnitures avoiding security drones and laser. To do so you can crouch to hide, use bonus items you picked up. And that's pretty much it. Simple yet effective.Really well balanced procedural level generation. The difficulty grows up painlessly, there is no big spike in the difficulty curve. Every level feels different and makes sense. It feels pretty organic.The story is told thourght log journal you'll gather throught your multiple runs.So if you want to know everything you'll have to play it multiple times. Yet the story is completly facultative. It' worth noting that the audio dubbing of the logs are nailed too.Visually and aurally, the ambience is really quiet, because of this you'll press the ""new game"" button multiple times without noticing it.Controls are tight.And there is even a touch of humor every now and then, in the logs, on the poster, etcPlus, there are multiple game modes, challenge levels, ""campaign"", and classic proccedural levels.It's a flawless game.

												I like this game. Graphics are nice, controls are responsive. Original concept is what got me.But I'm already tired of it. This could be because either: 1) I suck at stealth furniture eating games. 2) This game is so frustrating that it overshadows the fun.I think it is a little of both. But I'm not invested enough in this game to put myself through hours of trying to sneak through an empty room occupied by 6 sentries to get to a level good enough for building 6.I understand there has to be difficulty, but in my opinion (and that's all it is) this is discouraging. I don't feel that ""Oooo so close"" feeling that drives you to try again. I have made it to building 4 in almost every playthrough and to building 5 once. Finishing the level by running (or rather ""wheeling"") through at top speed picking up what I could grab as multiple sentries fling bullets at me.Thats not stealth. There is not enough furniture for stealth at that point. Its about run-n-gun.I'm happy I bought it, but happier I got it on sale. I'll play it again, maybe something will change. But as I now have no problem forfeiting the game rather than fight through a pointless level. I'd rather try FTL, then at least I can play for an hour and learn something I can use the next playthrough.			"

												I hate to give a bad review because so much about this game is good. The graphics function well, the controls are good, the music is fairly good (it always reminds me of Reckoner by Radiohead) but there's a killer: the sentry robots who oppose you on later levels appear to move randomly. This is death to any stealth strategy. You can hide behind something, but maybe they'll come around and see you, maybe they won't. You can slip past when you're not looking, but maybe they'll turn to see you just as you do, maybe they won't. This can definitely affect fun: maybe you'll be stuck waiting for several minutes while a sentry tracks back and forth along the same path, or maybe it'll leave the area right away. Given the rest of the game I'm surprised this happened because this is a fairly fundamental design error.			"

												Not great but certainly far from bad, a neat little game about being a stealthy robot who eats all the furniture and appliances in offices. There are a few hazards and obstacles to avoid, the game throws out different powers for you to pick up and use to make your way around the level easier and your health carries over from floor to floor.In a sense it is something of a roguelike, especially considering the overarching levelling system that slowly unlocks more powers and upgrades along with the randomly generated floors.Fun to mess around with and for the right person it may just scratch the right itch. I wouldn't be racing out to buy a copy any time soon but if it's cheap or you get it in a bundle it's worth throwing in an hour or two for a laugh.			"

 You are a defenseless robotic exclamation mark valiantly trying to help hoarders declutter their office by eating their furniture. Your goal is to collect enough food to move to the next level or the next office building while dodging rotating lasers, staying out of sight of patrolling floating robot skulls, navigating moving barriers and other obstacles. There are other objectives you will need to complete as well as collecting enough food, like: tagging the rotating lasers and activating sequenced floor plates. You can collect powerups like 1-ups, the ability to become invisible and place blocks, and eat walls (the most useful one). The story is told through auidologs and it's mostly played for laughs, it's pretty entertaining. The graphics are really slick and the music/sound is passable. The really novel thing, besides the premise, is how the difficulty levels up with you - this is a cool idea and makes you play carefully but it does tend to leave you unfulfilled when you have your best run and still can't reach the last level and realize your chances of reaching it in future runs just got worse. As you progress you also unlock challenges, which are mostly just frustrating, and perks for the different powerups. The stealth aspect is clever, you have to balance eating furniture and leaving furniture to hide behind and block lasers. All the obstacles work really well - except the skull bots, they're really unpredictable and difficult to evade. Unless you flow like water they will annoy the crap out of you in the later levels where there can be 6+ of them.  In short, this game is worth playing but you should catch it on sale. PS - check out 2DArray's earlier game Company of Myself, it's a really awesome free flash game that'll make you ponder life, the universe and everything.			"

When you play the game you start to regret it.The game features a wide veriet of security features to keep robots like you out, but the one that's going to drive you mad the easiest and fastest is the Sentries.  They have a completely random patrol pattern and can see you from all the way across the room should nothing be between you two.  They're easy enough work around if you have enough cover, but the core gameplay mechanic of this game is that you eat that stuff away, leading to them going from being a slight inconvienence to the bane of your existance.Another thing about this game is that when you lose a run, it will add up all the points you've earned during and unlock special permenate upgrades once you've collected enough.  But a lot of the upgrades you can unlock only make the game more dificult.  Why?  I though I was supposed to be spending my hard earned XP to make games easier.  If I wanted more of a challenge in my next run, I'd just turn up the dificulty settings.But the biggest problem you'll have with this game is the fact that it's randomly generated.  I can understand that it's supposed to make it so that no two runthroughs are alike, but that give it a high probability for the game to feel like it's actually dicking with you.  Some runthoughs you'll get a max inventory and every item you'll need to tackle any building with an even number, other's you'll get jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ turning you into the sentry's target practice.  This causes the game to be so difficult I can't get past Building 4 on the lowest possible dificulty.			"

												Good for the first few hours, but after a while it becomes a bit repetative (the procedurally generated levels helps prolong how long it takes, but it still happens) and as the enemies become more and more difficult (the more you play even the first level is more difficult than the first time you played) the game becomes more and more frustrating rather than more and more rewarding.  Since it is a stealth game make sure you are prepared tospend a lot of time waiting.I think a niche audience will love this game, but general audiences will not get more than a few hours of gameplay.Pros:Procedurally generated levels increases replayability timeCons:Not a lot of control over difficulty (easiest difficulty gets more difficult)Increasing game difficulty discourages doing well in game to delay levelingSomewhat clumys controls.  (Not too bad but more than once I have eaten my cover when not meaning to)			"

												let's start with what rocks:+fun running around, collecting furniture, dodging lasers+early on, you can feel awesome for dodging the sentries. And what doesn't work:-infinite robot sight range-hard to parse how furniture blocks line of sight (sometimes you're crouching behind a desk with no backing, sometimes you are seen, sometime not...)-Random robot movement, with little indication of routesI think these challenges would be fine in a game like invisible Inc, where you can guage what's possible, but here you're constantly stymied by a sight range you couldn't see. Add to that some fairly week ""story"" clips found through levels, and I just can't recommend it. Go play invisble inc, and play smart.			"

Stealth and rogue-like hybridYou play as a a thin robot who has an appetitie for office furniture. Your goal is to consume a certain amount of furniture before moving to the exit to move onto the next room. The problem though, is that there are plenty of traps, guard bots and towers which try to destroy you. This is where the stealth element plays a factor. You have no weapons to defend yourself, however you can avoid enemy partrols by hiding behind office furniture  (yes the ones you need to consume) and crouching. Crouching limits you visibility to patrols, but also reduces your movement speed. There are also items you can pick up which can heal you, make you invisible, create cover etc. Some such items require you consume a certain amount of furniture before you can use them again. When you are spotted by sentry bot you won't die immeditely, instead you will be pusued and gunned down  unless you can find cover quickly. After you die, your score will be used to unlock new items, upgrades and game modes when you have scored enough amoungst multiple play throughs (this is a good factor in keeping you playing the game over and over again). There isn't much story to the game. As said previously, you're basically a robot who has to consume a certain amount of office furniture in each room. After a certain amount of rooms are cleared, you move onto the next building which has more rooms to clear. The closest resemblance to a plot, in the game, are audio recordings which tell a tale about some office workers. However, the problem is that you won't have a clue what is going on until you have all the recordings.In the game, there is limited audio. During gamplay 'quiet' music is played, which is alright because it's a stealth game. However, when you are spotted and hunted by sentries the music doesn't change at all. As such there is a loss of protential to create a more tense atmosphere for players to try not to get spotted. The only voice acting in the game are audio recordings,  but they are spoken in 'Robotic monotone' and don't sound great at all.The level design is good. In the early levels you find yourself in a small room with a couple of towers, small food goal and relatively easy to finish. However as you progress through the campaign, you will face more enemies, larger rooms and more complex goals (ie having to to consume food and forfill a sequence in order to proceed). There is plenty of room to move around and items to hide behind, which is excellent for a stealth game as it gives you opportunity to plan your route. I guess the game is alright, but for some reason I wasn't compelled to keep playing this game unlike other rogue-likes. The game may not get you hooked, but you can pick this up if you REALLY like stealth gameplay with limited story.			"

												I really, really wish I could like this game. I love stealth, I love robots, and I love randomly generated stuff. The developer of the game is the guy behind The Company of Myself, one of my favorite games when I was a wee middle schooler on Kongregate. This game has a very inventive idea, a stealth game where you must destroy your own cover in order to progress. But this game shows that randomly generated rooms and stealth is NOT a good combination. It is frequently straight-up unfair or frustrating to play most levels. It had never really occured to me before, but a good stealth game requires a whole lot of meticulous level design in order to make the level work. When a level is quite literally just strewn together, all of that meticulous planning done to balance challenge and ingenuity is thrown out the window. Stealth and RNG simply do not mix, and I do not like this game; not for the fault of the author or the game itself, but the very premise of the game just doesn't work. It is very easy for a level to straight up ♥♥♥♥ you over, trap you in a tiny room with a sentry that you literally CANNOT avoid and you MUST get spotted in order to progress, and since there is no set route that the sentries follow, you can be literally stuck waiting a good five minutes for the sentry to look away long enough just to move to the other side of the room. Things like that, things that turn a good idea into a gimmick into a chore. It is not fun to play, as much as I wish it was. This is just an example of a good idea unfortunately making a poor game. Perhaps with better coding for the level generation or more forgiving sentry AI this game could be a lot better.			"

												Not The Robots is like Katamari with tactics. There are enemies you have to take into consideration so you can't just rush off and eat everything you see. Other than that there are power-ups like invisibility which you'll desperately need in order to advance. The game plays like a roguelike so if you die it's game over. You will level up eventually allowing you to store more items and things like that. All in all Not The Robots is decent. It isn't my favorite game by a longshot and it will never appear in any of my top 10 lists, but it's kinda fun for short sessions.[Rating: 68/100]			"

												This is a game that I did not choose to buy, it came with some sort of gift bundle from a friend and I was kinda bumped and sceptical about it. To be honest the only reason I installed this game was to get the card drops...but then I started playing it. It's well built with humorous tips and witty stories. Engine looks great, no graphics issues, with smooth movement and actions.The story itself is quite peculiar and intriguing never seen something like that. Adding up the fact that everytime you pass a level the game levels up and not you, leading to a challenging  (and I have to say sometimes frustrating!) amount of diffuculty, you have one of the best indie puzzle strategy, or whatever you want to call it, game! Moreover Not The Robots keeps you on your toes at all times and makes you think thoroughly before your every move thus providing great brain exercise!			"

												This game has a lot of content, it would be cool if the base game itself didn't suck.There are two kinds of levels; levels with guards and levels without.Levels without guards are easy, pointless, a waste of time. Levels with guards though are very luck based. If a guard sees you, it will shoot you immedietly, no warning, and then stay in an enraged mode for the rest of the level, when in this mode they will shoot on sight, and vaporise cover, which will only respawn after a minute or so. Judging that you have to eat that cover to finish the level, it feels like a waste of time. You think the guards would go and investigate where you are? No actually, they just go around depending on where RNG (random number generation) takes them! Think you have a good plan, like in any other good stealth game, like Mark of the NInja, or invisible inc? Too bad, because theres a 90% chance that the guard will just turn around at some random moment or vaporise some cover your using. If the plan does work, your probably waiting three or four minutes untill it can work. The whole game just takes a long time, from waiting for guards to be in the right place, to waiting for cover that you have to eat to clear the level to respawn. There is an ability that makes it so you are invisible forever untill you start moving. Forever! This game is like rolling a dice untill you get two sixes in a row, then you can make a move and finish the level.I think that the game would get better if the community wanted the devs to make it, they already added lots of game content that would fit nicely with an actually good game, but the game is dead, and the last update was around 2014, and when I write this review its 2016. The game is dead, and the devs couldn't even make it better before giving up and trashing it. Nice job devs, you have loads of extra content and challenges for a game that isn't even enjoyable.			"

tl;dr -> If you want to play as a sadistic Roomba gone mad with a binge eating disorder (without the purging), then this is your game! 11/10 power to the robots, ♥♥♥♥ the humans!A good friend gave me this game, and I now want to (secretly) kill him for that. Not the Robots is easily one of the best staples for the rogue-like genres. The game literally punishes you for playing and levelling up. I love it.If you like rogue-likes, action/stealth-based gameplay, eating furniture, and being relentlessly punished, then you MUST play this game. Seriously, any rogue-like lover/enthusiast has to try this game. You will not be disappointed. The aesthetics are good - the amount of detail in the environment and different furniture types is well-done. The music and sounds are decent, however, I quickly muted all sounds and played my own. The soundtrack makes me think of old school elevator music, but I did feel like it added to the vibe of the game appropriately. There are random sound bites you can find that add a bit of extra lore to the game, and they are interesting if you take the time to listen.The controls are simple and easy to familiarize yourself with. There is no tutorial, but feedback is given when you first start to explain how to get going. The learning curve is minimal to brutal, depending on your experience with rogue-likes. I unlocked an extra difficulty level, so my slider currently has 6 levels to choose from (trust me, the max difficulty I can play on is ridiculous and sadistic). There is a main campaign, operations, and challenges (the latter two are a bit similar) - adding massive replayability to the game. I've played with both the keyboard&mouse and a controller, and this is one of the few games where I actually prefer the keyboard&mouse combo, but this is a matter of preference. The game is very responsive with either.During gameplay, you must progress through different buildings, each with a total of 2 floors. Every even-numbered building has sentries, which patrol the area and will attack you on sight. I have made it up to level 6, then died horribly. Your goal (initially) is to eat enough furniture to satisfy your counter at the bottom right of your screen - once you do this, you may return to the teleporter/elevator you spawned in to proceed to the next area. Larger pieces count for more points, however, they can also act as valuable cover against hazards like lazers (shoot out and move in a circle pattern) and sentries. Whenever you start a floor, you are able to look around the map with what looks like a camera feed before deploying with spacebar - and this is extremely helpful when sentries are patrolling near your starting area (you can wait for a better opportunity before spawning). Items, bonuses, and health may be present in the floor. You can initially carry only one item, however, a ""+1 to max inventory slot"" bonus exists. You can eat items (blue or light blue boxes) if you want a different one - in fact, you get a bonus to your score for eating a 1-up. Items may also include things like teleport (I only recently realized you can hold the mouse down and literally teleport anywhere in the map), armor (decreases damage taken from all hazards), and sprint (brief speed boost). There are upgraded versions of most items (light blue boxes), which are unlocked as you gain experience from playing (more on this later). Bonuses are in green boxes and can only be accessed once you fulfil the floor requirements (the elevator and your gauges will shine green when you can exit the level). Bonuses can include things like score/experience multipliers (always increases by .50%) and scanners, which will reveal a random item box per level for each scanner you possess. Health is stackable, however, there is a decreasing upper limit depending on the difficulty you are playing on - in normal (easiest), you start with 100hp and the max is 200. As you progress through buildings, you will encounter additional floor requirements besides your increasing ""hungry count"" (how much furniture you need to eat). First, you will also need to touch markers in descending order - you initially only have to go from 3 to 1, but later will have to go from 5 to 1. Combined with the presence of sentries, this can be quite the daunting task. If you can make it past these buildings, the checkpoint requirement will be swapped with a ""tagging"" one (the tagger will take an inventory slot but can be dropped and picked up again at will) - here, you will have to tag every hazard (except for sentries) on the floor. Sounds fun, right?Yes, if you are a masochist.Now, on to the best part, and the element that makes this one of my favorite rogue-likes. Whenever you die, your score/experience is calculated and you slowly level up (multipliers are given based on the difficulty you play on). You get bonuses to your score/experience for doing things like: eating a 1-up, getting a ""max food"" (eat all furniture on the floor) buff, or achieving a ""no damage"" run (do not lose a single HP). As you level up, you will unlock things like better items (chance of upgraded items spawning on a floor) and new items. Cool!But, wait. There's more.I mentioned the game literally punishes you for playing. You can be the worst player, unable to even advance through the first floor/building. BUT, you will still eventually level up.Most levelling up bonuses are ""negative."" One of my first unlocks was a laser wall hazard that is randomly added to the room. Eventually, I also unlocked an advanced laser wall (more damage). The game taunts you by having a witty hint at the end of the experience bar (ex: a familiar enemy, but stronger {not verbatim, unlocks a stronger sentry}). Just when you think the game is getting difficult, it constantly curb stomps you and keeps things refreshing with added elements. There are game hints during the loading screen, and apparently beating the game unlocks a first-person mode. Ridiculous.Overall, Not the Robots plays exactly how I would expect a staple rogue-like to. In fact, it far surpasses any of my expectations. Any and all rogue-like enthusiasts must give this game a try. ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												the sentries which you have to avoid are just way too random in their movements. the moment you come out of your hiding place and try to go hide again, the sentry turns back in middle of it's path and spots you, hitting you and making you lose your perfect stealth run. this happens so much it is frustrating. sometimes you get 3 robots in your room as well and theres nothing you can do to not get hit unless you have a invisibility ability in which case the robots still stay around for too long.

												A fantastic stealth based Rogue Like game. I picked it up on sale, butwith the game play I've gotten out of it, I'd stillh ave payed full price. A lot of stealth games rely on basic mechanics that can get stale after a while, or don't cause a lot of tensions. The ones that do it right make for really stressful moments, and Not the Robots nails it on every level.  Every time you screw up, you know that you should have done something differently, and it's pretty much your fault. The tension that's created for the AI looking for you is fantastic, making you on the edge of your seat repeatedly saying ""please don't look here please don't look here"". Honestly, I'm not coming up with a lot of negatives for the game, it does most elements well and is a game that is great to play if you want to kill time or even just get your heart pumping.I've got some basic gameplay/mechanics here:

												Not The Robots might've just created a new genre of video game: the skill based stealth game.Let me explain, most stealth games have set enemy patrols and cover. You're encouraged to take your time and plan for the perfect path through the level. NTR has a section at the beginning of each level where you can attempt to make a strategy, but if you try to aproach this game the same way you approach other stealth games you will be severely punished.Not only do the patrolling enemies not have set paths but, as soon as the first enemy spots you, the furniture (your only cover) begins to TELEPORT AROUND THE LEVEL. This can lead to some stupid moments where you're hiding in a one exit room behind the last peice of cover (which you've strategecly left behind after eathing the rest), then suddenly the cover is gone and you get killed by the 5 enemies that happen to be in the room at the moment. Most of the time, however, the mechanic serves as a way to force you to think on your feet. NTR shines the brightest at the moments where you run into a room, a small army of sentinals on your tail, and have to quicky find the best peice of cover in a room that was literaly thrown together randomly. In short, any amount of planning won't help you in NTR, you will be judged on your knowledge of the core game mechanics, fundemental knowledge of how line-of-sight works, and nothing more.oh, and the ""perfect advertisement"" storyline clips are hallarious.8.5/10			"

												Best way to describe this game... Pac-Man meets Metal Gear Solid, meets Office Battle... Let me explain.The goal is to eat the furniture in the office to progress.Sounds simple enough right? Wrong.You have seven buildings to complete, and with each building you complete, the level of difficulty increases.By the way... Did I mention... the levels are fully procedural.There are all types of obstacles to stop you from progressing. From lasers to guard robots with only one thing on their minds... Your destruction.But fear not... You have a multitude of power-up to help you along the way.Gameplay is simple and fun.Some might find the graphics perhaps a little subpar but for the stealthy type of game it is, I find the graphics and sound quite well done.Nothing to write home to mom about, but by no means subpar, to my view.Don't take my word for it, and check out my video by clicking on the link.

Furniture serves as cover for you to hide from increasingly menacing enemy robots, but also as your only source of food.  I've never played anything like it.  Highly recommended.			"

												A good game with simple mechanics that has an original take on the difficulty curve which is high. And steep. It has a lot to offer, be it content, challenge or visual/sound design.However, the procedural generation is a tad too fond of randomness which makes it somehow ""unfair"". Even with a good understanding of the system, a solid strategy and mad skills gifted by the Ancients Gods, you can be stuck in a hellish nightmare simply because your computer felt like it. Given that the backstory is about AI, it's a great example of ludonarrative consonance. Well done.			"

												Not the Robots pretty much fits its description: it's a stealth roguelike where you eat furniture :-D By eating furniture you essentially eat up any possible cover you have, which is an awesome way of adding strategy into the mix. The levels get harder as you play on, and randomize each time you play (a la roguelike). On top of all this, promises of a story in the form of recorded messages push the gameplay even further. Only one bug came into play while I was playing: by trying to eat any kind of upgrade or item box when you otherwise couldn't (ie, you have an item or haven't completed the leve to get the upgrade) switches movement controls to camera controls, and doesn't let go unless you get rid of an item. Other than that, this game is an easy recommendation; it's cheap, it's fast, it's fun, and it runs perfect on my toaster of a laptop.			"

												You play as a tall robot which can squat to become less visible, moving through floors of an office, sucking in pieces of office furniture and equipment until you've met a quota. You can pick up items like invisibility and upgrades like an additional item slot, all of which are lost if you die from being shot and burned by security bots and rotating lasers, respectively. You try not to be seen, and if you are and get killed, you start over from the beginning, and every level's layout and such is all randomized. As far as motivation, just ""doing well,"" going faster, and voice recordings which talk about staplers and mundane stuff like that are all that really exist to motivate. If that gameplay sounds really fun to you and those sources of motivation sound good to you, then you might enjoy the game. For me, however, the gameplay didn't win me over, and sans that, a game's story has to completely be incredible, so with neither of those really appealing to me, I wasn't into it and would not recommend it to anyone with tastes similar to my own.

												Nah. Yeah we get it its random gen perma-death (both brand new never-done before game types I know, cough cough, not impressed). You just do the same thing and eat the same office furniture each level. Even though each level is ""random gen"" its basically the exact same with a lil diff layout. Sometimes there are like 8 patrol guys thats continually go back and forth in a room so its impossible to get anywhere without being caught. Especially because the abilities may not be placed befor the guy so you don't get help. Also the patrol guys basically can't be hurt and they have ridiculously long range and basically can see you when they are turned sideways, which is dumb. Also sometimes you go multiple levels without a health crate and then 3 in a row, so its inconsistent and can get you killed.			"

												Not The Robots is a Stealth game. Which you get to eat furniture *don't look at me look at the creators lol*. You play as a robot with almost no offensive capabilities. You just need to eat without getting spotted. It's not that hard actually.The Graphics are sure great. The animation and the effects are quit stunning. The textures are very detailed.The Soundtrack ain't bad. It's only one track so after a while it will get annoying.The gameplay is so good. WASD for movements, The mouse to look around, Space to interact and eat, LShift to crouch, Lclick to use the items, F to drop the items. It support gamepad.There are seven different buildings. Each one is harder.There are different enemies through the levels from standing still guns you need to avoid to patrolling robots you need to run from.There are also traps. Spotlights, Lasers, Bombs etc...The furniture most of the time acting as a shield but you need to eat it in order to finish so the level itself gets harder by the sec.There are many Items scattered through the game each one gives you a unique ability helps you through the levels.The levels are generated randomly so if you screwed up you can never try the same level again. The settings and options are covering everything up you can adjust. You can adjust the audio volume, The graphics and the resolution. You also can change the mouse's sensitivity or the key bindings.It's sure one of the most unique games I've played till now.You get four card drops of a seven cards badge. There are fifteen achievement.If you are interested in reading and discussing reviews. Check Cassus.org "

												Ehhhhhhhh...... The game is fun and I enjoy it, but I wouldn't recommend it really. The game has randomly generated levels which I really like, but my problem is any level with the AI sentries is a fun blockade. The robots move in random directions instead of being preset, which could work, but there's just not any feedback. The robots don't have a cone of sight, and they seem to see infinitely anyways. Levels without the robot sentries are sweet, but the sentry levels just kill it for me.			"

												Funny Concept and great game.  The premise of the game is that you are a little robot moving from office building to office building trying to eat furniture without dying.  It has quite a few roguelike qualities.  Each level you play is randomly generated, so if you mess up you won't get another chance.  As you progress from building to building you get powerups and meet new enemies.  Each floor has an objective in order to move on.  At first it's as simple as eating a certain amount of furniture, then as you progress you'll have to touch certain spots on the floor in sequential order, eat laptops that have audiologs in them which reveals more of the story and why you're eating furniture in the first place.  The thing that gives it a lot of replay value is the fact that when you die, you get experience based on how many floors you cleared, how well you performed etc. and the experience will level up your game.  This is less of a character level, and more of unlocking new features in the games.  The leveling system takes turns with giving you an upgrade, and then giving you more obstacles to traverse through your next game.  This makes the game slightly more challenging and it makes you want to continue playing because it means you will most likely run into something new that you haven't seen before.  It does a pretty good job at balancing the difficulty for you and it does a very good job at setting up an effective learning curve.  Overall, It's a lot of fun and has good replay value.			"

												You're a robot in an office building run by a rival corporation. You avoid detection and eat enough furniture to progress to the next level of the office building. Rinse. Repeat.:)Seriously oddball premise with a rock solid, if basic, execution. Few bells & whistles, it sticks to the core concept of sneaking around an office floor, avoiding detection from enemy robots or lasers etc, with you having to literally eat the furniture (thus reducing the cover available!) to progress.It's got procedural generated levels, a nice big toolbox of mission types & problems to overcome, and it presents itself really well given the premise & obviously small budget origins, making me laugh more than once.

												Read the full review: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/not-the-robots-game-review/Not The Robots is a unique game, classified as a ""Roguelike Stealth Furniture Eating Simulator"". It certainly can justify that, as it is a lot different from any other game I've ever played.Not The Robots places the player in control of a robot whose tasked with devouring office furniture. Yes, I know that sounds awesome, but there is a catch. The furniture must be devoured without being detected, in most cases. There are a few things that can ""detect"" the robot, such as sentries, or lasers (which are very difficult to avoid in open areas). There are a few rooms in which none of these are present, and you can eat furniture in peace, but for the most part, there'll be enemies to watch out for.There are also numerous abilities that can be picked up from blue crates scattered throughout each room. These abilities can serve many purposes, my favorite being the pickaxe, which can be used to break through walls that are otherwise unbreakable. There are a lot of these to choose from, but I found it a bit annoying that I couldn't tell what was contained in each of these crates by default. This resulted in me disposing of other abilities (you can hold several abilities at once) just to see what was in another crate, usually disappointed by the result.Not The Robots offers a variety of game modes to choose from. Aside from the campaign, there are operations and challenges. Both greatly extend on the length of the game (and even further, if you choose to perfect them) and serve as a break from the campaign of the game, which can become aggravating at times, especially when you die really far into it.The game features mediocre graphics and sound, nothing too spectacular, but nothing to complain about. The colors used are rather dark, but that fits well with the ""stealth"" aspect of the game. There is also a story that's told in pieces collected throughout the game. They are rather difficult to find, I only found a few throughout my play session.Overall, Not The Robots is a fresh experience, really unlike anything I've ever played. It has its merits, along with its flaws, but it packages itself well.			"

												Oh goodness. This game is really interesting. A mechanic in a stealth game where you have to destroy your own cover in order to progress is something I'd never seen before, but that is pulled off quite well here.I will say that on odd-numbered buildings, the game feels very arcade-y, what with the spinning lasers, timed floor traps, and sliding walls. That isn't a bad thing, but there's something to be said about the sense of dread that I get going into the odd-numbered levels which feature sentries that really make the stealth aspects of this game come to light.I would love to see more gameplay elements in the future, should it continue to receive updates, ones that make the game feel more stealth-focused rather than arcade-focused. Until then, definitely recommended. It's highly replayable, and fun no matter what your playstyle.			"

												Starting out the first time that I played this game, it wasn't a satisfying experience that I hoped it would be, but I played it for almost an hour. I came back to it the next day and played it without the depressing, ominous, and unpropitious music (if you can even call it that), and instead played my own music, and I had a blast. Supposedly there is a campaign within the game, however, I have yet to get that far into the game, or I have over looked some things, but it is a very difficult game, as I haven't gotten past the 4th building/level, and that is with the difficulty at its lowest. But my over all experience with the game has been positive, and I believe I got my money's worth for it especially since I got it on sale for $1.			"

												It's a fun concept for a game. A robot moving from office buildings eating furniture. It could make for a funny story. But the entire game is focused on high scores with only perfect execution. It's an easy to play stealth game but with a sharp learning curve in skill. No one could know the paths of the sentry bots and their infinite line of sight. And the furniture that you use for cover from sentries or lasers randomly teleporting can throw your entire game if you made it very far. It requires quite a bit of commitment to get skilled at the game and can only be progressed with perfect execution and luck in randomly generated levels and enemies. 7/10			"

												I am the furniture eater! Everything is edible, delectable garbage!Welcome to a stealth furniture-eating simulator, where you, a sentient robotic garbage can, must eat as much furniture and appliances as you can without tripping the defenses of the office buildings. Okay, you don't HAVE to stealth, but if you want to get cut through by rotating lasers, slam your mechanical face into prototype Aperture Material Emancipation Grills, get chased by floating mines, and shot at by mobile sentry bots, then be my guest.Not the Robots is a very fun and somewhat arcady game with procedurally-generated levels. As you go through the game, you'll unlock new powerups you can collect and use to defend yourself - but you will also unlock new tricks and traps to avoid, making the game more challenging as you progress. Each level starts you at an elevator, and you will need to eat enough furniture to satisfy your electronic stomach - along with completing various other objectives that you need to unlock the elevator and continue on to the next level. How much furniture you eat, how many levels you make it through, and how many bonus objectives you complete, will determine the amount of points once your run ends - whether that results from you somehow managing to get through all of the office buildings, or, more likely, meeting an untimely demise at the hands of office security. You might be able to collapse yourself and hide behind desks and computer monitors, or even slide under a table and then sprint away when no one's looking, or teleport away just before that mine comes around the corner, but be aware - the traps get more devisive, and the sentries get more tools up their sleeve, especially if they see you. So your best bet is to not get noticed in the first place.This is quite an enjoyable game, and if you happen to get bored or want something different than the regular office building dynamic, there are also various challenges that unlock as you make progress through unlocking levels and achieving certain goals. Perhaps, you might even strive for finding out what the story is behind this whole mess - if you can find those computer logs scattered throughout the levels at random. It's good for sinking in a small twenty minutes, or taking an entire afternoon. It plays smoothly, sounds great, and its visuals have a very gritty yet childlike cartoon quality to them that makes it that much more enjoyable to roll around in.Highly recommend it.			"

												Bought this one on the advice of a friend who said ""it's good for 10 minute size adrenaline bites every now and then"", and I couldn't agree more.  It's a silly, novel concept that loads fast, plays smooth and ends badly, every time. :)  You are a robot who eats furniture (don't let this guy loose in IKEA) in progressively harder buildings, each randomly generated.  It's permadeath and you don't keep your items or location, but you do keep your experience progress in campaign mode, opening up better items as you play.  It has high replayability (it's also kid-friendly).It really is great for when you have 10 minutes free and 10 minutes only and want a quick time waster.  It has an ""arcade"" style to it while having enough elements to keep you launching it.			"

												I hate to thumbs down this game because it is well made.  It has its own thing going and I'm sure this game is on someones favorite top list.  I just can't get into it.  I like rogue-like games at times and stealth is one of my favorite genres, but this game just does not satisfy me. I got tired of it very quickly, like within the first hour. I guess the main thing that got me is that I didn't feel like it was a stealthy game.  You eat furniture that you're supposed to hide behind.  The bots have no specific route which is cool but sucks at the same time, cause there is not much strategy to it IMO with the generated level designs. When I actually try to be stealthy it felt like I was waiting too long and become impatient, I usually don't have that problem with stealth games.  Starting over is boring.  I didn't like how much the screen shakes when you're being shot at.  I didn't feel the suspense.  I felt like I had to be extremely patient or run and steal everything as fast as I could which neither were enjoyable.			"

												I liked this game from first sight, and I'm hooked. Unfortunately it doesn't run that well on larger levels on my crappy laptop, so I have to play on my desktop to really get engaged. Gameplay is brilliantly simple, possibly too simple but more on that later. The style and atmosphere is excellent, they hit the noir mystery feel from the start and stuck with it.Gameplay and controls are simple and solid. The game lets you plan a nice path, and eases you into the system of deciding when to eat your cover. It's quite strategic, but easy enough to start playing. However, I do feel the Sentries are a bit strong. They spot you and almost immediately start firing with no warning. And the random-generation of maps means that some areas can be packed with Sentries, even your starting spot. There are no good luring or distracting mechanics so far in the game, so some stealth is a waiting-game of hoping they don't get a lucky pixel line of sight on you. That can be frustrating, but it's a roguelike, you're expected to die at the hands of RNG.Aside from that balance issue, it's an engaging and innovative game that knows what it's doing. It's very polished and just fun to play repeatedly. There's a lot of content with different modes and progressive objectives. I'd easily recommend the game at -40%, it's a good value if you are at all interested by what you've seen.			"

												This is a really well made and gripping little game packed with treats and compounding frustration. Okay, there's not much to the gameplay; avoid the traps, eat the furniture and escape the room. But far more going on than that.Gameplay might seem limited, but for what there is it's done very well. Graphics are polished and look really funky so it conjures up thoughts of a 21st century version of Beserk. The levels are completely randomised so you might get 3 or 5 run throughs before you tire of seeing it in your Steam list. There's a story element too, which is a little bizarre up to now, but highly compelling to find out how the developer manages to explain all this wackiness. Add a whole lot of challenges and operations outside of the campaign and you have plenty to keep you going for quite some time.This game is so well worth the money it feels like I'm stealing from the developer, but regardless of price <i>Not the Robots</i> is undoubtedly a fine example of what should be getting a Greenlight on Steam.

												Video review: Let's eat some Furniture! - Not the RobotsNot the robots is an excellent stealth game. Normally, I am not a huge fan of stealth games. They simply require too much patience on my part and time sitting around waiting to be fun for me. I like action and this game actually does a pretty darn good job at providing that. Not the Robots has acheived the feat of making me enjoy a stealth game. The quirky concept of eating furniture combined with the derpy looking robot who squiggles all over the place, makes this game pretty enjoyable to play. The difficulty ramps up quite quickly, but with the sprint button you can generally run away from the sentires as why try to shoot you down. What else can I say? you eat furniture, and it's great.

												4/10Had high hopes for this game given the fairly positive reviews and interesting concept. In the end I just found the game very frustrating. The levels are auto-generated which adds to variety, but in this game it doesn't work too well. There are many cases where there will be a narrow passageway and you have to wait forever for a moment where you can cross safety. Just very boring waiting and waiting. I feel campaign mode should have had pre-set levels, but the developers were too lazy.			"

												Like a lot of other players, I want to reccommend this.But I just can't.  It's a game about stealth with a perma-death mechanic that gets really, really hard.The ProsThe first few buildings are a blast.  I can move around and practice stealth at my own pace, where I've got avenues to plan out how I'll avoid a laser or a sentry.  Power-ups aren't as mandatory, which can suck later on, but can be lifesavers.  The random generation of these floors was the reason I did a few runs, where I could consistantly get through them and enjoy my time.There's a funny narrative that progresses with each playthrough (or attempt at it).  The only thing that holds it back are the later levels, which are likely to set you back to square one.In terms of atmosphere, I love it.  There's an abode of unique effects prevalent in the way the game feels.  The music and asthetic match, almost as if I'm watching myself through a camera, and it really makes me feel like I should be stealthy about it.The Cons*Sigh* and then there's the late game.I'm talking floors 5-7.  I just sorta hit a wall.  Floor 4 has this perfect balance of cover to walls to sentries that makes it a challenge, but also still provides sufficient routes to try and tackle the floor.  Floor 5 on the other hand, feels like I'm robbing Trump's personal pornography stash.  The random generation aspect of the game's core feels OK here, but when sentries are introduced in such vast quantities as they are, it can take 2-3 minutes before they've cleared out of a room, and I can move again.  It becomes so painstakingly slow that I just can't progress.  I either pick off some cover, wait 7 minutes and move to the next room (where I may or may not get stuck), or I go completely bonkers and just leg it (which seldom works, but often happens).The random aspect of the sentries makes it impossible for me to plan routes on these later floors, which is really dissapointing because I know planning a route is important in any game that considers itself a stealth-em-up (Stealth Barstard and Thief come to mind).  That being said, the sentries feel more like a broken mechanic.  At least in Deus Ex, Hitman and Wolfenstein I can squelch someone that detects me.  But without a reliable method of escaping, everything is very likely to come to a screeching halt.That ties directly back to the perma-death aspect of the game.  Unlike Tower of Guns or Sword of the Stars, I don't learn anything.  I don't get some unlock that might change the way I play the game.  I don't discover something that might help me get further.  Thus when I inevitably die on floor 5, I'm shoved right back into bureau buffet boot-camp, and will likely not get any further than I did before.  I'm really dissapointed with this, because I'm dying to find out what happens on upper floors.  I haven't experienced the true essence of what's there, because I can't get there.  The game is keeping me from enjoying the game.My VerdictIt's a really interesting and unique take on a genre that has a lot of trouble doing things right.  The stealth can be a lot of fun, but it also can get extremely tedious to borderline boring.  I feel like someone on the dev team was drunk and just shouted ""let's make it a rouge-like!"" without realizing that the game would become impossible to a lot of the general audience.  Everything is there for a game, but there's so much I'd re-do.- Make sentries like they were in Thief.  If you can't fight them, make sure you can avoid them.  This random-movement crap makes the game way too difficult to predict.-  If the above can't be accomplished, provide a reliable escape mechanism.  Maybe make powerups into unlockables, with unlimited use.  I just sort of went through the game seeing them as ""maybe get-out-of-jail-free"" cards, that one was unlikely to find again.-  It's made by a small team, and on a small budget, but for $10 I kind of expected to get a little more than 2 hours before the game hit a plateau and I essentially couldn't play it any more.  The other content just wasn't interesting, so I feel like I'm at fault for not enjoying the central experience, which I don't think is ever in a dev's mind.6/10			"

												I'm okay with the fact that you are a robot that eats furniture. I'm okay with that, because sometime in the future, that may happen as some sort of waste disposal. I guess. But why are there lasers and sentries guarding the furniture? Someone could get hurt. Like me. Oh and sentries are the most annoying enemies in any strategy game ever here, you know how sentries in every other game follow a set pattern? Yeah not this game, they just randomly walk around and shoot you to hell whenever their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t-o-vision sees through cover and goes mental. Other than that, it's kinda fun i guess, at least the laser levels are, because you know, logic, not just getting lucky.			"

												A simple but fun stealth game where the levels randomly generate.  The idea is to eat enough furniture (food) in order to trigger the exit, though doing so removes the available cover used to hide from sentries and the like.  Worth the 99 cents I paid.

												Game is very fun and addictive.  It gets harder as you progress, which makes for some interesting strategic decisions.  I never knew robots liked eating furniture :P			"

												I have somewhat mixed feelings about this game. I really enjoyed it - the idea of eating what keeps you hidden is a very interesting mechanic that added a lot to what would have been a typical stealth game otherwise.On the other hand, levels like those with the sentries made me very frustrated, especially since the sentries would remain alert for the remainder of the level. This made the difficulty seem unbalanced between sentry levels and levels without.			"

Captains Log, 19.10.2016Setting sail for uncharted waters! Destination: Not the Robots. So robots do eat furniture, huh? “ok”. Let us have a look at what this game of robots is all about!First (very short)look at the game: also available as VOD on twitch[www.twitch.tv]Not the robots is an arcade/puzzlegame that lets you control one furniture eating robot through randomly generated levels, that is: floors of a “strange office” building. If you die to environmental hazards or other robots you have to start over from Level 1, but you gain some progress in return. So it is reset and gameplus. Don´t anybody dare mention Rogue right now! Here is what you get:The game features a grainy security camera perspective, that can be controlled via mouse or gamepad.The robot is also controllable by either gamepad or mouse/keyboardYour robot can duck behind or below furniture to evade the sentries, laserbeams and other hazards.Your robot can get upgrades in form of healthboosts and useable items that let you change the games rules in different ways e.g. double movement speed, invisibility, wall removal.The sentry robots looking for intruders don´t have patterns of movement and you have to guess at what they can and can´t see.The game tells you the player in the beginning that it is going to level up instead of him. That got my interest peaked.You get additional game modes upon reaching certain points in the campaign mode. I have to admit I didn´t even try challenge or operation game mode.Look and feel and sound:Not the robots does look….well….it does not look good. In a gameplay way it lacks features that make me as the player want to continue. In a design way the wonky camera controls or viewing angle and the grainy security camera looks don´t do the game any good but hurt the player’s eyes/brains. The choice of “color” palette (why did it have to be horrid grayish colors? Just because it is an office building?)  and a strange way of introducing the game (you really only get half a tutorial….i would have preferred no tutorial and a randomized introduction of game elements) made me quit after 40 minutes. The game leveling up, like the little bird in the beginning said, does not work from my perspective.Captains Orders:I cannot recommend this game to anyone. Verdict:Walk the plank!  Sadly, this is one of the games I will not play again. It does not work for me in any way.

												I love stealth games.  I love Mark of the Ninja, I love Gunpoint, I loved Splinter Cell Conviction, and I love Monaco though I need to play it more.  However, I wouldn't really call Not The Robots a stealth game.  This game is almost real good, but one thing really kills me: the sentries, your main enemy in this game, the things that you actually hide from.In the games I listed above, the enemies are all predictable to a certain extent, enough to let me plan out what I want to do.  I can see what their fields of vision are, I can clearly see what direction they're facing, and I know what paths they will take, so I can strategize and plan accordingly.  In Not The Robots, the sentries see forward forever so they have no visible field of vision, it's not clear really what direction the sentries are looking, and the sentries explore rooms and move around at random.First off, I'm OK with there being no field of vision since they can see forward forever.  The thing is that it's also hard to see what direction they're looking.  It would be super great if they just had like a laser sight or a flashlight, to give me quick knowledge of what direction they were facing.  I'd feel much more confident hiding that way, and there are already lasers in the game that seem designed to show me how far they can reach and when they are blocked by an object.  I don't see why the sentries couldn't have something similar.But hands down the worst part of the sentries–I'm sorry, but of the whole game–is their patternless movement.  Like I said before, the sentries explore rooms and move around at random.  I can't tell where they're going to be, so I can't plan any course of action that doesn't involve being nowhere near them in almost guaranteed safety.  Even though I CAN hide behind them, there's literally no telling when one will make a 180º turn and see me, then chase me while shooting me to death as I scramble away.  This does not allow me the ability to strategize.  I found myself waiting, straight-up waiting for the sentries to go away so I could dash for the exit, not having any idea when they would leave, and I waited 5-10 minutes for my ideal window, which was just all the robots leaving the room at the same time.  I don't mind waiting for an enemy to leave me alone, but in any of the games I listed above I actually know when that will be.  I just want the sentries to have set paths, or patterns, like they always follow the wall, or always turn a certain way, or /something/ besides just complete randomness followed by chasing.  This weakness in the design basically turns me off to the whole game, despite its inventive concept, great graphics, tight controls, and what was probably going to be an interesting story : (Speaking of inventive concept, I think the procedural level generation in this game is really an interesting idea.  It would be awesome if stealth games had procedurally generated levels, because it would mean you could just play the game over and over again and have a new challenge each time.  But this game doesn't feel like a stealth game to me really.  Each procedurally generated level is not a new puzzle for me to figure out, it's just basically me waiting for the robots to get out of my way, however long that will take.  Rather than a stealth game, this game reminds me more of Receiver, which is a fun little FPS that I'm TERRIBLE at, wherein you hide from and shoot down flying sentry robots as you explore a procedurally generated map looking for tapes.  Except in Not The Robots you don't have a gun, and the robots find you easier.  This also reminds me of Receiver thematically, with the dark, mysterious atmosphere, and unusual story background.  In fact, Receiver is going to be my recommendation instead of this game.  Sorry guys.			"

												This game makes no sense, I was confused the whole time I played it and it has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story line to it or from what I saw. Didn't play to long as you can see but wasn't engaging nor did it give anything that was different from any other stealth/strategy game. Twas bland, tasteless and boring. Would I recommend it? As you can see I gave it a thumbs down but if you got it for 99 cents like I did take the gamble and see for yourself but it didn't catch my fancy at all. Not saying it was bad just the developers could have done a better job at engaging the player rather then eat furniture and computers and dodge lasers, but one good note I did like the animation/cartoon-y look to it.

												Personal Rating: 5/10Uhm, well this is odd. A lot of people like this game...I'm not a stealthy person, it explains why I haven't played Metal Gear Solid in a while but this game is ALL ABOUT stealth. You're a robot, a little bit of a ClapTrap look, eating, furniature...OK, the aspect of this game isn't really the best to be honest, I mean, if that's your story then it definately needs some work.Another thing I found out very quickly is that you don't need to be stealthy. If you run as fast as you can you can get through without using the hide mode that doesn't work, all it does is make you a smaller version of yourself. The art style is lovely however. But to be honest I just didn't like this as much as I thought it would. Title's a bit mis-leading, I would've picked ""Attack of the Dyson's"" or ""Vaccum Vengeance"" or something witty and very punny.			"

												I was intrigued by this game and, seeing it in a humble bundle, decided to get it. The game revolves around a furniture eating robot who needs to eat loads of furniture to.... I guess fuel himself? You also have to avoid other robots... that don't like you eating furniture?? The story is pretty much non exsistant and the game seems to be more of ""Here are a series of levels you can play through."" There isn't any rhyme or reason to the thing. Also the game seems to be VERY short. I got to building 6 in about 20 minutes and I am told that there are only 7 buildings in the campaign mode. I think the idea was the random generation was going to make it replayable but I just dont see that happening.The gameplay consist of just moving around behind crap to avoid patroling robots or slowly spinning lazers. You get one ability at first and slowly unlock more. The game quickly becomes a grind and each level feels exactly the same as the last. Each building you go to is an office building with the same furniture.The music is god awful. Since thats the only sound aside from the buzzing of lazers or gun fire if something spots you, you should mute the game and play something better in the background.The biggest problem I have with this game is, what is the point for the random generated levels?? Seriously. It doesn't add anything to the game and only serves to make the expirence samey and watered down. This would have been so much better with specificly designed levels by the devs that you had to work through. Sure it may techniqually offer you a different expirence every playthrough, but if your random generation is so basic and your game is so basic, its going to end up feeling the same anyway! Why not just craft something specific?I hate to say that this game just doesn't do anything in any aspect. Im not sure what kind of expirence they were trying to deliver here. I would say give this a pass, or at the very least wait for a very heavy discount or a humble bundle deal.			"

												Let's get one thing straight. It's cool game. I don't know of any other games where you play a robot that sucks up furniture. It's also really fun to dodge and outsmart lazers and patrol guards. But realistically, it's not super fun. Once you die, your entire career mode resets. The graphics are poor considering that it's a pretty recent game. It's not one you'll find yourself playing over and over again. Just for a couple hours, and then that's it. Cool concept, but no fun.			"

												Not the Robots added stealth to it's mix of randomized stealth-level chaos. The game is short, but now that saving exists you need not fear having to start over if you've been having a good run but need to leave. Worth it for the odd premise alone.Gameplay:

												Not The Robots! What you will say when the sentries locate you. This game is a unique experience which hybridizes stealth and tactical/puzzle gameplay to great effect. You play as a robot with an eating disorder which can eat all sorts of furniture and electronics but apparently only the non-hostile variety *shrugs*. The game takes place on floors of an office building as you progress around eating furniture until you collect a sufficent amount and situationally pass through waypoints etc. The game uses sentry bots, lasers and a variety of other static hazards to dwindle away your health (although admittedly the only real threat is the sentry bots) and they provide a great amount of challenge. This game offers better stealth than any other game I've ever played (and I've played quite a few) and the unique concept that the furniture which although provides you with cover must be consumed to proceed to the next floor, as such you have to snack carefully to make sure you have sufficent cover to complete the level without getting over-run with sentries. There is also an inventory system with a host of powerups/abilities to use to help get you out of a pinch, and the fear of restarting the entire sequence, with a single life game over system adds to the frantic nature of the game (one power up gives additional tries). Levels are also randomly generated, and the game does scale quickly, it doesn't hold back but that makes it all the more fun. The story however is nonexistent at best, told in fragments and although this doesn't detract from the experience much as the game is focused on solid gameplay, it would have been nice to have a narrative to back it up. This is nitpicking however and the game is overall a great experience with a full recommendation from me, it offers a gameplay experience that will make you hungry for more.			"

												Not the Robots is a great game. It pulls together stealth mechanics and rouge-like fun into one neat package.Video Review:


YouTube™ Video: Takin' a Look at... Not the Robots 

			Views: 13		

			Today we play Not the Robots. It's a fun rouge-like stealth game where we play as a furniture eating robot and go on a quest to eat furniture. It's a great time.		

What is it?Not the Robots is a rouge-like stealth game where you play as a robot eating furniture. Every level is randomly generated, perma death, yadda yadda rouge-like stuff (I'm sure that most of you know the genre). What is more interesting is the stelth mechanics. You have a robot that can crouch, move, and use various items. Hiding is decided by line of sight alone. If they can see you, you're done. If they can't then you may live to eat another day.There are three things that really make this game intersting to me. Firstly is the fact that you eat your cover. The furniture, which you have to eat to complete the level, is also what you need to hide behind in order to not be seen. A large amount of strategy comes from the decision of wether or not you should eat that desk. Will it come in handy later? Might you need it to survive? The second thing is the item system. Throughout the levels you can pick up items these can do various things such as destroy permanent walls, turn you invisible, or place a block in front of you. These items can dratically effect how you play and the decision of wether or not you should discard your current item and try your luck at getting a better one is always problematic (in a good way). Finally, the leveling system. Most rouge-likes have a system for unlocking things after you've played a bit. Not the Robots' system is unique in that you not only unlock good things that you can use, but also new enemies and traps.The last thing that I wanted to mention was the difficulty. Starting on a normal campaign, the difficulty starts low and takes a steep climb. The game will evolve as you play it. As you get farther you will need to do more than simply eat furniture and each new objective (obvioulsy) makes your job all the harder. Also, you're not instantly killed if you're seen. You can actually take a bit of fire before you die.Pros:-Good difficulty curve (is that a thing?). By that I mean that the game becomes progressivly more difficult at a good rate. It doesn't start hard as nails, and doesn't remiain easy as pie for too long.-Leveling up helps you but also hurts you. In order to get the cool items, you have to suffer through new traps. Also, as you level up you gain more replayability as new elemnts are added.-You can actually take a hit. Getting seen is not the end of the game, and you can actually run around being shot for long enough to find cover. -Useful, stragety changing items.-They made eating furniture fun. (Bonus, I got to write that sentence)Cons:-It is possible for levels to generate unfairly. I can remember one time where the spawn point was in a room with four sentries. The sentries couldn't get out and there was no way that I couldn't be spotted. However, that was only one spawn of thirty or fourty I did so it's not a terrible issue.Overall, this is a great game. I've completely ejoyed the time I've spent on it so far. May we all eat furniture instead of being slaughtered by horrific sentries.			"

												Fun little distraction, but can get very frustrating. Hover sentry robots are unpredictable, making dodging them almost impossible (especially with the random nature of the level generation). Low laser beams are also crazy, considering that unlike with the high lasers (where you can ""crouch""), there is no jump command (or small hover), which would have improved the game. The story segments (found as collectable laptops) are funny and fit the style of this game.			"

												This is such a fun game. Worth every cent I spent. As it is a major stealth game, it gives interesting levels when randomized. The difficulty skyrockets, however, the second you get past the third building (level 6), as the sentries are random but annoying and persistent. Enemies and obstacles stack one atop the other and the game quickly becomes frustrating and hard. Which makes it great.  How many games out there will you beat and then never play again? Not The Robots combats this ""One and Done"" mentality. Trust me, you're going to enjoy this one.Which game is my next favorite? Not The Robots.			"

 Very Interesting But Very Repetitive The concept of this game is great. A stealth game that forces you to remove what you hide behind in order to proceed. That’s flat out amazing and I applaud the creators for such an innovative idea and presenting it in a good way with a very cool art style. The animation and graphics are spot on and really do give the game a great feel, it's very appealing to the eye and you could spend hours just admiring the visuals alone But something for me just didn't go down well, I found that the controls are a bit clunky, I feel like I’m waiting for the animation which slowed things down on my side, and the ""eat furniture"" ability was not precise enough. In the end this game is a more puzzle than stealth and for me that made it too repetitive. I like my challenges to be more diverse and have more than one end goal, or no end goal at all. Those being the major reasons games like Mount and Blade appeal to me. This game just feels too rigid for a stealth game and too touchy for a precise puzzle game. If I rated it as a full on stealth game I couldn't recommend it but I will rate it as puzzle game in which case it shows a lot of potential to be a lot of fun. I had my good share of fun playing it, maybe you'll have more. So while not a 100% must buy it is still something to consider if you're in the market for an interesting puzzler with a little bit of character and story.			"

												Not The Robot wins my vote for most unique premise - a robot that eats furniture. We're talking a skinny robot that eats huge desks, and has the audacity to say it needs more.In addition to furniture-eating, your robots needs to avoid traps, which may be lasers or other hazards, as well as moving enemies. There is no direct fighting in this game, so there is a large degree of stealth in balancing out which furniture pieces you want to eat now, and which you want to eat later. In addition, the game rewards your furniture gluttony with powerups that may shape the environment, or provide personal buffs. Acquiring buffs requires a sizable amount of furniture to be eaten already, so it goes back to stealth vs. food debate.The game itself is fairly randomly-generated, and appears to be pretty unique across playthroughs. There's also a sliding difficulty which impacts the spawning of your levels. A level-up system will also impact your level's conditions. Your level is calculated across runs, based on performance, and increases as you do better. In layman's terms: the better you do, the harder it gets.The game goes on sale quite a bit during major sales, and is definitely worth sale price.			"

												Now this game is something I haven't seen before. You play as a slim little robot that is able to duck an drive around. Every level takes place on some multistory building with old office furniture and you're goal is to eat quite a lot of them to be able to get to the exit. The problem with this is that you have to eat the same stuff you need to hide behind or under and if this is not enough, every level is guarded by stationed and/or moving sentry robots. Every time you escape, the next floor will be increasingly difficult. What I really like about the game is that every floor is, although every time procedurally generated, always very tasteful decorated. The furniture and stuff fits to the wallpapers as well as to the carpet. What I like too, is the startup. The developer seems to be making fun of himself because there is no permanent logo or company name but changing stuff that doesn't really say anything.   I still don't know why anybody would need to eat furniture or why on earth old office stuff has to be guarded so heavily guarded but what do I know? I just know I really like it and you might too, if you like to play stealth game. Oh and you should have some patience because you'll get caught much much more than once.			"

												Surprise! This review snuck up on you didn’t it? That’s because this review, like this game, was meant to be stealthy. I’m screwing with you. My bad. Let’s move on.I – Story [7/10]Not The Robots is a stealth, roguelike “Furniture Eating Simulator” from 2Darray. The story is simple, outlandish, and comical. You (the player) are a sentient robot that awakes inside a strange office building. On top of that, you’re hungry. You’re robot stomach is making the rumblies that only furniture can satisfy. (Yeah, that was a Llamas with Hats reference. Deal with it.) As you gorge your way through the various office buildings, consuming every desk and water cooler that you come across, you gradually uncover the story of why you’re here…eating all the furniture and dodging all those damned, pesky sentry robots. Audio files you devour piece it all together for you; a bit more each time you play. It was a novel method of storytelling and definitely not one I had encountered before. And you know what? I quite liked it, but it was a bit underwhelming. Especially considering the level of wanton mastication of office furniture.II – UI [10/10]The user interface is pretty basic. There’s no minimap (or even a regular map) and, to be frank, you don’t need one. You’ve got a small HUD that displays your health, inventory, and your objectives (both the level of food consumption needed to press forward on your gluttonous quest and the amount of access points left in a sequence). It’s all incredibly easy to navigate and to use.III – Gameplay [9/10]Honestly, I could sit here and try to explain to you how the game is played, but I feel that it’s pretty self explanatory. You eat furniture. That aspect of the gameplay is abnormally satisfying and addictive. You’re even supplied with power-ups and bonuses around the map to aid you. In a way, they’re a bit like condiments.The sentry robots though, as I mentioned above, can become supremely frustrating if you are not careful. This is especially true on higher difficulty settings. Sometimes they can make it nigh impossible to complete a level. Oh and if you die, it’s permadeath. You’re starting back at the beginning sucker.IV – Content [6/10]While the vast majority of the game’s content is unlocked simply by playing the game and earning experience, it didn’t feel like there was quite enough of it to unlock. There are a few different power-ups and then their upgraded forms. There are a seemingly unnecessary amount of difficulty levels. There are even quite a few enemies and traps that spring up to prevent you from accessing your hardwood and plastic buffet. But, in the end, I was left with a sense of wanting.However, much to the game’s credit, the levels are all randomly generated. No two of my playthroughs were ever the same and it made NTR that much more addictive.V – Visuals [5/10]In terms of graphics, I felt that Not The Robots was just a tad forgettable. The visuals are decent and, of course, this is not where the game gets it’s charm and replayability, but it did put a bit of a damper on the whole experience. I guess I just expected more.VI – Audio [10/10]What NTR lacked in the art department, it more than made up for with it’s soundtrack. The soundtrack itself is randomly generated. I kid you not. Each level has different music (however slightly different) that is pulled from a pool of 70 looping tracks and put together for your listening pleasure. Not The Robots has one of the best soundtracks I’ve heard in a long time and I don’t think I’ve even heard a quarter of it’s potential tracks.Also, it is worth noting that the voice actors for the audio files (for the most part) did great jobs. My hat is off to you.VII – Overall [7.8/10]Overall, Not The Robots is a solidly built game and is a lot of fun. You should buy it just to hear the soundtrack if nothing else.			"

												This is my favorite game ever, and probably my favorite thing ever.It's hard to describe this game better than the trailer does, as it is indeed a game about eating furniture.Everything about this game is absolutely perfect, or better. I would buy this game 100 times if I had the cash.Buy it. Buy it for your friends. Buy it for your enemies. Buy it for your grandma. Buy it for your cat. Buy it for your tree.Everyone and everything deserves a copy of this game (Except♥♥♥♥♥♥Cheney).			"

												This is one of those games that makes you say WTF when you look at it. It may seem ridiculous, but in reality it is very fun. The difficulty goes from fairly simple to HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥I'M-GONNA-DIE as you progress through the game. The traps and guards add a level of challenge to the game that makes it pretty thrilling. I may only have 3 hours on the game, but I still love it. I feel like, whiel this is a very god game, it is not worth the 10 dollar pricetag. I got it on sale for 4 dollars and i would certainly say it was worth it. I suggest you wait for it to go on sale.			"

												In the loading screen the say that this game is influenced by Desktop Dungeons and Spellunker. There is not a lot in common with those games except the fun i have playing it. Every levels are random generated, there is a load of chalenges and game modes. Really worth the price. you can ajust control on a gamepad, it work really well with the F710. ( a lot of game are supossed to support gamepad but don't work with mine. Maybe because i have a mac.) so if you like rogue-like and stealth game this is for you.			"

												This is a really fun game. I picked it up for a bargain and I'm actually really glad I did. The controls are smooth, the gameplay is only as fast as you make it, and there's a bit of a story to drive everything, if you're sick of just dodging sentries and eating furniture.There are some cons, such as the randomly moving sentries, waiting (waiting, and more waiting...!), and sometimes the randomly generated levels get repetitive. That can put some people off, so if you don't generally like those things, I would not recommend this game to you. The game's story has to be persued a little, if you want to get it, but otherwise, pretty much worth it. It makes things a lot more interesting. Then again, if you're not into that kind of thing, you don't have to do anything but dodge enemies, complete challenges, and move to the next building. I'm generally not a fan of rogues, or permadeath, but I like this game. It's pretty good, and I definitely recommend it.Plus, the music is really nice...			"

 Very Interesting But Very Repetitive The concept of this game is great. A stealth game that forces you to remove what you hide behind in order to proceed. That’s flat out amazing and I applaud the creators for such an innovative idea and presenting it in a good way with a very cool art style. The animation and graphics are spot on and really do give the game a great feel, it's very appealing to the eye and you could spend hours just admiring the visuals alone But something for me just didn't go down well, I found that the controls are a bit clunky, I feel like I’m waiting for the animation which slowed things down on my side, and the ""eat furniture"" ability was not precise enough. In the end this game is a more puzzle than stealth and for me that made it too repetitive. I like my challenges to be more diverse and have more than one end goal, or no end goal at all. Those being the major reasons games like Mount and Blade appeal to me. This game just feels too rigid for a stealth game and too touchy for a precise puzzle game. If I rated it as a full on stealth game I couldn't recommend it but I will rate it as puzzle game in which case it shows a lot of potential to be a lot of fun. I had my good share of fun playing it, maybe you'll have more. So while not a 100% must buy it is still something to consider if you're in the market for an interesting puzzler with a little bit of character and story.			"

There are even quite a few enemies and traps that spring up to prevent you from accessing your hardwood and plastic buffet. But, in the end, I was left with a sense of wanting.However, much to the game’s credit, the levels are all randomly generated. No two of my playthroughs were ever the same and it made NTR that much more addictive.V – Visuals [5/10]In terms of graphics, I felt that Not The Robots was just a tad forgettable. The visuals are decent and, of course, this is not where the game gets it’s charm and replayability, but it did put a bit of a damper on the whole experience. I guess I just expected more.VI – Audio [10/10]What NTR lacked in the art department, it more than made up for with it’s soundtrack. The soundtrack itself is randomly generated. I kid you not. Each level has different music (however slightly different) that is pulled from a pool of 70 looping tracks and put together for your listening pleasure. Not The Robots has one of the best soundtracks I’ve heard in a long time and I don’t think I’ve even heard a quarter of it’s potential tracks.Also, it is worth noting that the voice actors for the audio files (for the most part) did great jobs. My hat is off to you.VII – Overall [7.8/10]Overall, Not The Robots is a solidly built game and is a lot of fun. You should buy it just to hear the soundtrack if nothing else.			"

												This is a really fun game. I picked it up for a bargain and I'm actually really glad I did. The controls are smooth, the gameplay is only as fast as you make it, and there's a bit of a story to drive everything, if you're sick of just dodging sentries and eating furniture.There are some cons, such as the randomly moving sentries, waiting (waiting, and more waiting...!), and sometimes the randomly generated levels get repetitive. That can put some people off, so if you don't generally like those things, I would not recommend this game to you. The game's story has to be persued a little, if you want to get it, but otherwise, pretty much worth it. It makes things a lot more interesting. Then again, if you're not into that kind of thing, you don't have to do anything but dodge enemies, complete challenges, and move to the next building. I'm generally not a fan of rogues, or permadeath, but I like this game. It's pretty good, and I definitely recommend it.Plus, the music is really nice...			"

												This was a cute game. Going into it I had no idea what it was about. I just saw it was on sale, and it had good reviews. I was not let down. It's definitly a game you can sink some time into. I'm not the best at puzzle games but this was definitly something I could sit down and try to get better at.			"

												Cute little stealth action with procedurally generated levels and a robot that eats furniture.Gameplay is fun, stays light and puzzley- not something that is going to make you rage.Worth checking out, a good play for sure, but you might want to catch it on sale/bundle.			"

												I wasn't sure about this one but the developer made a few other games I like which are free to play online so I gave it a shot.  I'm not disappointed.  Combining stealth with an all-you-can-eat office.  Really enjoyed this one			"

												I don't usually write a review after so few hours in a game unless, A: the game is just that short or B: it's a bad game, but this is an exception. It took me one death to get the hang of this game. First off, the graphics are outstanding, especially at the performance, with the gameplay and default controls being fantastic. In the later levels, like building six, the drones, or flying skulls, or whatever you prefer to call them really got my heart pumping, with each shot being fired being a huge jumpscare even with the colorful atmosphere. The levels with only the lazer turrets feel like a fun puzzel with an enormous selection of ways to complete it, with only few ways allowing you to get full points. Along with the simple controls and easy-to-run graphics allows me to play this with a steam controller and media pc on my television.10/10			"

												I'd reccomend buying this game if it looks fun. I'd reccomend buying it on sale if you think it will be fun.It can be very frustrating at times, i.e. getting cornered by sentry robots and you can't do anything.I really love the random generated levels, it keeps the game challenging as you can't simply memorize the patterns. The sentry bots move randomly, which means, if you want to move, you find a good covered spot, and wait for ideal sentry positions. I don't find this a problem, as planning routes or listening to the story keeps me busy. However, you won't win if you charge through the rooms eating all the furniture.Some buildings don't have sentriy bots which is a nice change of pace, as the sentry levels can be stressful, and you can lose a lot of health on them. As long as you keep an eye on the lasers it's easy to make it past these levels unscathed.Hands down, this game is difficult. Since you're forced to destroy cover, levels become progressively harder. If you like a good challenge, try Not The Robots.			"

												If you like rogue-like games where you stealthily eat furniture and avoid enemies with random paths while listening to sombre music then this is your game. I personally dislike rogue-likes but I can recommend the game for those who do. The game has an interesting style and is very well made.			"

												More of a minigame. You basically are in a room, trying to absorb the furniture without being detected by drones and being hit by lasers. You have some abilitys and there´s much to unlock, much to play and it will get very hard pretty fast. So, even though it has quite some content, it´s hard and repetetiv..Only recommened at a little price and if you have NOTHING else to play.As, for me, I didn´t have too much fun, and even that was over pretty quickly.

												A clever stealth game that's punishingly difficult but extremely addictive. It gets ""harder"" the more you play. But really, you're missing out on a lot of the fun at lower levels. There's just something really satisfying about getting to say that you've played a stealth, furniture-eating simulator.And that's the charm of it. This game likes to push at your ability to stay hidden by constantly forcing to to manuever around while making yourself more and more exposed. And don't think you're a fighter. At best, you get a stun mine. If you're caught by a sentry turret, your only hope is to run, hide, and pray to your maker that it doesn't rip away the office plant you're crammed behind.Your robot you play as moves really smoothly. There's a lot of weight and control to it. So any deaths you have will be your fault; not the game's.The $10.00 price tag is a bit much if you're on a budget. But you can get it for a steal during sale times. I can't recommend this game enough.			"
