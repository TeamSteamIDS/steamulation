												A Virus Named TOM is not a bad game, but the game mechanics and controls don't make this all that fun to play. It really needs a more intuitive method to rotate blocks maybe by using the left/right triggers or bumpers.			"

												This game is well crafted, however the mechanics are more twitch reaction based and less puzzle solving. Since the core goal is to alway solve the tile turning puzzle this becomes frustrating quickly. The developers tried to compensate by allowing the player to automatically skip levels, but this doesn't correct the core problem since the level after the one you skipped has the same problems.If you have always wanted a twitch reaction tile puzzle game, this one may be perfect for you. Otherwise you may lose interest quickly, as I did.			"

												Wow. I was really surprised at how unfun the gameplay actually was. Mixing up several different gaming styles – contemplative puzzling, timers and fast-paced enemy avoidance – apparently didn't pan out that well in this case.The gameplay's two major inspirations would appear to be Qix and Pipe Mania (or the hacking puzzle in Bioshock, shudder). Instead of drawing lines like in Qix, you navigate a grid of Pipe Mania -type puzzle parts and manually rotate them one at a time while avoiding enemies.I kind of want to like Tom – the writing's amusing and the production's solid. However, the core gameplay just isn't fun.			"

												Imagine the hacking minigame from Bioshock, except that you rotate existing tiles instead of placing existing ones. Also imagine that you control Frogger, who hand-rotates these tiles while listening to techno and dodging traffic on a highway.If you dismiss indie games as being EITHER fast, tough-as-nails platformers OR artsy atmospheric environments, I highly encourage you to give this game a shot - this is a fine example of original gameplay that requires split-second precision and risk/reward decision making. I had beaten (not gold-medalled) the single-player campaign in about 4 hours, but don't take that as a knock against the game - I preferred to play in 10-minute intervals to give my nerves a chance to recover from the frantic pace, and I haven't played much of the other modes yet.The soundtrack by Ian Hicks is extremely well done - 7 tracks that nicely complement the setting and gameplay that are well worth purchasing and adding to your mp3 player. The 8th, which is used in the trailer, feels out of place and I've removed it from my playlist. Recommended.Speed and precision required: YesStraightforward 100%: NoSoundtrack format: DLC, mp3			"

												This game... it has no clue what it's trying to be. There's no difficulty curve, you'll have random hard levels mixed in with middling ones. You go straight from a pure-puzzle stage to a pure-action one and there's major whiplash. Some levels require memorization as pieces are hidden, which only makes things more tedious. Controls need work too, TOM is not always responsive to slightly early arrow presses which can lead to you coming to a dead stop when you meant to move right and often even a fraction of a second can get you killed. Also, the death penalty is incredibly steep and if you're going for a gold score you might as well restart if you die even once. Which wouldn't be a problem except in levels with enemies all over the place and avoiding dying is the only real goal of the level. This game is just simply unfun to play, the art's nice, the music's alright though a bit dull after a while, but just playing this game is a chore. I couldn't even find it in myself to finish the game, I was just having that little enjoyment playing it. I'm sure there's an audience for this kind of game somewhere but it isn't me and I don't think most of the crowd that would want to play this from how it looks would be in that audience. I only got this through the humble bundle which is about the only place I'd recommend getting it from, really.			"

												A brief explanation of the game: you're a virus trying to infect systems. To do that you have to redirect power through the system. You just have to rotate tiles till they form a path from the power source to your objective. Had a pretty good start but I just got bored about 3/4 of the way into the game. Doesn't know its identity, whether it wants to be a strategy game, or an action game, or both. Mechanics are sort of just all over the place. At some point it just becomes memorizing tiles. Pretty boring after a while.			"

												Nobody likes having their ideas stolen. For Dr. X, it's more than just a clever invention, but his entire livelihood being taken away by a mega corporation, framing and imprisoning him in the process just to make it abundantly clear what a bunch of greedy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥they are. Unfortunately, they forgot about a little virus named Tom, who's about to turn their billion dollar company into a pile of rubble, one computer at a time.A Virus Named Tom is something like a pimped out Pipe Mania. Guiding Tom through computer mainframes, you need to redirect the flow of the hack by twisting panels until the infection has spread across the entire board. Simple in theory, but in execution it becomes quite an elaborate challenge once anti-hack bugs, hidden and unmovable tiles, and the intricate maze designs start to pile on more and more things to keep track of. One of the most impressive things about AVNT is how it balances these elements into a gradual but brisk increase in difficulty. Rarely did I feel overwhelmed by any of the mechanics, instead rather impressed with myself that I was able to solve what initially appear to be incredibly involved puzzles. It's constantly rewarding and satisfying to progress, even with the surprisingly long single player story (which doesn't take into account the entire separate coop campaign which I've yet to even dip into).As a puzzle game, A Virus Named Tom resides pleasantly in the realm of the best pick up and play arcade classics. It's challenging and enjoyable whether in short bursts or drawn out sessions as you try to attain a gold medal on every level, and never once managed to outstay its welcome for me however long I spent with it. It also features a fantastic electronic soundtrack, and some rather charming and humorous cutscenes which somehow manage to make mass hysteria and deconstruction feel lighthearted and amusing. Really, if a game can't sell itself to you with a dog that doesn't poop, I don't even know what more there is to say.			"

												I remember that I bought this game early on and then could not play it for years because it had some kind of a bug with my hardware that made the game just turn black at random. Despite this, my excitement never waned.Fast-forward to now when I have a new PC and this bug is gone, and I can say that this is an incredibly shallow game. Every 3-5 levels a new gimmick is thrown into the mix, but they don't really make it better so much as just turn a set of levels into something beyond the basic Pipe Dream gameplay. The biggest issue is that, unless there's some late-game revelation I never got to, the board remains roughly the same size and you're just trying to connect everything, sometimes before it all locks up and screws you on a few stages. Scoring is just based on speed, turning a puzzle into an action game if you want rewards: figure out the solution, then do it 30 seconds faster without dying.			"

												This is a mainly a Puzzle game.The main story is about a docter who created TOM the virus to attack and hack the world of robots and machines.As a way to take revange what they to the Doc.So Tom needs to hack the world and to do say you need to defeat a lot of puzzles.Game has a really nice extended story mode with some really nice OST to it.Graphic part it looks really basic and nothing spelcial.After some stages the game can be very difficoult and will give you a good challange.I thought the game whas very nice of the the story mode as theme to it.It's not the best puzzle game but it is a lot of fun playing this game.I will give this game a 7/10 score.

												My Take: Think Pipe Mania and Tron Lightcycle. Redirect the virus' infection by rotating the circuits while dodging the anti-virus countermeasure drone spiders. Elements such as locked circuits and red game over blocks get thrown in later. Eventually, you get to a point where it's solely based on timing your moves around the spiders. Tedious.Graphics: The character and level design are simple, but worked for what they are. The little cutscenes follow an art style reminiscent of what you would see on Cartoon Network in the mid 90's, just not as good. Also the resolution is locked at 1280x720 so if you switch the settings to 1980x720, you get a horrible border all the way around the screen. Sound: So little going on here that the only thing worth mentioning is the respawn noise is annoying.Music: Surprisingly solid with a track or two I'd actually listen to outside the game.Controls: Simple enough bindings, you've got directional controls, glitch drop, and circuit rotation. The game recommends the controller, but you can honestly make do with the keyboard. I couldn't tell any difference in the gameplay between the two.Did I Finish It: No.Will I Finish It: Eventually, but I'm so irritated with the later levels, I'm taking an indefinite break.Should You Buy It: Only if the concept interests you, snag it in a bundle or if you see it for 80% or less.

												An interesting mash up born when you cross Pipe Mania and Qix. The game plays a lot like Pipe Mania with the player controlling Tom, who moves around the gridded game area and spins the 'pipe' pieces by moving around them and holding a button, all while avoiding enemies. Tom has 'health' (time bar) that slowly drops over time and is reduced further when hit by an enemy. This game has potential, given its inclusion of a bare but amusing story that gives context to the player's actions, as the game slowly introduces new concepts, powerups and enemy types. It also rewards the player with a few 'skip tokens' every new world, so if you are really stuck on a level you can still continue playing. Unfortunately, I just feel that the game lacks polish and refinement as the difficulty spikes and curve seem to be pretty uneven, and the very fast and 'instakill' enemies just seem to throw the balance out of whack. There is a nice mix between standard puzzle and enemy levels, however the game as a whole did not hold my interest very well with the fairly plain looking levels, fairly shallow game mechanics and unfair 'twitchy' game movements required in later levels just to survive, all while trying to think how to solve the actual puzzle.Overall, an enjoyable but flawed puzzle game that hardcore difficult puzzle fans will love but most people will find just too unremarkable and difficult to be enjoyable. 6/10. Finally, kudos to the people in the audio department for a memorable and enjoyable soundtrack! One of the best parts of the game for sure.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. Pipe Dream was one of my favorite games of my childhood. That's why I picked up this game. But the game relies heavily on quick player reactions. This would not be a big problem if the controls were more responsive or more intuitive (played with keyboard). It makes it frustrating sometimes. Especially when the stages have so many damn spiders.Not a bad game. But I could not enjoy my time with it.			"

												I really do want to recommend this game. The aesthetics, the humor, the character design of T.O.M., the snazzy soundtrack (the one positive thing I got from this game) are fantastic, but ultimately the gameplay is where the game fails to understand itself.If you have played the demo, you might actually find the game interesting and fun with the pipe-linking puzzle game AVNT wants you to believe it is. But once you get to the middle of the second area/world/device, the game suddenly forgets the methological approach.The main problem with this game is it wants you to take your time to figure out the puzzles, yet it also rushes you to solve the solutions as your health is your time-limit. Some levels will slowly degrade your health while others will rely on you manuevering around enemies to absorb more health. And you have to complete the puzzle while doing that as well.Even worse, you have to do all of that while you CAN'T see your progress. There is a mechanic introduced fairly early that hides the grid unless you connect the pipes. So that means you have to brute force your way to completion. But some levels seem to demand that you memorize each level, THEN do it as quick as possible while not getting hurt and losing time/health. Some might argue that the skip-tokens let you get past those frustrating levels, but the game just continues to get more frustrating for all the wrong reasons. The challenges at the start of the game do not prepare you for the trials towards the end. I couldn't even imagine trying to convince someone to play cooperative with me on the later levels.Then you have the other glaring issue: The controls.The best way to explain the problem is that you always feel tied to an anchor. Whether you use a controller or the keyboard, you have to hold a button down to interact with a section of the grid. Combine this mechanic with having to dodge enemies quickly and you'll find yourself stuck on the same paths or you'll accidently slide into an enemy you were trying to avoid.If there is A Virus Named TOM 2, however slim, I hope the devs choose one type of puzzle or the other.  Testing your reflexes or testing your puzzle-solving is fine, but testing both at the same time is a challenge in frustration, not of fair difficulty.			"

												Disclaimer: I haven't played the Multiplayer element of the game and my review is only reflective of the single player experience. I decided to play this game after it had been in my library for almost a year from a Humble Bundle I had purchased. I thought it would at least keep my attention for a while as it was classified as a puzzle game, but to my dismay it wasn't really a puzzle game overall. The game is mostly a twitch/reaction game with some puzzle elements. The game takes its roots in the genre Pipe Mania made popular. You have to move circuit pieces around so that you have a complete circuit/flow of the virus and the level is complete. You may ask ""But isn't that a puzzle game?"" and to that question I would say it is a puzzle game.The last half of the game it introduces too many elements for it to remain a puzzle game. The later elements all rely on the player moving quickly and trying to think on their toes and often that leads to death. A good puzzle game gives the player time to do the puzzles and doesn't require ADHD levels of movement while still trying to solve a puzzle. Many design choices made in the game are inherently flawed. After you complete a level it takes you back to the main board to select a level wherein you will often find that you have to move around a couple times to get to the next level. I would have liked to see the game progress you to the next level after a level is completed. My next issue is with the music. There felt like there were 3 tracks of music that were randomly selected at the start of a level. I would have liked to have seen a couple tracks for each world and I would have liked it if the music didn't change every single time I had to restart a level. The sound effects are some of the most nerve-wracking I have heard in a while that I ended up just disabling sound to play the game.Overall the game is an ""Okay"" experience but I know for sure that I will not play it anymore. It's not worth $10 and has the same amount of content I would expect from a $3 mobile app. I'd have to say to all my friends to give this game a pass as there are plenty of other games you can get that are better for the same price point.

												This is not a bad game, it is however one I really could not get into.You control a microscopic robot through a grid that can be made to rotate as you move along it, so far so good.However, with all of the levels it seems to be more of a matter of ""How am I supposed to solve this?"" rather than ""In what way do I want to solve this?""This lack of creative solutions, combined with a timer on every level makes for an experience that did not suit me.Presentation-wise there is nothing wrong with the game, it looks and sounds as good as is to be expected both for the size of the studio and the asking price, there isn't much plot but what is there is told in decent cutscenes.Whether or not you'll enjoy this game is based mostly on the question of whether or not you can find enjoyment in finding a specific solution under time pressure, and I imagine that for some people the answer to this might be yes. Just not me.			"

												This is alot of fun.  It's a simple concept which makes for a fun puzzle game.  Some of the puzzles you are presented with are very difficult, but they are never impossible.There are two types of puzzles; ones which force you to think and act fast.  The other requires plenty of thought and lots of trial and error.  Fortunately the game provides you with skip tokens, which allow you to bypass puzzles you may not be able to solve at the time.  As you can imagine this alleviates frustration and keeps the game fun.This game shines in local coop.  Gasp!  Did I just say Local Coop on the PC?  I did!  A Virus Named Tom does it so well, it might be some of the most fun I've had during a local coop session.  It forces you to work together to solve the puzzles and fend off the antivirus.  This game will spur lots of comradery and arguments to boot as you accidentally work against each other.If you have some extra controllers and some friends (up to 4) you can invite over, definitely buy this game.  The learning curve is quite easy, so that even non gamers can enjoy it.			"

Very cool story, great production, great art, but the gameplay is too frustrating to get through more than the 30 minutes I played. Seriously if they patched out the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ spiders the game would genuinely be 1000 times better. You can't be a puzzle game, and an action game, and an agility game all at the same time.Even beyond the spiders, getting a gold medal on the SECOND level requires robotic precision. I had to repeat it 10 times to get a gold medal. On The SECOND LEVEL! (as in, the second one in the robot dog) Come on now. The game has to be possible to beat.			"

-Quick Review-A Virus Named TOM is an amusing 2D Puzzle game with great music, and amusing quirky story, and great co-op replay game.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  You are TOM, a virus created by Dr. X for revenge against a huge corporation that fired him. You will need to use quick reflexes, and the logic part of your brain to help TOM bring down the corporation, one invention at a time!Game Play: The controls are extremely simple, you move in any direction, rotate tiles, or drop glitch spots to slow down defenses going after TOM. There’s not much else to be said about it. I played on a keyboard, my brother has been playing the co-op with me and he’s been using a controller, the game controls are very straightforward.  Achievements: The achievements are rather dynamic and more complicated then I want to get into. The puzzles get really difficult and complex making getting all the achievements in this game a bit tricky, and the specialized achievements are a headache. Price: The price for A Virus Named TOM is $9.99, I’d recommend getting the game on a steal sale, or a humble bundle. I’d place the value on this game closer to $5.00. It is just a puzzle game, so naturally; most people won’t want to spend very much time playing it. Conclusion:While looking at other people’s reviews, it appears there’s a large amount of people who didn’t enjoy this game, which surprised me; I found the game unique and a bit refreshing. Plus I enjoyed the electric music type. I guess knowing that there’s a lot of people who didn’t enjoy it should be a word of caution for others purchasing this game. But I’ll stand on the other said and say I for one enjoyed this game.			"

												I remember when I first saw A Virus Named Tom, and thought. ""Wow that's so cool looking"".  The graphics looked good, and the idea or a really good puzzler got me hyped for it.   I was so interested.    And now that I played it, I kind of wish I got a different game. It's not that A Virus Named Tom is horrible.  It's well made, and the story is fun enough.  But the gameplay is just too annoying to be recommendable.   About half of the levels in this game are fantastic.  Like A+ puzzle solving, and interesting.  It's just the other half of the levels are some of the most annoying that I've played recently.  Some of them are just tedious, or monotonous.  And a few are just frustration filled. The game plays a bit like pipedream where you have to make a path.  The difference is there's no time component to the game, and all the player can do is rotate the squares.  This works well.  And while the control scheme is a little annoying, it works.   In fact it's kind of fun.  The other side of the game is that it takes a lot to make a game out of that idea.  With Pipe Dream there's a huge time component.  With A Virus Named Tom the game gets into a number of other ideas.  While there's a time component for score, the majority of A Virus Named Tom is played with enemies, or other annoyances to slow down the player.  The two big complaints I have for the game is the mystery blocks, and the twitch gameplay.  In the second set of levels you start finding these mystery blocks.  This isn't awful at first, but they reuse those mystery blocks entirely too much.  Eventually when you get to the third set of levels they start to disappear, but overall, they are some of the most annoying  blocks in the game.   The issue with them is that the player must either remember the board, the pattern they need, or just fiddle with the blocks until they work.  It's a pointless exercise.  While some levels like that could be interesting, they come TOO often, and aren't very fun gameplay elements.  If they flashed every 5 seconds it might be useful, instead it's just a full mystery the entire time. The second issue that's quite annoying is about half the levels have enemies.  Most of the time this is fine, you just have to keep spatial awareness.  However quite a few times these enemies move too fast, or are there just to test your twitch gameplay.    You have to react too fast.  If this is a puzzle game, it shouldn't take that much control and just is annoying.  If this is a twitch gameplay, where is that action for the rest of the game.  Those are some of the worst designed levels that I've seen.  I like the game mind you, I just hate those twitch levels. I loved the look of A Virus Named Tom when I first saw it, I thought it looked interesting, but now that I've played it (on ps3 and PC) I have to say, I'm not a fan of it.  It's not an awful game, it's just trying to be two types of game, and doesn't really succeed at being either.   It's a fun puzzler to start, but quickly changes into a game filled with frustration, rather than challenge.  A shame, but I just can't recommend this game.			"

If you intend to purchase A Virus Named Tom though, well that's a different kettle of fish.The game starts off as an innocuous pipe dreams style game; organise the circuit pieces to infect the part. The game quickly introduces more boundaries to your success, both related and external to the circuit itself: fixed pieces, encrypted pieces, anti-virus pieces, drones, glitch-proof drones, hunter drones etc. Personally I enjoyed the puzzles that involved finding the correct circuit within the defined time limit, and initially the drones gave levels the right amount of pressure. Unfortunately with the glitch-proof and hunter drones things start to get obnoxiously messy, especially as they are often paired with extremely fast patrol speeds, changing the game into a frustrating mess of puzzle solving and timing-based movement.It's certainly not a bad game but there are dozens of fun and challenging puzzle games on Steam that certainly outclass A Virus Named Tom.

												This game is a puzzle game. Except, the puzzles aren't difficult, just time consuming. But it has enemies, so it's sort of an action game! Except the enemies are predictable, and being hit by one only serves to reduce the time remaining that you have to solve the particular puzzle until you 'run out of energy'. At which point you need to start the 'puzzle' over again. This game then quickly devolves into two kinds of levels:1. Long and boring puzzle levels where enemies are hardly a threat, and sometimes pieces of the puzzle are obscured so you either have to rely on memorization or gueswork.2. Insultingly simple puzzles that are only made 'difficult' by a pointless overabundance of enemies, which, due to the fact that you are limited by a grid, are impossible to dodge unless you literally wait for the perfect timing, jump in, rotate pieces of the puzzle, and jump out before you get hit and waste your time.Wasting your time is the name of the game, here. This game is not a puzzle game, nor an action game, nor a game in any sense of the word. It is a time waster, in the purest sense. Buying it is, predictably, a waste of time.			"

												A Virus Named TOM is a puzzle game, where you play as a virus trying to bring down a Jetsons-style ""City of Tomorrow"". You do this by connecting all of the lines to the source of the infection.The game is very well made in almost every aspect. The puzzles are challenging, and require a combination of skillful maneuvering and careful planning. The game continues introducing a bunch of new elements as you play, taking time to introduce each, and it demonstrated the game's depth and its finesse in how it introduces each. The style of the game is really neat. I adored the game's art, and I laughed a few times at the humorous story.This game has local multiplayer, both cooperative and competitive, which is something you don't see that often anymore. On top of that, it's pretty fun.I hadn't heard much about this game before getting it, which is sad, because more people need to hear about A Virus Named TOM. This game is excellent, and it deserves a place among the best indie games.			"

												An interestingly strange game.It's effectively a twitch-based reaction game... That you need to solve a puzzle in order to beat first. If you try to do both at one time, you probably won't have fun with it.At its core though, this is a decently fun game.A few caveats to this, however:The story is entirely forgettable.Respawn follows no logic that I can grasp. A real nuisance on later levels.Pretty short. I've played for a little over 3 hours now and have nearly beaten the campaign.Still, enjoyable in all.			"

												This may be a little biased as I'm not the biggest fan of puzzle games, and if you like puzzle games then you might love this, but for 7 pounds I don't think it's worth the price. I got this in a Humble Bundle, and after seeing some people play it I was really pumped for it and was kind of the main reason I got the Humble Bundle and I was disappointed. I went through the first 2 levels and was bored by it. This isn't really a negative review or postive but more netural but leaning towards the negative. The gameplay was basically like the thousands of connected the pipe minigames and maybe it does get better after the first stage, but I didn't want to have to go through the rest of that to get to it. Watching some of the videos if you're not a completionist you can get through this game rather quickly. There is a mutliplayer that I never touched because I believe it was LAN though the Dev said he was making it Online so it might be by now.I do kinda feel dicky for having a negative opinion for this game as it is Indie and the Dev seems like a nice guy with a wife and two year old child, so good on you if you do buy it as you're supporting them but for me it was lacking it what reviews and video hype put it up to be.If you're a puzzle fan then you'll like this.If you're not a puzzle fan then you'll ever dislike this or be netural about this.If you're not a puzzle fan but you really wanna try this I'd wait until a sale came.

												Typical puzzle game with typical puzzle games failings.  Concept is dead simple but the game gets frustrating towards the end when it veers away from solving puzzles and closer to twitch reflexes and timing with loose controls.  The game suffers from poor design.  There is a timer for each level which seems unnessary, and makes the more difficult levels frustrating when you have to repeat them simply because you ran out of time.  Obsticles are added to each level to hinder your ability to solve the puzzle, which just adds to the tedious and frustrating nature.  Know the solution?  Too bad because you have to navigate around enemies with poor controls just to input the answer.  No hazards?  Well they decide to hide the puzzle pieces so you have to go to each individual piece and move it before you can see what it does.  Then you have to do both.  I am all for increased difficulty, but if your idea of difficulty is tedium, I'll pass.  After beating the more frustating level I never once felt accomplished, just glad I didn't have to spend more playing.   Art style is some what interesting and the levels that give you enough time and don't have pointless obstacles to prevent you from just solving the puzzle are fun and satisfying.  Maybe I am in the minority, but a puzzle game is fun when its not stressful.  Peggle and Bejeweled are games that I can relax too, hang out in and thuroughly enjoy my time playing them.  A Virus Named TOM just frustrated me endlessly.			"

												That game is advertised as a puzzle game. However, most puzzles are fairly simple, and the difficulty comes from 2 additions :- Either there are hidden tiles that force you to remember the layout, relying on rote memory rather than actually thinking about the solution.- Or the difficulty is in the execution, where the solution is known but you have to race around enemies to execute it.This is not a puzzle game, this is an action game. And since the controls aren't intuitive, it's not even a fun action game. The memory-based puzzles are infuriating, and the action ones can also be frustrating, because the floaty controls (with gamepad) can generate some mistakes and stupid deaths.That's too bad, because the character design and the sound design were well done, giving Tom a fun personality. That unfortunately isn't enough to redeem the faults in the gameplayHowever i do give kudos to the devs to include skip tokens, which allow you to skip puzzles that you're stuck too long on. At least you're not gonna rage against a specific level.			"

												A Virus Named TOM is a puzzle game that puts you in the shoes of TOM, a rather adorable robot looking computer virus. The primary gameplay is rotating circuitry around to pass power from one end of the board to the other, and completing this task as fast as possible. While this is not exactly a novel game concept, the presentation is nice and there are some interesting twists in the mechanics later into the game.However all that being said, I personally was not all that enthused by the game, so if a friend were to ask me for a recommendation, this title would not be one of them.

												A solid puzzle game with fun co-op and competitive multiplayer to go along with loads and loads of personality. The cinematics are wonderfully realized and play out in the great retro-future aesthetic of a 1950's sci-fi movie. The game mechanics are familiar, heavily inspired by games like Pipe Dream, but there's a lot of new ideas here too. The game introduces new mechanics at a very nice pace and always keeps the player entertained with between levels email exchanges and cinematics.A Virus Named TOM is the sort of indie game I hope to see more of, simple on the surface with hidden complexity, well designed and above all else extremely polished.

												I like the concept behind this, what with you controlling a virus in an effort to infect various machinery.  Most of the puzzles are an entertaining way of blowing a couple of minutes here or there, but those boards with an antagonist element, while novel, are more frustrating than tense.  Due to the way Tom moves in a ""notched"" manner across the grid, getting out of harm's way is often down to how fast you can hammer a given directional key.  Twitch gaming isn't really something I'm looking for in a timed puzzle game.  The ability to skip stages is doled out piecemeal as a reward for progression, and although using them feels a bit like throwing up a white flag, those with no compunctions about this will find the feature handy.  Overall I'd rate this a bit above average.			"

												This is a pretty fun puzzler where you have to rearrange all the pieces so they are connected, spreading your virus throughout the level. While doing that, you have to look out for enemies and use various powerups to your advantage. There's a very humorous approach to the story through cutscenes before and after the levels, showing the effects of your virus at work. There's a very well implemented scoreboard which shows how you are doing relative to your Steam friends. That made me redo a few levels just to see if I could get to the top. It controls very well with a controller, once you get the hang of their method for turning each tile.The graphics are good enough for a puzzle game. The cutscenes are a stylized animation that looks quite nice. I'd recommend this if you are looking for a casual puzzle game.Grade: B			"

												This game is very bad at being a puzzle game. I bought it because it was categorized as a puzzle game, and now it's tagged as a puzzle game, but don't trust that.If you like brain teasers, really stay away from this. The game has a good presentation, but is overall frustrating. It doesn't require thinking to get by and many of its mechanics go against puzzle game fundamentals. For example:There is a flawed gold/silver/bronze medal system for finishing levels with certain ammounts of energy remaining. Which gives the impression there is an optimal way to solve levels until LATER in the game you gain the ability to RECOVER energy and you can use that ability in levels BEFORE gaining that ability!You can die, and you will, a lot, if you touch the creeps in stage, but then you respawn. You also gain the ability to kill them, but they also respawn. This is like an arcade game that doesn't work.One of the ""puzzle"" features is that the pieces you have to rotate appear for 2 seconds on the screen then become ""?"" symbols until you pass energy through them. You can rotate the ""?"" symbols. Just so you know, it's 100% not possible to beat a level of this kind and get a gold medal without memorizing what you should rotate first, after a lot of restarts.Not a good puzzle game. Flawed mechanics. Frustrating. Would not recommend. If you want a connect the paths game, get Droplitz, it's a casual puzzle like Tetris and at not in the least frustrating.			"

												This game is very bad at being a puzzle game. I bought it because it was categorized as a puzzle game, and now it's tagged as a puzzle game, but don't trust that.If you like brain teasers, really stay away from this. The game has a good presentation, but is overall frustrating. It doesn't require thinking to get by and many of its mechanics go against puzzle game fundamentals. For example:There is a flawed gold/silver/bronze medal system for finishing levels with certain ammounts of energy remaining. Which gives the impression there is an optimal way to solve levels until LATER in the game you gain the ability to RECOVER energy and you can use that ability in levels BEFORE gaining that ability!You can die, and you will, a lot, if you touch the creeps in stage, but then you respawn. You also gain the ability to kill them, but they also respawn. This is like an arcade game that doesn't work.One of the ""puzzle"" features is that the pieces you have to rotate appear for 2 seconds on the screen then become ""?"" symbols until you pass energy through them. You can rotate the ""?"" symbols. Just so you know, it's 100% not possible to beat a level of this kind and get a gold medal without memorizing what you should rotate first, after a lot of restarts.Not a good puzzle game. Flawed mechanics. Frustrating. Would not recommend. If you want a connect the paths game, get Droplitz, it's a casual puzzle like Tetris and at not in the least frustrating.			"

												This is a pretty fun puzzler where you have to rearrange all the pieces so they are connected, spreading your virus throughout the level. While doing that, you have to look out for enemies and use various powerups to your advantage. There's a very humorous approach to the story through cutscenes before and after the levels, showing the effects of your virus at work. There's a very well implemented scoreboard which shows how you are doing relative to your Steam friends. That made me redo a few levels just to see if I could get to the top. It controls very well with a controller, once you get the hang of their method for turning each tile.The graphics are good enough for a puzzle game. The cutscenes are a stylized animation that looks quite nice. I'd recommend this if you are looking for a casual puzzle game.Grade: B			"

												I like the concept behind this, what with you controlling a virus in an effort to infect various machinery.  Most of the puzzles are an entertaining way of blowing a couple of minutes here or there, but those boards with an antagonist element, while novel, are more frustrating than tense.  Due to the way Tom moves in a ""notched"" manner across the grid, getting out of harm's way is often down to how fast you can hammer a given directional key.  Twitch gaming isn't really something I'm looking for in a timed puzzle game.  The ability to skip stages is doled out piecemeal as a reward for progression, and although using them feels a bit like throwing up a white flag, those with no compunctions about this will find the feature handy.  Overall I'd rate this a bit above average.			"

												A Virus Named TOMPro's: - A challenging puzzle indie game with a straightforward mission.- Requires often fast thinking or quick reactions- Plenty of co-op opportunities and games.- Nice soundtracks.- Possibilities of skipping a level.- Cutscene videos.- Gamepad availability.Con's:- Short story mode. (Nothing to do alone after you completed it)- Co-op is apparently only available on a single computer (up to 3 gamepads + keyboard).All in all, this game's a 3/5 from me, only because of the short single-player possibilities.I'd reccomend only if it's either bundled or on a big sale and you really don't know what else to enjoy.

												A Virus Named TOM is a fast paced action/puzzle game with core gameplay similar to Pipeflow based puzzles. Initially, the puzzles are timed, so you must think relatively quickly to solve them, and you receive points based upon speed. Most of the puzzles require small thought during this part of the game. Later, the difficulty ratchets up to keyboard destroying frustration, as enemies infiltrate the puzzle board and move across it as fast or faster than you can control poor TOM. Then, the game introduces enemies that home in and seek you out, all the while your time runs out. With limited counterplay options, it becomes a race against your inevitable demise to solve a puzzle in your head by looking at the board while avoiding the AI, and then a question of dexterity to actually pull off the necessary movements without dying. A Virus Name TOM is a well designed hardcore puzzle/action game that became so frustrating to play that I uninstalled it. I would only recommend it to people who already hate themselves.			"

												If you like, if you don't like to use your brain don't try this game…For the others, the very progressive difficulty ( the whole game is basically a tutorial for each new features ), the fun story, and the clever level design ( you don't feel like doing the same level again ) and the pressure of real time fight for your energy, makes this game great in it's genre!You will run through 50 levels, and if some are really too hard for you ( some are big puzzles, others are hard because of the foes, and some other levels are very tricky ) there are a few « skip points » so that you don't get stuck forever, but use them wisely!I often play no more than 10 minutes to this style of bundle games, tom the virus is one noticeable exception ^^ "

A Virus Named TOMThis is an indie puzzle game where you control a virus who's name is TOM.The story behind the game is that you are a scientist who get's kicked out of the city of tommorow and he is the one who built a lot of the new machines that they use.He decides to get his revenge by infecting all of his previously built machines and so on.I was very surprised with how badly the game controlled and how I was having nothing even close to a good time with the game. The tutorial isn't very good and it just feels wonky when you are trying to control the puke green little robot, flipping tiles to solve puzzle after puzzle.I tried out getting as good times as possible on a few levels but with a keyboard it to some degree felt nearly impossible to go fast. This might just be me being bad or not using a gamepad but it just felt sloppy which is not a good first impression to give the player.Something that they did ""good"" with the game however was the amount of content for someone who enjoys this type of slow paced gameplay.The only two modes in the game are the singleplayer campain/story-line and a local-coop mode. You will very quickly get frustrated with how the mechanics work and the developers even added a skip level function but that really does not help since the level after the one you skipped will have the same feel and problems.I would really like to recommend it but no person in their right mind can say that it's a good and polished game when almost everyone who played it had a bad time with it.- Liam			"

												A Virus Named TOM is a very sleek pipe connector arcade game. You play as the eponymous virus as you infect various types of futuristic devices, much to the chagrin of the company Mega-Tech.While the game starts off slow, it picks up to a speed-based puzzler. The objective is to spread your infection by connecting wires that bend in different directions. Each device effectively has ten levels to play--with the classic Bronze / Silver / Gold medal system. Later on, you also get upgrades and new enemies that add further complexity to the game. There's also a multiplayer version if you're interested in co-op puzzle games.There's nothing really inherently bad about this game. It's polished and should provide a good deal of amusement (and challenge) while it lasts. Two gripes though: (1) the controls might be hard to adjust to, and (2) the presence of both single-player and multiplayer achievements is kind of redunant.Try this one out!			"

The graphics are good, probably too good for a game that is better played on phones. I played past the pet and the teleporter to see if it will get better or introduce new, exciting elements, but it stayed the same.While not overly difficult, the concept of memorizing/precisely moving to get the best time is annoying and there is no real meaning or sense of achievement in the medal system.I don't own a controller or played with other people, maybe the game is better if you try those - but there is not a single redeeming factor for a single player, I found myself playing the second hour just to get those cards already. This is not the feeling a game should leave you with.I don't strongly warn against TOM, there are worse games out there, but it isn't worth the money.

Maybe it would work if your HP bar wasn't also your timer.  As it is, it falls on the wrong side of frustrating as the levels progress.

I played past the pet and the teleporter to see if it will get better or introduce new, exciting elements, but it stayed the same.While not overly difficult, the concept of memorizing/precisely moving to get the best time is annoying and there is no real meaning or sense of achievement in the medal system.I don't own a controller or played with other people, maybe the game is better if you try those - but there is not a single redeeming factor for a single player, I found myself playing the second hour just to get those cards already. This is not the feeling a game should leave you with.I don't strongly warn against TOM, there are worse games out there, but it isn't worth the money. It's okay, if you get it in the bundle, avoid otherwise.			"

												A Virus Named Tom is very similar to the hacking puzzle game in the Bioshock games, however this game is not based on strategy or puzzle solving but more on your reaction response to avoid enemies and other obstacles, which makes the game not fun at all. There's also a time limit on each level which gets reduced each time you die, when the level restarts none of your progress is saved which makes replaying a level very frustrating... some levels I beat based off of just pure luck.

												One day it would be so great to go up to Hideo Kojima, the creator of the Metal Gear games and say to him about A Virus Named TOM, ''Sir, you have created a game that is both original and good. Sadly the parts that are good are not original and the parts that are original are not good.''Harsh? I don’t think so. A Virus Named TOM is a massively overrated game. Although it breaks new ground in it fantastic graphic and superb sound, its gameplay is often badly flawed and plotwise is almost laughable in its political naivety and Z-grade writing. But before we get started here is the obligatory information stuff that all reviews must contain by law in case you have never heard of this game before.A Virus Named TOM is a game that probably needs no introduction, but here is one anyway. It was released in 1999 by Konami on the Playstation and updated into three dimensions the adventures of Solid Snake a covert operative from the group Fox Hound. Previous adventures on the NES and MSX were fairly basic but innovative stealth action games were going in with all guns blazing was not the sensible option. The PlayStation incarnation saw Solid Snake being sent to a base in Alaska where former members of Fox Hound have taken control of a huge robot called Metal Gear Rex and its Snakes job to defeat them and return control of Rex. Unusually for such a console style game, it was also released for the PC a year later to a fairly muted reception.You are supported by various helpful people via a radio in your ear called your Codec. This allows you to ask advice, gain info and save your game. Controls wise you action is viewed from a top down third person viewpoint that can be switched to first person (static) view for looking around in detail. Support items such as infrared goggles, cardboard boxes etc are kept on one side of the screen and weapons such as the Socom and Nikita on the other. One can be assigned to each and as you progress through the game you collect a fearsome arsenal. Each type of weapon is effective against certain Bosses, for example Sniper Wolf needs to be taken out with a sniper rifle, the Nikita Launcher needs to be used versus Liquid Snake and his helicopter. Your main tactic is to sneak about, sneaking everywhere is the key. You rarely need weapons unless you are in a boss battle. The elegant controls give you a wide range of crawling, sliding, ducking options.The graphics and sound are beautiful on the lowly PlayStation, despite the colour palette being heavy on the greens and greys it was still a stunning achievement from the little grey box. Breath clouds in the cold. However the voice acting is still far superior to most of what has gone before or since. The plot forms a huge part of the game with long discussions and cut scenes cropping up at regular intervals. With its strong anti-war message the game is often preachy and unsubtle in it's ''fighting's bad mmkay'' proletising and considering the overall content of the game one of the rankest pieces of hypocrisy ever to be committed to any medium.So what’s wrong then? Well lots. For a start, the much vaunted stealth aspects of the game are not as original as many would have you believe. the first NES games may have included stealth elements for the first time in gaming but the way they have been implemented in AVNT are much more reminiscent of N64 game Goldeneye and the superb ninja stealth game Tenchu. But whereas in those games enemies could spot you from a great distance and if a surveillance camera spied you, it was pretty much mission over, in AVNT its just plain dumb. For example if you are spotted by a camera or guard you only have to avoid them for about ten seconds before they get bored and go back to patrolling. EH??? And for some reason these genetically modified genome soldiers can only see ten feet in front of them. Stay out of range using your handy radar and you can run right in front of them and not be seen. Ridiculous.In the same vein, the super bad bosses who are so much tougher than you, all seem to have very low IQs. They happily pause and show you a weak spot for you to hit, and as you spend four hours wearing their health down, they will refuse to change tactics, which is nice. Its also in a blatant attempt to make the game seem bigger, much backtracking to unlock doors early on in the game using key cards obtained later on. There are also some terrible attempts to introduce postmodernism into videogames. That means a cultural text that acknowledges it is a work of fiction by addressing the reader/viewer/player. In this case, its demanding you remove the controller in a boss fight, having Psycho Mantis read your memory card and Snake referring to the vibration of the controller to sooth his poor, sore arm. This struck me at the time as a rather odd thing to do, when so much of the game is supposedly geared to sucking you into its story. to suddenly bring you up short by yelling ''hey this is a game yah know!'' seems to be very strange and schizophrenic.Where A Virus Named TOM tries to break new ground is via its storyline. It tries to present itself as quite radical in its condemnation of war, fighting and the effects on the human spirit. Yes, that’s very nice, but the constant whining of Solid Snake about how bad his lot is and how Meryl shouldn't want to be a solider is not great, just grating. Especially when you have a bajillion items to commit all kinds of murder in your possession and can strangle and break guards necks with your bare hands. Also by the end the plot seems have careered off at various bizarre tangents. What started out as an interesting tale about political intrigue and genetic experimentation has turned into some kind of idiotic farce. Every other person turns out to be a traitor, and the great threat turns out to be a big robot that can fire missiles off its shoulders or something equally stupid.Perhaps its worst fault is its moronic vision of global politics. The world we live in is not ever likely to be threatened by super enhanced terrorists using a giant robot to launch nukes. To even try and present it seriously (with footage from global conflicts and Hiroshima amongst others) is an affront. As we have always been shown, if terrorist want to hurt us they attack out basic freedoms by targeting our transport, leisure and centre's of commerce. What irritates the hell out of me about AVNT and the like is the stultifying effect it has on the minds of players who sink into a kind of apathy about world affairs, always assuming there is a quick and violent solution to the deep, protracted, long-term problems of this sick world we live in.A Virus Named TOM is a lovely game to look at and makes nice noises. But if you really listen to it and probe what its trying to say you’ll find its nothing more than primary school politics, with a moral message delivered with all the subtlety of a brick in the face. Its stealth-based gameplay is badly flawed and has been done better elsewhere, both before and since. Snake is possibly one of the most tediously self-centred “heroes” ever to appear in a videogame and to cap it all, the villain, Liquid Snake has an English accent(!). Oh Hideo, stick to the Mech games you obviously really want to be making, this Snake needs a mongoose to put it (and us) out of its misery.			"

												It could make do without the dubstep and the timer. Having the timer makes it less of a puzzle game and more of a trial-and-error kind of deal in the later levels. I'm fine with having a system where you get a higher score the faster or more time you have on the clock but when that runs out and then that means I fail it can get pretty pretentious... or maybe that just means I suck ♥♥♥♥♥ at this.

												Fun little puzzle game where you control a virus that has to take over systems. The idea is simple; you have a grid and by holding the action button and moving to a side you'll rotate the tiles. The goal is to have the entire system powered up.It sounds simple, but becomes fairly complicated later on. Playing solo is fun in its own right, but I think the real potential lies in its co-op addition, where you and a friend both control a certain part of the grid so teamplay is a must.[Rating: 76/100]			"

												Finally, a game for luddites! (How they'd play it, I'm not sure.) Created by a mad scientist, you play the titular virus, going around and generally making the future an awful place to live by destroying all of their convenient little machines by way of solving puzzles in a fashion that is equal parts Pipe Dream, Frogger, and a little Pac-Man thrown in for good measure. The concept works well on paper, but unfortunately the controls are a bit too loose. Tom tends to fly about the playing field, which is great if you're trying to get away from an enemy, but you will likely find yourself losing a great many unintentional games of chicken. This, coupled with a very large difficulty spike (although granted, the game DOES only have five ""worlds"") makes this one of those titles that you should only attempt if you have a great deal of patience. Rage quitters need not apply.			"

												I have not played the multiplayer so this review is based on the singelplayer mode.A Virus Bamed TOM is a puzzle game, most likely designed for a controller, as the keyboard controls feel unresponsive and loose which can be quite frustrating as the game often requires quick, sharp movements. The puzzles do ramp up in difficulty with new blocks, and enemies that chase you as you try to complete the level, but the game truly isn't very enjoyable. This lies in the fact that unless you can immediately visualize the solution to a puzzle, you're going to be spending a long time using trial and error. The fact that you have drones chasing you down that can kill you, makes this trial and error proccess all the more painful. Once you eventually find out the solution, you're really just relieved that you're done. I was glad to be doen with the game, and all though the art and the music are nicely done, there are dozens of other puzzle games that are a lot more fun than this one.			"

												This game is charming, with a typical good doctor turned evil storyline that is just silly but serves its purpose well. The art style of futuristic sci-fi works quite well and is very evocative and eye-pleasing. The soundtrack however gets incredibly repetitive and gets boring and annoying overtime. The sound effects also get annoying and frustrating as the game progresses but the voice acting is done well and is entertaining. The gameplay is easy to understand and it allows for two players. It is easy to understand but it gets progressively harder to master. The game constantly makes the puzzles harder and harder adding more gameplay elements that make it even harder to complete. 7/10- The game is an entertaining puzzle game that works surprisingly well and does keep you entertained for the 3-5hours it will take you to complete, depending on how challenging depending on how hard you believe the puzzles are "

You will enjoy trying to get past the many levels that this game offers.Overall my rating would be for this type of game 7/10. Only because of the fact that you get annoyed/frustrated and that it requires a bit more tutorial work to teach people the tricks and to be mindful of movements as they drain energy. I know there is a helpfile but in this day and age a good tutorial does make one have to look at a help document let alone the fact who would want to anyhow?			"

However, there isn't much variety in terms of puzzles (they add things to make it more difficult, but it still plays exactly the same).A word of warning, this game ends up being very reflex/twitch oriented so if you are looking for a more thoughtful/slow paced puzzle game, then stay away!

												Cool and intuitive puzzle game, easy to learn and hard to master. Takes speed, skill and thought to complete. The narrative and graphic style is cute - you being a virus trying to infect all sorts of stuff - and it suits the gameplay. I had a lot of fun with the singleplayer campaign.A big minus to achievements being strictly multiplayer, and to the non-replayability of the linear puzzle-solving.7/10. A nice, unique puzzle game that's suitable on-the-go. Very frustrating at times due to linear but hard puzzles and as I said, the need for multiplayer-mode in a puzzle game.			"

												Finally, a game for luddites! (How they'd play it, I'm not sure.) Created by a mad scientist, you play the titular virus, going around and generally making the future an awful place to live by destroying all of their convenient little machines by way of solving puzzles in a fashion that is equal parts Pipe Dream, Frogger, and a little Pac-Man thrown in for good measure. The concept works well on paper, but unfortunately the controls are a bit too loose. Tom tends to fly about the playing field, which is great if you're trying to get away from an enemy, but you will likely find yourself losing a great many unintentional games of chicken. This, coupled with a very large difficulty spike (although granted, the game DOES only have five ""worlds"") makes this one of those titles that you should only attempt if you have a great deal of patience. Rage quitters need not apply.			"

												[DID NOT FINISH]Bugger me with a whisk, this game is the first I am reviewing uncompleted, I got to the last world/stage/bit/THING! and I... I just couldn't, this game is too difficult and I just don't care enough to complete it, if I liked it more I could have finished it in maybe another hour or two, but sod it. I've seen all this has to offer anyway.This game is good for a few reasons. The game is a unique and challenging puzzler with a entertaining story. Nevertheless, this is far from the best puzzler I've played in my opinion, but as I know this game holds true quality even though it's not for me, I have to recommend it. The game's gameplay is simple at first and quickly gets very challenging, the story is fun, the engine is good, world design is ok, level design is very very good but too difficult for people of my ability, the dialog is decent, AI is basic but all it needs to be, graphics are ok nothing special, and sound in game is all it needs to be. If you want a real challenge this game is for you, maybe look at some gameplay first to see if it appeals to you. I would just rather do something else with my time than suffer completing this game.8/15 ""Good, but hard and not for me.""			"

												The backstory is probably better than the actual game. It's a variation of the classic game Pipe Dream, but with less focus on puzzling and more on avoiding enemies. I really didn't like that, and the pipes being unrevealed at the start after a handful of missions made me quit.			"

												I have played this game more than most. You can tell because my name is on the top 10 list. But I haven't really played it at all. So this means NO ONE plays this game. I like it. It's fun and entertaining. But NO ONE PLAYS THIS GAME. If you want to make it to number 1 on the score board for any game, this is the one to try... not because it's easy, but because NO ONE PLAYS. It's really not a bad game... just no one plays it. I don't know why. It's great for 10 minutes of time wasting. PS: Don't expect co-op mode to work unless, you know, you find someone that you can convince to play. Considering this is available everywhere, and there are probably less than 10 people in the entire world that have ever played it, I doubt you will be lucky to find your next door neighbour has a liking for it. But it's a good game.			"

												A Virus Named TOM honestly had trouble keeping my attention.  It's a flash game in disguise, you see.  It is pretty to look at, and funny to boot, but it's one of those ""pipe"" puzzlers that wants you to put the virus, in this case, into every section of piping on each level by spinning the differently-shaped pieces until they all light up.  It's that simple.  They throw some curve balls at you later, but there isn't much to the game but that.  It's cute and simple.  The music is very dubsteppy and electronic (as can be expected from a game where you play a computer virus), and gets very grating after a while.  I recommend listening to it quietly or not at all.  The visual components are actually very well done, and while the content of the story is a bit lackluster, the voice acting is very entertaining.  Not worth very much money, to be frank, but a nice little bonus on the end of my Humble Bundle.			"

												A challenging twist on the old pipeworks game from our youth. Like most games it increases in difficulty as you continue on and reaches almost impossible difficulties. It is a test of your problem solving skills aswell as your reflexes because the time between being caught by the antivirus (and other twists to stop you) or moving into safety can be more instinct than skill. The only real complaint I can make about this game is that it seems to be built more for console or a controller rather than a PCs control scheme. If you like puzzle games or just want the extra challenge then I would recommend this to you.			"

												If there is one game which deserves to be described with ""easy to learn, hard to master"", than it is this one.It's a fun and innovative gameplay which is nice kill some time when played casually.If you're going for the gold medals, it will be a really tough way.Even if you have them all, which will take a few days, there is the co-op mode waiting for you.New levels with seperated fields, so that each player has to work on his own side, but working together on on the same curcuit.It's hard  enough to get the gold medals on your own, good luck when you have to try it with another player.Maybe you want to beat your co-op partner up, because he messed something up?Well, go into versus mode and take over the field, while you blow up your freinds with glitch bombs.This is a really fun game, rich in variety with nice cartoon graphics and even a small humoristic storyline behind it.Progressing through the levels, it will add new features to make it harder, each time giving you a messege from Megatech, the company you're working against.They add new defenses and will let you know that it's over for you now.So show them they are wrong!This gets a 6 out of 10 from me.

												As a game this seems a little... empty. The mechanics are in themselves pretty simple, and are extremely reminiscent of a ""match-the-pipe"" type game. It might get better towards the end, but so far (about 3/4 into the second ""world"") it's been a little samey. On its own it doesn't grab me and make me keep playing. Unfortunately I can't give it good marks for escapism.As a minigame within a larger, deeper and more compelling world, this would be PERFECT. Its mechanics are complex enough to warrant a bunch of tries and is rewarding enough to not be a consistent ""gonad-blocker"" for whatever it may be used for in such a case. I would much prefer this for a hacking minigame instead of what comes as standard with say, Deus Ex: Human Revolution.However if you are an action puzzle nut and you prefer simple, quick games instead of time-consuming immersive fictional settings, this is definitely a recommended title for you.

												I had to think about whether I gave this title a thumbs up or down - I figured the overall package deserved it, but it's not plain sailing.Essentially a really amp'd-up version of pipemania, this is an interesting indie title that is the gaming equivalent of tightrope walking while dodging waterbombs.What I liked:The general style. The music. The characters. The art. It takes place in a zany Jetsons-style futuristic city (think Fallout before the bombs hit). This game didn't actually need any of these but the dev chose to put them in all the same, and the game is better for it. It feels like a quality title.What I disliked:I generally don't mind difficult games, but this crossed the line into frustration one too many times. Later levels are patently ridiculous, with the player being expected to multi-task to a degree where there need to be simultaneously dropping Glitches (essentially land mines) to catch two bugs at once while trying to work out the orientation of hidden pipes WHILE trying to re-orientate the known pipes. You don't feel any satisfaction once you've done it because often you win by sheer luck.It's a decent title. It's well-made. But there's a line between challenging and annoying and this game unfortunately has no idea where it is for the most of the time. By all means, get it in a sale and have a blast on your laptop when you're bored :)			"

												I thought from the first series of levels (the robodog) and even the first level or two of the second series that I would enjoy this game, and I really enjoy the style, writing, and art, but the gameplay is not fun. It's twitch-based puzzle solving... okay, I get that might not be my cup of tea, but it's the addition of silly mechanics like ""you only get to see the level for two seconds and then you have to solve it blind, and then you can only glimpse the map every two minutes or so"" that made me just put it down and relegate it to the pile of games owned only for trading cards. And then there are stupid mechanics like some levels just randomly punishing you by refusing to let you get your energy back to retry the level if you failed the first couple of times. Isn't part of the attraction of hard puzzle games the ability to fail, think about a new plan, try the new plan, and repeat? I have no idea why you'd introduce a mechanic where the game gets infinitely harder if you don't succeed at first.I really like the output of their art, writing, and sound teams, but I'm not impressed at all with the mechanics and gameplay. It doesn't matter how charming a game's style is when the core gameplay is lacking.			"

												Got this on a Humble Bundle, so it was a steal. However, it's overall just a pretty dull game. While playing the first level, I thought, well this is repetitive. But, I shrugged it off. It was the tutorial after all. While playing the second level, I just got frustrated by the repitition. New elements added to the gameplay don't spice it up, they just make it frustrating. The puzzles aren't fun, either. They're just more of the same every time.			"

												This Indie puzzle game definitely has an enjoyable backstory to it, with a dash of evil and a very cartoon network-y feel to the overall experience. It's a remake of those old pipe-games where you have to try and connect all the pipes on a grid, but with story, animations, obstacles and more!Playable at all ages, forces you to think at some points and slowly adds in new features as you complete levels, angry birds style. Well designed and easy to learn.			"

												I liked this. It was fun both alone and with friends. I ended up solving the more difficult puzzles on paper; it was easier that way, and then I could refer to my solution to solve them quickly and get a good rating. They end up being logic puzzles; you rule out possibilities and finally end up with the solution. I liked the way some levels also required some dodging skills as you were carrying out your solution.			"

The levels started off easy, but they soon get difficult fast. I'm partial with the level skipping feature they have. Makes it as if you just need to finish MOST of the game rather than ALL of the game. The art style is very nice, and they definitely captured a futuristic/comical game look. Warning though, some of the levels will frustrate you and/or make your brain hurt.			"

												If there is one game which deserves to be described with ""easy to learn, hard to master"", than it is this one.It's a fun and innovative gameplay which is nice kill some time when played casually.If you're going for the gold medals, it will be a really tough way.Even if you have them all, which will take a few days, there is the co-op mode waiting for you.New levels with seperated fields, so that each player has to work on his own side, but working together on on the same curcuit.It's hard  enough to get the gold medals on your own, good luck when you have to try it with another player.Maybe you want to beat your co-op partner up, because he messed something up?Well, go into versus mode and take over the field, while you blow up your freinds with glitch bombs.This is a really fun game, rich in variety with nice cartoon graphics and even a small humoristic storyline behind it.Progressing through the levels, it will add new features to make it harder, each time giving you a messege from Megatech, the company you're working against.They add new defenses and will let you know that it's over for you now.So show them they are wrong!This gets a 6 out of 10 from me.

												As a game this seems a little... empty. The mechanics are in themselves pretty simple, and are extremely reminiscent of a ""match-the-pipe"" type game. It might get better towards the end, but so far (about 3/4 into the second ""world"") it's been a little samey. On its own it doesn't grab me and make me keep playing. Unfortunately I can't give it good marks for escapism.As a minigame within a larger, deeper and more compelling world, this would be PERFECT. Its mechanics are complex enough to warrant a bunch of tries and is rewarding enough to not be a consistent ""gonad-blocker"" for whatever it may be used for in such a case. I would much prefer this for a hacking minigame instead of what comes as standard with say, Deus Ex: Human Revolution.However if you are an action puzzle nut and you prefer simple, quick games instead of time-consuming immersive fictional settings, this is definitely a recommended title for you.

Because of that, I had no idea what the controls were, as they are not displayed in the main menu.Can't even say if it's a good game because it's an unstable piece of #%@$.			"

												This looks like a puzzle game in the ""twist and route"" category, and for the first few levels, it is. However, by about halfway through the second schematic, it has morphed into some sort of strange hybrid between ""Pac-Man"" and a memorization test, wherein your primary goal is to avoid getting hit by the bad guys while dropping bombs in their path, and trying to memorize the entire layout of the level in the split-second that it is shown to you when you succeed at dropping something in the right place and then hiding long enough for them to run into it.I am aware of the ""skip tokens"", but there is absolutely no reason to believe that things are going to go anywhere but downhill past this, given the progression so far.Oh, and for those who figure they can sit and think through their movements before trying to brave the play field? No such luck, your life is on a constant timer that drops even if you aren't hit by anything. And here I thought that mechanic had gone away with the quarter-fed arcade games. Heck, even Gauntlet doesn't do that to you anymore, on a home game. "

It's twitch-based puzzle solving... okay, I get that might not be my cup of tea, but it's the addition of silly mechanics like ""you only get to see the level for two seconds and then you have to solve it blind, and then you can only glimpse the map every two minutes or so"" that made me just put it down and relegate it to the pile of games owned only for trading cards. And then there are stupid mechanics like some levels just randomly punishing you by refusing to let you get your energy back to retry the level if you failed the first couple of times. Isn't part of the attraction of hard puzzle games the ability to fail, think about a new plan, try the new plan, and repeat? I have no idea why you'd introduce a mechanic where the game gets infinitely harder if you don't succeed at first.I really like the output of their art, writing, and sound teams, but I'm not impressed at all with the mechanics and gameplay.

												I...didn't like this game. Which is weird because I love the hacking minigames that many stealth/bioshock games have. But this one doesn't feel like it has a difficulty curve. Sometimes they're stupid easy. Sometimes it feels impossible. And there's no rhyme or reason to what you're going to get from level to level. I loved the art and the story, which made me sad that I didn't like the gameplay itself. I'm not sure what type of user would like this game, perhaps if you really liked Frogger back in the day and have a better attention to detail than I.			"

												Yech... looked promising, and for a little while it's genuinely fun; but there are so many design mistakes in this title that it will quickly begin to grate on your nerves.1) The multiplayer can only be played on one computer. No LAN. No online play.2) Puzzle game + time limit = bad. On the (very) few levels with legitimately difficult puzzles, you'll find yourself being forced to restart every few minutes.3) There is a mechanic on some levels that doesn't allow you to look at the gameboard while you try to solve the puzzle. Bad idea.4) The music and sound effects, while technically nice, serve only to distract and break concentration (the worst offender is the 'time limit almost up *BWOOP BWOOP BWOOP*' sound effect. In a puzzle game, that's bad.5) Many of the levels have stupidly simplistic puzzles, but overcompensate by heavily relying on the non-puzzle elements, artificially ramping up the difficulty. See those drones in the trailer? Imagine about 40 of them on 1 map.			"

												I keep trying to like it, but as other reviews have more eloquently said, the controls are not intuitive and its puzzles are more suited towards quick reactions than anything else.  While it may be fun to some, it is not what I was expecting.			"

												Interesting and fun puzzle game, but DAMN it's hard.If you like technically difficult puzzle games that require sharp instincts, precise inputs and maybe a little luck every now and then, this is a fun little quirky game to throw money at.			"

												If you enjoy puzzle games this one relies on reflexs rather than reflective thinking I suggest a controller since thats how it was designed to be played I believe. I can understand why some people don't like how fast you can move and the fact there's hazards. But I think that has more to do with expecting a puzzle getting a getting an action puzzle game. That being said there are many legitimate criticisms for example although the puzzles gradually add new mechanics and become more complex they add artificial difficulty through just adding a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of hazards. Which means it becomes more about surviving long enough to figure out the puzzle and get it done. It's one of the few games where the leaderboards are well handled and it can be addictive yet frustrating, I wish there was a sensitivity setting, despite that I wouldn't lower his speed if I could. The fast paced nature of this game is what makes it more exciting than a pipe minigame. lol.			"

												★★★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆It would be great successor of legendary PipeMania (it's a variation of that idea), but after a few enjoyable levels the game's difficulty skyrockets and all the fun is over.			"

												I was promised strategic. I got boring memorization and a straightforward mechanic. I guess it's a little innovative, but still not fun. I suspect most of the fun is probably set in the VS, but I have no interest in it.			"

												I love it. Some people get stuck in the levels but you will get to the end. I know I tried and did not get there SO FAR. Also it gives you stratagies and helps you with puzzle games.			"

												One the ""encryption"" block-hiding game mechanic comes in, this puzzle game is simply frustrating. Some coop levels block you away from each other as well, which is aggravating.The versus mode is fun, though I can't recommend this game based on its multiplayer versus mode alone...			"

												A very fun puzzle game that starts a bit simple but quickly grows in fun and complexity. Later levels are often frantic dashes to flip the right tiles while avoiding enemies, leading to very satisfying wins. The game having a good sense of humor is just a bonus.The only thing I didn't like was the question-mark tile mechanic in some levels, which is more annoying than fun. But that alone wasn't enough to spoil the game.			"

												It's a neat idea, and a cute game, but it's like they wanted to make a pipe-dream style puzzle game with as counter-intuitive controls as possible. I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I could have just moved to the peive I wanted to turn, and had one button for clockwise and one for counter clockwise, and that be it. The weird running aroung the squared with the button in mechanic is exhausting.Too bad, because it really is a cute game with well-developed puzzles, and a funny story.			"

												A funny puzzle game with great animations and cutscence. For sure needs more players.... I'm in the top 5 so far on all the puzzles I've done and I'm not that great. Have not tried th co-op or vs yet hope to give those a shot too. It's great that those modes are even included in this puzzle game.			"

												There is a lot to be said about this game, but alas I must keep this short.I love this game, I truely do. Me and my friends started playing it the other day and couldn't stop, literally for hours. Still could't complete the game though and ironically wish there were more levels. The levels: They start with simple tutorial levels and jumps to mad levels of difficulty very fast, faster enimies, shorter time, greater stress. All in good fun.The story: You are the antagonist ploting revenge and this time the bad guy wins (haven't gotten to the end but think that what happens, no spoilers)The multiplayer: Bit congested on the keyboard (as it should be) but gald they had the function implemented, there is quite bit of skill involved, not much, just enough to keep it interesting. This game and a few other friends equal 10 times more fun.If you like puzzle or if you want to start playing a puzzle games,  get this game, 10/10			"
